12835,the biofilm sequencing batch reactor bsbr can simultaneously remove and enrich phosphorus from wastewater highly efficiently however the mechanism of phosphorus transformations in the biofilm remains to be clarified this present work examines the biofilm in the bsbr to reveal the changes of phosphorus in the cells and the extracellular polymeric substances eps and to assess how the metabolic characteristics of intracellular polymers polyhydroxyalkanoate glycogen polyphosphorus affect the migration and transformation of phosphorus when the bsbr reactor is under steady operation 20 c do 6 mg l 1 the influent phosphorus concentration 10 mg l 1 and the aerobic phosphorus removal efficiency 95 the phosphorus in the biofilm is mainly distributed in the eps as the total phosphorus of eps account for 83 20 86 97 of the total phosphorus of the biofilm phosphorus speciation shows that the biofilm realizes the absorption and release of phosphorus through the combined action of eps and cells the cells provide the primary driving force and the eps play a key role the intracellular polyphosphorus is closely related to polyhydroxyalkanoate pha but not glycogen high throughput sequencing demonstrates that the microbial population in the biofilm is dominated by the bacteria that secrete eps that can enhance to phosphorus removal graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords biofilm phosphorus recovery eps pha polymer metabolism data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction the disadvantages of enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr systems in existing sewage treatment plants include low phosphorus recovery efficiency large sludge volume large floor space the need for a separate side flow process etc the biofilm phosphorus recovery process is receiving rising attention in recent years thanks to its high recovery efficiency use of liquid media and compatibility with mainstream processes whereas previous studies mainly focused on the mechanism of ebpr biological phosphorus removal that is in the anaerobic stage the phosphorus accumulating organisms paos decompose the polyphosphorus to generate energy which is used to absorb carbon sources and generate energy storage materials of pha and in the next aerobic stage provide energy for the growth of new cells and the formation of new polyphosphorus 1 3 moreover the research is mainly based on activated sludge process 4 5 therefore the absorption and release of phosphorus by biofilms remain to be further analyzed to provide guidance for future research in sewage treatment systems phosphorus accumulating organisms are the primary species responsible for phosphorus removal 6 microorganisms also generate extracellular polymeric substances eps from their own metabolites and refractory organic matter in the external environment for the sake of self protection 7 8 research has revealed that eps contain abundant phosphorus and play an important role in the absorption and release of phosphorus 3 for example zhang et al 9 and wang et al 10 found that about 6 6 10 5 and 30 of the phosphorus in the sludge is retained in eps respectively argument still exists regarding the role of eps in phosphorus accumulation some researchers believe that the intracellular biochemical processes differ from and are relatively independent of those within the eps and eps only serve to transport and preserve phosphorus others argue that the synthesis and decomposition of polyphosphorus is achieved in eps and there is only orthophosphorus within cells 11 12 thus to study phosphorus recovery with biofilms it is imperative to understand the mechanism of phosphorus uptake and release under the combined action of eps and cells in addition to eps intracellular polymers are also key to the uptake and release of phosphorus by biofilms the intracellular polymers in the biofilms are stored in cells as a source of carbon and energy when the cells experience imbalance of nutrients such as carbon and nitrogen these polymers include polyhydroxyalkanoate pha glycogen polyphosphorus etc 13 and are critical to the phosphorus removal by biofilms 14 during the aerobic phase the paos absorb extracellular orthophosphorus to synthesize polyphosphorus within the cell by decomposing pha to access energy and by using o2 or nitrate as electron acceptors the energy also helps restore glycogen level and promote cell growth in the anaerobic phase paos release orthophosphorus by converting the intracellular polyphosphorus meanwhile the paos decompose the internally stored glycogen through the embden meyerhof parnas emp pathway and they also absorb volatile fatty acids vfa from the outside to synthesize and store pha as the carbon source 15 16 researchers now agree that the redox balance during the formation of pha is mostly maintained by the emp pathway rather than the tricarboxylic acid cycle tca 17 because the metabolism of the biofilm eps is still unclear the metabolism of the intracellular polymer needs to be further explored in this study the biofilm in a biofilm sequencing batch reactor bsbr system was taken as the research object and the mechanism of phosphorus absorption and release under the combined action of eps and cells and the metabolic characteristics of the polymer were studied using nuclear magnetic resonance nmr and high throughput sequencing the content and morphological changes of biofilm eps cellular phosphorus and microbial population characteristics were revealed the purposes of this study were i to achieve efficient removal and enrichment of phosphorus in wastewater by bsbr ii to obtain the distribution and transformation rules of different forms of phosphorus in biofilms iii to obtain the changes of polymers and phosphorus iv to investigate the characteristics of microbial populations and to provide microbiological theoretical support for the mechanism of biofilm absorption release of phosphorus in conclusion the results of this study provide valuable support for the popularization and application of bsbr in urban sewage treatment 2

drained over 13 min the carbon source solution 50 ml and the solution in the anaerobic enrichment tank 4950 ml were then pumped into the reactor over 2 min and stirring was started to initiate the

min for use in the next enrichment cycle all reactions were carried out at room temperature and all steps were managed by a timer each enrichment cycle needed 6 h in total and the bsbr switched from

according to the standard protocol from majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china 24 2 5 calculation formula the efficiency of phosphorus removal from the aerobic phase was calculated as

ratio of p release was calculated as follows 4 p r p start p end where pr is the ratio of p release p start is the anaerobic start phosphorus content p end is the anaerobic end phosphorus content 3 results and discussion 3 1 bsbr performance fig 2a shows the variation of the phosphorus concentration in the bsbr over 255 days of operation the actual phosphorus concentration of the aerobic influent was 10 1 mg l 1 and the average phosphorus concentration of the aerobic effluent was 0 5 mg l 1 the solution in the anaerobic enrichment tank was replaced at the end of each round of phosphorus recovery marked by dotted lines in fig 2a at which point the phosphorus concentration far exceeded 50 mg l 1 i e the standard concentration of phosphorus recovery by the struvite method 25 26 the bsbr was firstly acclimated and cultured for 26 days in round i 27 after steady state operation in round ii and round iii the number of enrichment cycles was increased in round iv to accumulate phosphorus in the biofilm the phosphorus accumulated in the biofilm at the end of the round iv was released in round v which gave an enrichment solution containing 173 12 mg l 1 phosphorus after multiple aerobic anaerobic cycles the concentration of phosphorus in the enrichment tank gradually increased up to 235 mg l 1 round xi giving an enrichment factor of phosphorus as high as 23 5 the phosphorus removal efficiency was 95 for all 12 recovery rounds eq 1 the increase of phosphorus concentration in the enrichment solution slowed down remarkably at the end of each enrichment round for round v vi and vii the phosphorus enrichment efficiency dropped dramatically with increasing number of cycles fig 2b near the end of each round as the phosphorus concentration in the enrichment solution escalated the amount of phosphorus released by the biofilm decreased likely because the anaerobic phase experienced stronger resistance to phosphorus release meanwhile the phosphorus uptake in the aerobic phase also decreased which would cause excessive phosphorus 0 5 mg l 1 in the effluent of the aerobic phase thus to ensure enrichment efficiency eq 2 and effluent quality the enrichment solution was replaced every 15 days after 180 days dashed line in fig 2b 3 2 distribution and variation of tp in eps and cells fig 3 illustrates the changes of tp in the eps and the cell during one aerobic anaerobic cycle measured on day 225 at the end of round x in the aerobic phase the biofilm absorbed the phosphorus in the wastewater phosphorus was accumulated in the biofilm and tpbiofilm increased from 23 mg g 1 to 50 mg g 1 in the anaerobic phase the phosphorus accumulated in the biofilm was released and tpbiofilm decreased from 50 mg g 1 to 25 mg g 1 the changes agreed well with the aerobic phosphorus absorption and the anaerobic phosphorus release by paos in ebpr after the full cycle tpbiofilm increased from 23 mg g 1 to 25 mg g 1 which represented the increase of tp in the biofilm over each cycle the phosphorus in the biofilm was mainly stored in eps the tpeps tpbiofilm ratio of phosphorus content in eps to that in biofilm ratio was 83 20 86 97 higher than that of the systems examined by wang et al 30 10 and long et al 52 4 61 3 1 after one aerobic anaerobic cycle tpeps increased by 1 97 mg g 1 but tpcells phosphorus content in cells only increased by 0 03 mg g 1 in the aerobic stage tpeps phosphorus content in eps increased from 19 52 mg g 1 to 41 6 mg g 1 accounting for 81 78 of the total phosphorus uptake by the biofilm in the anaerobic stage tpeps decreased from 41 6 mg g 1 to 21 49 mg g 1 accounting for 80 44 of the phosphorus release from the biofilm hence the eps in the biofilm play an important role in the absorption and release of phosphorus and the phosphorus in the biofilm is mainly accumulated in the eps however phosphokinase ppk and phosphohydrolase ppx were not detected in biofilm eps therefore it is speculated that biofilm eps only has the function of transporting and storing phosphorus tables 1 and 2 reveal that the ratio of phosphorus uptake and phosphorus release are 2 41 and 2 39 times respectively for cells in one cycle which are much larger than those of eps 2 13 and 1 94 respectively that is the change of intracellular phosphorus is more dramatic the biological absorption and release of phosphorus by the cells are the prerequisite of and provide the driving force for the absorption and release of phosphorus by the eps 3 3 metabolic characteristics of biofilm 3 3 1 transformation of polymers in the biofilm tables 3 and 4 present the phosphorus speciation results determined by 31p nmr 28 29 the phosphorus species in eps is 89 00 93 58 orthophosphorus ortho p 3 65 5 85 pyrophosphorus pyro p and 1 64 5 63 polyphosphorus poly p in contrast the intracellular phosphorus is 47 00 60 94 orthophosphate 0 24 3 50 pyrophosphate and 37 52 52 76 polyphosphorus fig 4a b shows that at the end of the aerobic stage eps mainly have orthophosphorus 37 23 mg g 1 4 58 mg g 1 in the cells but the cells mainly have polyphosphorus 3 75 mg g 1 2 17 mg g 1 in eps four stages can be identified in each cycle each having distinct behavior in the absorption or release of phosphorus and the synthesis or decomposition of polymers in the biofilm fig 4c in the first stage 0 2h there is substantial synthesis of polyphosphorus along with rapid decomposition of pha and producing large amounts of atp 30 the phosphate in the wastewater is continuously absorbed by the biofilm and converted to polyphosphorus the cells do not accumulate any orthophosphate and the concentration of intracellular polyphosphate increases significantly from 1 32 mg g 1 to 3 08 mg g 1 the orthophosphate in the eps increases rapidly due to the concentration gradient in the second stage 2 4 h the synthesis of polyphosphorus has largely completed the synthesis of intracellular polyphosphorus becomes notably slower and pha is decomposed at a reduced rate accordingly the absorbed orthophosphate starts to accumulate in cells as it is not quickly converted to polyphosphate the absorption of phosphorus by eps also slows down in the third stage 4 5 h the system enters the anaerobic phase and the external carbon source is quickly absorbed by the biofilm the polyphosphorus in the cell is rapidly decomposed into orthophosphate which is then expelled from the cell a large amount of pha is synthesized and the orthophosphate concentration in the eps also decreases rapidly in the last stage 5 6 h the decomposition of polyphosphorus is basically complete the uptake of carbon sources slows down dramatically the synthesis of pha is also significantly reduced and the content of intracellular polyphosphorus changes very little nevertheless the phosphorus concentration of the liquid phase still gradually increases from 226 6 mg l 1 to 234 1 mg l 1 indicating that at this point the slow diffusion of orthophosphorus from the eps to the liquid phase is responsible for the release of phosphorus from the biofilm fig 4d shows that the decomposition synthesis of pha is positively related to the synthesis decomposition of polyphosphorus in the aerobic phase the synthesis of polyphosphorus becomes stronger when the decomposition of pha is more active and in the anaerobic phase the decomposition of polyphosphorus decreases when the synthesis of pha weakens in the aerobic stage the biofilm absorbs phosphorus strongly with relatively little pha decomposition likely because a large amount of orthophosphorus is absorbed and accumulated in the eps 31 as a result the ratio of p uptake to pha degradation is as high as 1 89 p mmol c mmol in the anaerobic stage the orthophosphorus generated from the decomposition of intracellular polyphosphorus is released into the eps with a high concentration of orthophosphorus the eps releases a substantial amount of orthophosphorus into the solution 1 consequently the ratio of p release to the uptake of acetate is as high as 1 47 p mmol c mmol the current biofilm in this system can utilize pha at much higher efficiency compared with literature reports because eps play an important role in the absorption and release of phosphorus in the aerobic and anaerobic phases 2 19 3 3 2 source of reducing equivalent polyphosphorus pha and glycogen are the three basic polymers in the phosphorus metabolism of paos and their changes reflect the basic metabolic pathways and principles of the paos fig 5 depict the anaerobic phosphorus release and aerobic excess phosphorus uptake in the bsbr system in anaerobic stage paos converted into orthophosphorus by hydrolysis of polyphosphorus poly p and generates adenosine triphosphate atp and glycogen is converted into pyruvate by emp pathway to generate atp and reducing power 32 and rapidly absorb the acetate in the liquid phase the acetate and pyruvate are converted into acetyl coa a part of acetyl coa is subsequently reduced to pha in the presence of reducing power and stored in the cell and a part generates reducing power through the tca cycle converting into acetone coenzyme a which is finally reduced to pha this process simultaneously releases orthophosphorus into the eps which increases the content of orthophosphorus in the eps driven by the concentration gradient the orthophosphorus in the eps is released to the liquid phase in aerobic stage fig 5a pao uses oxygen as an electron acceptor oxidizes and decomposes pha stored in the body to release energy and part of pha is converted into glycogen to supplement the glycogen content in the microbial body for the utilization of the next cycle of anaerobic stage the remaining pha is converted into acetyl coa and the tca cycle transfers protons and electrons to the electron acceptor to generate atp part of the generated atp is used for microbial growth and metabolism and the remaining part is stored in pao in the form of polyphosphorus in traditional paos metabolic mechanisms the reducing equivalent is mainly generated from the emp pathway by converting glycogen to pyruvate fig 5b however in the current work glycogen decomposition may not produce adequate reducing equivalent for the synthesis of pha as the biofilm does not demonstrate evident synthesis and decomposition of glycogen the emp pathway the entner doudoroff ed pathway the hexose monophosphate hmp pathway and the tricarboxylic acid tca cycle are the four metabolic processes that can generate the reducing equivalent in the anaerobic phase 33 among them the emp pathway is a metabolic process in which cells convert glycogen into pyruvate to generate energy and reducing power the ed pathway is an alternative pathway that exists in some microorganisms lacking a complete emp pathway which is unique to microorganisms but the productivity level of the ed pathway is lower than that of the emp pathway while the tca cycle is dependent on the glycogen concentration under anaerobic conditions when the amount of glycogen decomposed in the anaerobic stage is very small it may activate the tca cycle in paos which is the source of pha synthesis provides atp and reducing power 34 in addition the hmp pathway is only used by microorganisms when the pathways of the emp ed and tca cycle are absent which can generate a large amount of reducing power and atp 35 when the internal and external environments vary the reducing equivalent may be mainly provided by one metabolic pathway 17 36 the emp hmp and tca of paos are dominant in microbial competition 33 erdal et al noted that the biochemical pathway of the epbr can vary and is mainly the tca cycle when the temperature is 20 c 37 in our case the paos of bsbr may depend heavily on the tca cycle to maintain their internal redox balance fig 5c 3 4 microbiological analysis the biofilm was sampled at the end of round x on day 225 when the bsbr was under steady state to analyze the microbial composition fig 6a shows the genera with 1 5 abundance the dominant bacteria in the biofilm when the bsbr was under steady stable operation were mainly ca competibacter 20 97 defluviicoccus 9 49 caldilineaceae 2 85 dechloromonas 3 06 flavobacterium 6 08 and saprospiraceae 1 02 among them ca competibacter and defluviicoccus are both typical glycogen accumulating organisms gaos 38 flavobacterium 39 saprospiraceae 40 and caldilineaceae are all presumed paos and dechloromonas is a pao with a strong ability for phosphorus accumulation under low carbon source conditions 41 both flavobacterium and dechloromonas contain the key genes for the expression of the tca cycle 33 the sum of these 6 kinds of microorganisms was then taken to calculate the ratio of each fig 6b shows that the biofilm contains 70 07 gaos and 29 93 paos there are more gaos than paos ca competibacter is beneficial to form viscous eps 42 and thus strengthens the influence of eps in the absorption and release of phosphorus by the biofilm recent research demonstrates that ca competibacter is capable of synthesizing and hydrolyzing polyphosphorus 43 caldilineaceae is a common filamentous fungus and the phosphorus removal can be enhanced when filamentous fungus serves as the skeleton of the biofilm to intimately wrap streptococcus and cocci within the eps and cover them tightly on the filler surface 44 flavobacterium absorbs phosphorus aerobically and releases phosphorus anaerobically and it is also related to the formation of biofilms as it helps maintain the structural stability of biofilms through the secreted eps while using the eps for the accumulation of phosphorus 41 45 the eps produced by defluviicoccus and saprospiraceae bind cells together to form spherical envelopes that are beneficial to biofilm growth 46 47 in sum eps play an important role in the absorption and release of phosphorus because the bsbr is more heavily populated by the bacteria that can secrete eps to improve the phosphorus removal in summary to solve the problem of phosphorus resource consumption and meet the concept of sustainable development phosphorus recovery in urban sewage treatment has become an effective means of recycling the biofilm method can not only achieve aerobic phosphorus removal but also enrich and recover phosphorus in the anaerobic stage which will be used as one of the main research processes for phosphorus recovery from urban sewage our current findings provide new perspectives and valuable insights into understanding the mechanisms of phosphorus removal and enrichment by bsbr in municipal wastewater next the pilot scale trial operation of urban sewage will be carried out to realize the removal and enrichment of phosphorus in urban sewage the recovery of the enriched phosphate solution will be carried out to generate phosphorus products such as struvite cyanite hydroxyapatite etc to realize the real recycling of phosphorus resources at the same time the internal mechanism of biofilm system was deeply studied and the detailed process of biofilm eps and intracellular phosphorus migration and transformation was discussed so as to provide theoretical support for biofilm phosphorus removal 4 conclusions the bsbr reactor is under steady operation 20 c do 6 mg l 1 c 10 mg l 1 which can achieve 95 phosphorus removal in the aerobic phase to give an enrichment solution of up to 235 mg l 1 phosphorus the eps play a key role in the absorption and release of phosphorus by the biofilm the cell provides the main driving force for the absorption and release of phosphorus by the biofilm when the bsbr system is carried out with an aerobic phase of 4 h and an anaerobic phase of 2 h the phosphorus uptake by the aerobic cells is basically complete within 2 h and the phosphorus release by the anaerobic cells is basically complete within 1 h the phosphorus absorption during 3 4 h in the aerobic phase and the phosphorus release during 1 2 h of the anaerobic phase mainly rely on eps the bsbr system is populated by microorganisms that can secrete abundant eps that are beneficial to phosphorus removal and eps play an important role in the absorption and release of phosphorus by the biofilm declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

12835,the biofilm sequencing batch reactor bsbr can simultaneously remove and enrich phosphorus from wastewater highly efficiently however the mechanism of phosphorus transformations in the biofilm remains to be clarified this present work examines the biofilm in the bsbr to reveal the changes of phosphorus in the cells and the extracellular polymeric substances eps and to assess how the metabolic characteristics of intracellular polymers polyhydroxyalkanoate glycogen polyphosphorus affect the migration and transformation of phosphorus when the bsbr reactor is under steady operation 20 c do 6 mg l 1 the influent phosphorus concentration 10 mg l 1 and the aerobic phosphorus removal efficiency 95 the phosphorus in the biofilm is mainly distributed in the eps as the total phosphorus of eps account for 83 20 86 97 of the total phosphorus of the biofilm phosphorus speciation shows that the biofilm realizes the absorption and release of phosphorus through the combined action of eps and cells the cells provide the primary driving force and the eps play a key role the intracellular polyphosphorus is closely related to polyhydroxyalkanoate pha but not glycogen high throughput sequencing demonstrates that the microbial population in the biofilm is dominated by the bacteria that secrete eps that can enhance to phosphorus removal graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords

whereas previous studies mainly focused on the mechanism of ebpr biological phosphorus removal that is in the anaerobic stage the phosphorus accumulating organisms paos decompose the polyphosphorus to generate energy which is used to absorb carbon sources and generate energy storage materials of pha and in the next aerobic stage provide energy for the growth of new cells and the formation of new polyphosphorus 1 3 moreover the research is mainly based on activated sludge process 4 5 therefore the absorption and release of phosphorus by biofilms remain to be further analyzed to provide guidance for future research in sewage treatment systems phosphorus accumulating organisms are the primary species responsible for phosphorus removal 6 microorganisms also generate extracellular polymeric substances eps from their own metabolites and refractory organic matter in the external environment for the sake of self protection 7 8 research has revealed that eps contain abundant phosphorus and play an important role in the absorption and release of phosphorus 3 for example zhang et al 9 and wang et al 10 found that about 6 6 10 5 and 30 of the phosphorus in the sludge is retained in eps respectively argument still exists regarding the role of eps in phosphorus accumulation some researchers believe that the intracellular biochemical processes differ from and are relatively independent of those within the eps and eps only serve to transport and preserve phosphorus others argue that the synthesis and decomposition of polyphosphorus is achieved in eps and there is only orthophosphorus within cells 11 12 thus to study phosphorus recovery with biofilms it is imperative to understand the mechanism of phosphorus uptake and release under the combined action of eps and cells in addition to eps intracellular polymers are also key to the uptake and release of phosphorus by biofilms the intracellular polymers in the biofilms are stored in cells as a source of carbon and energy when the cells experience imbalance of nutrients such as carbon and nitrogen these polymers include polyhydroxyalkanoate pha glycogen polyphosphorus etc 13 and are critical to the phosphorus removal by biofilms 14 during the aerobic phase the paos absorb extracellular orthophosphorus to synthesize polyphosphorus within the cell by decomposing pha to access energy and by using o2 or nitrate as electron acceptors the energy also helps restore glycogen level and promote cell growth in the anaerobic phase paos release orthophosphorus by converting the intracellular polyphosphorus meanwhile the paos decompose the internally stored glycogen through the embden meyerhof parnas emp pathway and they also absorb volatile fatty acids vfa from the outside to synthesize and store pha as the carbon source 15 16 researchers now agree that the redox balance during the formation of pha is mostly maintained by the emp pathway rather than the tricarboxylic acid cycle tca 17 because the metabolism of the biofilm eps is still unclear the metabolism of the intracellular polymer needs to be further explored in this study the biofilm in a biofilm sequencing batch reactor

small amounts of cacl2 2h2o mgso4 7h2o edta 2na and the composite solution 18 the phosphorus enrichment tank was drained at the end of each round and filled with water 5 l at the start of each round of phosphorus enrichment 2 2 construction and operation of bsbr the bsbr fig 1 used suspended fillers made of polyethylene 15 mm in diameter 5 mm in height and had a filling ratio of 40 in each reaction cycle wastewater 5 l in the aerobic water distribution tank was introduced into the bsbr over 2 min under the action of gravity after the water inlet valve was opened stirring and aeration were then started in the reactor to initiate the aerobic phosphorus absorption and the dissolved oxygen do was maintained at about 6 mg l 1 the bsbr was kept in the aerobic phase for 225 min and then drained over 13 min the carbon source solution 50 ml and the solution in the anaerobic enrichment tank 4950 ml were then pumped into the reactor over 2 min and stirring was started to initiate the anaerobic phosphorus release during which time do was typically about 0 3 mg l 1 after reaction for 105 min the phosphorus enriched solution was drained back to the anaerobic enrichment tank over 13 min for use in the next enrichment cycle all reactions were carried out at room temperature and all steps were managed by a timer each enrichment cycle needed 6 h in total and the bsbr switched from the aerobic phase to the anaerobic phase at 4 h there were four enrichment cycles each day the influent and the effluent of the aerobic and anaerobic phases were monitored continuously and regularly to measure the phosphorus concentration and the cod in the last enrichment cycle of day 225 immediately before changing the enrichment solution and when the bsbr was in steady state operation the

was added only immediately before running the nmr all 31p nmr tests were completed within 2 h at least 128 scans to avoid any change of the phosphorus form 9 the data were processed and analyzed using mestrenova to measure the intracellular polymers agilent gc 7890 usa the biofilm sample 10 ml was taken out from the reactor and centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min after removing the supernatant the

according to the standard protocol from majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china 24 2 5 calculation formula the efficiency of phosphorus removal from the aerobic phase was calculated as

results and discussion 3 1 bsbr performance fig 2a shows the variation of the phosphorus concentration in the bsbr over 255 days of operation the actual phosphorus concentration of the aerobic influent was 10 1 mg l 1 and the average phosphorus concentration of the aerobic effluent was 0 5 mg l 1 the solution in the anaerobic enrichment tank was replaced at the end of each round of phosphorus recovery marked by dotted lines in fig 2a at which point the phosphorus concentration far exceeded 50 mg l 1 i e the standard concentration of phosphorus recovery by the struvite method 25 26 the bsbr was firstly acclimated and cultured for 26 days in round i 27 after steady state operation in round ii and round iii the number of enrichment cycles was increased in round iv to accumulate phosphorus in the biofilm the phosphorus accumulated in the biofilm at the end of the round iv was released in round v which gave an enrichment solution containing 173 12 mg l 1 phosphorus after multiple aerobic anaerobic cycles the concentration of phosphorus in the enrichment tank gradually increased up to 235 mg l 1 round xi giving an enrichment factor of phosphorus as high as 23 5 the phosphorus removal efficiency was 95 for all 12 recovery rounds eq 1 the increase of phosphorus concentration in the enrichment solution slowed down remarkably at the end of each enrichment round for round v vi and vii the phosphorus enrichment efficiency dropped dramatically with increasing number of cycles fig 2b near the end of each round as the phosphorus concentration in the enrichment solution escalated the amount of phosphorus released by the biofilm decreased likely because the anaerobic phase experienced stronger resistance to phosphorus release meanwhile the phosphorus uptake in the aerobic phase also decreased which would cause excessive phosphorus 0 5 mg l 1 in the effluent of the aerobic phase thus to ensure enrichment efficiency eq 2 and effluent quality the enrichment solution was replaced every 15 days after 180 days dashed line in fig 2b 3 2 distribution and variation of tp in eps and cells fig 3 illustrates the changes of tp in the eps and the cell during one aerobic anaerobic cycle measured on day 225 at the end of round x in the aerobic phase the biofilm absorbed the phosphorus in the wastewater phosphorus was accumulated in the biofilm and tpbiofilm increased from 23 mg g 1 to 50 mg g 1 in the anaerobic phase the phosphorus accumulated in the biofilm was released and tpbiofilm decreased from 50 mg g 1 to 25 mg g 1 the changes agreed well with the aerobic phosphorus absorption and the anaerobic phosphorus release by paos in ebpr after the full cycle tpbiofilm increased from 23 mg g 1 to 25 mg g 1 which represented the increase of tp in the biofilm over each cycle the phosphorus in the biofilm was mainly stored in eps the tpeps tpbiofilm ratio of phosphorus content in eps to that in biofilm ratio was 83 20 86 97 higher than that of the systems examined by wang et al 30 10 and long et al 52 4 61 3 1 after one aerobic anaerobic cycle tpeps increased by 1 97 mg g 1 but tpcells phosphorus content in cells only increased by 0 03 mg g 1 in the aerobic stage tpeps phosphorus content in eps increased from 19 52 mg g 1 to 41 6 mg g 1 accounting for 81 78 of the total phosphorus uptake by the biofilm in the anaerobic stage tpeps decreased from 41 6 mg g 1 to 21 49 mg g 1 accounting for 80 44 of the phosphorus release from the biofilm hence the eps in the biofilm play an important role in the absorption and release of phosphorus and the phosphorus in the biofilm is mainly accumulated in the eps however phosphokinase ppk and phosphohydrolase ppx were not detected in biofilm eps therefore it is speculated that biofilm eps only has the function of transporting and storing phosphorus tables 1 and 2 reveal that the ratio of phosphorus uptake and phosphorus release are 2 41 and 2 39 times respectively for cells in one cycle which are much larger than those of eps 2 13 and 1 94 respectively that is the change of intracellular phosphorus is more dramatic the biological absorption and release of phosphorus by the cells are the prerequisite of and provide the driving force for the absorption and release of phosphorus by the eps 3 3 metabolic characteristics of biofilm 3 3 1 transformation of polymers in the biofilm tables 3 and 4 present the phosphorus speciation results determined by 31p nmr 28 29 the phosphorus species in eps is 89 00 93 58 orthophosphorus ortho p 3 65 5 85 pyrophosphorus pyro p and 1 64 5 63 polyphosphorus poly p in contrast the intracellular phosphorus is 47 00 60 94 orthophosphate 0 24 3 50 pyrophosphate and 37 52 52 76 polyphosphorus fig 4a b shows that at the end of the aerobic stage eps mainly have orthophosphorus 37 23 mg g 1 4 58 mg g 1 in the cells but the cells mainly have polyphosphorus 3 75 mg g 1 2 17 mg g 1 in eps four stages can be identified in each cycle each having distinct behavior in the absorption or release of phosphorus and the synthesis or decomposition of polymers in the biofilm fig 4c in the first stage 0 2h there is substantial synthesis of polyphosphorus along with rapid decomposition of pha and producing large amounts of atp 30 the phosphate in the wastewater is continuously absorbed by the biofilm and converted to polyphosphorus the cells do not accumulate any orthophosphate and the concentration of intracellular polyphosphate increases significantly from 1 32 mg g 1 to 3 08 mg g 1 the orthophosphate in the eps increases rapidly due to the concentration gradient in the second stage 2 4 h the synthesis of polyphosphorus has largely completed the synthesis of intracellular polyphosphorus becomes notably slower and pha is decomposed at a reduced rate accordingly the absorbed orthophosphate starts to accumulate in cells as it is not quickly converted to polyphosphate the absorption of phosphorus by eps also slows down in the third stage 4 5 h the system enters the anaerobic phase and the external carbon source is quickly absorbed by the biofilm the polyphosphorus in the cell is rapidly decomposed into orthophosphate which is then expelled from the cell a large amount of pha is synthesized and the orthophosphate concentration in the eps also decreases rapidly in the last stage 5 6 h the decomposition of polyphosphorus is basically complete the uptake of carbon sources slows down dramatically the synthesis of pha is also significantly reduced and the content of intracellular polyphosphorus changes very little nevertheless the phosphorus concentration of the liquid phase still gradually increases from 226 6 mg l 1 to 234 1 mg l 1 indicating that at this point the slow diffusion of orthophosphorus from the eps to the liquid phase is responsible for the release of phosphorus from the biofilm fig 4d shows that the decomposition synthesis of pha is positively related to the synthesis decomposition of polyphosphorus in the aerobic phase the synthesis of polyphosphorus becomes stronger when the decomposition of pha is more active and in the anaerobic phase the decomposition of polyphosphorus decreases when the synthesis of pha weakens in the aerobic stage the biofilm absorbs phosphorus strongly with relatively little pha decomposition likely because a large amount of orthophosphorus is absorbed and accumulated in the eps 31 as a result the ratio of p uptake to pha degradation is as high as 1 89 p mmol c mmol in the anaerobic stage the orthophosphorus generated from the decomposition of intracellular polyphosphorus is released into the eps with a high concentration of orthophosphorus the eps releases a substantial amount of orthophosphorus into the solution 1 consequently the ratio of p release to the uptake of acetate is as high as 1 47 p mmol c mmol the current biofilm in this system can utilize pha at much higher efficiency compared with literature reports because eps play an important role in the absorption and release of phosphorus in the aerobic and anaerobic phases 2 19 3 3 2 source of reducing equivalent polyphosphorus pha and glycogen are the three basic polymers in the phosphorus metabolism of paos and their changes reflect the basic metabolic pathways and principles of the paos fig 5 depict the anaerobic phosphorus release and aerobic excess phosphorus uptake in the bsbr system in anaerobic stage paos converted into orthophosphorus by hydrolysis of polyphosphorus poly p and generates adenosine triphosphate atp and glycogen is converted into pyruvate by emp pathway to generate atp and reducing power 32 and rapidly absorb the acetate in the liquid phase the acetate and pyruvate are converted into acetyl coa a part of acetyl coa is subsequently reduced to pha in the presence of reducing power and stored in the cell and a part generates reducing power through the tca cycle converting into acetone coenzyme a which is finally reduced to pha this process simultaneously releases orthophosphorus into the eps which increases the content of orthophosphorus in the eps driven by the concentration gradient the orthophosphorus in the eps is released to the liquid phase in aerobic stage fig 5a pao uses oxygen as an electron acceptor oxidizes and decomposes pha stored in the body to release energy and part of pha is converted into glycogen to supplement the glycogen content in the microbial body for the utilization of the next cycle of anaerobic stage the remaining pha is converted into acetyl coa and the tca cycle transfers protons and electrons to the electron acceptor to generate atp part of the generated atp is used for microbial growth and metabolism and the remaining part is stored in pao in the form of polyphosphorus in traditional paos metabolic mechanisms the reducing equivalent is mainly generated from the emp pathway by converting glycogen to pyruvate fig 5b however in the current work glycogen decomposition may not produce adequate reducing equivalent for the synthesis of pha as the biofilm does not demonstrate evident synthesis and decomposition of glycogen the emp pathway the entner doudoroff ed pathway the hexose monophosphate hmp pathway and the tricarboxylic acid tca cycle are the four metabolic processes that can generate the reducing equivalent in the anaerobic phase 33 among them the emp pathway is a metabolic process in which cells convert glycogen into pyruvate to generate energy and reducing power the ed pathway is an alternative pathway that exists in some microorganisms lacking a complete emp pathway which is unique to microorganisms but the productivity level of the ed pathway is lower than that of the emp pathway while the tca cycle is dependent on the glycogen concentration under anaerobic conditions when the amount of glycogen decomposed in the anaerobic stage is very small it may activate the tca cycle in paos which is the source of pha synthesis provides atp and reducing power 34 in addition the hmp pathway is only used by microorganisms when the pathways of the emp ed and tca cycle are absent which can generate a large amount of reducing power and atp 35 when the internal and external environments vary the reducing equivalent may be mainly provided by one metabolic pathway 17 36 the emp hmp and tca of paos are dominant in microbial competition 33 erdal et al noted that the biochemical pathway of the epbr can vary and is mainly the tca cycle when the temperature is 20 c 37 in our case the paos of bsbr may depend heavily on the tca cycle to maintain their internal redox balance fig 5c 3 4 microbiological analysis the biofilm was sampled at the end of round x on day 225 when the bsbr was under steady state to analyze the microbial composition fig 6a shows the genera with 1 5 abundance the dominant bacteria in the biofilm when the bsbr was under steady stable operation were mainly ca competibacter 20 97 defluviicoccus 9 49 caldilineaceae 2 85 dechloromonas 3 06 flavobacterium 6 08 and saprospiraceae 1 02 among them ca competibacter and defluviicoccus are both typical glycogen accumulating organisms gaos 38 flavobacterium 39 saprospiraceae 40 and caldilineaceae are all presumed paos and dechloromonas is a pao with a strong ability for phosphorus accumulation under low carbon source conditions 41 both flavobacterium and dechloromonas contain the key genes for the expression of the tca cycle 33 the sum of these 6 kinds of microorganisms was then taken to calculate the ratio of each fig 6b shows that the biofilm contains 70 07 gaos and 29 93 paos there are more gaos than paos ca competibacter is beneficial to form viscous eps 42 and thus strengthens the influence of eps in the absorption and release of phosphorus by the biofilm recent research demonstrates that ca competibacter is capable of synthesizing and hydrolyzing polyphosphorus 43 caldilineaceae is a common filamentous fungus and the phosphorus removal can be enhanced when filamentous fungus serves as the skeleton of the biofilm to intimately wrap streptococcus and cocci within the eps and cover them tightly on the filler surface 44 flavobacterium absorbs phosphorus aerobically and releases phosphorus anaerobically and it is also related to the formation of biofilms as it helps maintain the structural stability of biofilms through the secreted eps while using the eps for the accumulation of phosphorus 41 45 the eps produced by defluviicoccus and saprospiraceae bind cells together to form spherical envelopes that are beneficial to biofilm growth 46 47 in sum eps play an important role in the absorption and release of phosphorus because the bsbr is more heavily populated by the bacteria that can secrete eps to improve the phosphorus removal in summary to solve the problem of phosphorus resource consumption and meet the concept of sustainable development phosphorus recovery in urban sewage treatment has become an effective means of recycling the biofilm method can not only achieve aerobic phosphorus removal but also enrich and recover phosphorus in the anaerobic stage which will be used as one of the main research processes for phosphorus recovery from urban sewage our current findings provide new perspectives and valuable insights into understanding the mechanisms of phosphorus removal and enrichment by bsbr in municipal wastewater next the pilot scale trial operation of urban sewage will be carried out to realize the removal and enrichment of phosphorus in urban sewage the recovery of the enriched phosphate solution will be carried out to generate phosphorus products such as struvite cyanite hydroxyapatite etc to realize the real recycling of phosphorus resources at the same time the internal mechanism of biofilm system was deeply studied and the detailed process of biofilm eps and intracellular phosphorus migration and transformation was discussed so as to provide theoretical support for biofilm phosphorus removal 4 conclusions the bsbr reactor is under steady operation 20 c do 6 mg l 1 c 10 mg l 1 which can achieve 95 phosphorus removal in the aerobic phase to give an enrichment solution of up to 235 mg l 1 phosphorus the eps play a key role in the absorption and release of phosphorus by the biofilm the cell provides the main driving force for the absorption and release of phosphorus by the biofilm when the bsbr system is carried out with an aerobic phase of 4 h and an anaerobic phase of 2 h the phosphorus uptake by the aerobic cells is basically complete within 2 h and the phosphorus release by the anaerobic cells is basically complete within 1 h the phosphorus absorption during 3 4 h in the aerobic phase and the phosphorus release during 1 2 h of the anaerobic phase mainly rely on eps the bsbr system is populated by microorganisms that can secrete abundant eps that are beneficial to phosphorus removal and eps play an important role in the absorption and release of phosphorus by the biofilm declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

12836,an ever increasing number of anthropogenic pollutants referred to as emerging pollutants eps have been of concern in recent years these pollutants are known for the potential risk that they pose in the environment and have been consistently found in surface waste and potable waters moreover some of them are persistent to conventional treatments and in the environment advanced oxidation processes aops are widely used technology for the removal of eps the use of peracetic acid paa as an oxidant aop for the treatment of eps has attracted increasing interest owing to its ease of activation and to the selectivity of the organic radicals that are generated in these processes towards electron rich sites which makes them more robust against the effect of scavenging agents in real matrices this work presents a critical analysis of the advantages disadvantages and opportunities of paa based processes several strategies for paa activation were analyzed including uv and transition metal activation heterogeneous catalysis thermal and microwave activation and phosphate induced activation it was found that paa based aops seem to have several advantages over other widely studied processes some key perspectives for research include testing of these processes with a variety of eps analysis of transformation products and their toxicity in the treated effluents multivariate optimization of the process direct comparison with widely studied oxidants and experimentation for escalation and implementation nevertheless paa based aops seem to be a promising alternative to conventional aops keywords peracetic acid advanced oxidation process activation degradation emerging pollutants 1 introduction the growth of industry and the increasing population in urban and rural areas have created challenges in form of the removal of increasingly complex pollutants from water 1 4 advances in science lead to the constant manufacture of new pollutants as well as to a better understanding of the threats posed by them these new contaminants are referred to as emerging pollutants eps 5 they include various classes of products such as pharmaceuticals dyes endocrine disruptors nanomaterials flame retardants artificial sweeteners and ingredients of personal care products 3 6 eps are toxic compounds that vary in chemical structures and are known to be persistent and toxic in the environment 5 7 while some eps are known to be naturally found in the environment most have been introduced through human activity ranging in concentration from a few ng l in clean surface waters to hundreds of μg l in polluted waters 1 8 moreover it has been reported that conventional water treatments are failing to remove or degrade many eps probably because they are highly stable and very resistant to biodegradation rendering many conventional physicochemical and biological wastewater treatment processes ineffective 9 10 in consequence the removal of eps from wastewater treatment plants has been considered a challenge fortunately growing public health and environmental concerns have led to efforts to develop new technologies for the treatment of ep containing wastewater one such technology is advanced oxidation processes aops which have gained growing acceptance for their effectivity in the removal of several eps 11 13 aops traditionally comprise several methods for the in situ generation of highly reactive radical species such as hydroxyl radical oh sulfate radical so4 and other reactive oxygen species hydroxyl radical based processes are one of the most studied aops these have proved to be significantly effective reactive and nonselective with electrophilic behavior and a redox potential of 2 8 v these radicals can rapidly oxidate and degrade a wide spectrum of pollutants in wastewater 14 principally by abstracting h from c h n h or o h bonds adding to cc bonds or adding to aromatic rings see eqs 1 3 15 one of the advantages of aops is that these reactions with oh can destroy molecules and in some cases mineralize them into co2 h2o and inorganic salts 14 see eq 4 1 oh r h h 2 o r 2 oh c c oh c c 3 oh r r oh 4 organic species oh c o 2 h 2 o inorganic ions nevertheless the major drawback of current aops is that they are costly as expensive chemicals are used as reagents high energy consumption is required in order for the oxidation system to be used and these processes are sensitive to the effect of the water matrix 11 13 moreover some processes lead to the generation of new pollutants some of which are more toxic than their parent compounds 13 in consequence research into better more effective strategies for treatment of ep polluted water is still ongoing to address the issue of scavenging pollutants in the water matrix it has been suggested that aops should be made more selective for the specific target pollutants however as mentioned before low selectivity is one of the characteristics of oh radicals 14 in consequence some more recent studies have reported the activation of peracids both inorganic such as peroxymonosulfate and peroxydisulfate 16 17 and organic such as peracetic acid paa 17 18 this study focuses on aops based on the activation of peracetic acid although paa based aops have been previously discussed in reviews by ao et al 18 and kiejza et al 17 new information of significant importance has been published regarding the reaction mechanisms radicals mediating the reaction and new technologies for the paa activation hence this review aims to provide updated information on paa based activation methods for the degradation of eps 2 peracetic acid basic information peracetic acid paa pka equal to 8 2 is an organic peroxyacid that has been widely employed as a disinfectant sanitizer sterilizing agent oxidizer and polymerization catalyst it has been of interest as an alternative disinfection product to chlorine due to the reduced formation of disinfection by products in paa based processes 19 its wide spectrum of microbial activity and its economic feasibility 20 paa is a highly water soluble colorless substance with a strong pungent acrid odor like that of vinegar 17 18 which is synthesized by the reaction of acetic acid with hydrogen peroxide h2o2 in the presence of a catalyst such as sulfuric acid 21 it is often sold as a mixture containing paa acetic acid h2o2 and water 22 commercial paa solutions are often below 15 paa solutions exceeding this concentration are unstable and show some degree of explosiveness paa is inactive with glassware and most plastic packaging however it can degrade vinyls and natural or synthetic rubbers metal containers like pure aluminum stainless steel and tin plated iron can resist paa but brass copper steel and bronze are susceptible to corrosion when exposed to paa 23 paa in solution is consumed by spontaneous decomposition or hydrolysis spontaneous decomposition occurs at ph between 5 5 and 10 2 and is fastest near ph 8 2 the paa pka in this mechanism the paa anions paa may attack the paa neutral molecules paa0 forming an active intermediate that further decomposes to acetic anions o2 and h on the other hand the mechanism of hydrolysis consists of the protonation of the carbonyl group and the formation of a carbocation that is further attacked by water forming h2o2 and acetic acid the hydrolysis mechanism seems to be negligible at ph below 8 2 and its rate constant increases at higher ph values 24 25 the cost of paa was reported to be 1100 1200 ton in 2015 by luukkonen et al and a disinfection cost of 0 0261 m3 for a 3 mg l dose 26 nowadays there are several commercial paa solutions with different concentrations of h2o2 and paa wt six of which have been approved by the us environmental protection agency for wastewater disinfection proxitane ww 12 peraclean 15 vigorox wwt ii sanidate 15 peragreen ww and peragreen 22ww 24 the global peracetic acid market is forecast to grow from usd 813 million in 2020 to usd 1685 million by 2030 at a cagr of 7 6 27 moreover previous works have reported that the cost of these products has been decreasing probably due to the increase production and expansion of its applications 17 18 thus seeming like an economically promising oxidant for water treatment 3 paa based aops in addition to its industrial uses paa has the potential to degrade aqueous organic micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals due to its high oxidation potential which ranges from 1 06 at alkaline conditions to 1 96 v at acidic conditions 17 18 however its rate of homolytic cleavage k 6 10 12 s 1 is too low for it to be used as oxidant in technological applications meaning that activators are needed for the efficient generation of strong oxidants 17 in aops paa has been of interest as an oxidant agent that is activated to generate peroxyl radicals ch3c o o and ch3c o oo by the activation of the paa molecules and oh radicals by the activation of either paa molecules or coexisting h2o2 the generation of free radicals in paa based aops was first reported caretti and lubello who used an uv paa process in a wastewater disinfection pilot plant 28 however it was only until recently that paa based aops gained attention as means to degrade eps as shown in fig 2 when compared to h2o2 which is the reference oxidant in aops paa is characterized by the lower energy in its o o bond 38 kcal mol 1 vs 51 kcal mol 1 meaning that it is thermodynamically unstable and more easily broken 25 additionally the ease of activation of paa is indicated by its lower unoccupied molecular orbital lumo energy 0 25 ev which suggests that paa can more easily accept electrons than h2o2 lumo energy 0 57 ev consequently higher reaction rates have been reported for the paa reaction 29 30 for this reason paa based aops seem to be a potential improvement on conventional aops based on hydrogen peroxide and research into this kind of processes has received growing attention over the last three years fig 1 several strategies have been proposed for the o o bond cleavage in paa which leads to the generation of peroxyl radicals ch3c o o and ch3c o oo and oh radicals these technologies include uv light irradiation uv paa 29 31 33 transition metal ions mn paa including cobalt 34 35 iron 30 36 manganese 37 ruthenium 38 molybdenum 39 40 and silver 41 and other methods that are shown in fig 2 in the following sections we discuss the current works using these methods their mechanisms and the role of the important process variables on their performance 3 1 activation by uv irradiation perhaps the most studied activator for paa is uv irradiation uv radiation leads to the homolytic cleavage of the o o bond in paa generating acetoxyl and hydroxyl radicals eq 5 29 33 42 44 additionally some amounts of h2o2 are always present in paa solutions so it coexists with the uv h2o2 aop eq 6 29 42 zhang and huang 42 modeled the kinetics of the uv paa process reporting several reaction pathways that can occur during radical generation and their subsequent interactions it was found that oh ch3c o o and oh and ch3c o oo were the major species participating in the reaction the same authors also determined the quantum yield for paa decomposition at uv254 φ 0 88 0 04 mol ein 1 42 it should be noted that this is higher than that of h2o2 φ 0 5 mol ein 1 indicating a faster reaction rate with a similar amount of absorbed light 5 c h 3 c o o 2 h uv c h 3 c o o oh ε 8 m 1 cm 1 φ 0 88 0 04 mol ein 1 6 h 2 o 2 uv 2 oh ε 18 7 m 1 cm 1 φ 0 5 mol ein 1 subsequently some limiting reactions that remove radicals of interest from the solution while producing less reactive ones can be triggered by oh and ch3c o o radicals 1 oh can further react with paa to generate acetyl peroxyl radicals ch3c o oo and h2o eq 7 2 ch3c o o can react with paa to form ch3c o oo and acetic acid eq 8 and 3 ch3c o o may undergo radical radical coupling eq 9 33 42 additionally acetoxyl radicals can decarboxylate yielding methyl radicals ch3 and carbon dioxide co2 eq 10 furthermore the ch3c o oo formed in eq 8 can react with itself to regenerate ch3c o o radicals eq 11 18 42 several other subsequent reactions may happen in the process which are presented in the article by zhang and huang 42 7 c h 3 c o o 2 h oh c h 3 c o oo h 2 o k 1 3 0 2 10 9 8 ch 3 c o o 2 h c h 3 c o o c h 3 c o oo

publications have focused on the degradation of persistent organic pollutants by uv paa these are presented in table 1 overall uv paa seems like a promising alternative for the degradation of eps sharma et al reported a degradation between 80 and 100 for various chlorophenols their results show that the number and position of chlorine atoms in the aromatic ring structure significantly influences degradation 45 the effectivity of the uv paa process was also reported by cai et al 29 who studied the effect of the process on the degradation of some pharmaceutical compounds they showed that while little degradation was obtained by oxidation with paa alone all pharmaceuticals were degraded by 93 5 under uv paa with 1 mg l of paa at ph 7 1 29 they also conducted scavenging tests to determine the reactive species that led to such degradation they reported that the degradation was caused mainly by oh oxidation followed by oxidation by other radicals which were mostly organic radicals and direct photolysis which is consistent with the results obtained by zhang and huang 42 moreover organic radicals showed higher selectivity reacting quickly with naproxen nap but not with carbamazepine cbz and ibuprofen ibp which indicates the higher affinity of these radicals for specific pollutants similar behavior was obtained by rizzo et al 46 for the degradation of chloramphenicol but with lower degradation rates this seems to be attributable to the experimental conditions especially the paa contaminant ratio which is much higher in the experiments by the former hollman et al also studied the uv paa process for the treatment of pharmaceuticals obtaining results that were consistent with the findings of cai et al 29 33 however a lower amount of reaction intermediates was found by hollman for a common pollutant cbz which seems to be related to the use of a higher dose of paa which led to significantly higher pollutant degradation other studies that show the effectivity of paa in degrading eps include the degradation of steroid estrogens by hu et al 48 and the degradation of the cyanotoxins microcystin lr and rr by almuhataram et al 49 several process variables have been found to influence the performance of the uv paa process these include ph paa dosage and water matrix operational parameters as this is a radiation activated process exposure to uv 254 nm has a major synergistic effect in the process as has been demonstrated by several authors 29 42 43 zhang et al measured a quantum yield of 0 88 0 04 mol ein 1 which indicates that the production of radicals in the solution is limited by the absorption of photons in the system 43 however to the best of our knowledge there are no works that study the effect of reactor configurations in the uv paa process 3 1 1 effect of ph in the uv paa process ph influences the paa acid base equilibrium and consequently the generation of the reactive radical species as the pk value of paa is 8 2 its deprotonated form paa is more dominant above ph 8 2 while its protonated form paa0 is more prominent below this ph paa is characterized by a higher molar absorption coefficient than paa0 at 254 nm which suggests that the photolysis of paa and the generation of radicals are faster at alkaline ph however the increase in ph may also have a negative effect on the efficiency of uv paa because the radicals show a decreased redox potential at this ph and the oh ions could act as scavengers 29 43 this is shown by the results of cai et al who reported that there were no significant differences between ph 5 and ph 7 1 but observed a decrease at ph 9 65 29 and zhang et al who reported an optimal ph of 8 5 43 therefore near neutral conditions seem to be ideal for the uv paa process since more basic conditions have been shown to reduce the process efficiency and acidic conditions would increase the cost apparently without any significant effect 3 1 2 effect of the paa initial concentration in the uv paa process in paa based aops reactive radicals are mainly produced by the activation of a paa h2o2 mixture in consequence it is logical to suppose that the concentration of paa is a significant factor affecting the efficiency process it has been reported that an increase in paa generally leads to a higher degradation but a plateau is eventually reached where further degradation is not achieved this was evidenced in the work of rizzo et al 46 where the pseudo first order reaction rate increased from 9 3 10 3 to 36 4 10 3 min 1 with an increase in initial paa from 5 to 50 mg l for the degradation of chloramphenicol 46 and that of hollman et al who found that the pseudo first order reaction rate can be approximated as a linear function of the paa dose 33 zhang et al 2020 43 found similar results for the degradation of diclofenac dcf the pseudo first order reaction rate increased from 0 0967 to 0 182 min 1 with increasing paa concentration from 10 to 150 μm however they also reported that at higher concentrations the increase was less significant and could eventually reach a plateau which is probably due to the scavenging effect of paa on the radicals eqs 13 14 moreover it is also possible that more paa absorbed more photons inhibiting the effect of direct photolysis in the pollutant 3 1 3 effect of the water matrix the selectivity of ch3c o o is one of the main advantages of paa based aops for this reason several authors have evaluated the effect of the matrix conditions in the uv paa process commonly identified water matrix scavengers for aops include carbonates co3 2 and hco3 chloride ions cl sulfate ions so4 2 nitrate ions no3 and dissolved organic matter dom although these ions may reduce the efficiency of aops in general the literature shows that most of these ions have effects on the uv paa process that are lower or even non significant except in the case of dom for example chen et al 44 reported that a dose of 20 mm of carbonates co3 2 and hco3 reduced the reaction rate kobs in the uv h2o2 from 0 106 to 0 062 min 1 while the uv paa showed no significant change kobs 0 112 0 117 this is probably due to a higher selectivity of the acetoxyl radicals towards nap over carbonates while cl did not seem to have a significant effect on the efficiency of the uv paa process it did decrease the reaction rate when in the presence of a oh scavenger suggesting that cl might scavenge the acetoxyl radicals nevertheless this may be an indicator that the coexistence of radicals in the process could increase the robustness of the process finally the authors also reported that 0 5 mg l of humic acids ha reduced the reaction rate in the uv paa from 0 12 to 0 066 min 1 and a similar effect was observed for uv h2o2 which is probably due to the likelihood of ha being attacked by both acetoxyl and oh radicals 44 similar results were found by zhang et al 2020 43 for the degradation of dcf in which cl so4 2 no3 and co3 2 did not show any significant effect on the process however dissolved organic matter dom negatively affected the efficiency of the process 5 mg l of fulvic acid decreased the 15 min dcf degradation by around 15 there are two possible explanations for this firstly dom is known to be a scavenger for oh radicals competing with the target pollutants and secondly dom can absorb radiation and compete with paa reducing the generation of radicals 42 3 2 activation of paa by metal catalysts transition metals have been commonly used as catalysts in the activation of oxidants to generate radical species some recent works have studied transition metals including iron cobalt and manganese for the activation of paa in aops 34 50 51 a summary of the recent works is presented in table 2 although most of these studies have dealt with dissolved metal catalysts there are also some studies using heterogeneous metal catalysts like zero valent metals and metal oxides which may reduce reagent costs and secondary pollution due to metal cations 39 52 55 in general it has been reported that activation of paa with transition metal catalysts metal paa is in essence like the classic fenton process namely a transition metal catalyst is oxidized to break the o o bond and activate paa eqs 12 13 50 the activation of paa by metal catalysts leads to the generation of ch3c o o and ch3c o oo as is shown in fig 3a also just as in the uv paa process the presence of h2o2 in the solution may also have an important role in the oxidation process for example when using fe2 as the metal catalyst a simultaneous fenton process may occur in the system leading to the generation of oh radicals 30 50 which seems to increase the effectivity and robustness of the process but also makes it more complex due to the interactions between the different radicals 12 c h 3 c o o 2 h m n m n 1 c h 3 c o o oh 13 m n 1 c h 3 c o o 2 h m n c h 3 c o oo h 3 2 1 cobalt paa according to previous studies cobalt co has a higher catalytic performance for paa activation than other metals like manganese mn iron fe and copper cu the process follows the model provided in eqs 12 13 and it is noteworthy that to the best of our knowledge there are no reports of oh formation in the decomposition of paa with co2 35 51 which is a key difference with other processes as is shown in fig 3b kim et al reported that the second order rate constants for paa activation with co2 range between 1 7 101 and 1 33 102 m 1 s 1 at ph 3 and 8 2 respectively and between 3 91 and 5 57 102 for co3 which leads to the conclusion that the process is better at neutral ph and that co can efficiently cycle through the reactions in eqs 12 and 13 34 35 the efficiency of the co2 paa process has been evaluated by various authors for different pollutants wang et al 34 evaluated the process for the degradation of sulfamethoxazole smx reaching around 90 smx degradation in 15 min in this process the use of scavengers led to the conclusion that organic radicals ch3c o o and ch3c o oo are the main contributors to degradation which is consistent with theory 34 also kim et al 35 evaluated the same process for cbz smx nap and bisphenol a bpa achieving degradations between 88 and 100 at neutral ph almost complete degradation was achieved for all of the pollutants in 5 min however cbz seemed to be more resistant to the process only 80 degradation being achieved for this pollutant in 30 min 35 a more recent study by liu et al 51 found that the co2 paa process at acidic conditions may lead to the generation of co4 species that may also participate in the degradation of organic pollutants however neutral ph seems to favor the generation of oxygen centered radicals like the ch3c o o and ch3c o oo while the role of co4 species is narrowed the proposed mechanism for co4 species generation is presented in eqs 14 and 15 the role of these species has been often overlooked as one of the advantages of co2 paa is that it may work at neutral conditions unlike other metal paa processes nevertheless it seems worthy of attention as some pollutants like cbz seem to be more reactive to co4 than oxygen centered radicals 51 14 c o 2 c h 3 c o ooh c o 2 c h 3 c o ooh complex 15 c o 2 c h 3 c o ooh comple x c o 4 c h 3 c o o h on the other hand heterogeneous co based catalysts have also been considered for paa activation wu et al 54 experimented with co3o4 for the degradation of orange g og complete degradation of og was reached after 90 min of reaction and organic radicals were identified as the main oxidant species additionally low cobalt leaching was observed during the reaction contributing to the reusability of the catalyst and lowering the secondary source of contamination 54 the same authors also conducted experiments on several other pollutants finding that cephalexin cfx and ampicillin are very easily degraded by co3o4 paa but nitrobenzene nb benzoic acid ba smx cbz and dcf are more resistant and even recalcitrant to the process although co seems to be a promising alternative for eps due to its efficiency for paa activation it must be considered that co is characterized by its potential risk to human health and is a secondary source of pollution to the environment in consequence processes involving homogeneous co must be handled carefully in order to neutralize cobalt before discharge and heterogeneous processes must take into account the potential leaching of co to the sample which limits its application 54 3 2 2 iron paa the use of iron based catalysts has been widely studied for water treatment due to their low cost high efficiency and environmental friendliness fe2 is used as the catalyst in the fenton process therefore it is the one of the most used iron catalysts and has been widely investigated 17 18 fe2 activation of paa seems to behave in a similar way to co2 activation although the main difference between these processes is the generation of oh radicals 30 as shown in fig 3c these are generated in 2 ways 1 fe2 can activate the h2o2 that exists in equilibrium with paa generating a fenton reaction that occurs simultaneously to the fe paa activation 2 kim et al proposed that in addition to eqs 12 and 13 oh radicals may also be generated in the activation of paa eq 16 30 16 c h 3 c o o 2 h m n m n 1 c h 3 c o o oh another important difference between fe2 and co2 mediated processes is the necessity to work at acidic conditions in order to maintain the speciation of fe2 and prevent the precipitation of iron that happens at higher ph kim et al reported that the second order reaction rate varied between 1 10 105 and 1 56 104 m 1 s 1 at ph between 3 and 7 1 30 this is probably due to the precipitation of iron at neutral to basic conditions it is noteworthy that the reported reaction rate of the fe2 paa process is much higher than that of the fenton 63 76 m 1s 1 and co2 paa 1 33 102 m 1 s 1 process some authors have successfully employed the fe2 paa process for the degradation of eps kim et al 30 studied the degradation of methylene blue nap and bpa achieving 90 degradation for all pollutants at ph 3 however degradation significantly decreased at higher ph values additionally the authors found that paa activation is 650 times faster than that of h2o2 which suggests that it can easily outperform coexistent h2o2 in the process consistently the authors found 2 distinct kinetic stages in the process the first consisting of rapid degradation attributed to the fe2 paa and the second of slower degradation attributed to fe2 h2o2 30 moreover thayrine et al 36 evaluated the fe2 paa process against its fe3 counterpart at acidic conditions ph 3 unlike the reaction with h2o2 it seems that paa may be activated effectively with fe3 ions a mb degradation of 99 was achieved with 50 μm of fe3 while 95 was achieved with the same amount of fe2 and a dose of 52 μm paa theoretical calculations suggest that this behavior is because the reactions between paa and fe3 are spontaneous and produce in turn fe2 while those with fe2 are non spontaneous 36 nevertheless it must be noted that the paa h2o2 ratio in the paa solution that was used was 0 65 which is considerably lower than in other works therefore the role of fe3 ions for the activation of paa mixtures containing a higher ratio should be studied some works have also studied iron heterogeneous catalysis for example wang et al achieved complete removal of smx with a fe2 modified zeolite paa at neutral ph and in 60 min of reaction time 50 additionally wang et al studied the combined metal catalyst cofe2o4 achieving degradations of around 75 in 30 min also at neutral ph 52 moreover zhang et al 56 studied the activation of paa with nano zero valent iron fe0 achieving tetracycline tc degradations of 95 in 30 min compared to h2o2 activation which yielded 15 degradation paa activation was considerably more efficient probably due to the ease of activation of paa 56 overall despite the ph dependence of the fe2 paa processes their low cost high efficiency and reaction rate and environmental friendliness suggest that iron is a good alternative for the activation of paa however further research is required to better understand the mechanisms and widen the ph window in which it can work the role of fe3 is of special interest since ferric salts seem to be an effective activator for paa and are cheaper than ferrous salts 3 2 3 effect of ph in the metal paa process ph influences the speciation of both metal ions and paa as mentioned before the speciation of paa pka 8 2 may affect the reaction rate because the paa0 that predominates at acid to neutral ph is more oxidant than paa which predominates at basic ph additionally paa0 is more likely to accept electrons than its deprotonated form and the reactions between the transition metals and paa eqs 12 13 are based on the electron exchange between them this is consistent with the results by kim et al who reported that the maximum oxidation rate was achieved at near neutral ph for the co2 paa process 35 on the other hand the results of liu et al 51 suggest that ph may be determinant in the reaction mechanisms of the co2 paa process while acidic conditions seem to favor the formation of co4 species that may act as oxidants the widely used neutral conditions seem to favor the formation of ch3c o o and ch3c o oo 51 the evidence seems to suggest that some pollutants like cbz may be more easily oxidized by the former therefore further studies with different pollutants are necessary fe2 speciation also has a major effect on the performance of the fe2 paa process as with the fenton process this process seems to be optimal at a ph around 3 30 36 this is especially so during the second kinetic stage described by kim et al 35 which is attributed to a fenton process at higher ph fe3 is known for the generation of precipitative hydroxide complexes that significantly decrease the activity of the fe2 paa and fenton reaction 30 3 2 4 effect of the paa initial concentration in the metal paa processes similarly to the uv paa process paa activation is probably the main source of reactive radicals in the process making it one of the significant factors limiting the reaction most works dealing with metal paa processes have shown this behavior for example kim et al reported that the degradation efficiency for cbz in a co2 paa process increased from 24 to 92 by increasing the initial concentration of paa from 20 to 200 μm in 30 min of reaction time 35 observing a similar behavior for smx kim et al 30 also studied the effect of initial paa concentration on mb degradation finding that this increased from 69 7 to 100 in 60 min when the paa concentration was increased from 50 to 500 μm however they also pointed out that 1000 μm considerably inhibited the reaction this is probably because the effect of paa is limited by paa fe2 ratio they reported that 1 1 was optimal for the degradation of mb 30 excess paa might compete for radicals with the pollutants producing less reactive oxidant species and limiting the reaction this is coherent with the results reported by wang et al 50 but ultimately the optimal paa dose depends on the characteristics of the pollutant and its concentration additionally one of the drawbacks of any paa process is that because paa is an organic substance the addition of paa leads to an increase in the total organic carbon toc in the solution in consequence it is logical to suppose that excess paa contributes to this drawback while also implying a cost increase in the process this makes it necessary to carefully optimize the paa dose in the processes 3 2 5 effect of the catalyst dosage in the metal paa as mentioned before the paa metal ratio is a key parameter in metal paa processes in general it has been reported that the decomposition of paa in co2 paa reaction increases with higher dosages of co2 this was shown by wang et al 34 where the degradation of smx increased from 61 2 to nearly 100 after reaction for 15 min as the initial co concentration grew from 0 2 to 3 2 μm owing to the fast reduction of co3 to co2 the redox cycle of co2 and co3 is expected to be efficient and to keep the reaction going and an increased amount of metal ions has shown to increase the reaction rate significantly 34 also kim et al 35 reported a similar effect for the degradation of cbz degradation increased from 30 5 to 97 7 after 30 min when co2 concentration was increased from 1 to 100 μm however the addition of excess co2 resulted in a decrease in the efficiency probably due to the radical scavenging by excess metal ions 35 kim et al 30 observed a similar behavior in the fe2 paa process reporting that the optimum fe paa ratio was 1 1 and that excess fe2 ions caused a significant reduction in the process efficiency at a fixed dose of 50 μm of paa increasing fe2 from 20 to 50 μm led to an increase from 63 1 to 75 but further increases to 100 and 500 μm led to significant reductions of up to 46 in efficiency additionally when using 1000 μm of both reagents complete degradation was achieved almost instantly 30 in general it should be considered that metal ions especially cobalt are a secondary source of pollution and excess dosages should be avoided 3 2 6 effect of the water matrix few studies have analyzed the effect of the water matrix on metal paa processes it is expected that the variety and selectivity of radicals in these processes make them less likely to be affected by scavengers in real matrices kim et al 35 showed that the addition of cl 100 1000 μm had little impact on cbz degradation by co2 paa but the addition of carbonates hco3 or phosphates po4 3 in the same range significantly reduced degradation at 30 min by up to 45 6 and 60 7 respectively ha 1 10 mg l also reduced degradation by up to 69 however cai et al and chen et al concluded that carbonates did not scavenge ch3c o oo radicals in the uv paa process 29 44 in consequence the inhibition in degradation for the co paa seems to be attributable to the formation of non reactive hco3 co2 complexes 18 35 moreover kim et al reported a similar effect for the fe2 paa process specifically in the second kinetic phase where the addition of 0 5 mm of total carbonate resulted in reductions of 33 and 26 for nap and bpa degradation respectively which is expected since this phase is attributed to a fenton reaction 30 overall it seems that the efficiency of metal paa processes can be reduced by some of the widely known oh radical scavengers like carbonates phosphates and natural organic matter nom however there is also evidence that acetoxyl radicals are not significantly scavenged by such substances 29 44 this suggests that the mechanisms involved in the efficiency reduction are related to the interaction with the catalysts or the scavenging of the coexistent oh in the case of cl which is known to be an oh radical scavenger it is reported that the co paa process is not significantly affected however to the best of our knowledge there is no evidence regarding its interaction with fe paa considering that the generation of oh radicals is involved in the process it is likely that the process would be inhibited especially during the second kinetic phase this suggests that although metal paa processes may negatively interact with scavengers in real matrices they also seem to be more robust than conventional oh based processes making them interesting alternatives that require further study 3 2 7 other transition metals used for paa activation although cobalt and iron are the most widely used transition metals for paa activation other metals including molybdenum mo 39 40 ruthenium ru 38 and copper cu 53 have also been studied wang et al 39 used molybdenum disulfide mos2 as a heterogeneous activator for paa in the degradation of smx sulfaguanidine sg sulfamonomethoxine smm and sulfamerazine smz obtaining degradations of 76 60 92 and 92 respectively with 0 3 mm paa 0 3 g l mos2 and ph 3 in 15 min of reaction time moreover it was found that 98 4 of mos2 remained in its crystalline structure and only 1 6 leached to the solution indicating that the process generates a low level of metal pollution however the recovered mos2 suffered a considerable loss in effectivity after second and third degradation runs 39 moreover wang et al 40 used mos2 as a co catalyst in the fe3 paa activation in the degradation of smx which was reduced by 96 in 10 min of reaction time with 0 3 mm paa 0 1 g l mos2 and 0 1 mm fe3 this enhancement is attributed to the generation of fe2 in the reaction between mos2 and fe3 40 there have been reports of paa activation with fe3 that may also produce fe2 ions 36 however the degradation in the paa fe3 test performed by the authors showed negligible degradation and fe2 generation mos2 is characterized by its low toxicity and biocompatibility in this sense it appears to be an environmentally friendly and effective alternative for paa activation nevertheless the low reusability of the crystalline mos2 suggests that the costs of this reagent and its removal from water should be further assessed before its application and escalation ruthenium ions have also performed effectively in paa activation li et al 38 completely degraded 10 μm of smx using 100 μm ru3 200 μm paa and 10 mm phosphate buffer to maintain the ph at 7 in 4 min in this study ru3 was more effective than co2 fe2 and others the lower efficiency of fe2 can be attributed to the effect of ph 38 however it is especially interesting that ru3 showed a higher performance than co2 one possible explanation for this is the formation of co complexes with phosphate 35 the authors also studied the effect of phosphate ions on the process showing that an increase in these enhances the reaction however the effect seems to be mainly attributable to the ru3 and paa concentrations the ru3 paa process is an effective alternative for the treatment of eps however the effect of water matrices needs to be further studied and the cost and toxicity of ru3 needs to be assessed moreover the development of new ru based catalysts is another perspective for future research a study by zhang et al 53 used zero valent copper zvc for the activation of paa achieving complete degradation of 1 μm dcf in 40 min of reaction time with 100 μm paa 0 5 g l zvc and a ph of 3 interestingly degradation with 9 4 mg l cu2 ions and similar conditions was only 10 and with zvc h2o2 it was 40 degradation would appear to be attributable to the cu ions on the surface of zvc which is related to the need for acidic conditions as h enhances the generation of cu ions moreover matrix ions like so4 2 no3 and co3 2 do not seem to affect the reaction while cl seems to increase the reaction rate probably due to the generation of cl radical species on the other hand zvc seems to be reusable as degradation only decreased from 95 to 87 after 3 times of recycling 53 the effectivity of reusability of zvc suggests that this could be a cost effective process for the removal of eps like dcf nevertheless the toxicity of copper needs to be considered consequently it is necessary to conduct studies on the leaching of copper in zvc paa activation as mentioned before co and fe oxides have also been effectively used as heterogeneous activators for paa wang et al 52 effectively used cobalt ferrite cofe2o4 for the activation of paa this activator was found to be considerably more effective for the degradation of 10 μm smx than co oxides like co3o4 and co2o3 and fe oxides like fe2o3 the process conditions were 0 1 g l of the activators 100 μm paa and ph of 7 achieving a degradation of 75 with cofe2o4 in 30 min while the other studied activators achieved degradations below 24 moreover cofe2o4 proved to be highly recyclable as the authors obtained stable degradation in 4 tests reusing cofe2o4 moreover cofe2o4 can be easily separated from the solution due to its magnetic properties similar results were obtained by zhou et al for other pollutants including smx tcs aniline 2 clorophenol and bpa 57 however the authors confirmed the leaching of co ions in the process the cofe2o4 paa process appears to have several practical applications that make it interesting for further research however its main drawback seems to be contamination due to co ions furthermore different manganese salts mn2 were tested by rothbart et al 37 for the degradation of the orange ii dye catalytic degradation was tested at ph 9 5 and 25 c it was found that the non catalyzed reaction was 500 times slower than the one in the presence of mn2 kobs 1 28 10 4 and 6 05 10 2 s 1 respectively moreover paa activation was much higher than that of h2o2 with mn2 kobs 7 92 10 4 s 1 additionally the participation of free radicals was shown through scavenging experiments 37 3 3 synergistic fe2 uv paa process although uv paa and fe2 paa seem to be effective for the degradation of several pollutants some compounds depending on their characteristics may be more resistant or even recalcitrant to the processes thus requiring longer reaction times examples of this were cbz and ibp in the uv paa treatment by cai et al 29 nap and bpa in the fe2 paa treatment by kim et al 54 in consequence some recent works have explored the synergistic effect of uv and fe2 for the activation of paa 58 60 wang et al 60 studied the uv fe2 paa process for the degradation of triclosan tcs as a means to accelerate the reaction through the synergistic effect of uv and fe2 95 degradation was achieved with fe2 paa in 20 min of reaction at ph 3 5 while complete degradation was achieved with uv fe2 paa more importantly the degradation rate constant was higher 0 59 min 1 in the uv fe2 paa than in the fe2 paa 0 46 min 1 60 in the same study the authors concluded that oh radicals were the main oxidating species but ch3c o o and ch3c o oo were also responsible for part of the degradation another important observation from this process was the effect of inorganic ions cl showed no inhibition effect on the tcs degradation a possible explanation might be that the formed cl radicals might react with tcs 60 or that the oxidation by ch3c o o and ch3c o oo is not significantly affected by the presence of cl 29 44 the presence of no3 ions resulted in the enhancement of the removal from 88 to 97 in the first 3 min of reaction with the addition of 10 mm of no3 this is explained by the photolysis of no3 which may generate oh radicals and reactive nitrogen species that might enhance the reaction 60 the uv fe2 paa was also studied by chen et al 58 who added edds as a chelating agent to prevent fe2 from precipitating at neutral ph the fe2 edds uv paa process was used to degrade nap achieving around 80 degradation in 5 min of reaction with nap 10 μm paa 100 μm fe2 12 5 μm and edds 25 μm meanwhile the fe2 paa achieved 20 degradation and uv paa achieved around 40 showing that the reaction rate can be significantly increased by the combination of both processes 58 the effect of the matrix was consistent with the results of wang et al 60 the uv fe2 paa process was also evaluated by ghanbari et al 59 for the degradation of acetaminophen act in this case the uv radiation was provided by uvc led paa uvc led fe2 showed high efficiency 95 for act removal in 30 min at ph 5 paa 4 mm and fe2 0 5 mm furthermore the paa uvc led and paa fe2 systems removed 53 4 and 42 2 of act from solution respectively this indicates that there was a synergistic effect in the process interestingly the ph showed no significant difference between 3 and 5 in this process 59 3 4 other paa activation methods the rising interest in paa based aops has led to the publication of various studies dealing with paa activation strategies for the treatment of various eps so far most of the research has focused on uv paa activation and more recently metal catalyzed activation has also been on the rise however uv irradiation has limited penetration into water and is unavailable on the subsurface while excessive transition metal ions such as cobalt affect water quality and may be toxic and or carcinogenic consequently research on alternative activation methods has also been on the rise therefore methods like phosphate buffer activation thermal activation microwave activation and activation using carbonaceous materials which are enhanced due to the ease of activation for paa have received recent attention table 3 presents a summary of works dealing with such methods 3 4 1 carbon based catalysts for the activation of paa as an alternative to metal catalysts zhou et al 61 proposed the use of activated carbon fibers acf for the catalytic activation of paa they achieved 97 removal of reactive brilliant red x 3b at neutral ph with paa 5 mm and 2 g l of acf control runs suggested that paa can effectively be activated by acf only 47 degradation was achieved with acf alone which is attributable to adsorption on the acf and it only increased to 54 with and the addition of h2o2 in the same amount showing that h2o2 is poorly activated by this method 61 the main advantages of this process are that no secondary pollution is generated by the acfs they can be reused and the process can work over a wide ph range 3 4 2 phosphate buffer activation it has been reported that peroxides with asymmetric structures like peroxymonosulfate pms and paa can be activated by nucleophilic attacks with phosphate buffer solutions pbs generating radicals consequently deng et al 64 proposed activation with phosphate anions which is shown in eq 17 96 dcf degradation was achieved in 45 min using a 0 1 m pbs solution and 0 55 mm paa at ph 7 4 and room temperature 25 c moreover it was found that the effect of h2o2 activation in the system is negligible the role of ph seems to be critical for the process since deprotonated phosphate seems to be more favorable for the activation of paa therefore ph 7 2 would favor the reaction moreover ph above the paa pka 8 2 seems to favor its self decomposition which might result in a decrease in degradation 64 17 c h 3 c o o 2 h pbs c h 3 c o o oh other factors influencing the performance of the process include pbs concentration paa dosage and water matrix pbs is the main activator for paa in the process therefore it is reported that increasing concentrations of pbs ranging from 0 01 to 0 1 mm would considerably favor the process until a plateau is reached between 0 1 and 0 2 mm 64 on the one hand this plateau might be attributed to the pbs paa ratio however it must be considered that phosphate ions have been reported to be scavenging of the radicals involved in paa based processes 29 additionally the role of paa is consistent with the theory increasing paa favors the process until a plateau is reached due to activation limits and or its self scavenging effect as shown in eq 8 the process does not seem to be significantly affected by cl so4 2 or no3 but hco3 and nom seem to significantly reduce degradation 3 4 3 thermal activation of paa wang et al 62 proposed that paa can be thermally activated to generate oxidant radicals as shown in eq 18 decomposition of paa was effectively achieved and both acetoxyl and oh radicals as well as other reactive oxygen species ros were identified in the process the process achieved smx degradation of 86 with 0 2 mm of paa at 60 c and a neutral ph 62 moreover the effect of h2o2 on thermal decomposition was found to be negligible similar results were obtained by dai et al with 0 1 mm paa 63 18 c h 3 c o o 2 h c h 3 c o o oh dai et al 63 also evaluated microwave heating as an alternative to conventional heating for the activation of paa 94 degradation of smx was achieved in 30 min of reaction time with a rate constant of 0 107 min 1 0 39 times higher than that of conventional heating 0 077 min 1 the role of h2o2 was also negligible for this process and it achieved a similar effectivity to its homologue with pms this kind of process is an interesting alternative due to its simplicity and to the fact that it can achieve significant degradation of pollutants without the addition of activators moreover temperature can increase the dissolution of pollutants in water accelerate the reaction and shorten the reaction times however its main drawback is the high cost of elevating the temperature of the solution nevertheless this process could be studied for use in industrial wastewaters that are characterized by a high temperature or with other sources of temperature like residual heat from parallel industrial processes 3 5 challenges and perspectives of paa aops several strategies for the degradation of eps through the activation of paa were presented in this section these processes may generate several radicals including the widely studied oh and the organic ch3c o o and ch3c o oo all of which have been shown to contribute to the oxidation of eps while oh radicals have been characterized for a higher oxidation potential ch3c o o and ch3c o oo are more selective towards electron rich sites in the molecules making them more selective and resistant to the interference of coexistent inorganic ions like cl nevertheless there are still several practical challenges for the application of the different paa aops most studies dealing with paa aops are based on uv activation of paa the feasibility of uv based processes is highly dependent on water matrices for example waters with high turbidity tend to hinder the irradiation of paa additionally the cost of electrical energy in the process is highly dependent on the characteristics of the pollutants more resistant pollutants will require a longer irradiation time significantly increasing the costs of the processes most transition metal based activation studies have used co2 as an activator while co is of great interest because the co2 co3 redox cycle is efficient at neutral ph dissolved co is a secondary source of pollution and it has been reported that high concentrations of co may pose a risk for the environment and human health hence iron activation seems more environmentally friendly as iron is found naturally in the environment however iron based processes are ph dependent and imply additional costs and reagents for the control of ph furthermore heterogeneous catalysts lead to a potential leaching of the metals which must also be considered carbon based catalysts seem to be a promising and environmentally friendly alternative but haven t received as much attention several strategies have been proposed for the activation of other oxidants like ps and pms 65 testing these metal free catalysts seems like a good alternative for future research on paa aops as research on paa based aops is still at an early stage available information is limited more research about the degradation of eps with these processes is necessary especially since the effect of ch3c o o and ch3c o oo radicals is considerably variable due to their selectivity additionally more information is still needed about the degradation pathways and toxicity of tps of pollutants in paa based aops moreover direct comparison with h2o2 based processes is key to understanding the real advantages of these processes over the currently available ones yet only a few authors have conducted such comparison for some of the activation strategies the interaction of acetoxyl and hydroxyl radicals as well as the coexistence of different processes owing to the coexistence of paa and h2o2 generates complex reaction systems that need further study especially for the fe2 based processes moreover the role of the different commercial paa h2o2 ratios should also be considered the addition of paa to the systems leads to an increase in the organic contents of the effluent and metal catalysts are secondary sources of pollution some of which are known to represent risks for the environment and human health optimization needs to be conducted to introduce the least possible amount of these substances while achieving effective degradation also it is necessary to study ways to remove or recycle the remaining paa and metal ions from the treated effluent ionic exchange activated carbon adsorption and similar technologies could be ways to achieve this all the works discussed about paa based aops were carried out at laboratory scale using deionized water with controlled amounts of pollutants although some studies have measured the effect of some water matrix ions like carbonates phosphates nitrates sulfates and natural organic matter the degradation of pollutants in real waste and surface waters still needs to be studied before the processes can scale to real applications 4 conclusions this work presented an up to date review of on the degradation of eps by paa based aops the use of paa based aops was discussed as an effective technology for the degradation of eps paa is more thermodynamically unstable than the widely used h2o2 and more easily broken this opens the door to new activation strategies that are sometimes more efficient than those currently available the most widely studied reactions for the activation of paa are uv based technologies and homogeneous and heterogeneous transition metal activation other less studied strategies include thermal and microwave activation phosphate buffer activation and metal free catalysts the understanding of mechanisms of reaction influencing parameters and effectivity of paa based processes has greatly advanced during recent years however research on paa based aops is still on an early stage consequently many questions remain open and there is room for several further investigations based on the information presented in this work the following appear to be promising topics for research 1 further investigation of the paa activation strategies already studied for the degradation of different eps is required to test the effectivity of the process which might be variable due to the selectivity of the generated radicals 2 a better understanding of the degradation mechanisms and by product generation is necessary to determine the feasibility of the processes as effective water treatments this includes the interaction of the processes with real water matrices 3 direct comparison with previously studied oxidants like h2o2 and persulfates is necessary to better assess the advantages and disadvantages of paa based aops this includes comparisons of costs environmental friendliness toxicity and possibility of escalation 4 the development and further study of alternative methods for the activation of paa to reduce the costs of the process and reduce its environmental impact for example metal free catalysts seem to be a promising and relatively environmentally friendly strategy for the activation of paa solar irradiation can be used to reduce the costs of the uv based processes and residual heat from industries could be considered for thermal activation 5 statistical optimization of important process variables like ph paa catalyst doses and irradiation needs to be conducted to better understand their interactions maximize the efficiency of the processes reduce their costs and introduce the least possible amount of contaminating substances to the environment 6 research focused on the scalability of processes is necessary this includes the design of reactors study of the processes in real wastewaters and surface waters and the subsequent pilot scale studies the optimization of processes focused on their coupling with biological treatments is also a good alternative for their industrial implementation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
12836,an ever increasing number of anthropogenic pollutants referred to as emerging pollutants eps have been of concern in recent years these pollutants are known for the potential risk that they pose in the environment and have been consistently found in surface waste and potable waters moreover some of them are persistent to conventional treatments and in the environment advanced oxidation processes aops are widely used technology for the removal of eps the use of peracetic acid paa as an oxidant aop for the treatment of eps has attracted increasing interest owing to its ease of activation and to the selectivity of the organic radicals that are generated in these processes towards electron rich sites which makes them more robust against the effect of scavenging agents in real matrices this work presents a critical analysis of the advantages disadvantages and opportunities of paa based processes several strategies for paa activation were analyzed including uv and transition metal activation heterogeneous catalysis thermal and microwave activation and phosphate induced activation it was found that paa based aops seem to have several advantages over other widely studied processes some key perspectives for research include testing of these processes with a variety of eps analysis of transformation products and their toxicity in the treated effluents multivariate optimization of the process direct comparison with widely studied oxidants and experimentation for escalation and implementation nevertheless paa based aops seem to be a promising alternative to conventional aops keywords peracetic acid advanced oxidation process activation degradation emerging pollutants 1 introduction the growth of industry and the increasing population in urban and rural areas have created challenges in form of the removal of increasingly complex pollutants from water 1 4 advances in science lead to the constant manufacture of new pollutants as well as to a better understanding of the threats posed by them these new contaminants are referred to as emerging pollutants eps 5 they include various classes of products such as pharmaceuticals dyes endocrine disruptors nanomaterials flame retardants artificial sweeteners and ingredients of personal care products 3 6 eps are toxic compounds that vary in chemical structures and are known to be persistent and toxic in the environment 5 7 while some eps are known to be naturally found in the environment most have been introduced through human activity ranging in concentration from a few ng l in clean surface waters to hundreds of μg l in polluted waters 1 8 moreover it has been reported that conventional water treatments are failing to remove or degrade many eps probably because they are highly stable and very resistant to biodegradation rendering many conventional physicochemical and biological wastewater treatment processes ineffective 9 10 in consequence the removal of eps from wastewater treatment plants has been considered a challenge fortunately growing public health and environmental concerns have led to efforts to develop new technologies for the treatment of ep containing wastewater one such technology is advanced oxidation processes aops which have gained growing acceptance for their effectivity in the removal of several eps 11 13 aops traditionally comprise several methods for the in situ generation of highly reactive radical species such as hydroxyl radical oh sulfate radical so4 and other reactive oxygen species hydroxyl radical based processes are one of the most studied aops these have proved to be significantly effective reactive and nonselective with electrophilic behavior and a redox potential of 2 8 v these radicals can rapidly oxidate and degrade a wide spectrum of pollutants in wastewater 14 principally by abstracting h from c h n h or o h bonds adding to cc bonds or adding to aromatic rings see eqs 1 3 15 one of the advantages of aops is that these reactions with oh can destroy molecules and in some cases mineralize them into co2 h2o and inorganic salts 14 see eq 4 1 oh r h h 2 o r 2 oh c c oh c c 3 oh r r oh 4 organic species oh c o 2 h 2 o inorganic ions nevertheless the major drawback of current aops is that they are costly as expensive chemicals are used as reagents high energy consumption is required in order for the oxidation system to be used and these processes are sensitive to the effect of the water matrix 11 13 moreover some processes lead to the generation of new pollutants some of which are more toxic than their parent compounds 13 in consequence research into better more effective strategies for treatment of ep polluted water is still ongoing to address the issue of scavenging pollutants in the water matrix it has been suggested that aops should be made more selective for the specific target pollutants however as mentioned before low selectivity is one of the characteristics of oh radicals 14 in consequence some more recent studies have reported the activation of peracids both inorganic such as peroxymonosulfate and peroxydisulfate 16 17 and organic such as peracetic acid paa 17 18 this study focuses on aops based on the activation of peracetic acid although paa based aops have been previously discussed in reviews by ao et al 18 and kiejza et al 17 new information of significant importance has been published regarding the reaction mechanisms radicals mediating the reaction and new technologies for the paa activation hence this review aims to provide updated information on paa based activation methods for the degradation of eps 2 peracetic acid basic information peracetic acid paa pka equal to 8 2 is an organic peroxyacid that has been widely employed as a disinfectant sanitizer sterilizing agent oxidizer and polymerization catalyst it has been of interest as an alternative disinfection product to chlorine due to the reduced formation of disinfection by products in paa based processes 19 its wide spectrum of microbial activity and its economic feasibility 20 paa is a highly water soluble colorless substance with a strong pungent acrid odor like that of vinegar 17 18 which is synthesized by the reaction of acetic acid with hydrogen peroxide h2o2 in the presence of a catalyst such as sulfuric acid 21 it is often sold as a mixture containing paa acetic acid h2o2 and water 22 commercial paa solutions are often below 15 paa solutions exceeding this concentration are unstable and show some degree of explosiveness paa is inactive with glassware and most plastic packaging however it can degrade vinyls and natural or synthetic rubbers metal containers like pure aluminum stainless steel and tin plated iron can resist paa but brass copper steel and bronze are susceptible to corrosion when exposed to paa 23 paa in solution is consumed by spontaneous decomposition or hydrolysis spontaneous decomposition occurs at ph between 5 5 and 10 2 and is fastest near ph 8 2 the paa pka in this mechanism the paa anions paa may attack the paa neutral molecules paa0 forming an active intermediate that further decomposes to acetic anions o2 and h on the other hand the mechanism of hydrolysis consists of the protonation of the carbonyl group and the formation of a carbocation that is further attacked by water forming h2o2 and acetic acid the hydrolysis mechanism seems to be negligible at ph below 8 2 and its rate constant increases at higher ph values 24 25 the cost of paa was reported to be 1100 1200 ton in 2015 by luukkonen et al and a disinfection cost of 0 0261 m3 for a 3 mg l dose 26 nowadays there are several commercial paa solutions with different concentrations of h2o2 and paa wt six of which have been approved by the us environmental protection agency for wastewater disinfection proxitane ww 12 peraclean 15 vigorox wwt ii sanidate 15 peragreen ww and peragreen 22ww 24 the global peracetic acid market is forecast to grow from usd 813 million in 2020 to usd 1685 million by 2030 at a cagr of 7 6 27 moreover previous works have reported that the cost of these products has been decreasing probably due to the increase production and expansion of its applications 17 18 thus seeming like an economically promising oxidant for water treatment 3 paa based aops in addition to its industrial uses paa has the potential to degrade aqueous organic micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals due to its high oxidation potential which ranges from 1 06 at alkaline conditions to 1 96 v at acidic conditions 17 18 however its rate of homolytic cleavage k 6 10 12 s 1 is too low for it to be used as oxidant in technological applications meaning that activators are needed for the efficient generation of strong oxidants 17 in aops paa has been of interest as an oxidant agent that is activated to generate peroxyl radicals ch3c o o and ch3c o oo by the activation of the paa molecules and oh radicals by the activation of either paa molecules or coexisting h2o2 the generation of free radicals in paa based aops was first reported caretti and lubello who used an uv paa process in a wastewater disinfection pilot plant 28 however it was only until recently that paa based aops gained attention as means to degrade eps as shown in fig 2 when compared to h2o2 which is the reference oxidant in aops paa is characterized by the lower energy in its o o bond 38 kcal mol 1 vs 51 kcal mol 1 meaning that it is thermodynamically unstable and more easily broken 25 additionally the ease of activation of paa is indicated by its lower unoccupied molecular orbital lumo energy 0 25 ev which suggests that paa can more easily accept electrons than h2o2 lumo energy 0 57 ev consequently higher reaction rates have been reported for the paa reaction 29 30 for this reason paa based aops seem to be a potential improvement on conventional aops based on hydrogen peroxide and research into this kind of processes has received growing attention over the last three years fig 1 several strategies have been proposed for the o o bond cleavage in paa which leads to the generation of peroxyl radicals ch3c o o and ch3c o oo and oh radicals these technologies include uv light irradiation uv paa 29 31 33 transition metal ions mn paa including cobalt 34 35 iron 30 36 manganese 37 ruthenium 38 molybdenum 39 40 and silver 41 and other methods that are shown in fig 2 in the following sections we discuss the current works using these methods their mechanisms and the role of the important process variables on their performance 3 1 activation by uv irradiation perhaps the most studied activator for paa is uv irradiation uv radiation leads to the homolytic cleavage of the o o bond in paa generating acetoxyl and hydroxyl radicals eq 5 29 33 42 44 additionally some amounts of h2o2 are always present in paa solutions so it coexists with the uv h2o2 aop eq 6 29 42 zhang and huang 42 modeled the kinetics of the uv paa process reporting several reaction pathways that can occur during radical generation and their subsequent interactions it was found that oh ch3c o o and oh and ch3c o oo were the major species participating in the reaction the same authors also determined the quantum yield for paa decomposition at uv254 φ 0 88 0 04 mol ein 1 42 it should be noted that this is higher than that of h2o2 φ 0 5 mol ein 1 indicating a faster reaction rate with a similar amount of absorbed light 5 c h 3 c o o 2 h uv c h 3 c o o oh ε 8 m 1 cm 1 φ 0 88 0 04 mol ein 1 6 h 2 o 2 uv 2 oh ε 18 7 m 1 cm 1 φ 0 5 mol ein 1 subsequently some limiting reactions that remove radicals of interest from the solution while producing less reactive ones can be triggered by oh and ch3c o o radicals 1 oh can further react with paa to generate acetyl peroxyl radicals ch3c o oo and h2o eq 7 2 ch3c o o can react with paa to form ch3c o oo and acetic acid eq 8 and 3 ch3c o o may undergo radical radical coupling eq 9 33 42 additionally acetoxyl radicals can decarboxylate yielding methyl radicals ch3 and carbon dioxide co2 eq 10 furthermore the ch3c o oo formed in eq 8 can react with itself to regenerate ch3c o o radicals eq 11 18 42 several other subsequent reactions may happen in the process which are presented in the article by zhang and huang 42 7 c h 3 c o o 2 h oh c h 3 c o oo h 2 o k 1 3 0 2 10 9 8 ch 3 c o o 2 h c h 3 c o o c h 3 c o oo

publications have focused on the degradation of persistent organic pollutants by uv paa these are presented in table 1 overall uv paa seems like a promising alternative for the degradation of eps sharma et al reported a degradation between 80 and 100 for various chlorophenols their results show that the number and position of chlorine atoms in the aromatic ring structure significantly influences degradation 45 the effectivity of the uv paa process was also reported by cai et al 29 who studied the effect of the process on the degradation of some pharmaceutical compounds they showed that while little degradation was obtained by oxidation with paa alone all pharmaceuticals were degraded by 93 5 under uv paa with 1 mg l of paa at ph 7 1 29 they also conducted scavenging tests to determine the reactive species that led to such degradation they reported that the degradation was caused mainly by oh oxidation followed by oxidation by other radicals which were mostly organic radicals and direct photolysis which is consistent with the results obtained by zhang and huang 42 moreover organic radicals showed higher selectivity reacting quickly with naproxen nap but not with carbamazepine cbz and ibuprofen ibp which indicates the higher affinity of these radicals for specific pollutants similar behavior was obtained by rizzo et al 46 for the degradation of chloramphenicol but with lower degradation rates this seems to be attributable to the experimental conditions especially the paa contaminant ratio which is much higher in the experiments by the former hollman et al also studied the uv paa process for the treatment of pharmaceuticals obtaining results that were consistent with the findings of cai et al 29 33 however a lower amount of reaction intermediates was found by hollman for a common pollutant cbz which seems to be related to the use of a higher dose of paa which led to significantly higher pollutant degradation other studies that show the effectivity of paa in degrading eps include the degradation of steroid estrogens by hu et al 48 and the degradation of the cyanotoxins microcystin lr and rr by almuhataram et al 49 several process variables have been found to influence the performance of the uv paa process these include ph paa dosage and water matrix operational parameters as this is a radiation activated process exposure to uv 254 nm has a major synergistic effect in the process as has been demonstrated by several authors 29 42 43 zhang et al measured a quantum yield of 0 88 0 04 mol ein 1 which indicates that the production of radicals in the solution is limited by the absorption of photons in the system 43 however to the best of our knowledge there are no works that study the effect of reactor configurations in the uv paa process 3 1 1 effect of ph in the uv paa process ph influences the paa acid base equilibrium and consequently the generation of the reactive radical species as the pk value of paa is 8 2 its deprotonated form paa is more dominant above ph 8 2 while its protonated form paa0 is more prominent below this ph paa is characterized by a higher molar absorption coefficient than paa0 at 254 nm which suggests that the photolysis of paa and the generation of radicals are faster at alkaline ph however the increase in ph may also have a negative effect on the efficiency of uv paa because the radicals show a decreased redox potential at this ph and the oh ions could act as scavengers 29 43 this is shown by the results of cai et al who reported that there were no significant differences between ph 5 and ph 7 1 but observed a decrease at ph 9 65 29 and zhang et al who reported an optimal ph of 8 5 43 therefore near neutral conditions seem to be ideal for the uv paa process since more basic conditions have been shown to reduce the process efficiency and acidic conditions would increase the cost apparently without any significant effect 3 1 2 effect of the paa initial concentration in the uv paa process in paa based aops reactive radicals are mainly produced by the activation of a paa h2o2 mixture in consequence it is logical to suppose that the concentration of paa is a significant factor affecting the efficiency process it has been reported that an increase in paa generally leads to a higher degradation but a plateau is eventually reached where further degradation is not achieved this was evidenced in the work of rizzo et al 46 where the pseudo first order reaction rate increased from 9 3 10 3 to 36 4 10 3 min 1 with an increase in initial paa from 5 to 50 mg l for the degradation of chloramphenicol 46 and that of hollman et al who found that the pseudo first order reaction rate can be approximated as a linear function of the paa dose 33 zhang et al 2020 43 found similar results for the degradation of diclofenac dcf the pseudo first order reaction rate increased from 0 0967 to 0 182 min 1 with increasing paa concentration from 10 to 150 μm however they also reported that at higher concentrations the increase was less significant and could eventually reach a plateau which is probably due to the scavenging effect of paa on the radicals eqs 13 14 moreover it is also possible that more paa absorbed more photons inhibiting the effect of direct photolysis in the pollutant 3 1 3 effect of the water matrix the selectivity of ch3c o o is one of the main advantages of paa based aops for this reason several authors have evaluated the effect of the matrix conditions in the uv paa process commonly identified water matrix scavengers for aops include carbonates co3 2 and hco3 chloride ions cl sulfate ions so4 2 nitrate ions no3 and dissolved organic matter dom although these ions may reduce the efficiency of aops in general the literature shows that most of these ions have effects on the uv paa process that are lower or even non significant except in the case of dom for example chen et al 44 reported that a dose of 20 mm of carbonates co3 2 and hco3 reduced the reaction rate kobs in the uv h2o2 from 0 106 to 0 062 min 1 while the uv paa showed no significant change kobs 0 112 0 117 this is probably due to a higher selectivity of the acetoxyl radicals towards nap over carbonates while cl did not seem to have a significant effect on the efficiency of the uv paa process it did decrease the reaction rate when in the presence of a oh scavenger suggesting that cl might scavenge the acetoxyl radicals nevertheless this may be an indicator that the coexistence of radicals in the process could increase the robustness of the process finally the authors also reported that 0 5 mg l of humic acids ha reduced the reaction rate in the uv paa from 0 12 to 0 066 min 1 and a similar effect was observed for uv h2o2 which is probably due to the likelihood of ha being attacked by both acetoxyl and oh radicals 44 similar results were found by zhang et al 2020 43 for the degradation of dcf in which cl so4 2 no3 and co3 2 did not show any significant effect on the process however dissolved organic matter dom negatively affected the efficiency of the process 5 mg l of fulvic acid decreased the 15 min dcf degradation by around 15 there are two possible explanations for this firstly dom is known to be a scavenger for oh radicals competing with the target pollutants and secondly dom can absorb radiation and compete with paa reducing the generation of radicals 42 3 2 activation of paa by metal catalysts transition metals have been commonly used as catalysts in the activation of oxidants to generate radical species some recent works have studied transition metals including iron cobalt and manganese for the activation of paa in aops 34 50 51 a summary of the recent works is presented in table 2 although most of these studies have dealt with dissolved metal catalysts there are also some studies using heterogeneous metal catalysts like zero valent metals and metal oxides which may reduce reagent costs and secondary pollution due to metal cations 39 52 55 in general it has been reported that activation of paa with transition metal catalysts metal paa is in essence like the classic fenton process namely a transition metal catalyst is oxidized to break the o o bond and activate paa eqs 12 13 50 the activation of paa by metal catalysts leads to the generation of ch3c o o and ch3c o oo as is shown in fig 3a also just as in the uv paa process the presence of h2o2 in the solution may also have an important role in the oxidation process for example when using fe2 as the metal catalyst a simultaneous fenton process may occur in the system leading to the generation of oh radicals 30 50 which seems to increase the effectivity and robustness of the process but also makes it more complex due to the interactions between the different radicals 12 c h 3 c o o 2 h m n m n 1 c h 3 c o o oh 13 m n 1 c h 3 c o o 2 h m n c h 3 c o oo h 3 2 1 cobalt paa according to previous studies cobalt co has a higher catalytic performance for paa activation than other metals like manganese mn iron fe and copper cu the process follows the model provided in eqs 12 13 and it is noteworthy that to the best of our knowledge there are no reports of oh formation in the decomposition of paa with co2 35 51 which is a key difference with other processes as is shown in fig 3b kim et al reported that the second order rate constants for paa activation with co2 range between 1 7 101 and 1 33 102 m 1 s 1 at ph 3 and 8 2 respectively and between 3 91 and 5 57 102 for co3 which leads to the conclusion that the process is better at neutral ph and that co can efficiently cycle through the reactions in eqs 12 and 13 34 35 the efficiency of the co2 paa process has been evaluated by various authors for different pollutants wang et al 34 evaluated the process for the degradation of sulfamethoxazole smx reaching around 90 smx degradation in 15 min in this process the use of scavengers led to the conclusion that organic radicals ch3c o o and ch3c o oo are the main contributors to degradation which is consistent with theory 34 also kim et al 35 evaluated the same process for cbz smx nap and bisphenol a bpa achieving degradations between 88 and 100 at neutral ph almost complete degradation was achieved for all of the pollutants in 5 min however cbz seemed to be more resistant to the process only 80 degradation being achieved for this pollutant in 30 min 35 a more recent study by liu et al 51 found that the co2 paa process at acidic conditions may lead to the generation of co4 species that may also participate in the degradation of organic pollutants however neutral ph seems to favor the generation of oxygen centered radicals like the ch3c o o and ch3c o oo while the role of co4 species is narrowed the proposed mechanism for co4 species generation is presented in eqs 14 and 15 the role of these species has been often overlooked as one of the advantages of co2 paa is that it may work at neutral conditions unlike other metal paa processes nevertheless it seems worthy of attention as some pollutants like cbz seem to be more reactive to co4 than oxygen centered radicals 51 14 c o 2 c h 3 c o ooh c o 2 c h 3 c o ooh complex 15 c o 2 c h 3 c o ooh comple x c o 4 c h 3 c o o h on the other hand heterogeneous co based catalysts have also been considered for paa activation wu et al 54 experimented with co3o4 for the degradation of orange g og complete degradation of og was reached after 90 min of reaction and organic radicals were identified as the main oxidant species additionally low cobalt leaching was observed during the reaction contributing to the reusability of the catalyst and lowering the secondary source of contamination 54 the same authors also conducted experiments on several other pollutants finding that cephalexin cfx and ampicillin are very easily degraded by co3o4 paa but nitrobenzene nb benzoic acid ba smx cbz and dcf are more resistant and even recalcitrant to the process although co seems to be a promising alternative for eps due to its efficiency for paa activation it must be considered that co is characterized by its potential risk to human health and is a secondary source of pollution to the environment in consequence processes involving homogeneous co must be handled carefully in order to neutralize cobalt before discharge and heterogeneous processes must take into account the potential leaching of co to the sample which limits its application 54 3 2 2 iron paa the use of iron based catalysts has been widely studied for water treatment due to their low cost high efficiency and environmental friendliness fe2 is used as the catalyst in the fenton process therefore it is the one of the most used iron catalysts and has been widely investigated 17 18 fe2 activation of paa seems to behave in a similar way to co2 activation although the main difference between these processes is the generation of oh radicals 30 as shown in fig 3c these are generated in 2 ways 1 fe2 can activate the h2o2 that exists in equilibrium with paa generating a fenton reaction that occurs simultaneously to the fe paa activation 2 kim et al proposed that in addition to eqs 12 and 13 oh radicals may also be generated in the activation of paa eq 16 30 16 c h 3 c o o 2 h m n m n 1 c h 3 c o o oh another important difference between fe2 and co2 mediated processes is the necessity to work at acidic conditions in order to maintain the speciation of fe2 and prevent the precipitation of iron that happens at higher ph kim et al reported that the second order reaction rate varied between 1 10 105 and 1 56 104 m 1 s 1 at ph between 3 and 7 1 30 this is probably due to the precipitation of iron at neutral to basic conditions it is noteworthy that the reported reaction rate of the fe2 paa process is much higher than that of the fenton 63 76 m 1s 1 and co2 paa 1 33 102 m 1 s 1 process some authors have successfully employed the fe2 paa process for the degradation of eps kim et al 30 studied the degradation of methylene blue nap and bpa achieving 90 degradation for all pollutants at ph 3 however degradation significantly decreased at higher ph values additionally the authors found that paa activation is 650 times faster than that of h2o2 which suggests that it can easily outperform coexistent h2o2 in the process consistently the authors found 2 distinct kinetic stages in the process the first consisting of rapid degradation attributed to the fe2 paa and the second of slower degradation attributed to fe2 h2o2 30 moreover thayrine et al 36 evaluated the fe2 paa process against its fe3 counterpart at acidic conditions ph 3 unlike the reaction with h2o2 it seems that paa may be activated effectively with fe3 ions a mb degradation of 99 was achieved with 50 μm of fe3 while 95 was achieved with the same amount of fe2 and a dose of 52 μm paa theoretical calculations suggest that this behavior is because the reactions between paa and fe3 are spontaneous and produce in turn fe2 while those with fe2 are non spontaneous 36 nevertheless it must be noted that the paa h2o2 ratio in the paa solution that was used was 0 65 which is considerably lower than in other works therefore the role of fe3 ions for the activation of paa mixtures containing a higher ratio should be studied some works have also studied iron heterogeneous catalysis for example wang et al achieved complete removal of smx with a fe2 modified zeolite paa at neutral ph and in 60 min of reaction time 50 additionally wang et al studied the combined metal catalyst cofe2o4 achieving degradations of around 75 in 30 min also at neutral ph 52 moreover zhang et al 56 studied the activation of paa with nano zero valent iron fe0 achieving tetracycline tc degradations of 95 in 30 min compared to h2o2 activation which yielded 15 degradation paa activation was considerably more efficient probably due to the ease of activation of paa 56 overall despite the ph dependence of the fe2 paa processes their low cost high efficiency and reaction rate and environmental friendliness suggest that iron is a good alternative for the activation of paa however further research is required to better understand the mechanisms and widen the ph window in which it can work the role of fe3 is of special interest since ferric salts seem to be an effective activator for paa and are cheaper than ferrous salts 3 2 3 effect of ph in the metal paa process ph influences the speciation of both metal ions and paa as mentioned before the speciation of paa pka 8 2 may affect the reaction rate because the paa0 that predominates at acid to neutral ph is more oxidant than paa which predominates at basic ph additionally paa0 is more likely to accept electrons than its deprotonated form and the reactions between the transition metals and paa eqs 12 13 are based on the electron exchange between them this is consistent with the results by kim et al who reported that the maximum oxidation rate was achieved at near neutral ph for the co2 paa process 35 on the other hand the results of liu et al 51 suggest that ph may be determinant in the reaction mechanisms of the co2 paa process while acidic conditions seem to favor the formation of co4 species that may act as oxidants the widely used neutral conditions seem to favor the formation of ch3c o o and ch3c o oo 51 the evidence seems to suggest that some pollutants like cbz may be more easily oxidized by the former therefore further studies with different pollutants are necessary fe2 speciation also has a major effect on the performance of the fe2 paa process as with the fenton process this process seems to be optimal at a ph around 3 30 36 this is especially so during the second kinetic stage described by kim et al 35 which is attributed to a fenton process at higher ph fe3 is known for the generation of precipitative hydroxide complexes that significantly decrease the activity of the fe2 paa and fenton reaction 30 3 2 4 effect of the paa initial concentration in the metal paa processes similarly to the uv paa process paa activation is probably the main source of reactive radicals in the process making it one of the significant factors limiting the reaction most works dealing with metal paa processes have shown this behavior for example kim et al reported that the degradation efficiency for cbz in a co2 paa process increased from 24 to 92 by increasing the initial concentration of paa from 20 to 200 μm in 30 min of reaction time 35 observing a similar behavior for smx kim et al 30 also studied the effect of initial paa concentration on mb degradation finding that this increased from 69 7 to 100 in 60 min when the paa concentration was increased from 50 to 500 μm however they also pointed out that 1000 μm considerably inhibited the reaction this is probably because the effect of paa is limited by paa fe2 ratio they reported that 1 1 was optimal for the degradation of mb 30 excess paa might compete for radicals with the pollutants producing less reactive oxidant species and limiting the reaction this is coherent with the results reported by wang et al 50 but ultimately the optimal paa dose depends on the characteristics of the pollutant and its concentration additionally one of the drawbacks of any paa process is that because paa is an organic substance the addition of paa leads to an increase in the total organic carbon toc in the solution in consequence it is logical to suppose that excess paa contributes to this drawback while also implying a cost increase in the process this makes it necessary to carefully optimize the paa dose in the processes 3 2 5 effect of the catalyst dosage in the metal paa as mentioned before the paa metal ratio is a key parameter in metal paa processes in general it has been reported that the decomposition of paa in co2 paa reaction increases with higher dosages of co2 this was shown by wang et al 34 where the degradation of smx increased from 61 2 to nearly 100 after reaction for 15 min as the initial co concentration grew from 0 2 to 3 2 μm owing to the fast reduction of co3 to co2 the redox cycle of co2 and co3 is expected to be efficient and to keep the reaction going and an increased amount of metal ions has shown to increase the reaction rate significantly 34 also kim et al 35 reported a similar effect for the degradation of cbz degradation increased from 30 5 to 97 7 after 30 min when co2 concentration was increased from 1 to 100 μm however the addition of excess co2 resulted in a decrease in the efficiency probably due to the radical scavenging by excess metal ions 35 kim et al 30 observed a similar behavior in the fe2 paa process reporting that the optimum fe paa ratio was 1 1 and that excess fe2 ions caused a significant reduction in the process efficiency at a fixed dose of 50 μm of paa increasing fe2 from 20 to 50 μm led to an increase from 63 1 to 75 but further increases to 100 and 500 μm led to significant reductions of up to 46 in efficiency additionally when using 1000 μm of both reagents complete degradation was achieved almost instantly 30 in general it should be considered that metal ions especially cobalt are a secondary source of pollution and excess dosages should be avoided 3 2 6 effect of the water matrix few studies have analyzed the effect of the water matrix on metal paa processes it is expected that the variety and selectivity of radicals in these processes make them less likely to be affected by scavengers in real matrices kim et al 35 showed that the addition of cl 100 1000 μm had little impact on cbz degradation by co2 paa but the addition of carbonates hco3 or phosphates po4 3 in the same range significantly reduced degradation at 30 min by up to 45 6 and 60 7 respectively ha 1 10 mg l also reduced degradation by up to 69 however cai et al and chen et al concluded that carbonates did not scavenge ch3c o oo radicals in the uv paa process 29 44 in consequence the inhibition in degradation for the co paa seems to be attributable to the formation of non reactive hco3 co2 complexes 18 35 moreover kim et al reported a similar effect for the fe2 paa process specifically in the second kinetic phase where the addition of 0 5 mm of total carbonate resulted in reductions of 33 and 26 for nap and bpa degradation respectively which is expected since this phase is attributed to a fenton reaction 30 overall it seems that the efficiency of metal paa processes can be reduced by some of the widely known oh radical scavengers like carbonates phosphates and natural organic matter nom however there is also evidence that acetoxyl radicals are not significantly scavenged by such substances 29 44 this suggests that the mechanisms involved in the efficiency reduction are related to the interaction with the catalysts or the scavenging of the coexistent oh in the case of cl which is known to be an oh radical scavenger it is reported that the co paa process is not significantly affected however to the best of our knowledge there is no evidence regarding its interaction with fe paa considering that the generation of oh radicals is involved in the process it is likely that the process would be inhibited especially during the second kinetic phase this suggests that although metal paa processes may negatively interact with scavengers in real matrices they also seem to be more robust than conventional oh based processes making them interesting alternatives that require further study 3 2 7 other transition metals used for paa activation although cobalt and iron are the most widely used transition metals for paa activation other metals including molybdenum mo 39 40 ruthenium ru 38 and copper cu 53 have also been studied wang et al 39 used molybdenum disulfide mos2 as a heterogeneous activator for paa in the degradation of smx sulfaguanidine sg sulfamonomethoxine smm and sulfamerazine smz obtaining degradations of 76 60 92 and 92 respectively with 0 3 mm paa 0 3 g l mos2 and ph 3 in 15 min of reaction time moreover it was found that 98 4 of mos2 remained in its crystalline structure and only 1 6 leached to the solution indicating that the process generates a low level of metal pollution however the recovered mos2 suffered a considerable loss in effectivity after second and third degradation runs 39 moreover wang et al 40 used mos2 as a co catalyst in the fe3 paa activation in the degradation of smx which was reduced by 96 in 10 min of reaction time with 0 3 mm paa 0 1 g l mos2 and 0 1 mm fe3 this enhancement is attributed to the generation of fe2 in the reaction between mos2 and fe3 40 there have been reports of paa activation with fe3 that may also produce fe2 ions 36 however the degradation in the paa fe3 test performed by the authors showed negligible degradation and fe2 generation mos2 is characterized by its low toxicity and biocompatibility in this sense it appears to be an environmentally friendly and effective alternative for paa activation nevertheless the low reusability of the crystalline mos2 suggests that the costs of this reagent and its removal from water should be further assessed before its application and escalation ruthenium ions have also performed effectively in paa activation li et al 38 completely degraded 10 μm of smx using 100 μm ru3 200 μm paa and 10 mm phosphate buffer to maintain the ph at 7 in 4 min in this study ru3 was more effective than co2 fe2 and others the lower efficiency of fe2 can be attributed to the effect of ph 38 however it is especially interesting that ru3 showed a higher performance than co2 one possible explanation for this is the formation of co complexes with phosphate 35 the authors also studied the effect of phosphate ions on the process showing that an increase in these enhances the reaction however the effect seems to be mainly attributable to the ru3 and paa concentrations the ru3 paa process is an effective alternative for the treatment of eps however the effect of water matrices needs to be further studied and the cost and toxicity of ru3 needs to be assessed moreover the development of new ru based catalysts is another perspective for future research a study by zhang et al 53 used zero valent copper zvc for the activation of paa achieving complete degradation of 1 μm dcf in 40 min of reaction time with 100 μm paa 0 5 g l zvc and a ph of 3 interestingly degradation with 9 4 mg l cu2 ions and similar conditions was only 10 and with zvc h2o2 it was 40 degradation would appear to be attributable to the cu ions on the surface of zvc which is related to the need for acidic conditions as h enhances the generation of cu ions moreover matrix ions like so4 2 no3 and co3 2 do not seem to affect the reaction while cl seems to increase the reaction rate probably due to the generation of cl radical species on the other hand zvc seems to be reusable as degradation only decreased from 95 to 87 after 3 times of recycling 53 the effectivity of reusability of zvc suggests that this could be a cost effective process for the removal of eps like dcf nevertheless the toxicity of copper needs to be considered consequently it is necessary to conduct studies on the leaching of copper in zvc paa activation as mentioned before co and fe oxides have also been effectively used as heterogeneous activators for paa wang et al 52 effectively used cobalt ferrite cofe2o4 for the activation of paa this activator was found to be considerably more effective for the degradation of 10 μm smx than co oxides like co3o4 and co2o3 and fe oxides like fe2o3 the process conditions were 0 1 g l of the activators 100 μm paa and ph of 7 achieving a degradation of 75 with cofe2o4 in 30 min while the other studied activators achieved degradations below 24 moreover cofe2o4 proved to be highly recyclable as the authors obtained stable degradation in 4 tests reusing cofe2o4 moreover cofe2o4 can be easily separated from the solution due to its magnetic properties similar results were obtained by zhou et al for other pollutants including smx tcs aniline 2 clorophenol and bpa 57 however the authors confirmed the leaching of co ions in the process the cofe2o4 paa process appears to have several practical applications that make it interesting for further research however its main drawback seems to be contamination due to co ions furthermore different manganese salts mn2 were tested by rothbart et al 37 for the degradation of the orange ii dye catalytic degradation was tested at ph 9 5 and 25 c it was found that the non catalyzed reaction was 500 times slower than the one in the presence of mn2 kobs 1 28 10 4 and 6 05 10 2 s 1 respectively moreover paa activation was much higher than that of h2o2 with mn2 kobs 7 92 10 4 s 1 additionally the participation of free radicals was shown through scavenging experiments 37 3 3 synergistic fe2 uv paa process although uv paa and fe2 paa seem to be effective for the degradation of several pollutants some compounds depending on their characteristics may be more resistant or even recalcitrant to the processes thus requiring longer reaction times examples of this were cbz and ibp in the uv paa treatment by cai et al 29 nap and bpa in the fe2 paa treatment by kim et al 54 in consequence some recent works have explored the synergistic effect of uv and fe2 for the activation of paa 58 60 wang et al 60 studied the uv fe2 paa process for the degradation of triclosan tcs as a means to accelerate the reaction through the synergistic effect of uv and fe2 95 degradation was achieved with fe2 paa in 20 min of reaction at ph 3 5 while complete degradation was achieved with uv fe2 paa more importantly the degradation rate constant was higher 0 59 min 1 in the uv fe2 paa than in the fe2 paa 0 46 min 1 60 in the same study the authors concluded that oh radicals were the main oxidating species but ch3c o o and ch3c o oo were also responsible for part of the degradation another important observation from this process was the effect of inorganic ions cl showed no inhibition effect on the tcs degradation a possible explanation might be that the formed cl radicals might react with tcs 60 or that the oxidation by ch3c o o and ch3c o oo is not significantly affected by the presence of cl 29 44 the presence of no3 ions resulted in the enhancement of the removal from 88 to 97 in the first 3 min of reaction with the addition of 10 mm of no3 this is explained by the photolysis of no3 which may generate oh radicals and reactive nitrogen species that might enhance the reaction 60 the uv fe2 paa was also studied by chen et al 58 who added edds as a chelating agent to prevent fe2 from precipitating at neutral ph the fe2 edds uv paa process was used to degrade nap achieving around 80 degradation in 5 min of reaction with nap 10 μm paa 100 μm fe2 12 5 μm and edds 25 μm meanwhile the fe2 paa achieved 20 degradation and uv paa achieved around 40 showing that the reaction rate can be significantly increased by the combination of both processes 58 the effect of the matrix was consistent with the results of wang et al 60 the uv fe2 paa process was also evaluated by ghanbari et al 59 for the degradation of acetaminophen act in this case the uv radiation was provided by uvc led paa uvc led fe2 showed high efficiency 95 for act removal in 30 min at ph 5 paa 4 mm and fe2 0 5 mm furthermore the paa uvc led and paa fe2 systems removed 53 4 and 42 2 of act from solution respectively this indicates that there was a synergistic effect in the process interestingly the ph showed no significant difference between 3 and 5 in this process 59 3 4 other paa activation methods the rising interest in paa based aops has led to the publication of various studies dealing with paa activation strategies for the treatment of various eps so far most of the research has focused on uv paa activation and more recently metal catalyzed activation has also been on the rise however uv irradiation has limited penetration into water and is unavailable on the subsurface while excessive transition metal ions such as cobalt affect water quality and may be toxic and or carcinogenic consequently research on alternative activation methods has also been on the rise therefore methods like phosphate buffer activation thermal activation microwave activation and activation using carbonaceous materials which are enhanced due to the ease of activation for paa have received recent attention table 3 presents a summary of works dealing with such methods 3 4 1 carbon based catalysts for the activation of paa as an alternative to metal catalysts zhou et al 61 proposed the use of activated carbon fibers acf for the catalytic activation of paa they achieved 97 removal of reactive brilliant red x 3b at neutral ph with paa 5 mm and 2 g l of acf control runs suggested that paa can effectively be activated by acf only 47 degradation was achieved with acf alone which is attributable to adsorption on the acf and it only increased to 54 with and the addition of h2o2 in the same amount showing that h2o2 is poorly activated by this method 61 the main advantages of this process are that no secondary pollution is generated by the acfs they can be reused and the process can work over a wide ph range 3 4 2 phosphate buffer activation it has been reported that peroxides with asymmetric structures like peroxymonosulfate pms and paa can be activated by nucleophilic attacks with phosphate buffer solutions pbs generating radicals consequently deng et al 64 proposed activation with phosphate anions which is shown in eq 17 96 dcf degradation was achieved in 45 min using a 0 1 m pbs solution and 0 55 mm paa at ph 7 4 and room temperature 25 c moreover it was found that the effect of h2o2 activation in the system is negligible the role of ph seems to be critical for the process since deprotonated phosphate seems to be more favorable for the activation of paa therefore ph 7 2 would favor the reaction moreover ph above the paa pka 8 2 seems to favor its self decomposition which might result in a decrease in degradation 64 17 c h 3 c o o 2 h pbs c h 3 c o o oh other factors influencing the performance of the process include pbs concentration paa dosage and water matrix pbs is the main activator for paa in the process therefore it is reported that increasing concentrations of pbs ranging from 0 01 to 0 1 mm would considerably favor the process until a plateau is reached between 0 1 and 0 2 mm 64 on the one hand this plateau might be attributed to the pbs paa ratio however it must be considered that phosphate ions have been reported to be scavenging of the radicals involved in paa based processes 29 additionally the role of paa is consistent with the theory increasing paa favors the process until a plateau is reached due to activation limits and or its self scavenging effect as shown in eq 8 the process does not seem to be significantly affected by cl so4 2 or no3 but hco3 and nom seem to significantly reduce degradation 3 4 3 thermal activation of paa wang et al 62 proposed that paa can be thermally activated to generate oxidant radicals as shown in eq 18 decomposition of paa was effectively achieved and both acetoxyl and oh radicals as well as other reactive oxygen species ros were identified in the process the process achieved smx degradation of 86 with 0 2 mm of paa at 60 c and a neutral ph 62 moreover the effect of h2o2 on thermal decomposition was found to be negligible similar results were obtained by dai et al with 0 1 mm paa 63 18 c h 3 c o o 2 h c h 3 c o o oh dai et al 63 also evaluated microwave heating as an alternative to conventional heating for the activation of paa 94 degradation of smx was achieved in 30 min of reaction time with a rate constant of 0 107 min 1 0 39 times higher than that of conventional heating 0 077 min 1 the role of h2o2 was also negligible for this process and it achieved a similar effectivity to its homologue with pms this kind of process is an interesting alternative due to its simplicity and to the fact that it can achieve significant degradation of pollutants without the addition of activators moreover temperature can increase the dissolution of pollutants in water accelerate the reaction and shorten the reaction times however its main drawback is the high cost of elevating the temperature of the solution nevertheless this process could be studied for use in industrial wastewaters that are characterized by a high temperature or with other sources of temperature like residual heat from parallel industrial processes 3 5 challenges and perspectives of paa aops several strategies for the degradation of eps through the activation of paa were presented in this section these processes may generate several radicals including the widely studied oh and the organic ch3c o o and ch3c o oo all of which have been shown to contribute to the oxidation of eps while oh radicals have been characterized for a higher oxidation potential ch3c o o and ch3c o oo are more selective towards electron rich sites in the molecules making them more selective and resistant to the interference of coexistent inorganic ions like cl nevertheless there are still several practical challenges for the application of the different paa aops most studies dealing with paa aops are based on uv activation of paa the feasibility of uv based processes is highly dependent on water matrices for example waters with high turbidity tend to hinder the irradiation of paa additionally the cost of electrical energy in the process is highly dependent on the characteristics of the pollutants more resistant pollutants will require a longer irradiation time significantly increasing the costs of the processes most transition metal based activation studies have used co2 as an activator while co is of great interest because the co2 co3 redox cycle is efficient at neutral ph dissolved co is a secondary source of pollution and it has been reported that high concentrations of co may pose a risk for the environment and human health hence iron activation seems more environmentally friendly as iron is found naturally in the environment however iron based processes are ph dependent and imply additional costs and reagents for the control of ph furthermore heterogeneous catalysts lead to a potential leaching of the metals which must also be considered carbon based catalysts seem to be a promising and environmentally friendly alternative but haven t received as much attention several strategies have been proposed for the activation of other oxidants like ps and pms 65 testing these metal free catalysts seems like a good alternative for future research on paa aops as research on paa based aops is still at an early stage available information is limited more research about the degradation of eps with these processes is necessary especially since the effect of ch3c o o and ch3c o oo radicals is considerably variable due to their selectivity additionally more information is still needed about the degradation pathways and toxicity of tps of pollutants in paa based aops moreover direct comparison with h2o2 based processes is key to understanding the real advantages of these processes over the currently available ones yet only a few authors have conducted such comparison for some of the activation strategies the interaction of acetoxyl and hydroxyl radicals as well as the coexistence of different processes owing to the coexistence of paa and h2o2 generates complex reaction systems that need further study especially for the fe2 based processes moreover the role of the different commercial paa h2o2 ratios should also be considered the addition of paa to the systems leads to an increase in the organic contents of the effluent and metal catalysts are secondary sources of pollution some of which are known to represent risks for the environment and human health optimization needs to be conducted to introduce the least possible amount of these substances while achieving effective degradation also it is necessary to study ways to remove or recycle the remaining paa and metal ions from the treated effluent ionic exchange activated carbon adsorption and similar technologies could be ways to achieve this all the works discussed about paa based aops were carried out at laboratory scale using deionized water with controlled amounts of pollutants although some studies have measured the effect of some water matrix ions like carbonates phosphates nitrates sulfates and natural organic matter the degradation of pollutants in real waste and surface waters still needs to be studied before the processes can scale to real applications 4 conclusions this work presented an up to date review of on the degradation of eps by paa based aops the use of paa based aops was discussed as an effective technology for the degradation of eps paa is more thermodynamically unstable than the widely used h2o2 and more easily broken this opens the door to new activation strategies that are sometimes more efficient than those currently available the most widely studied reactions for the activation of paa are uv based technologies and homogeneous and heterogeneous transition metal activation other less studied strategies include thermal and microwave activation phosphate buffer activation and metal free catalysts the understanding of mechanisms of reaction influencing parameters and effectivity of paa based processes has greatly advanced during recent years however research on paa based aops is still on an early stage consequently many questions remain open and there is room for several further investigations based on the information presented in this work the following appear to be promising topics for research 1 further investigation of the paa activation strategies already studied for the degradation of different eps is required to test the effectivity of the process which might be variable due to the selectivity of the generated radicals 2 a better understanding of the degradation mechanisms and by product generation is necessary to determine the feasibility of the processes as effective water treatments this includes the interaction of the processes with real water matrices 3 direct comparison with previously studied oxidants like h2o2 and persulfates is necessary to better assess the advantages and disadvantages of paa based aops this includes comparisons of costs environmental friendliness toxicity and possibility of escalation 4 the development and further study of alternative methods for the activation of paa to reduce the costs of the process and reduce its environmental impact for example metal free catalysts seem to be a promising and relatively environmentally friendly strategy for the activation of paa solar irradiation can be used to reduce the costs of the uv based processes and residual heat from industries could be considered for thermal activation 5 statistical optimization of important process variables like ph paa catalyst doses and irradiation needs to be conducted to better understand their interactions maximize the efficiency of the processes reduce their costs and introduce the least possible amount of contaminating substances to the environment 6 research focused on the scalability of processes is necessary this includes the design of reactors study of the processes in real wastewaters and surface waters and the subsequent pilot scale studies the optimization of processes focused on their coupling with biological treatments is also a good alternative for their industrial implementation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

desalination 1 introduction wastewater remediation techniques provide important solutions to the several problems of fresh water shortage and water pollution 1 traditional techniques such as reverse osmosis 2 multistage distillation 3 and electro dialysis 4 are capable of producing fresh water from wastewater however these techniques suffer from the drawbacks of high cost high energy consumption and large investment thus their applications are strongly limited 5 7 recently solar driven interfacial evaporation 8 10 emerged as a promising alternative technique due to the development of efficient photothermal conversion materials these materials can absorb the abundant solar energy and convert it into heat which enables wastewater evaporation and fresh water recovery 11 12 furthermore simultaneous photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants can be realized by combining photothermal conversion materials with photocatalysts such as tio2 and silver nanoparticles 13 14 solar driven interfacial evaporation is also effective in special applications including the treatment of radioactive wastewater 15 16 and remediation saline soil 17 therefore solar driven interfacial evaporation technique has attracted extensive attention owning to the obvious advantages of low cost sustainable and environmentally friendly characteristics 18 20 efficient interfacial solar evaporation is based on advanced materials that have excellent solar absorption 21 22 solar thermal conversion properties 23 24 and plenty of rapid transport channels for water 25 26 principally water is transported continuously by capillary action to the surfaces of the materials where heat generated from solar thermal conversion is concentrated then water is evaporated and the organic pollutants or hazardous ions are left behind 27 29 up to date a serious of efficient materials and devices have been developed based on metallic nanoparticles semiconductors and carbon materials however metallic nanoparticles are either expensive ag 30 au 31 et al or reactive fe 32 cu 33 et al semiconductors tio2 34 tin 35 et al show narrow absorption bands in the solar spectrum some carbon materials such as graphene 36 and carbon nanotube 37 not only have difficulty in scale production but also have poor hydrophilicity and required additional treatment to improve their compatibility with water in contrast biomass materials 38 40 are available in large scale at very low cost the well developed porous structures of biomass materials provide tremendous transport channels for water 38 furthermore biomass materials have perfect compatibility with water and bring strong capillary action that serves as driving force for water transportation 39 after carbonization biomass materials can be expected to have outstanding solar absorption and solar thermal conversion properties delivering preferable carbon materials for solar driven interfacial water evaporation 41 43 in this study carbonized sugarcane was prepared and its performance in wastewater remediation was investigated sugarcane is one of the ten most cultivated crops in the world the global annual harvesting of sugarcane is about two billion tons sugarcane has highly developed pore structure and excellent hydrophilicity carbonized sugarcane has strong absorption in ultraviolet and visible regions however the absorption in near infrared region of most carbonized biomass materials including carbonized sugarcane is not satisfactory 44 46 it was then demonstrated that antimony doped tin oxide ato is a perfect complementary component for carbonized sugarcane owning to its outstanding absorption in near infrared region the hydrophilicity solar absorptivity solar thermal conversion and solar evaporation properties of the composite evaporator were then studied the potential applications of the composite evaporator for wastewater remediation were evaluated seawater desalination with the composite evaporator was also

peeled and then cut into a block of 2 5 2 5 0 8 cm and subjected to a freeze drying process then 2 ml of 20 wt ato aqueous suspension was added dropwise to the block and absorbed completely the block was then carbonized at 720 c for 1 h in nitrogen which was subsequently replaced with air when the block was naturally cooled to 350 c finally the block was naturally cooled to ambient temperature and labelled as cs ato as references the carbonized block without ato loaded was labelled as cs and the non carbonized block was labelled as ls 2 3 characterization the morphologies of the samples were

assess the solar absorption properties of the samples the solar weight absorption fraction am is calculated from eq 1 47 1 a m x 250 2500 s m λ α λ ⅆ λ 250 2500 s m λ ⅆ λ where s m λ and α λ are the incident solar irradiance and the absorbance at a given wavelength λ respectively 2 5 experiments on solar driven interfacial water evaporation fig 1 schematically illustrates the functional design of the ato loaded carbonized sugarcane as solar evaporator sugarcane has highly developed tracheid porous structures that have been retained after carbonation such porous structures provide plenty of channels for efficient water transportation under solar illumination ato nanoparticles strongly absorb near infrared ray due to their plasmon resonance effects the ultraviolet and visible components in solar spectrum are extensively absorbed by the carbonized sugarcane light penetrating into the carbonized sugarcane will be reflected and absorbed multiply by the channels which in turn enhances the absorption of solar irradiation the absorbed light is then converted into heat through thermalization and non radiative recombination of the photo generated electron hole pairs in addition ato nanoparticles will bring tremendous localized hot pots on the surface of the channels inside the carbonized sugarcane the above factors enable highly efficient solar thermal conversion and solar evaporation the experiments were conducted at the room temperature of 20 c and humidity of 15 the schematic illustration of the device is shown in fig s1 the sample was load on a gauze wrapped

shows the optical photograph of the samples before and after carbonization after carbonization the size of the block changes from 2 5 2 5 0 8 cm to 2 0 2 0 0 5 cm the color turns from white into black suggesting nearly complete absorption of visible light the top view of cs ato shows densely packed honeycomb cells with size of 50 200 μm fig 2b the cross section of cs ato consists of micro channel bundles parallel to the growth direction of the sugarcane fig 2c these micro channels with size of 50 200 μm can serve as light traps and water pathways that significantly enhance solar absorption and water transportation high magnification sem image of the tracheid cells reveals evenly assembled nanoparticles on the walls of the cells fig 2d e compared to the smooth surface of the carbonized

characteristics of amorphous carbon 3 2 hydrophilicity and optical absorption properties of cs ato hydrophilicity of materials plays an important role in solar evaporation direct wetting behavior of cs ato is demonstrated in fig 3a dropped to the surface of the sample a water droplet of 5 μl can be absorbed completely within 1 5 s indicating remarkable hydrophilicity of cs ato hydrophilicity of materials is always associated with polar functional groups ftir spectrum of cs ato fig 3b shows three obvious peaks at about 3241 cm 1 1635 cm 1 and 1127 cm 1 corresponding to the stretching vibration of oh cc and co bonds respectively 40 42 these functional groups endow the micro channels of cs ato with excellent hydrophilicity and capillary effect benefiting efficient water transportation and consequently solar driven interfacial evaporation optical absorption property of the materials is crucial for solar driven interfacial evaporation fig 3c shows the absorbance of cs ato cs ato and ls in the range of 250 2500 nm the corresponding am value calculated from the absorbance is presented in fig 3d the solar absorption capability of the non carbonized sugarcane is poor with a low am value of 32 7 the am value of cs dramatically increases to 89 1 after carbonization the assembling of ato nanoparticles whose am value is 83 8 on the surface of cs further increase the am value of cs ato to an extremely high level of 99 9 implying nearly complete absorption of sun light cs ato shows great potential for solar energy harvesting which can be attributed to the following reasons firstly the synergistic light absorption of cs in the visible region and ato in the near infrared region results in efficient solar absorption secondly hierarchical structures of cs ato consisting of micrometer cells and nanometer protuberances formed by ato nanoparticles resonance with light of different wavelengths and enable broad band optical absorption thirdly tremendous micro channels acting as light traps together with their significantly increased surface roughness compared to the smooth surface of cs presented in fig s3b by the assemblage of ato nanoparticles promote multiple scattering reflecting and absorbing processes and thus remarkably enhance solar absorption 3 3 solar driven interfacial evaporation performance of cs ato to illustrate the solar thermal conversion properties of the samples cs and cs ato were exposed to the illumination of the solar simulator at the intensity of 1 0 kw m 2 and the temperature variation was recorded by an infrared camera as shown in fig 4a surface temperature of cs increased rapidly from 27 2 c to 73 4 c within 10 min and gradually climbed to 74 1 c after illumination for 60 min cs ato exhibited even higher efficiency in solar thermal conversion whose surface temperature increased to 74 2 c in 10 min and reached 78 2 c after 60 min indicating promising potential in solar driven interfacial evaporation as a result cs ato delivered a solar evaporation rate of 1 43 kg m 2 h 1 compared to 1 14 0 64 and 0 30 kg m 2 h 1 for cs ls and bulk water corresponding to solar evaporation efficiencies of 95 3 71 7 42 7 and 20 0 respectively fig 4b c the outstanding performance of cs ato can be ascribed to the synergistic effect of ato and carbonized sugarcane in solar harvesting as well as the strong plasmon resonance effect and localized hot pots brought by the ato nanoparticles as illustrated in fig 1 to investigate its durability in solar driven interfacial evaporation cs ato was tested repeatedly with each cycle lasting for 1 h the performance can be maintained well for at least 40 cycles without obvious decay in the solar evaporation rate fig 4d 3 4 wastewater remediation performance to evaluate the performance of cs ato in the remediation of heavy metal polluted wastewater aqueous solution containing fe3 zn2 cu2 co2 and ni2 was tested according to the procedure described in 2 5 the results are presented in fig 5a after an evaporation condensation collection cycle the ion concentrations of fe3 zn2 cu2 co2 and ni2 decreased dramatically from 8712 ppm 5099 ppm 4893 ppm 4597 ppm and 4577 ppm to 0 095 ppm 0 028 ppm 0 011 ppm 0 036 ppm and 0 023 ppm respectively the concentrations are reduced by several orders and significantly lower that the level of heavy metal ion contents in drinking water defined by who 1 ppm meanwhile the electric resistances of the solution increased by two orders from 3 27 103 ω to 2 6 105 ω fig 5b demonstrating nearly complete ion rejection evaluation of the durability in the remediation of wastewater containing heavy metal ions shows that cs ato can maintain an average evaporation rate of about 1 42 kg m 2 h 1 and an average efficiency of about 94 7 after 40 cycles 1 h for each illustrating great potential for long term service fig 5c in addition cs ato is capable of remediating organic dye polluted wastewater fig 5d f show the absorption spectra of the original and remediated aqueous solution containing methylene red rhodamine b and eriochrome black t with the original concentrations of 25 50 100 150 and 200 mg l 1 for all remediated solutions the spectra display absorbance close to zero in the range from 400 to 1000 nm suggesting nearly 100 rejection of organic dyes as the digital photo fig s8 shown the recovered water samples are transparent and colorless confirming nearly complete removal of organic dyes for seawater desalination the contents of na mg2 k and ca2 in the collected fresh water are 0 84 ppm 0 012 ppm 0 38 ppm and 0 026 ppm compared to 9140 ppm 1549 ppm 280 ppm and 53 ppm in the original seawater respectively fig 5g such contents are lower than the levels in drinking water defined by who the electric resistance of the seawater increased from 1 309 103 ω to 3 9 105 ω fig 5h in addition tds of the water sample dropped from 33 334 to 23 mg l 1 toc from 28 18 to 4 74 mg l 1 and ph value varied from 8 15 to 7 07 the solar evaporation rate maintained at the level around 1 41 kg m 2 h 1 after 40 cycles 1 h for each suggesting that cs ato is highly stable in seawater fig 5i 4 conclusion in summary an efficient light absorber and solar evaporator for wastewater remediation cs ato was prepared through the assembling of ato nanoparticles on sugarcane followed by a carbonization process it is evidenced that the solar evaporation properties of the composite evaporator can be enhanced by ato nanoparticles that increase the nir absorption significantly as a result cs ato delivered a solar absorption efficiency of 99 1 and a solar evaporation efficiency of 95 3 which is on par with those reported efficient solar evaporators experimental investigation also suggests that the composite evaporator has potential in wastewater remediation and seawater desalination as well this work provides a feasible strategy in engineering biomass carbon materials into efficient solar

environment related applications graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords wastewater remediation carbonized sugarcane antimony doped tin oxide solar driven interfacial water evaporation seawater desalination 1 introduction wastewater remediation techniques provide important solutions to the several problems of fresh water shortage and water pollution 1 traditional techniques such as reverse osmosis 2 multistage distillation 3 and electro dialysis 4 are capable of producing fresh water from wastewater however these techniques suffer from the drawbacks of high cost high energy consumption and large investment thus their applications are strongly limited 5 7 recently solar driven interfacial evaporation 8 10 emerged as a promising alternative technique due to the development of efficient photothermal conversion materials these materials can absorb the abundant solar energy and convert it into heat which enables wastewater evaporation and fresh water recovery 11 12 furthermore simultaneous photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants can be realized by combining photothermal conversion materials with photocatalysts such as tio2 and silver nanoparticles 13 14 solar driven interfacial evaporation is also effective in special applications including the treatment of radioactive wastewater 15 16 and remediation saline soil 17 therefore solar driven interfacial evaporation technique has attracted extensive attention owning to the obvious advantages of low cost sustainable and environmentally friendly characteristics 18 20 efficient interfacial solar evaporation is based on advanced materials that have excellent solar absorption 21 22 solar thermal conversion properties 23 24 and plenty of rapid transport channels for water 25 26 principally water is transported continuously by capillary action to the surfaces of the materials where heat generated from solar thermal conversion is concentrated then water is evaporated and the organic pollutants or hazardous ions are left behind 27 29 up to date a serious of efficient materials and devices have been developed based on metallic nanoparticles semiconductors and carbon materials however metallic nanoparticles are either expensive ag 30 au 31 et al or reactive fe 32 cu 33 et al semiconductors tio2 34 tin 35 et al show narrow absorption bands in the solar spectrum some carbon materials such as graphene 36 and carbon nanotube 37 not only have difficulty in scale production but also have poor hydrophilicity and required additional treatment to improve their compatibility with water in contrast biomass materials 38 40 are available in large scale at very low cost the well developed porous structures of biomass materials provide tremendous transport channels for water 38 furthermore biomass materials have perfect compatibility with water and bring strong capillary action that serves as driving force for water transportation 39 after carbonization biomass materials can be expected to have outstanding solar absorption and solar thermal conversion properties delivering preferable carbon materials for solar driven interfacial water evaporation 41 43 in this study carbonized sugarcane was prepared and its performance in wastewater remediation was investigated sugarcane is one of the ten most cultivated crops in the world the global annual harvesting of sugarcane is about two billion tons sugarcane has highly developed pore structure and excellent hydrophilicity carbonized sugarcane has strong absorption in ultraviolet and visible regions however the absorption in near infrared region of most carbonized biomass materials including carbonized sugarcane is not satisfactory 44 46 it was then demonstrated that antimony doped tin oxide ato is a perfect complementary component for carbonized sugarcane owning to its outstanding absorption in near infrared region the hydrophilicity solar absorptivity solar thermal conversion and solar evaporation properties of the composite evaporator were then studied the potential applications of the composite evaporator for wastewater remediation were evaluated seawater desalination with the composite evaporator was also included as the extended part of the research 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials sugarcane was purchased from the local market ato aqueous suspension was purchased from shanghai huzheng nano

peeled and then cut into a block of 2 5 2 5 0 8 cm and subjected to a freeze drying process then 2 ml of 20 wt ato aqueous suspension was added dropwise to the block and absorbed completely the block was then carbonized at 720 c for 1 h in nitrogen which was subsequently replaced with air when the block was naturally cooled to 350 c finally the block was naturally cooled to ambient temperature and labelled as cs ato as references the carbonized block without ato loaded was labelled as cs and the non carbonized block was labelled as ls 2 3 characterization the morphologies of the samples were

angle meter jc2000c1 powereach china were employed to analyze the functional groups and hydrophilicity of the samples 2 4 calculation of the solar weight absorption fraction am to quantitatively assess the solar absorption properties of the samples the solar weight absorption fraction am is calculated from eq 1 47 1 a m x 250 2500 s m λ α λ ⅆ λ 250 2500 s m λ ⅆ λ where s m λ and α λ are the incident solar irradiance and the absorbance at a given wavelength λ respectively 2 5 experiments on solar driven interfacial water evaporation fig 1 schematically illustrates the functional design of the ato loaded carbonized sugarcane as solar evaporator sugarcane has highly developed tracheid porous structures that have been retained after carbonation such porous structures provide plenty of channels for efficient water transportation under solar illumination ato nanoparticles strongly absorb near infrared ray due to their plasmon resonance effects the ultraviolet and visible components in solar spectrum are extensively absorbed by the carbonized sugarcane light penetrating into the carbonized sugarcane will be reflected and absorbed multiply by the channels which in turn enhances the absorption of solar irradiation the absorbed light is then converted into heat through thermalization and non radiative recombination of the photo generated electron hole pairs in addition ato nanoparticles will bring tremendous localized hot pots on the surface of the channels inside the carbonized sugarcane the above factors enable highly efficient solar thermal conversion and solar evaporation the experiments were conducted at the room temperature of 20 c and humidity of 15 the schematic illustration of the device is shown in fig s1 the sample was load on a gauze wrapped

shows the optical photograph of the samples before and after carbonization after carbonization the size of the block changes from 2 5 2 5 0 8 cm to 2 0 2 0 0 5 cm the color turns from white into black suggesting nearly complete absorption of visible light the top view of cs ato shows densely packed honeycomb cells with size of 50 200 μm fig 2b the cross section of cs ato consists of micro channel bundles parallel to the growth direction of the sugarcane fig 2c these micro channels with size of 50 200 μm can serve as light traps and water pathways that significantly enhance solar absorption and water transportation high magnification sem image of the tracheid cells reveals evenly assembled nanoparticles on the walls of the cells fig 2d e compared to the smooth surface of the carbonized

characteristics of amorphous carbon 3 2 hydrophilicity and optical absorption properties of cs ato hydrophilicity of materials plays an important role in solar evaporation direct wetting behavior of cs ato is demonstrated in fig 3a dropped to the surface of the sample a water droplet of 5 μl can be absorbed completely within 1 5 s indicating remarkable hydrophilicity of cs ato hydrophilicity of materials is always associated with polar functional groups ftir spectrum of cs ato fig 3b shows three obvious peaks at about 3241 cm 1 1635 cm 1 and 1127 cm 1 corresponding to the stretching vibration of oh cc and co bonds respectively 40 42 these functional groups endow the micro channels of cs ato with excellent hydrophilicity and capillary effect benefiting efficient water transportation and consequently solar driven interfacial evaporation optical absorption property of the materials is crucial for solar driven interfacial evaporation fig 3c shows the absorbance of cs ato cs ato and ls in the range of 250 2500 nm the corresponding am value calculated from the absorbance is presented in fig 3d the solar absorption capability of the non carbonized sugarcane is poor with a low am value of 32 7 the am value of cs dramatically increases to 89 1 after carbonization the assembling of ato nanoparticles whose am value is 83 8 on the surface of cs further increase the am value of cs ato to an extremely high level of 99 9 implying nearly complete absorption of sun light cs ato shows great potential for solar energy harvesting which can be attributed to the following reasons firstly the synergistic light absorption of cs in the visible region and ato in the near infrared region results in efficient solar absorption secondly hierarchical structures of cs ato consisting of micrometer cells and nanometer protuberances formed by ato nanoparticles resonance with light of different wavelengths and enable broad band optical absorption thirdly tremendous micro channels acting as light traps together with their significantly increased surface roughness compared to the smooth surface of cs presented in fig s3b by the assemblage of ato nanoparticles promote multiple scattering reflecting and absorbing processes and thus remarkably enhance solar absorption 3 3 solar driven interfacial evaporation performance of cs ato to illustrate the solar thermal conversion properties of the samples cs and cs ato were exposed to the illumination of the solar simulator at the intensity of 1 0 kw m 2 and the temperature variation was recorded by an infrared camera as shown in fig 4a surface temperature of cs increased rapidly from 27 2 c to 73 4 c within 10 min and gradually climbed to 74 1 c after illumination for 60 min cs ato exhibited even higher efficiency in solar thermal conversion whose surface temperature increased to 74 2 c in 10 min and reached 78 2 c after 60 min indicating promising potential in solar driven interfacial evaporation as a result cs ato delivered a solar evaporation rate of 1 43 kg m 2 h 1 compared to 1 14 0 64 and 0 30 kg m 2 h 1 for cs ls and bulk water corresponding to solar evaporation efficiencies of 95 3 71 7 42 7 and 20 0 respectively fig 4b c the outstanding performance of cs ato can be ascribed to the synergistic effect of ato and carbonized sugarcane in solar harvesting as well as the strong plasmon resonance effect and localized hot pots brought by the ato nanoparticles as illustrated in fig 1 to investigate its durability in solar driven interfacial evaporation cs ato was tested repeatedly with each cycle lasting for 1 h the performance can be maintained well for at least 40 cycles without obvious decay in the solar evaporation rate fig 4d 3 4 wastewater remediation performance to evaluate the performance of cs ato in the remediation of heavy metal polluted wastewater aqueous solution containing fe3 zn2 cu2 co2 and ni2 was tested according to the procedure described in 2 5 the results are presented in fig 5a after an evaporation condensation collection cycle the ion concentrations of fe3 zn2 cu2 co2 and ni2 decreased dramatically from 8712 ppm 5099 ppm 4893 ppm 4597 ppm and 4577 ppm to 0 095 ppm 0 028 ppm 0 011 ppm 0 036 ppm and 0 023 ppm respectively the concentrations are reduced by several orders and significantly lower that the level of heavy metal ion contents in drinking water defined by who 1 ppm meanwhile the electric resistances of the solution increased by two orders from 3 27 103 ω to 2 6 105 ω fig 5b demonstrating nearly complete ion rejection evaluation of the durability in the remediation of wastewater containing heavy metal ions shows that cs ato can maintain an average evaporation rate of about 1 42 kg m 2 h 1 and an average efficiency of about 94 7 after 40 cycles 1 h for each illustrating great potential for long term service fig 5c in addition cs ato is capable of remediating organic dye polluted wastewater fig 5d f show the absorption spectra of the original and remediated aqueous solution containing methylene red rhodamine b and eriochrome black t with the original concentrations of 25 50 100 150 and 200 mg l 1 for all remediated solutions the spectra display absorbance close to zero in the range from 400 to 1000 nm suggesting nearly 100 rejection of organic dyes as the digital photo fig s8 shown the recovered water samples are transparent and colorless confirming nearly complete removal of organic dyes for seawater desalination the contents of na mg2 k and ca2 in the collected fresh water are 0 84 ppm 0 012 ppm 0 38 ppm and 0 026 ppm compared to 9140 ppm 1549 ppm 280 ppm and 53 ppm in the original seawater respectively fig 5g such contents are lower than the levels in drinking water defined by who the electric resistance of the seawater increased from 1 309 103 ω to 3 9 105 ω fig 5h in addition tds of the water sample dropped from 33 334 to 23 mg l 1 toc from 28 18 to 4 74 mg l 1 and ph value varied from 8 15 to 7 07 the solar evaporation rate maintained at the level around 1 41 kg m 2 h 1 after 40 cycles 1 h for each suggesting that cs ato is highly stable in seawater fig 5i 4 conclusion in summary an efficient light absorber and solar evaporator for wastewater remediation cs ato was prepared through the assembling of ato nanoparticles on sugarcane followed by a carbonization process it is evidenced that the solar evaporation properties of the composite evaporator can be enhanced by ato nanoparticles that increase the nir absorption significantly as a result cs ato delivered a solar absorption efficiency of 99 1 and a solar evaporation efficiency of 95 3 which is on par with those reported efficient solar evaporators experimental investigation also suggests that the

55 and 154 21 mg g 1 for mfa 1 mfa 2 and ufa respectively were observed for the cr dye while for the mb dye the maximum adsorption capacities of 55 75 52 64 and 35 09 mg g 1 for mfa 1 mfa 2 and ufa respectively the improvement of dye removal on acid composites than unmodified flys ash compsitewas credited to the increased active sites due to acid modification of fly ash the pso kinetic model and langmuir adsorption isotherms were the best fit for the experimental results the incorporation of tio2 inculcated photocatalytic regeneration ability in the composite adsorbents this allowed the adsorbent to be utilized in several cycles without thermal or chemical treatment this study concluded that the proposed adsorbent could be an effective solution for textile industry wastewater treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords fly ash tio2 dye adsorption regeneration photocatalysis textile wastewater 1 introduction textile industries use huge amounts of water in various processes such as dying rinsing and finishing one of the major sources of industrial wastewaters unabated discharge of untreated partially treated wastewater with a complex chemical composition of residual dyes suspended solids and volatile and recalcitrant organic compounds from the textile industry has severe consequences on the receiving environment 1 dyes are generally non biodegradable and their resistance to oxidizing agents makes it difficult to choose an appropriate removal method furthermore colour significantly influences public perception of water quality and is the first contaminant identified in water 2 it also obstructs light penetration which prompts the disturbance in the biological processes of the aquatic 3 moreover it results in a severe challenge for dye removal from textile wastewater hence there is a need to find efficient treatment technologies to remove dyes from textile wastewater 4 the dye generated from various textile industries can be divided into two major classes cationic dyes e g methylene blue mb and anionic dyes e g congo red cr 5 mb dye is used in the cotton silk and paper industry and makes ink because of its excellent colour stability and water solubility 6 cr is an acidic azo dye used in the textile food paper leather and carpet industries as a colouring agent 7 dye removal is accomplished using a variety of physical chemical and biological treatment processes physico chemical technologies involve processes such as membrane techniques 8 9 coagulation flocculation 10 adsorption 11 13 electrochemical methods 6 photodegradation 14 and advanced oxidation process 15 16 among these technologies adsorption has been recognized as a potential and attractive option due to its high selectivity simple operating requirements cost effectiveness and relatively high removal efficiency 17 19 recently several adsorbents such as biochar 20 biowaste 21 magnetic nanoparticles 22 and magnetic chitosan nanocomposite 23 have been studied to remove dye from wastewater using low cost adsorbents is currently gaining popularity and the adsorption process is a promising technology if a sorbent is inexpensive and ready for use 24 nevertheless the two most common limitations of adsorption are regeneration and reusability to overcome these limitations hybrid technology is used nowadays most commonly used hybrid technology is photocatalytic adsorption 25 27 various semiconductor oxides such as tio2 wo3 sno2 zno or modified oxides having photocatalytic activity are used in photocatalytic adsorption 28 29 because of its non toxicity environmentally compatible low cost strong power towards oxidation and great chemical stability titanium dioxide tio2 is the most widely used photocatalyst tio2 being active under ultraviolet uv light irradiation 380 nm is also a major reason for extensive use as a photocatalyst due to the simple regeneration process in adsorption the adsorbent based on raw and modified wastes has received plenty of attention in the past few years they simultaneously solved two problems treatment of the wastewater and identifying new applications as secondary raw materials flyash fa is one such waste product fa is used as a raw material in various industries including the production of cement brick fabrication and soil conditioning several researchers have used fa based materials to adsorb dyes such as magnetic ag fa composite 30 coal fa hydroxyapatite composites 31 fa based geopolymer 32 and mgo incorporated fa composites 33 however very few researchers have studied adsorption with fa for dye removal from the textile wastewater such as mb 34 36 cr 37 crystal violet and rhodamine b 38 and reactive blue 25 39 moreover no study has reported photocatalytic fa composite for dye removal and subsequent photocatalytic regeneration of adsorbent considering all the above benefits of fa and tio2 these were chosen to synthesize the fa tio2 chitosan composite adsorbent in this study moreover to enhance the adsorption capacity of fa it was modified with acids h2so4 and hno3 the present study aimed to determine the adsorption capacity removal efficiency and the effect of different parameters such as ph the concentration of dyes and the contact time of the adsorbent for the adsorption of cr and mb the synthesized composite was characterized using different techniques such as sem ft ir xrd tga and bet the photocatalytic regeneration of beads has also been performed to check the reusability of the synthesized composite adsorbents 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials fa was

toledo was used to perform a thermogravimetric analysis tga with nitrogen flow at a heating rate of 10 c min 1 the weight loss samples were measured at temperatures ranging from 30 to 600 c a eutech pc2700 multiparameter device was used to monitor ph mb and cr dye concentrations were measured by constructing a calibration curve using a uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu japan 2 3 modification of fly ash accurately weighed 50 g fa was dispersed in 160 ml di water 40 ml of 18 m h2so4 was slowly added into the solution while being heated at 95 c and vigorously shaken on a magnetic stirrer until a homogenous solution was formed ph 1 8 after cooling at room temperature the solution was filtered and washed multiple times with di water until the ph of the material reached 7 the material was then dried at 100 c for 12 h to obtain h2so4 modified fa the same procedure was applied with 15 5 m hno3 to obtain hno3 modified fa 2 4 synthesis of tio2 nanoparticles tio2 nanoparticles were synthesized as per the procedure reported earlier 40 the aqueous solution of titanium ammonium carbonate ti nh4 2co3 was prepared by dissolving the desired quantity of titanium v isopropoxide in 17 ml methanol followed by di water addition while the mixture was constantly stirred at 300 rpm after 15 to 20 min of the stirring a white precipitate ti nh4 2co3 was collected via filtration and washed thoroughly with di water multiple times and it was centrifuged to remove any kind of impurities the obtained powder was added to 25 ml 1 6 m aqueous nh4 2co3 solution under constant stirring after stirring for some time the solution turned milky white after that 3 0 ml of 30 h2o2 was added to the milky white solution turning the solution into a clear light yellow solution the resultant solution was then transferred to a teflon walled stainless steel autoclave 100 ml where the hydrothermal treatment was done at 150 c for 6 h the resultant solution was cooled followed by centrifugation via methanol and di water finally the residue was dried overnight at room temperature and subjected to further characterizations 2 5 synthesis of composite adsorbents the composite adsorbents were prepared using the ionotropic gelation method 41 15 g h2so4 modified fa 600 mg tio2 nanoparticles 3 ml acetic acid and 9 g chitosan were added to 300 ml di water the solution was mechanically stirred at 400 rpm until a homogenous solution was obtained the solution was dropped into 1 n naoh solution using a syringe producing spherical beads in the millimetre range the beads were incubated in the naoh solution for 12 h at room temperature the obtained beads were filtered and washed multiple times with di water until the ph reached 7 and dried at 60 c overnight the obtained beads are designated as mfa 1 a similar method was applied with hno3 modified fa and obtained beads are designated as mfa 2 the fa chitosan beads with no surface modification are designated as ufa 2 6 adsorption experiments the details on adsorption experiments performed in this study adsorption kinetics adsorption isotherms and regeneration are provided in esi 3 results and discussion 3 1 material characterizations the morphological characteristics of the raw fa and acid modified fa particles were studied using sem and edax figs 1a 1c the fa fa h2so4 and fa hno3 contained smooth spherical shaped particles of almost similar size acid modified fa was converted into slightly smaller particles due to h2so4 and hno3 activation 42 the increased adsorption capacity of the acid modified fa is expected due to the fa s increased surface area active sites as they converted into small spherical particles fa contained many oxides like cao mgo al2o3 etc which may help and accelerate the absorption characteristics of the fa based beads 43 the presence of these elements was confirmed from the edax figs 1a 1c of the fa and acid modified fa particles the bet surface area pore volume and average pore diameter of the raw fa were determined as 7 1 m2 g 1 0 049 cm3 g 1 and 15 1 nm respectively for the h2so4 acid modified fa the surface area was 1 31 times the raw fa while for hno3 acid modified fa the surface area was 1 26 times the raw fa moreover the surface modification of fa with h2so4 and hno3 increased the pore volume but decreased the average pore volume diameter the total pore volume for raw fa h2so4 and hno3 modified fa was 0 049 0 46 and 0 31 cm3 g 1 respectively similar observations have been reported by other researchers 42 44 fig s1 shows the xrd patterns of raw fa h2so4 and hno3 acid modified there was no significant difference in their xrd patterns all of the diffractograms exhibited narrow diffraction lines which indicated the material was crystalline fa samples showed the crystalline phases attributed to crystalline compositions present in fa material such as quartz icdd pdf 46 1045 and mullite icdd pdf 79 1450 additionally a minor fraction of hematite icdd pdf 33 0664 and magnetite icdd pdf 19 0629 with quartz peak at 2θ 26 8 being the most prominent 45 46 the broad hump that occurred at 2θ 16 68 was attributed to some amorphous material present in fa most likely silica 47 to identify whether a new functional group was attached to the surface of modified fa ft ir spectra of acid modified fa were analysed fig 2 the absorption bands at around 3414 cm 1 were attributed to o h s stretching vibration in the structure the narrow band at 3413 cm 1 was attributed to vibration oh in structural water while the band at around 1629 cm 1 was due to h oh vibration the existence of symmetric and asymmetric al oh band vibrations in the al oh 6 structure of fa was reflected by the band at 794 cm 1 48 the band at 552 cm 1 represented the mullite al2o3 in the fa 49 a band at 1090 cm 1 appeared in the fa spectra due to asymmetric stretching of sio or alo while a low intensity band at 782 cm 1 was due to the presence of quartz sio2 at the same time bands at 1098 cm 1 and 1608 cm 1 were due to si o si asymmetric stretching vibration and h o h bending vibration 48 after the modification with h2so4 and hno3 the band corresponding to 3414 cm 1 became strong and broad the band in the range from 2959 cm 1 to 2869 cm 1 was due to the ch stretch vibrations 49 the sem and edax of the synthesized tio2 nanoparticles are shown in fig 3 the sem image of the tio2 revealed the cubic morphology of the synthesized anatase tio2 the purity of synthesized was confirmed from edax of tio2 nanoparticles fig 3b moreover the particles were monodispersed and uniform in shape and size synthesized tio2 powder xrd spectra exhibited well resolved x ray diffraction peaks fig 3c the xrd peaks of anatase tio2 were indexed to 101 0 0 4 200 105 211 213 and 116 corresponding to to 2θ 25 2 37 8 48 0 54 1 55 2 62 5 and 68 9 respectively 50 51 these crystal planes indicated the high crystalline nature of synthesized tio2 fig 4 shows the sem and edax for mfa 1 composite beads the sem image of the mfa 1 was irregular and rough providing more adsorption sites for cr and mb dye adsorption the edax analysis for mfa 1 was performed to determine the chemical composition the edax analysis showed the presence of all elements of fa and chitosan along with tio2 the xrd patterns of chitosan mfa 1 mfa 2 and ufa chitosan beads are shown in fig 5 the diffraction peaks of chitosan were observed at 2θ 9 8 and 20 1 corresponding to 240 and 273 miller indices 52 these peaks indicated the amorphous and low crystalline nature of the chitosan the ufa retained peaks of both fa and chitosan the diffraction peaks fairly resemble the standard peaks 53 furthermore the diffraction patterns of the mfa 1 and mfa 2 indicate the composition of fa chitosan and tio2 the peaks of chitosan were of low intensity and can be observed at 2θ 9 8 and 20 1 in all the composite beads in the case of mfa 1 and mfa 2 the xrd peaks of the tio2 were observed at 2θ 25 2 37 8 48 0 54 1 and 62 5 the peak intensity of tio2 was lesser than fa because the mfa 1 and mfa 2 composite beads contained less amount of chitosan and tio2 than fa the thermographs of synthesized composite beads are depicted in fig 6 from 30 to 600 c the tga of the mfa 1 revealed a 98 02 residual mass 2 weight loss while for mfa 2 and ufa it was 96 76 and 95 89 residual mass respectively the presence of guest molecules or residual solvent loss of humidity and loss of hydration was responsible for reducing the residual mass of the synthesized beads mfa 1 and mfa 2 decomposed between 280 and 600 c while ufa decomposed between 240 and 600 c at 300 c the mfa 1 and mfa 2 showed dramatically weight loss the tga plots showed the highest thermal stability for mfa 1 up to 300 c and ufa up to 260 c 3 2 adsorption performance the adsorption performances removal efficiency and maximum adsorption capacity of synthesized adsorbents to remove dyes cr and mb from the aqueous solution were assessed and evaluated by varying several kinetic parameters such as ph adsorbent dose contact time and adsorbate concentration 3 2 1 effect of dosage the effect of adsorbent dosages in the range of 0 2 3 g l 1 was evaluated for the adsorption experiments the optimum adsorbent dose was determined using the variable amount of adsorbents dissolved in 10 ml of 20 mg l 1 cr and mb dye solution followed by stirring for 2 h fig 7 demonstrates the adsorption capacity of dyes depending on the adsorbent dose in the solution the curve followed a declining trend indicating the amounts of dye per gram of adsorbent adsorbed were inversely proportional to the adsorbent dose this was attributed to the aggregation of adsorbent particles as the adsorbent dose increased the removal efficiency of dyes increases by increasing the adsorbent dosage 54 this was because the addition of adsorbent provides more surface area and hence more active sites for adsorption to occur the maximum removal efficiency for cr and mb reached 98 and 61 respectively and then the trend gradually stabilized the cr adsorption showed higher removal efficiency and adsorption capacity compared to mb this was attributed to the negative charge of the cr dye 55 ufa and mfa 2 showed lower adsorption capacity and removal efficiency than mfa 1 after 1 g l 1 there was negligible difference in removal efficiency for all adsorbents therefore the optimum adsorbent dose was 1 g l 1 for both cr and mb for all the adsorption experiments 3 2 2 effect of concentration the effect of adsorbate concentration on the removal efficiency of adsorbents was studied at different concentrations 10 to 200 mg l 1 fig 8 when the concentration of the dyes was increased the removal efficiency decreased and the adsorption capacity increased the decrease in removal efficiency with concentration was also observed in the other studies 41 56 when the dye concentration was low the groups on the surface of the adsorbent that provided active adsorption sites were unsaturated and more surface active adsorption sites could quickly adsorb to the dye which shows high removal efficiency when the dye concentration became high the active sites were saturated and a less active surface was available to adsorb the dye hence the extra dye molecules was no longer adsorbed leading to a decrease in the removal efficiency for cr dye the maximum adsorption removal efficiency of mfa 1 mfa 2 and ufa was 99 63 99 16 95 67 and the maximum adsorption capacity of mfa 1 mfa 2 and ufa were 19 93 19 84 and 19 13 mg g 1 respectively for mb dye the maximum adsorption removal efficiency of mfa 1 mfa 2 and ufa was 61 13 58 75 and 53 75 and the maximum adsorption capacity of mfa 1 mfa 2 and ufa was 12 23 11 75 and 10 75 mg g 1 respectively the optimum concentration of the adsorbate selected for further studies was 20 mg l 1 3 2 3 effect of time fig 9 demonstrates the removal efficiency and adsorption capacity of cr and mb dye with respect to adsorbents contact time the adsorption process was investigated with an adsorbate concentration of 1 g l 1 and dye concentration of 20 mg l 1 as these parameters were optimized in earlier sections the adsorption capacity increased with adsorption time and stabilized at a certain level the adsorption time for cr dye gradually stabilized after 2 h and the adsorption rate reached 98 63 97 85 and 95 10 for the adsorbent mfa 1 mfa 2 and ufa respectively for mb dye adsorption time gradually stabilizes after 3 h and the adsorption rate reached 62 13 61 62 and 58 75 for the adsorbent mfa 1 mfa 2 and ufa respectively the adsorption process reached equilibrium because surface adsorption plays a major role in the initial adsorption stage and the active sites are largely occupied this led to the saturation of active sites therefore the dye molecules gradually diffused from the surface to the internal pores resulting in the saturation of adsorbents therefore the optimum contact time was 2 and 3 h respectively for removing cr and mb dye similar trends were also reported in other studies for the dye removal efficiency and the adsorption capacity for dye removal 57 59 3 2 4 effect of ph fig 10 demonstrates the effect of ph on the removal efficiencies of dyes the cr and mb dye solution s ph varied from 2 to 12 as the ph of the solution was raised from 2 to 12 the removal efficiency and adsorption capacity first increased reached a maximum and then decreased gradually with further increment in the solution ph this is in agreement with the previous studies 60 61 the maximum adsorption efficiency of mfa 1 mfa 2 and ufa was 98 85 98 and 94 95 respectively for cr at ph 5 while for the mb the maximum adsorption efficiency of mfa 1 mfa 2 and ufa was 61 58 75 and 54 35 respectively at ph 9 mfa 1 showed higher efficiency than mfa 2 and ufa at ph 5 this was attributed to more surface area h2so4 modified fa resulting in increased adsorption capacity the adsorption efficiency of cr dye in the solution decreased rapidly when the ph was 5 this was because the dye molecules generated a large amount of negative charges due to ionization many hydroxyl ions were adsorbed on the surface of the adsorbent and the electrostatic attraction between the dye and adsorbent became weak therefore the acidic solution favoured the strong adsorption of cr onto the surface of the modified adsorbents moreover al and fe in the adsorbent produced a positive surface charge at low ph which served as appropriate sites to adsorb cr dye molecules on the surface of the adsorbent at lower ph the adsorbent s positively charged silica and alumina at low ph provide insufficient adsorption of mb dye as the mb dye is positively charged for mb dye adsorption efficiency increases with an increase in ph because fa is negatively charged at high ph favouring the adsorption of mb dye 62 the fa modification increased the positive charge in adsorbents which enhanced the adsorption capacity this was because tio2 is coupled with fa and a positive shift was found in adsorbents 63 therefore the adsorption capacity of mfa 1 and mfa 2 was higher than the ufa the optimum ph for cr dye was 5 and for mb dye was 9 for all the adsorbents the removal efficiency for cr dye was higher than mb dye because fa can effectively remove the anionic contaminants from an aqueous solution as established in previous studies 64 this was attributed to the positive surface charge produced by al and fe in the adsorbent which were used as suitable sites to adsorb cr dye molecules on the adsorbent surface the adsorbent s positively charged surface provided a lower adsorption capacity for mb than cr dye as the mb dye is a cationic dye the incorporation of the tio2 to the fa increased the positive charge of adsorbents which enhanced the adsorption capacity of negatively charged dye cr 63 in addition the incorporation of the tio2 provided higher catalytic efficiency than the fa chitosan adsorbent furthermore it increased the photocatalytic regeneration of adsorbents and allowed them to be utilized in several cycles without any thermal or chemical post treatment the inferences drawn from the experiments are discussed in subsequent subsections the comparison of the cr and mb dye adsorption capacity of the synthesized adsorbents in this work with relevant adsorbents reported in the literature is included in table s1 the comparison was made based on the parameters such as adsorption capacity q max adsorbent dose ph and contact time the present study results were comparable with previous works suggesting that cr could be easily adsorbed on synthesized adsorbents prepared in this work however the value of q max for mb is lower than those reported in earlier work this indicates that the synthesized adsorbents are a cheap and effective alternate adsorbent for cr dye adsorption 3 3 adsorption kinetics figs 11 and 12 demonstrate the adsorption kinetics of cr and mb dye on the synthesized adsorbents according to the pfo and pso kinetic model respectively the adsorption of cr and mb dye on the synthesized adsorbents did not follow the pfo kinetic model as the regression coefficients and predicted adsorption capacities were lower than the pso kinetic model the adsorption mechanism followed the pso reaction for cr and mb dyes table 1 lists the adsorption capacities of adsorbents at equilibrium q e and kinetic plot coefficients for cr and mb for the pfo kinetic model the values of r2 were notably smaller than 1 for all the studied adsorbents hence the pfo kinetic model did not fit the experimental data in the case of cr dye the k 2 value was greater than k 1 illustrating the increase in adsorption capacity the smaller value of k 1 in the pfo kinetic model indicated slower adsorption the smaller value of the residual sum of the square and reduced chi square indicated the minimum difference for pso than pfo reaction between the experimental and theoretical values 65 the pso kinetic model possessed a value of r2 close to 1 suggesting the best fit of experimental results in this model the pso model s best fit of the adsorption data suggested that chemisorption was the dominating rate limiting mechanism in the adsorption of dyes 3 4 adsorption isotherm the adsorption isotherms of cr and mb dyes onto the synthesized adsorbents were studied by representing the variation of equilibrium adsorption capacity q e mg g 1 with equilibrium dye concentration mg l 1 according to the langmuir and freundlich model for the adsorption of cr and mb dye represented by figs 13 and 14 respectively the model parameters from langmuir and freundlich adsorption isotherms obtained from non linear regression are presented in table 2 comparing the results presented in table 2 it can be noticed that values of the correlation coefficient r2 of the langmuir linear model for cr and mb dyes were close to 1 these r2 values were higher than the freundlich adsorption isotherm model the residual sum of the square is less for langmuir isotherm than freundlich isotherm for both the dyes cr and mb the fitting of the langmuir isotherm can also be confirmed from the smaller value minimum difference between the theoretical and experimental value of the residual sum of the square langmuir adsorption isotherms suggested the best fit of experimental results in this model which indicated the adsorption was of the monolayer the fitting of langmuir isotherm was due to the homogeneous distribution of the active sites over the surface of the adsorbents 66 the results reported that the homogenous distribution of the active sites on the adsorbent surface was in a monolayer pattern the reduced chi square for the langmuir isotherm was also lower than the freundlich isotherm it was evident that synthesized adsorbent has a minimum difference between experimental and theoretical adsorption capacity in order of mfa 1 mfa 2 ufa with the maximum adsorption capacities of 163 51 160 55 and 154 21 mg g 1 for mfa 1 mfa 2 and ufa respectively for the cr dye at the same time the maximum adsorption capacities of 55 75 52 64 and 35 09 mg g 1 were for mfa 1 mfa 2 and ufa respectively for the mb dye 3 5 photocatalytic regeneration of adsorbent the adsorbent regeneration allows for its reusability and hence increases commercial applications to assess the possible reuse and stability of the adsorbents photocatalytic efficiency was examined for one cycle the photocatalytic regeneration experiments were performed under sunlight with all synthesized adsorbents for both absorbents i e cr and mb fig 15 demonstrates the synthesized adsorbents removal efficiency for cr and mb after regeneration 90 min of photocatalysis the mfa 1 and mfa 2 had higher catalytic efficiency than the ufa as they contained tio2 which is an excellent photocatalytic material the decrease in removal efficiency after regeneration of the tio2 incorporated adsorbents mfa 1 and mfa 2 was less than in regenerated ufa this allows them to be utilized in several cycles without requiring to be regenerated by thermal or chemical means fig s2 shows the ft ir spectra of the cr dye adsorbed and regenerated adsorbent to identify any change in the surface of the adsorbent during the adsorption and regeneration it was observed that there was some difference in the ft ir bands intensities after adsorption and regeneration of composite beads however all the characteristic peaks were retained hence it can be concluded that the composite beads did not undergo much compositional change 3 6 plausible mechanism for dye adsorption and adsorbent regeneration the plausible mechanism of dye adsorption on the composite adsorbent was studied ion exchange and coordination reactions must be considered when determining the adsorption mechanism of any materials in mfa 1 and mfa 2 since tio2 was added in the composite a positive shift in charge was expected in adsorbents which enhanced the adsorption capacity for cr than mb dye the mfa 1 and mfa 2 offered rough surface surface regulation homogeneity and surface area than ufa favouring better adsorption 67 fa adsorbed cr and md dye molecules mainly due to its carbon content and the functional oxide groups such as sio2 and al2o3 62 the silica in acid modified fa at low ph was positively charged while at high ph negatively charged similarly depending on the ph al and fe developed surface charges as a result the al and fe in the adsorbent produced a positive surface charge at low ph which served as appropriate sites to adsorb cr dye molecules on the adsorbent surface at low ph the adsorbent s positively charged silica and alumina at low ph provide inefficient adsorption of mb dye as the mb dye is positively charged as the ph decreased fa would become more positively charged which allowed cr dye molecules to adsorb on the surface leading to enhanced anion exchange adsorption the adsorption onto the mfa 1 followed the pso kinetics and langmuir isotherm model which indicated chemisorption adsorption by forming a monolayer of dyes mb and cr molecules onto mfa 1 since the adsorption of both the dyes cr and mb followed the pso model which indicated the dye molecules were adsorbed in aggregated form the fa present in composite beads was primarily responsible for providing unoccupied sites for adsorbed dye molecules on the other hand the dye molecules aggregated and adsorbed on the chitosan surface tio2 is well known photocatalytic material energy bandgap 3 2 ev 68 which causes the photocatalytic degradation of the dye molecules over the adsorbent surface mfa 1 and mfa 2 the electrons were promoted from the full valence band to the empty conduction band during the photodegradation process by irradiating with sunlight the resulting excitation was responsible for forming the electron hole pairs that bear the ability to delocalize throughout the crystal lattice of tio2 the water molecules get splits into h ion and oh radical by holes while the electron reacts with oxygen molecules to generate superoxide ions further these superoxide ions react with h formed to give hydroperoxyl radicals h2o two hydroperoxyl radicals yield hydrogen peroxide which reacts with superoxide ions yielding hydroxyl free radicals the oxidizing ability of these free radicals is very high the interaction of hydroxyl radicals on adsorbed cr and mb dye molecules on the adsorbent surface caused rapid growth of degradation products through intermediate generation 4 conclusions in this study we synthesised and studied the performance of the photocatalytic tio2 fa chitosan composite beads for cr and mb dye adsorption to enhance the adsorption capacity of the composite fa was modified with acids h2so4 and hno3 the sem images of the beads revealed its irregular and rough surface providing more adsorption sites for dye adsorption fa was converted into small particles due to h2so4 and hno3 activation the tga plots showed the higher thermal stability for mfa 1 and mfa 2 up to 300 c than ufa due to tio2 incorporation the adsorption capacity decreased with dosage attributed to the aggregation of particles the removal efficiency of dye increased by increasing the adsorbent dosage attributed to avalability of more active sites when the contact time was increased the adsorption capacity increased and reached equilibrium for all adsorbents the adsorption efficiency of cr dye in the solution decreased rapidly when the ph was 5 this was because the dye molecules generated a large amount of negative charges due to ionization the al and fe in the adsorbent produced a positive surface charge at low ph suitable sites to adsorb cr dye the adsorbent s positively charged silica and alumina at low ph provided insufficient adsorption of positively charged mb dye the pso kinetic model and langmuir isotherm possessed a greater value of r2 close to unity suggesting the best fit for experimental results in these models the maximum adsorption capacities of 163 51 160 55 and 154 21 mg g 1 for mfa 1 mfa 2 and ufa respectively for the cr dye at the same time the maximum adsorption capacities of 55 75 52 64 and 35 09 mg g 1were for mfa 1 mfa 2 and ufa respectively for the mb dye the incorporation of tio2 inculcated photocatalytic regeneration ability in the composite adsorbents this allowed the adsorbent to be utilized in several cycles without thermal or chemical treatment this study concluded that the proposed adsorbent can be an effective solution for textile

langmuir adsorption isotherms were the best fit for the experimental results the incorporation of tio2 inculcated photocatalytic regeneration ability in the composite adsorbents this allowed the adsorbent to be utilized in several cycles without thermal or chemical treatment this study concluded that the proposed adsorbent could be an effective solution for textile industry wastewater treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords fly ash tio2 dye adsorption regeneration photocatalysis textile wastewater 1 introduction textile industries use huge amounts of water in various processes such as dying rinsing and finishing one of the major sources of industrial wastewaters unabated discharge of untreated partially treated wastewater with a complex chemical composition of residual dyes suspended solids and volatile and recalcitrant organic compounds from the textile industry has severe consequences on the receiving environment 1 dyes are generally non biodegradable and their resistance to oxidizing agents makes it difficult to choose an appropriate removal method furthermore colour significantly influences public perception of water quality and is the first contaminant identified in water 2 it also obstructs light penetration which prompts the disturbance in the biological processes of the aquatic 3 moreover it results in a severe challenge for dye removal from textile wastewater hence there is a need to find efficient treatment technologies to remove dyes from textile wastewater 4 the dye generated from various textile industries can be divided into two major classes cationic dyes e g methylene blue mb and anionic dyes e g congo red cr 5 mb dye is used in the cotton silk and paper industry and makes ink because of its excellent colour stability and water solubility 6 cr is an acidic azo dye used in the textile food paper leather and carpet industries as a colouring agent 7 dye removal is accomplished using a variety of physical chemical and biological treatment processes physico chemical technologies involve processes such as membrane techniques 8 9 coagulation flocculation 10 adsorption 11 13 electrochemical methods 6 photodegradation 14 and advanced oxidation process 15 16 among these technologies adsorption has been recognized as a potential and attractive option due to its high selectivity simple operating requirements cost effectiveness and relatively high removal efficiency 17 19 recently several adsorbents such as biochar 20 biowaste 21 magnetic nanoparticles 22 and magnetic chitosan nanocomposite 23 have been studied to remove dye from wastewater using low cost adsorbents is currently gaining popularity and the adsorption process is a promising technology if a sorbent is inexpensive and ready for use 24 nevertheless the two most common limitations of adsorption are regeneration and reusability to overcome these limitations hybrid technology is used nowadays most commonly used hybrid technology is photocatalytic adsorption 25 27 various semiconductor oxides such as tio2 wo3 sno2 zno or modified oxides having photocatalytic activity are used in photocatalytic adsorption 28 29 because of its non toxicity environmentally compatible low cost strong power towards oxidation and great chemical stability titanium dioxide tio2 is the most widely used photocatalyst tio2 being active under ultraviolet uv light irradiation 380 nm is also a major reason for extensive use as a photocatalyst due to the simple regeneration process in adsorption the adsorbent based on raw and modified wastes has received plenty of attention in the past few years they simultaneously solved two problems treatment of the wastewater and identifying new applications as secondary raw materials flyash fa is one such waste product fa is used as a raw material in various industries including the production of cement brick fabrication and soil conditioning several researchers have used fa based materials to adsorb dyes such as magnetic ag fa composite 30 coal fa hydroxyapatite composites 31 fa based geopolymer 32 and mgo incorporated fa composites 33 however very few researchers have studied adsorption with fa for dye removal from the textile wastewater such as mb 34 36 cr 37 crystal violet and rhodamine b 38 and reactive blue 25 39 moreover no study has reported photocatalytic fa composite for dye removal and subsequent photocatalytic regeneration of adsorbent considering all the above benefits of fa and tio2 these were chosen to synthesize the fa tio2 chitosan composite adsorbent in this study moreover to enhance the adsorption capacity of fa it was modified with acids h2so4 and hno3 the present study aimed to determine the adsorption capacity removal efficiency and the effect of different parameters such as ph the concentration of dyes and the contact time of the adsorbent for the adsorption of cr and mb the synthesized composite was characterized using different techniques such as sem ft ir xrd tga and bet the photocatalytic regeneration of beads has also been performed to check the reusability of the synthesized composite adsorbents 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials fa was

toledo was used to perform a thermogravimetric analysis tga with nitrogen flow at a heating rate of 10 c min 1 the weight loss samples were measured at temperatures ranging from 30 to 600 c a eutech pc2700 multiparameter device was used to monitor ph mb and cr dye concentrations were measured by constructing a calibration curve using a uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu japan 2 3 modification of fly ash accurately weighed 50 g fa was dispersed in 160 ml di water 40 ml of 18 m h2so4 was slowly added into the solution while being heated at 95 c and vigorously shaken on a magnetic stirrer until a homogenous solution was formed ph 1 8 after cooling at room temperature the solution was filtered and washed multiple times with di water until the ph of the material reached 7 the material was then dried at 100 c for 12 h to obtain h2so4 modified fa the same procedure was applied with 15 5 m hno3 to obtain hno3 modified fa 2 4 synthesis of tio2 nanoparticles tio2 nanoparticles were synthesized as per the procedure reported earlier 40 the aqueous solution of titanium ammonium carbonate ti nh4 2co3 was prepared by dissolving the desired quantity of titanium v isopropoxide in 17 ml methanol followed by di water addition while the mixture was constantly stirred at 300 rpm after 15 to 20 min of the stirring a white precipitate ti nh4 2co3 was collected via filtration and washed thoroughly with di water multiple times and it was centrifuged to remove any kind of impurities the obtained powder was added to 25 ml 1 6 m aqueous nh4 2co3 solution under constant stirring after stirring for some time the solution turned milky white after that 3 0 ml of 30 h2o2 was added to the milky white solution turning the solution into a clear light yellow solution the resultant solution was then transferred to a teflon walled stainless steel autoclave 100 ml where the hydrothermal treatment was done at 150 c for 6 h the resultant solution was cooled followed by centrifugation via methanol and di water finally the residue was dried overnight at room temperature and subjected to further characterizations 2 5 synthesis of composite adsorbents the composite adsorbents were prepared using the ionotropic gelation method 41 15 g h2so4 modified fa 600 mg tio2 nanoparticles 3 ml acetic acid and 9 g chitosan were added to 300 ml di water the solution was mechanically stirred at 400 rpm until a homogenous solution was obtained the solution was dropped into 1 n naoh solution using a syringe producing spherical beads in the millimetre range the beads were incubated in the naoh solution for 12 h at room temperature the obtained beads were filtered and washed multiple times with di water until the ph reached 7 and dried at 60 c overnight the obtained beads are designated as mfa 1 a similar method was applied with hno3 modified fa and obtained beads are designated as mfa 2 the fa chitosan beads with no surface modification are designated as ufa 2 6 adsorption experiments the details on adsorption experiments performed in this study adsorption kinetics adsorption isotherms and regeneration are provided in esi 3 results and discussion 3 1 material characterizations the morphological characteristics of the raw fa and acid modified fa particles were studied using sem and edax figs 1a 1c the fa fa h2so4 and fa hno3 contained smooth spherical shaped particles of almost similar size acid modified fa was converted into slightly smaller particles due to h2so4 and hno3 activation 42 the increased adsorption capacity of the acid modified fa is expected due to the fa s increased surface area active sites as they converted into small spherical particles fa contained many oxides like cao mgo al2o3 etc which may help and accelerate the absorption characteristics of the fa based beads 43 the presence of these elements was confirmed from the edax figs 1a 1c of the fa and acid modified fa particles the bet surface area pore volume and average pore diameter of the raw fa were determined as 7 1 m2 g 1 0 049 cm3 g 1 and 15 1 nm respectively for the h2so4 acid modified fa the surface area was 1 31 times the raw fa while for hno3 acid modified fa the surface area was 1 26 times the raw fa moreover the surface modification of fa with h2so4 and hno3 increased the pore volume but decreased the average pore volume diameter the total pore volume for raw fa h2so4 and hno3 modified fa was 0 049 0 46 and 0 31 cm3 g 1 respectively similar observations have been reported by other researchers 42 44 fig s1 shows the xrd patterns of raw fa h2so4 and hno3 acid modified there was no significant difference in their xrd patterns all of the diffractograms exhibited narrow diffraction lines which indicated the material was crystalline fa samples showed the crystalline phases attributed to crystalline compositions present in fa material such as quartz icdd pdf 46 1045 and mullite icdd pdf 79 1450 additionally a minor fraction of hematite icdd pdf 33 0664 and magnetite icdd pdf 19 0629 with quartz peak at 2θ 26 8 being the most prominent 45 46 the broad hump that occurred at 2θ 16 68 was attributed to some amorphous material present in fa most likely silica 47 to identify whether a new functional group was attached to the surface of modified fa ft ir spectra of acid modified fa were analysed fig 2 the absorption bands at around 3414 cm 1 were attributed to o h s stretching vibration in the structure the narrow band at 3413 cm 1 was attributed to vibration oh in structural water while the band at around 1629 cm 1 was due to h oh vibration the existence of symmetric and asymmetric al oh band vibrations in the al oh 6 structure of fa was reflected by the band at 794 cm 1 48 the band at 552 cm 1 represented the mullite al2o3 in the fa 49 a band at 1090 cm 1 appeared in the fa spectra due to asymmetric stretching of sio or alo while a low intensity band at 782 cm 1 was due to the presence of quartz sio2 at the same time bands at 1098 cm 1 and 1608 cm 1 were due to si o si asymmetric stretching vibration and h o h bending vibration 48 after the modification with h2so4 and hno3 the band corresponding to 3414 cm 1 became strong and broad the band in the range from 2959 cm 1 to 2869 cm 1 was due to the ch stretch vibrations 49 the sem and edax of the synthesized tio2 nanoparticles are shown in fig 3 the sem image of the tio2 revealed the cubic morphology of the synthesized anatase tio2 the purity of synthesized was confirmed from edax of tio2 nanoparticles fig 3b moreover the particles were monodispersed and uniform in shape and size synthesized tio2 powder xrd spectra exhibited well resolved x ray diffraction peaks fig 3c the xrd peaks of anatase tio2 were indexed to 101 0 0 4 200 105 211 213 and 116 corresponding to to 2θ 25 2 37 8 48 0 54 1 55 2 62 5 and 68 9 respectively 50 51 these crystal planes indicated the high crystalline nature of synthesized tio2 fig 4 shows the sem and edax for mfa 1 composite beads the sem image of the mfa 1 was irregular and rough providing more adsorption sites for cr and mb dye adsorption the edax analysis for mfa 1 was performed to determine the chemical composition the edax analysis showed the presence of all elements of fa and chitosan along with tio2 the xrd patterns of chitosan mfa 1 mfa 2 and ufa chitosan beads are shown in fig 5 the diffraction peaks of chitosan were observed at 2θ 9 8 and 20 1 corresponding to 240 and 273 miller indices 52 these peaks indicated the amorphous and low crystalline nature of the chitosan the ufa retained peaks of both fa and chitosan the diffraction peaks fairly resemble the standard peaks 53 furthermore the diffraction patterns of the mfa 1 and mfa 2 indicate the composition of fa chitosan and tio2 the peaks of chitosan were of low intensity and can be observed at 2θ 9 8 and 20 1 in all the composite beads in the case of mfa 1 and mfa 2 the xrd peaks of the tio2 were observed at 2θ 25 2 37 8 48 0 54 1 and 62 5 the peak intensity of tio2 was lesser than fa because the mfa 1 and mfa 2 composite beads contained less amount of chitosan and tio2 than fa the thermographs of synthesized composite beads are depicted in fig 6 from 30 to 600 c the tga of the mfa 1 revealed a 98 02 residual mass 2 weight loss while for mfa 2 and ufa it was 96 76 and 95 89 residual mass respectively the presence of guest molecules or residual solvent loss of humidity and loss of hydration was responsible for reducing the residual mass of the synthesized beads mfa 1 and mfa 2 decomposed between 280 and 600 c while ufa decomposed between 240 and 600 c at 300 c the mfa 1 and mfa 2 showed dramatically weight loss the tga plots showed the highest thermal stability for mfa 1 up to 300 c and ufa up to 260 c 3 2 adsorption performance the adsorption performances removal efficiency and maximum adsorption capacity of synthesized adsorbents to remove dyes cr and mb from the aqueous solution were assessed and evaluated by varying several kinetic parameters such as ph adsorbent dose contact time and adsorbate concentration 3 2 1 effect of dosage the effect of adsorbent dosages in the range of 0 2 3 g l 1 was evaluated for the adsorption experiments the optimum adsorbent dose was determined using the variable amount of adsorbents dissolved in 10 ml of 20 mg l 1 cr and mb dye solution followed by stirring for 2 h fig 7 demonstrates the adsorption capacity of dyes depending on the adsorbent dose in the solution the curve followed a declining trend indicating the amounts of dye per gram of adsorbent adsorbed were inversely proportional to the adsorbent dose this was attributed to the aggregation of adsorbent particles as the adsorbent dose increased the removal efficiency of dyes increases by increasing the adsorbent dosage 54 this was because the addition of adsorbent provides more surface area and hence more active sites for adsorption to occur the maximum removal efficiency for cr and mb reached 98 and 61 respectively and then the trend gradually stabilized the cr adsorption showed higher removal efficiency and adsorption capacity compared to mb this was attributed to the negative charge of the cr dye 55 ufa and mfa 2 showed lower adsorption capacity and removal efficiency than mfa 1 after 1 g l 1 there was negligible difference in removal efficiency for all adsorbents therefore the optimum adsorbent dose was 1 g l 1 for both cr and mb for all the adsorption experiments 3 2 2 effect of concentration the effect of adsorbate concentration on the removal efficiency of adsorbents was studied at different concentrations 10 to 200 mg l 1 fig 8 when the concentration of the dyes was increased the removal efficiency decreased and the adsorption capacity increased the decrease in removal efficiency with concentration was also observed in the other studies 41 56 when the dye concentration was low the groups on the surface of the adsorbent that provided active adsorption sites were unsaturated and more surface active adsorption sites could quickly adsorb to the dye which shows high removal efficiency when the dye concentration became high the active sites were saturated and a less active surface was available to adsorb the dye hence the extra dye molecules was no longer adsorbed leading to a decrease in the removal efficiency for cr dye the maximum adsorption removal efficiency of mfa 1 mfa 2 and ufa was 99 63 99 16 95 67 and the maximum adsorption capacity of mfa 1 mfa 2 and ufa were 19 93 19 84 and 19 13 mg g 1 respectively for mb dye the maximum adsorption removal efficiency of mfa 1 mfa 2 and ufa was 61 13 58 75 and 53 75 and the maximum adsorption capacity of mfa 1 mfa 2 and ufa was 12 23 11 75 and 10 75 mg g 1 respectively the optimum concentration of the adsorbate selected for further studies was 20 mg l 1 3 2 3 effect of time fig 9 demonstrates the removal efficiency and adsorption capacity of cr and mb dye with respect to adsorbents contact time the adsorption process was investigated with an adsorbate concentration of 1 g l 1 and dye concentration of 20 mg l 1 as these parameters were optimized in earlier sections the adsorption capacity increased with adsorption time and stabilized at a certain level the adsorption time for cr dye gradually stabilized after 2 h and the adsorption rate reached 98 63 97 85 and 95 10 for the adsorbent mfa 1 mfa 2 and ufa respectively for mb dye adsorption time gradually stabilizes after 3 h and the adsorption rate reached 62 13 61 62 and 58 75 for the adsorbent mfa 1 mfa 2 and ufa respectively the adsorption process reached equilibrium because surface adsorption plays a major role in the initial adsorption stage and the active sites are largely occupied this led to the saturation of active sites therefore the dye molecules gradually diffused from the surface to the internal pores resulting in the saturation of adsorbents therefore the optimum contact time was 2 and 3 h respectively for removing cr and mb dye similar trends were also reported in other studies for the dye removal efficiency and the adsorption capacity for dye removal 57 59 3 2 4 effect of ph fig 10 demonstrates the effect of ph on the removal efficiencies of dyes the cr and mb dye solution s ph varied from 2 to 12 as the ph of the solution was raised from 2 to 12 the removal efficiency and adsorption capacity first increased reached a maximum and then decreased gradually with further increment in the solution ph this is in agreement with the previous studies 60 61 the maximum adsorption efficiency of mfa 1 mfa 2 and ufa was 98 85 98 and 94 95 respectively for cr at ph 5 while for the mb the maximum adsorption efficiency of mfa 1 mfa 2 and ufa was 61 58 75 and 54 35 respectively at ph 9 mfa 1 showed higher efficiency than mfa 2 and ufa at ph 5 this was attributed to more surface area h2so4 modified fa resulting in increased adsorption capacity the adsorption efficiency of cr dye in the solution decreased rapidly when the ph was 5 this was because the dye molecules generated a large amount of negative charges due to ionization many hydroxyl ions were adsorbed on the surface of the adsorbent and the electrostatic attraction between the dye and adsorbent became weak therefore the acidic solution favoured the strong adsorption of cr onto the surface of the modified adsorbents moreover al and fe in the adsorbent produced a positive surface charge at low ph which served as appropriate sites to adsorb cr dye molecules on the surface of the adsorbent at lower ph the adsorbent s positively charged silica and alumina at low ph provide insufficient adsorption of mb dye as the mb dye is positively charged for mb dye adsorption efficiency increases with an increase in ph because fa is negatively charged at high ph favouring the adsorption of mb dye 62 the fa modification increased the positive charge in adsorbents which enhanced the adsorption capacity this was because tio2 is coupled with fa and a positive shift was found in adsorbents 63 therefore the adsorption capacity of mfa 1 and mfa 2 was higher than the ufa the optimum ph for cr dye was 5 and for mb dye was 9 for all the adsorbents the removal efficiency for cr dye was higher than mb dye because fa can effectively remove the anionic contaminants from an aqueous solution as established in previous studies 64 this was attributed to the positive surface charge produced by al and fe in the adsorbent which were used as suitable sites to adsorb cr dye molecules on the adsorbent surface the adsorbent s positively charged surface provided a lower adsorption capacity for mb than cr dye as the mb dye is a cationic dye the incorporation of the tio2 to the fa increased the positive charge of adsorbents which enhanced the adsorption capacity of negatively charged dye cr 63 in addition the incorporation of the tio2 provided higher catalytic efficiency than the fa chitosan adsorbent furthermore it increased the photocatalytic regeneration of adsorbents and allowed them to be utilized in several cycles without any thermal or chemical post treatment the inferences drawn from the experiments are discussed in subsequent subsections the comparison of the cr and mb dye adsorption capacity of the synthesized adsorbents in this work with relevant adsorbents reported in the literature is included in table s1 the comparison was made based on the parameters such as adsorption capacity q max adsorbent dose ph and contact time the present study results were comparable with previous works suggesting that cr could be easily adsorbed on synthesized adsorbents prepared in this work however the value of q max for mb is lower than those reported in earlier work this indicates that the synthesized adsorbents are a cheap and effective alternate adsorbent for cr dye adsorption 3 3 adsorption kinetics figs 11 and 12 demonstrate the adsorption kinetics of cr and mb dye on the synthesized adsorbents according to the pfo and pso kinetic model respectively the adsorption of cr and mb dye on the synthesized adsorbents did not follow the pfo kinetic model as the regression coefficients and predicted adsorption capacities were lower than the pso kinetic model the adsorption mechanism followed the pso reaction for cr and mb dyes table 1 lists the adsorption capacities of adsorbents at equilibrium q e and kinetic plot coefficients for cr and mb for the pfo kinetic model the values of r2 were notably smaller than 1 for all the studied adsorbents hence the pfo kinetic model did not fit the experimental data in the case of cr dye the k 2 value was greater than k 1 illustrating the increase in adsorption capacity the smaller value of k 1 in the pfo kinetic model indicated slower adsorption the smaller value of the residual sum of the square and reduced chi square indicated the minimum difference for pso than pfo reaction between the experimental and theoretical values 65 the pso kinetic model possessed a value of r2 close to 1 suggesting the best fit of experimental results in this model the pso model s best fit of the adsorption data suggested that chemisorption was the dominating rate limiting mechanism in the adsorption of dyes 3 4 adsorption isotherm the adsorption isotherms of cr and mb dyes onto the synthesized adsorbents were studied by representing the variation of equilibrium adsorption capacity q e mg g 1 with equilibrium dye concentration mg l 1 according to the langmuir and freundlich model for the adsorption of cr and mb dye represented by figs 13 and 14 respectively the model parameters from langmuir and freundlich adsorption isotherms obtained from non linear regression are presented in table 2 comparing the results presented in table 2 it can be noticed that values of the correlation coefficient r2 of the langmuir linear model for cr and mb dyes were close to 1 these r2 values were higher than the freundlich adsorption isotherm model the residual sum of the square is less for langmuir isotherm than freundlich isotherm for both the dyes cr and mb the fitting of the langmuir isotherm can also be confirmed from the smaller value minimum difference between the theoretical and experimental value of the residual sum of the square langmuir adsorption isotherms suggested the best fit of experimental results in this model which indicated the adsorption was of the monolayer the fitting of langmuir isotherm was due to the homogeneous distribution of the active sites over the surface of the adsorbents 66 the results reported that the homogenous distribution of the active sites on the adsorbent surface was in a monolayer pattern the reduced chi square for the langmuir isotherm was also lower than the freundlich isotherm it was evident that synthesized adsorbent has a minimum difference between experimental and theoretical adsorption capacity in order of mfa 1 mfa 2 ufa with the maximum adsorption capacities of 163 51 160 55 and 154 21 mg g 1 for mfa 1 mfa 2 and ufa respectively for the cr dye at the same time the maximum adsorption capacities of 55 75 52 64 and 35 09 mg g 1 were for mfa 1 mfa 2 and ufa respectively for the mb dye 3 5 photocatalytic regeneration of adsorbent the adsorbent regeneration allows for its reusability and hence increases commercial applications to assess the possible reuse and stability of the adsorbents photocatalytic efficiency was examined for one cycle the photocatalytic regeneration experiments were performed under sunlight with all synthesized adsorbents for both absorbents i e cr and mb fig 15 demonstrates the synthesized adsorbents removal efficiency for cr and mb after regeneration 90 min of photocatalysis the mfa 1 and mfa 2 had higher catalytic efficiency than the ufa as they contained tio2 which is an excellent photocatalytic material the decrease in removal efficiency after regeneration of the tio2 incorporated adsorbents mfa 1 and mfa 2 was less than in regenerated ufa this allows them to be utilized in several cycles without requiring to be regenerated by thermal or chemical means fig s2 shows the ft ir spectra of the cr dye adsorbed and regenerated adsorbent to identify any change in the surface of the adsorbent during the adsorption and regeneration it was observed that there was some difference in the ft ir bands intensities after adsorption and regeneration of composite beads however all the characteristic peaks were retained hence it can be concluded that the composite beads did not undergo much compositional change 3 6 plausible mechanism for dye adsorption and adsorbent regeneration the plausible mechanism of dye adsorption on the composite adsorbent was studied ion exchange and coordination reactions must be considered when determining the adsorption mechanism of any materials in mfa 1 and mfa 2 since tio2 was added in the composite a positive shift in charge was expected in adsorbents which enhanced the adsorption capacity for cr than mb dye the mfa 1 and mfa 2 offered rough surface surface regulation homogeneity and surface area than ufa favouring better adsorption 67 fa adsorbed cr and md dye molecules mainly due to its carbon content and the functional oxide groups such as sio2 and al2o3 62 the silica in acid modified fa at low ph was positively charged while at high ph negatively charged similarly depending on the ph al and fe developed surface charges as a result the al and fe in the adsorbent produced a positive surface charge at low ph which served as appropriate sites to adsorb cr dye molecules on the adsorbent surface at low ph the adsorbent s positively charged silica and alumina at low ph provide inefficient adsorption of mb dye as the mb dye is positively charged as the ph decreased fa would become more positively charged which allowed cr dye molecules to adsorb on the surface leading to enhanced anion exchange adsorption the adsorption onto the mfa 1 followed the pso kinetics and langmuir isotherm model which indicated chemisorption adsorption by forming a monolayer of dyes mb and cr molecules onto mfa 1 since the adsorption of both the dyes cr and mb followed the pso model which indicated the dye molecules were adsorbed in aggregated form the fa present in composite beads was primarily responsible for providing unoccupied sites for adsorbed dye molecules on the other hand the dye molecules aggregated and adsorbed on the chitosan surface tio2 is well known photocatalytic material energy bandgap 3 2 ev 68 which causes the photocatalytic degradation of the dye molecules over the adsorbent surface mfa 1 and mfa 2 the electrons were promoted from the full valence band to the empty conduction band during the photodegradation process by irradiating with sunlight the resulting excitation was responsible for forming the electron hole pairs that bear the ability to delocalize throughout the crystal lattice of tio2 the water molecules get splits into h ion and oh radical by holes while the electron reacts with oxygen molecules to generate superoxide ions further these superoxide ions react with h formed to give hydroperoxyl radicals h2o two hydroperoxyl radicals yield hydrogen peroxide which reacts with superoxide ions yielding hydroxyl free radicals the oxidizing ability of these free radicals is very high the interaction of hydroxyl radicals on adsorbed cr and mb dye molecules on the adsorbent surface caused rapid growth of degradation products through intermediate generation 4 conclusions in this study we synthesised and studied the performance of the photocatalytic tio2 fa chitosan composite beads for cr and mb dye adsorption to enhance the adsorption capacity of the composite fa was modified with acids h2so4 and hno3 the sem images of the beads revealed its irregular and rough surface providing more adsorption sites for dye adsorption fa was converted into small particles due to h2so4 and hno3 activation the tga plots showed the higher thermal stability for mfa 1 and mfa 2 up to 300 c than ufa due to tio2 incorporation the adsorption capacity decreased with dosage attributed to the aggregation of particles the removal efficiency of dye increased by increasing the adsorbent dosage attributed to avalability of more active sites when the contact time was increased the adsorption capacity increased and reached equilibrium for all adsorbents the adsorption efficiency of cr dye in the solution decreased rapidly when the ph was 5 this was because the dye molecules generated a large amount of negative charges due to ionization the al and fe in the adsorbent produced a positive surface charge at low ph suitable sites to adsorb cr dye the adsorbent s positively charged silica and alumina at low ph provided insufficient adsorption of positively charged mb dye the pso kinetic model and langmuir isotherm possessed a greater value of r2 close to unity suggesting the best fit for experimental results in these models the maximum adsorption capacities of 163 51 160 55 and 154 21 mg g 1 for mfa 1 mfa 2 and ufa respectively for the cr dye at the same time the maximum adsorption capacities of 55 75 52 64 and 35 09 mg g 1were for mfa 1 mfa 2 and ufa respectively for the mb dye the incorporation of tio2 inculcated photocatalytic regeneration ability in the composite adsorbents this allowed the adsorbent to be utilized in several cycles without thermal or chemical treatment this study concluded that the proposed adsorbent can be an effective solution for textile

milli q resulting in a final mn concentration ranging from 0 5 to 5 0 mg l the stock solution was prepared by dissolving powdered reagent grade 99 pure mnso4 fisher scientific nj usa in milli q water both the stock solution and sfw remained stable at a ph of 6 the sfw was maintained at room temperature 23 2 c in 60 l tanks open to the atmosphere 2 2 experimental design the experimental design was adapted from previous work done by pourahmad et al 5 two experimental phases were performed including 1 a continuous sorption dissolution column experiment investigating soft water remineralization and mn removal and 2 batch test experiments investigating the effect of the mgo fraction and mn loading on mn removal 2 3 continuous sorption dissolution experiments the first experimental phase aimed to assess the performance of a mixed caco3 mgo contactor in attaining both remineralization and mn removal targets a schematic of the column installation is illustrated in fig 1 in order to compare the data obtained from these assays with our previous study of a pure calcite column the design and operation of the column experiments was replicated and can be found in greater detail in our previous study 5 two columns were filled to an 80 cm bed height with ratios of media prepared by weight and were backwashed with a pure water feed for 2 h prior to switching to the sfw feeds the filters were operated upflow at 2 27 m h and water samples were taken at 5 and 20 min of empty bed contact time ebct the latter being equivalent to the fully treated water exiting the column the first column was fed with sfw with 0 5 mg mn l while the second one treated sfw with 5 mg mn l several different mass ratios of calcite mgo media 100 0 90 10 80 20 were first tested for 72 h upon which the ratio of 95 5 was selected for a 720 hour installation to observe the column operation over longer term this paper presents the results of the 720 hour column experiment as well as batch test results

operation and following an additional 72 h switched to an ultra pure water feed used media was collected from the column treating 5 mg mn l at a range of column depths for surface analysis using scanning electron microscope sem energy dispersive x ray analysis edx and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps sem images were taken at 1000 magnification using a field emission gun electron microscope jms 7600 feg sem jelo usa an energy dispersive spectrometer oxford x max silicon drift detector oxford instrument uk was connected to the microscope to perform the elemental analysis of the surface of the media edx at the same magnification as the sem analysis 1000 using a 15 kv accelerating voltage and a 12 mm working distance xps was performed using the al kα micro focused monochromator as an x ray source thermo scientific k alpha thermofisher usa with a 400 μm spot size and standard lens mode these analyses served to characterize the media after mn loading to compare the nature of the deposits on the mgo surfaces to those found on calcite the quantity of mn loading was determined after digesting 1 g of pre weighted rinsed dried media standard method 3050b by progressive heating and the addition of hno3 and hcl manganese concentrations were measured using icp ms following the digestion 2 6 batch sorption precipitation experiments on mn loaded media the effect of mgo ratio and mn loading on media dissolution and sorption was investigated using batch experiments at 23 2 c the batch tests were operated with 10 g l of mn loaded media and were flushed with n2 gas before being closed to the atmosphere tests were repeated with increasing aqueous manganese concentrations 0 0 0 1 and 1 0 mg mn l and were continuously shaken at 175 rpm for a duration of 48 h samples were taken periodically with a syringe 0 25 h 1 h 8 h 24 h and 48 h and analyzed to determine ph dic alkalinity mn ca and mg using the methods described previously additionally ph and dissolved oxygen do hach usa were measured continuously online to capture the rapid ph response upon introduction of the media to the solution and to monitor the effect of do on mnox species 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of mgo on the ph of the effluent and mn removal kinetic our results confirm that the addition of only 5 w w mgo in the media blend increases the ph response significantly over 720 h of operation the pure calcite column produced treated water with ph values between 8 6 and 8 8 5 whereas the columns containing 5 mgo produced effluents with a ph around 10 5 fig 2 in preliminary column tests the addition of 5 mgo at 2 27 m h ebct 20 min produced an over corrected ph thereby exceeding the health canada recommended maximal ph of 10 5 for potable water in the industry mgo media is advertised as capable of neutralizing up to 5 times more acidity than caco3 22 upon introducing a mgo fraction an initial spike is also observed in the total alkalinity total hardness and to a lesser extent ph data this is despite performing a backwash of the filter with 6 bed volumes prior to the start of the assay notably results for the pure calcite contactor did not exhibit the same trend we might therefore expect these high values to be the result of mgo impurities such that ph alkalinity and hardness are initially controlled by a small percentage of more soluble fractions i e cao at the beginning of column operation a similar observation was made by rötting and co workers who documented a ph spike above 12 before decreasing to 11 using a column containing 25 mgo tobias s 23 interestingly compared to a pure calcite filter the addition of mgo also accelerated mn removal kinetics such that effluent manganese concentrations were reduced from 5 mg mn l to below 0 02 mg mn l within the first 24 h of operation fig 2b in comparison the 100 calcite contactor required 10 days of operation to achieve this objective 3 2 effect of mgo on hardness addition previously the pure calcite column treating 5 mg mn l experienced a remineralization breakthrough after 600 h due to the build up of a diffusion barrier caused by mn coating in the mixed media contactor effluent hardness remained close to 30 mg caco3 l at the end of operation despite a gradual decrease after 144 h fig 3 fig 3 illustrates that this decrease is due to a decrease in aqueous mg2 whereas the contribution of the ca2 to total hardness remains relatively stable throughout the duration of the operation this suggests that mgo acts as a preferred reaction surface in the mixed media column and consequently experiences more mn loading than calcite this hypothesis is further investigated in section 3 5 when we discuss media characterization 3 3 effect of initial mn concentration on long term operation of a mixed media contactor column experiments treated feedwaters of 0 5 and 5 mg mn l respectively for both tested conditions the pure calcite contactor and the mixed media contactor were able to remove over 95 of dissolved mn from the sfw producing an effluent concentration below the target value of 0 02 mg mn l however as pourahmad et al mentioned treating high concentrations of mn causes a decrease in remineralization for the pure calcite column after 600 h of operation 5 the observed hardness decline was proposed to be due to the effect of mnox present on the calcite surface a statement supported by edx analysis consequently it was determined that after the long term operation of the contactor the accumulation of solid phase mn at the calcite surface impeded calcite dissolution through a diffusion barrier at the mass transfer boundary layer however with the addition of mgo the negative impact of high influent mn concentrations is diminished in fact the mixed media filter was able to reduce both influent concentrations to below target levels within 24 h while maintaining the total hardness addition close to the target value of 30 mg caco3 l figs 2b and 3 this suggests that the high ph induced by the dissolution of mgo favours a higher kinetic rate or a different removal mechanism i e direct precipitation vs sorption on preformed mnox deposits furthermore this leads to an interrogation of the importance of homogeneous precipitation precipitation by nucleation or heterogeneous precipitation precipitation by crystal growth in the mixed media filter the latter occurs at a higher supersaturation index and has been hypothesized to help limit the effect of media coating which is often accompanied by a decrease in hydraulic conductivity 24 3 4 effect of empty bed contact time on contactor performance in the contactor process the dissolution reaction ideally reaches equilibrium before leaving the bed in order to maximize effluent remineralization for this purpose the recommended ebct for a calcite contactor ranges from 10 to 30 min 25 at an ebct of 20 min the column design presented in this work was able to produce an effluent that met the treatment target values in practice it is recommended to adjust the contactor flow conditions such that the ebct is reduced and ph over correction is avoided when using mgo for the tested conditions ebct does not appear to have a significant impact on ph or dic the dissolution of media at the entrance of the column rapidly corrects the ph of the soft influent water and the mgo fraction which explains why we reduced mgo to 5 by weight to further constrain the ph response upon closer investigation total alkalinity measurements exhibited a visible increase from 5 min of ebct to the effluent measurement when operating with 5 mgo if the total alkalinity is considered to be the sum of hco 3 co 3 2 and oh species this increase can be attributed to the presence of a significant fraction of hydroxide alkalinity due to high ph given that at ph 11 the concentration of oh is equivalent to 50 mg caco3 l of alkalinity fig 4 in contrast if we associate carbonate alkalinity primarily with the dissolution of calcite and therefore the introduction of calcium ions into solution both varied minimally with ebct one possible explanation for this is that calcite dissolution is most significant at the entrance of the column prior to the increase in ph whereas the progression of the dissolution reaction for mgo is less impeded by the high column ph after 5 min of ebct based on dissolution theory it was expected that a mixed media column would be unable to attain equilibrium for both minerals inevitably the mixed media column will produce water that is under saturated with respect to either caco3 or mgo due primarily to the impact of ph on their respective equilibrium dynamics 3 5 media characterization fresh caco3 and mgo media were analyzed by sem edx and xps as well as one sample of mixed media collected after long term operation with a 5 mg mn l influent in comparison to fresh media surfaces 0 mg mn l we can see that used media surfaces exhibit distinct crystals and precipitates fig 5a for both media the decrease in mn phases corresponds to samples taken at increasing ebct or higher up the column confirming that mn removal occurs primarily at the entrance of the contactor this also corresponds well with the distinct colour change that was seen during the operation of the contactor where the media at the entrance of the column turned brown black most manganese oxide minerals are brown black and identifying the particular mineral can be a challenge high resolution xps analysis confirms the presence of mn2p spectra which implies the presence of mno2 mn2o3 and or mno oh as seen in fig 5b mn loaded surfaces also produce o1s and mg1s spectra which correspond to the mgo surface and the crystallization of magnesium carbonates table 2 previously comparable surface analyses of media from a pure caco3 column led to the hypotheses that mn sorption is initiated by an ion exchange reaction between aqueous mn2 and ca2 from the caco3 matrix followed by the slow recrystallization of mnco3 into mno2 5 manganese removal using mgo has been suggested to be controlled by the rapid oxidation of mn2 at high solution ph and subsequent precipitation of mn3 phases 16 26 tobias s 23 the authors used ph based calculations which predicted mno oh and mno2 phases as oversaturated or close to equilibrium and cortina and co workers successfully identified mn3o4 and mno oh precipitates by xrd 26 3 6 mn sorption isotherm and kinetics fig 6a compares the mn removal kinetics in a batch reactor containing fresh or mn loaded media from the 72 hour column experiments in the absence of mgo mn loading on calcite media 5 mg mn g sample improved the reaction kinetics as well as increasing mn removal by 36 over 48 h however both fresh and mn loaded calcite displayed slower reaction kinetics than either fresh mgo or mn loaded mixed media 5 mg mn g sample which attained a stable sorption regime within the hour the convergence of different mgo fractions with mn loaded calcite at 76 removal suggests that the presence of mn phases on the used media surfaces contributes to long term mn removal regardless of varying mgo content nevertheless the ratio of mgo available for dissolution and the corresponding increase of solution ph likely remains an important kinetic factor in fact fig 6b illustrates that increasing the mgo fraction from 5 to 20 accelerates the removal of mn within the first 15 min of operation with the aim of further investigating the effect of ph on mn removal a negative control test was performed in which the ph of the batch test solution was increased without the addition of media fig 6b illustrates that mn precipitation is minimal within the ph range 7 0 9 6 black open symbols but that 99 removal is achieved within 1 5 h when the ph is increased to 10 2 red open symbols in the presence of media we can therefore assume that ph induced precipitation from the aqueous phase does not significantly impact mn removal for either fresh or mn loaded caco3 final ph 9 5 10 in comparison fresh mgo and the mn loaded mixed media containing 5 20 mgo buffer the solution to a final ph which is above 10 2 at these conditions we would predict an almost complete removal of aqueous mn by precipitation instead the batch tests stabilize at 90 and 76 removal respectively one possible explanation for this is that the introduction of as little as 5 mgo causes the precipitation of a fraction of the aqueous mn phase into mn hydroxide and carbonate particles due to high solution ph while solid mn phase sorption controls removal kinetics once the aqueous phase has been significantly reduced this partial precipitation mechanism could account for the increased removal kinetic within the first 8 h of operation in comparison to pure calcite with the same concentration of solid mn phase as mentioned the presence of solid mn phases on used media surfaces accelerates the rate of mn removal in batch tests for pure calcite the formation of this coating was hypothesized to improve mn removal due to the autocatalytic nature of the adsorption oxidation of dissolved manganese by mnox 5 it is difficult to distinguish if the precipitation of divalent metals as me hydroxides occurs as direct nucleation on the brucite surface i e hydrated mgo surface or if they are formed within the fluid boundary layer before attaching 20 in their work hövelmann and co workers suggested among several possible reaction pathways the aggregation of metal nanoparticles on the mg oh 2 surface and the consequent crystallization transformation of these aggregates into a distinct precipitate surface these precipitation nuclei can then serve to further remove dissolved me2 species through ion by ion growth or by the sorption of oxidated colloidal particles present in the fluid boundary layer 20 in the presence of mgo which rapidly hydrates to mg oh 2 we might therefore expect that mn removal is not only improved due to ph induced precipitation but that the removal kinetic is also gradually improving during column operation due to the increased presence of precipitation nuclei on both caco3 and mgo media surfaces 4 conclusion this work aimed to determine the role of mgo in a mixed media contactor with the hypothesis that the media improves remineralization and mn removal over long term operation the main findings are summarized as follows over 720 h of operation the mixed media contactor with a 5 mgo ratio was shown to maintain effluent hardness levels of close to 30 mg caco3 l and to remove aqueous mn concentrations to below 0 02 mg mn l the decrease in remineralization observed at 600 h for pure caco3 was mitigated with the addition of mgo when treating high divalent metal concentrations 5 mg mn l the presence of mgo accelerates and improves mn removal in comparison to treatment with pure caco3 the addition of as little as 5 mgo increases the ph up to 10 5 which introduces a significant precipitation mechanism as mn2 is oxidized however batch test results suggest that removal may still be governed by a sorption coprecipitation reaction over the long term operation as the stable sorption regime of mn loaded mixed media converges with that of calcite media with the same concentration of mn coating 5 mg mn g media for the tested conditions surface analyses confirm that mn sorption is favoured by the mgo surface which measured 10 times higher solid phase mn concentrations than found on used caco3 media samples further work is required in order to better understand the numerous reaction pathways in a mixed media contactor system it would also be of particular interest to explore the treatment capacity of a mixed media contactor for waters

milli q resulting in a final mn concentration ranging from 0 5 to 5 0 mg l the stock solution was prepared by dissolving powdered reagent grade 99 pure mnso4 fisher scientific nj usa in milli q water both the stock solution and sfw remained stable at a ph of 6 the sfw was maintained at room temperature 23 2 c in 60 l tanks open to the atmosphere 2 2 experimental design the experimental design was adapted from previous work done by pourahmad et al 5 two experimental phases were performed including 1 a continuous sorption dissolution column experiment investigating soft water remineralization and mn removal and 2 batch test experiments investigating the effect of the mgo fraction and mn loading on mn removal 2 3 continuous sorption dissolution experiments the first experimental phase aimed to assess the performance of a mixed caco3 mgo contactor in attaining both remineralization and mn removal targets a schematic of the column installation is illustrated in fig 1 in order to compare the data obtained from these assays with our previous study of a pure calcite column the design and operation of the column experiments was replicated and can be found in greater detail in our previous study 5 two columns were filled to an 80 cm bed height with ratios of media prepared by weight and were backwashed with a pure water feed for 2 h prior to switching to the sfw feeds the filters were operated upflow at 2 27 m h and water samples were taken at 5 and 20 min of empty bed contact time ebct the latter being equivalent to the fully treated water exiting the column the first column was fed with sfw with 0 5 mg mn l while the second one treated sfw with 5 mg mn l several different mass ratios of calcite mgo media 100 0 90 10 80 20 were first tested for 72 h upon which the ratio of 95 5 was selected for a 720 hour installation to observe the column operation over longer term this paper presents the results of the 720 hour column experiment as well as batch test results

perkin elmer usa total hardness was then calculated using the measured concentrations of dissolved ca2 and mg2 calculation method 2340 b 2 5 characterization of mn loaded media after 720 h of operation and following an additional 72 h switched to an ultra pure water feed used media was collected from the column treating 5 mg mn l at a range of column depths for surface analysis using scanning electron microscope sem energy dispersive x ray analysis edx and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps sem images were taken at 1000 magnification using a field emission gun electron microscope jms 7600 feg sem jelo usa an energy dispersive spectrometer oxford x max silicon drift detector oxford instrument uk was connected to the microscope to perform the elemental analysis of the surface of the media edx at the same magnification as the sem analysis 1000 using a 15 kv accelerating voltage and a 12 mm working distance xps was performed using the al kα micro focused monochromator as an x ray source thermo scientific k alpha thermofisher usa with a 400 μm spot size and standard lens mode these analyses served to characterize the media after mn loading to compare the nature of the deposits on the mgo surfaces to those found on calcite the quantity of mn loading was determined after digesting 1 g of pre weighted rinsed dried media standard method 3050b by progressive heating and the addition of hno3 and hcl manganese concentrations were measured using icp ms following the digestion 2 6 batch sorption precipitation experiments on mn loaded media the effect of mgo ratio and mn loading on media dissolution and sorption was investigated using batch experiments at 23 2 c the batch tests were operated with 10 g l of mn loaded media and were flushed with n2 gas before being closed to the atmosphere tests were repeated with increasing aqueous manganese concentrations 0 0 0 1 and 1 0 mg mn l and were continuously shaken at 175 rpm for a duration of 48 h samples were taken periodically with a syringe 0 25 h 1 h 8 h 24 h and 48 h and analyzed to determine ph dic alkalinity mn ca and mg using the methods described previously additionally ph and dissolved oxygen do hach usa were measured continuously online to capture the rapid ph response upon introduction of the media to the solution and to monitor the effect of do on mnox species 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of mgo on the ph of the effluent and mn removal kinetic our results confirm that the addition of only 5 w w mgo in the media blend increases the ph response significantly over 720 h of operation the pure calcite column produced treated water with ph values between 8 6 and 8 8 5 whereas the columns containing 5 mgo produced effluents with a ph around 10 5 fig 2 in preliminary column tests the addition of 5 mgo at 2 27 m h ebct 20 min produced an over corrected ph thereby exceeding the health canada recommended maximal ph of 10 5 for potable water in the industry mgo media is advertised as capable of neutralizing up to 5 times more acidity than caco3 22 upon introducing a mgo fraction an initial spike is also observed in the total alkalinity total hardness and to a lesser extent ph data this is despite performing a backwash of the filter with 6 bed volumes prior to the start of the assay notably results for the pure calcite contactor did not exhibit the same trend we might therefore expect these high values to be the result of mgo impurities such that ph alkalinity and hardness are initially controlled by a small percentage of more soluble fractions i e cao at the beginning of column operation a similar observation was made by rötting and co workers who documented a ph spike above 12 before decreasing to 11 using a column containing 25 mgo tobias s 23 interestingly compared to a pure calcite filter the addition of mgo also accelerated mn removal kinetics such that effluent manganese concentrations were reduced from 5 mg mn l to below 0 02 mg mn l within the first 24 h of operation fig 2b in comparison the 100 calcite contactor required 10 days of operation to achieve this objective 3 2 effect of mgo on hardness addition previously the pure calcite column treating 5 mg mn l experienced a remineralization breakthrough after 600 h due to the build up of a diffusion barrier caused by mn coating in the mixed media contactor effluent hardness remained close to 30 mg caco3 l at the end of operation despite a gradual decrease after 144 h fig 3 fig 3 illustrates that this decrease is due to a decrease in aqueous mg2 whereas the contribution of the ca2 to total hardness remains relatively stable throughout the duration of the operation this suggests that mgo acts as a preferred reaction surface in the mixed media column and consequently experiences more mn loading than calcite this hypothesis is further investigated in section 3 5 when we discuss media characterization 3 3 effect of initial mn concentration on long term operation of a mixed media contactor column experiments treated feedwaters of 0 5 and 5 mg mn l respectively for both tested conditions the pure calcite contactor and the mixed media contactor were able to remove over 95 of dissolved mn from the sfw producing an effluent concentration below the target value of 0 02 mg mn l however as pourahmad et al mentioned treating high concentrations of mn causes a decrease in remineralization for the pure calcite column after 600 h of operation 5 the observed hardness decline was proposed to be due to the effect of mnox present on the calcite surface a statement supported by edx analysis consequently it was determined that after the long term operation of the contactor the accumulation of solid phase mn at the calcite surface impeded calcite dissolution through a diffusion barrier at the mass transfer boundary layer however with the addition of mgo the negative impact of high influent mn concentrations is diminished in fact the mixed media filter was able to reduce both influent concentrations to below target levels within 24 h while maintaining the total hardness addition close to the target value of 30 mg caco3 l figs 2b and 3 this suggests that the high ph induced by the dissolution of mgo favours a higher kinetic rate or a different removal mechanism i e direct precipitation vs sorption on preformed mnox deposits furthermore this leads to an interrogation of the importance of homogeneous precipitation precipitation by nucleation or heterogeneous precipitation precipitation by crystal growth in the mixed media filter the latter occurs at a higher supersaturation index and has been hypothesized to help limit the effect of media coating which is often accompanied by a decrease in hydraulic conductivity 24 3 4 effect of empty bed contact time on contactor performance in the contactor process the dissolution reaction ideally reaches equilibrium before leaving the bed in order to maximize effluent remineralization for this purpose the recommended ebct for a calcite contactor ranges from 10 to 30 min 25 at an ebct of 20 min the column design presented in this work was able to produce an effluent that met the treatment target values in practice it is recommended to adjust the contactor flow conditions such that the ebct is reduced and ph over correction is avoided when using mgo for the tested conditions ebct does not appear to have a significant impact on ph or dic the dissolution of media at the entrance of the column rapidly corrects the ph of the soft influent water and the mgo fraction which explains why we reduced mgo to 5 by weight to further constrain the ph response upon closer investigation total alkalinity measurements exhibited a visible increase from 5 min of ebct to the effluent measurement when operating with 5 mgo if the total alkalinity is considered to be the sum of hco 3 co 3 2 and oh species this increase can be attributed to the presence of a significant fraction of hydroxide alkalinity due to high ph given that at ph 11 the concentration of oh is equivalent to 50 mg caco3 l of alkalinity fig 4 in contrast if we associate carbonate alkalinity primarily with the dissolution of calcite and therefore the introduction of calcium ions into solution both varied minimally with ebct one possible explanation for this is that calcite dissolution is most significant at the entrance of the column prior to the increase in ph whereas the progression of the dissolution reaction for mgo is less impeded by the high column ph after 5 min of ebct based on dissolution theory it was expected that a mixed media column would be unable to attain equilibrium for both minerals inevitably the mixed media column will produce water that is under saturated with respect to either caco3 or mgo due primarily to the impact of ph on their respective equilibrium dynamics 3 5 media characterization fresh caco3 and mgo media were analyzed by sem edx and xps as well as one sample of mixed media collected after long term operation with a 5 mg mn l influent in comparison to fresh media surfaces 0 mg mn l we can see that used media surfaces exhibit distinct crystals and precipitates fig 5a for both media the decrease in mn phases corresponds to samples taken at increasing ebct or higher up the column confirming that mn removal occurs primarily at the entrance of the contactor this also corresponds well with the distinct colour change that was seen during the operation of the contactor where the media at the entrance of the column turned brown black most manganese oxide minerals are brown black and identifying the particular mineral can be a challenge high resolution xps analysis confirms the presence of mn2p spectra which implies the presence of mno2 mn2o3 and or mno oh as seen in fig 5b mn loaded surfaces also produce o1s and mg1s spectra which correspond to the mgo surface and the crystallization of magnesium carbonates table 2 previously comparable surface analyses of media from a pure caco3 column led to the hypotheses that mn sorption is initiated by an ion exchange reaction between aqueous mn2 and ca2 from the caco3 matrix followed by the slow recrystallization of mnco3 into mno2 5 manganese removal using mgo has been suggested to be controlled by the rapid oxidation of mn2 at high solution ph and subsequent precipitation of mn3 phases 16 26 tobias s 23 the authors used ph based calculations which predicted mno oh and mno2 phases as oversaturated or close to equilibrium and cortina and co workers successfully identified mn3o4 and mno oh precipitates by xrd 26 3 6 mn sorption isotherm and kinetics fig 6a compares the mn removal kinetics in a batch reactor containing fresh or mn loaded media from the 72 hour column experiments in the absence of mgo mn loading on calcite media 5 mg mn g sample improved the reaction kinetics as well as increasing mn removal by 36 over 48 h however both fresh and mn loaded calcite displayed slower reaction kinetics than either fresh mgo or mn loaded mixed media 5 mg mn g sample which attained a stable sorption regime within the hour the convergence of different mgo fractions with mn loaded calcite at 76 removal suggests that the presence of mn phases on the used media surfaces contributes to long term mn removal regardless of varying mgo content nevertheless the ratio of mgo available for dissolution and the corresponding increase of solution ph likely remains an important kinetic factor in fact fig 6b illustrates that increasing the mgo fraction from 5 to 20 accelerates the removal of mn within the first 15 min of operation with the aim of further investigating the effect of ph on mn removal a negative control test was performed in which the ph of the batch test solution was increased without the addition of media fig 6b illustrates that mn precipitation is minimal within the ph range 7 0 9 6 black open symbols but that 99 removal is achieved within 1 5 h when the ph is increased to 10 2 red open symbols in the presence of media we can therefore assume that ph induced precipitation from the aqueous phase does not significantly impact mn removal for either fresh or mn loaded caco3 final ph 9 5 10 in comparison fresh mgo and the mn loaded mixed media containing 5 20 mgo buffer the solution to a final ph which is above 10 2 at these conditions we would predict an almost complete removal of aqueous mn by precipitation instead the batch tests stabilize at 90 and 76 removal respectively one possible explanation for this is that the introduction of as little as 5 mgo causes the precipitation of a fraction of the aqueous mn phase into mn hydroxide and carbonate particles due to high solution ph while solid mn phase sorption controls removal kinetics once the aqueous phase has been significantly reduced this partial precipitation mechanism could account for the increased removal kinetic within the first 8 h of operation in comparison to pure calcite with the same concentration of solid mn phase as mentioned the presence of solid mn phases on used media surfaces accelerates the rate of mn removal in batch tests for pure calcite the formation of this coating was hypothesized to improve mn removal due to the autocatalytic nature of the adsorption oxidation of dissolved manganese by mnox 5 it is difficult to distinguish if the precipitation of divalent metals as me hydroxides occurs as direct nucleation on the brucite surface i e hydrated mgo surface or if they are formed within the fluid boundary layer before attaching 20 in their work hövelmann and co workers suggested among several possible reaction pathways the aggregation of metal nanoparticles on the mg oh 2 surface and the consequent crystallization transformation of these aggregates into a distinct precipitate surface these precipitation nuclei can then serve to further remove dissolved me2 species through ion by ion growth or by the sorption of oxidated colloidal particles present in the fluid boundary layer 20 in the presence of mgo which rapidly hydrates to mg oh 2 we might therefore expect that mn removal is not only improved due to ph induced precipitation but that the removal kinetic is also gradually improving during column operation due to the increased presence of precipitation nuclei on both caco3 and mgo media surfaces 4 conclusion this work aimed to determine the role of mgo in a mixed media contactor with the hypothesis that the media improves remineralization and mn removal over long term operation the main findings are summarized as follows over 720 h of operation the mixed media contactor with a 5 mgo ratio was shown to maintain effluent hardness levels of close to 30 mg caco3 l and to remove aqueous mn concentrations to below 0 02 mg mn l the decrease in remineralization observed at 600 h for pure caco3 was mitigated with the addition of mgo when treating high divalent metal concentrations 5 mg mn l the presence of mgo accelerates and improves mn removal in comparison to treatment with pure caco3 the addition of as little as 5 mgo increases the ph up to 10 5 which introduces a significant precipitation mechanism as mn2 is oxidized however batch test results suggest that removal may still be governed by a sorption coprecipitation reaction over the long term operation as the stable sorption regime of mn loaded mixed media converges with that of calcite media with the same concentration of mn coating 5 mg mn g media for the tested conditions surface analyses confirm that mn sorption is favoured by the mgo surface which measured 10 times higher solid phase mn concentrations than found on used caco3 media samples further work is required in order to better understand the numerous reaction pathways in a mixed media contactor system it would also be of particular interest to explore the treatment capacity of a mixed media contactor for waters
