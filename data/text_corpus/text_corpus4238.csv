21190,the 1978 ittc power prediction method is used to predict the propulsive power of ships through towing tank testing the form factor approach and its determination in this method have been questioned this paper investigates the possibility to improve the power predictions by introducing combined cfd efd method where the experimental determination of form factor is replaced by double body rans computations applied for open cases kvlcc2 and kcs including first time published towing tank tests of kvlcc2 at ballast condition including an experimental uncertainty analysis specifically derived for the form factor computations from nine organisations and seven cfd codes are compared to the experiments the form factor predictions for both hulls in design loading condition compared well with the experimental results in general for the kvlcc2 ballast condition majority of the form factors were under predicted while staying within the experimental uncertainty speed dependency is observed with the application of ittc57 line but it is reduced with the katsui line and nearly eliminated by numerical friction lines comparison of the full scale viscous resistance predictions obtained by the extrapolations from model scale and direct full scale computations show that the combined cfd efd method show significantly less scatter and may thus be a preferred approach keywords ship resistance form factor cfd scale effects combined cfd efd methods experimental uncertainty analysis 1 introduction performance prediction of a ship is one of the most important tasks during the design phase as a ship design progresses from beginning to end the required confidence interval for the prediction method increases according to the majority of commercial tendencies presented by shipyards and ship owners towing tank tests are still considered as the last step of the performance prediction additionally legal authorities consider towing tank testing as a mandatory step in their evaluations such as eedi calculations as enforced by imo 2011 where the applicable ships must go through the pre verification by model testing during the design phase of a new ship towing tank testing has remained as the only practice for more than a century with high accuracy to predict the performance of a ship in deep and calm water since william froude introduced the extrapolation procedures in the 1870s the foundation of the international towing tank committee ittc in 1933 lead to improved and standardized procedures in nearly all aspects of performance prediction an important step towards a common prediction method was taken in 1973 when computer programs with different assumptions and extrapolation methods were created by sspa as requested by the ittc lindgren and dyne 1980 ten institutions known to have access to sea trials for different types of ships evaluated each method by starting from their model test results to calculate the shaft power and propeller rate of revolution ittc 1978 the 1978 ittc performance prediction method emerged as a result of comparing approximately one thousand sea trials to model test predictions and it is still in effect after going through several revisions even though towing tank testing and extrapolation methods have been debated discussed and improved over decades there are inherent and well known shortcomings due to scale effects since model tests are carried out at froude similarity while reynolds similarity cannot be fulfilled simultaneously in order to limit the effects of the shortcomings towing tank facilities must rely on experience and large databases of both model tests and sea trials computational fluid dynamics cfd has been seen as an alternative to towing tank testing because of cfd s ability to fulfill both froude and reynolds similarities while providing a great deal of detail about the flow however the accuracy of cfd on prediction of full scale performance is still under concern even though several studies presented by sun et al 2020 and niklas and pruszko 2019 demonstrated that full scale simulations can provide similar or better power predictions than towing tank experiments the results from reynolds averaged navier stokes rans solvers in full scale is highly dependent on the computational set up e g the choice of turbulence model and modelling of hull roughness the results of lloyd s register workshop on ship scale hydrodynamics ponkratov 2016 also confirmed that differences between the numerical setups can lead to very diverse predictions on both power and propeller turning rate unlike the limited full scale verification and validation v v studies mainly due to lack of full scale test data assessment of state of the art in cfd methods in model scale has been a well established practice since 1980 larsson et al 2014 according to the resistance statistics of larsson et al 2014 the mean comparison error in per cent of the measured data value is 1 7 and 1 3 for kvlcc2 and kcs in fixed trim and sinkage condition while the standard deviations are 1 3 and 1 2 of the data value respectively it was also noted that the mean comparison error and standard deviation in self propelled cases are considerably higher than those in the resistance cases larsson et al 2014 as identified by the combined cfd efd methods ittc specialist committee combination of efd and cfd could be a feasible solution to increase the accuracy of power predictions instead of choosing efd or cfd for the time being if a part of the model testing or extrapolation procedure causes higher uncertainty than the numerical uncertainty and physical modelling errors of the cfd applications accuracy will be increased in the 1978 ittc performance prediction method the form factor has been identified by the specialist committee as one of the major causes of uncertainties due to the prohaska method prohaska 1966 and scale effects on form factor for the determination of full scale resistance of ships form factor determination method suggested by prohaska 1966 was recommended by 14th ittc meeting ittc 1975 when standardized performance prediction procedures were formulated and debated during the formulation of the 1978 ittc power prediction method the form factor concept was found superior to 2 d methods such as the 1957 power prediction method as it led to a better ship model correlation ittc 1978 the form factor determination method remained as the prohaska method however the main issue with the prohaska method was described by the ittc as stated below the problems of ships with partly submerged bulbous bows and the effects of wave breaking resistance for blunt bow forms need further consideration in both cases it is probably advisable to lower the speed limits future developments for the determination of form factors on a more scientific basis is expected from the resistance committee ittc 1978 in the 1978 ittc power prediction method the form factor concept of hughes 1954 was adopted it suggests that viscous resistance of a ship can be expressed in relation to a two dimensional turbulent friction line and the form factor is independent of reynolds number as it will be explained in more detail in section 2 the prohaska method can be replaced by model scale double body cfd computations which is one of the least numerically complicated cfd applications since modelling of propulsors free surface and roughness are omitted after the form factor determination method the second error source was identified as the scale effects or speed dependency on form factor when the 1978 ittc method was accepted there has been substantial evidence on the scale effects on form factor with ittc 57 line ittc 1978 further re analysis of geosim test data performed by garcía gómez 2000 and toki 2008 confirmed the scale effects additionally cfd studies performed by pereira et al 2017 showed that the speed dependency of form factors with the ittc 57 line were larger than the numerical uncertainties terziev tezdogan and incecik 2019 also showed that form factor is reynolds number dependent and additionally suggested that the form factor varies with froude number the cfd investigations presented by raven et al 2008 wang et al 2015 dogrul et al 2020 and korkmaz werner and bensow 2019a supported the existence of scale effects or speed dependency on form factor and indicated that the main cause of the scale effects are due to the ittc 57 model ship correlation line rather than the hypothesis of hughes 1954 cfd based form factor methods were investigated by korkmaz et al 2019a and wang et al 2019 in further detail for sensitivity of form factor to grid density and type speed dependency presence of rudder sinkage and trim the latter investigation also demonstrated that cfd based form factors correlated better with the sea trials compared to the prohaska method as a continuation of the initial study started by the combined cfd efd methods specialist committee in this paper cfd based form factor methods have been investigated as an alternative method to the prohaska method kvlcc2 in design and ballast loading condition kcs in design loading condition are computed at two speeds at both model and full scale the model tests of kvlcc2 in ballast loading condition performed at sspa s towing tank and the resistance data together with the measurement uncertainty analysis is presented for the first time in the literature wide range of cfd methods and setups are compared with the contribution from 9 different organisations and 7 different cfd codes in order to quantify the sensitivity of different cfd approaches on form factor non ideal cfd setups are also computed and discussed the scale effects on the form factor are presented by using the friction line proposed by katsui et al 2005 and numerical friction lines suggested by korkmaz et al 2019b in comparison to form factor based on the ittc 57 model ship correlation line the following research questions are aimed to be answered by this study can cfd based form factors with state of the art cfd codes be an alternative or supplement to the prohaska method which cfd methods and setups are not fit for reliable cfd based form factor predictions can the scale effects on form factor be prevented should the full scale simulations replace the extrapolation methods for full scale resistance predictions this paper is structured as follows section 2 describes the background of the form factor concept and its determination by experimental methods the flow solvers numerical methods computational domain and boundary conditions procedure of cfd based form factor calculation are presented in section 3 the computational conditions and details of the kvlcc2 towing tank tests in ballast condition are presented in section 4 in section 5 results and discussions are presented and conclusions are summarized in section 6 2 background of the form factor concept and experimental determination methods the form factor concept has been long discussed since the early 20 t h century ittc 1957 stated that ship resistance extrapolation based on three dimensional analysis such as form factor approach has been considered when the ittc 1957 line was selected in fact some researchers believed that a two dimensional flow line is not sufficient for the extrapolation problem ittc 1957 but rather that each hull form requires a separate extrapolator such as hughes 1954 the definition of form factor as described by hughes was adopted by the ittc 1972 and it is still in practice the wave making resistance depends on the froude number and at low speeds it becomes negligible for most hulls thus in carefully conducted experiments where care is taken with regard to turbulence stimulation measurement accuracy at low speeds and good surface finish a point in the c t curve can be found from this point towards smaller froude numbers the curve of c t is sensibly parallel to the two dimensional turbulent friction line this is called by hughes the low froude number run in point hughes 1954 the total resistance curve is formulated as 1 c t c f c f o r m c w c f o r m k c f where c f is the resistance equivalent to a flat plate in two dimensional flow c f o r m is form resistance due to the shape of the hull c w is wave resistance and k is the form factor c f o r m is proportional to c f when the flow is turbulent and the given hull is smooth streamlined without separation and in symmetrical form when towed in zero incidence angle c f o r m is made up of components due to additional skin friction caused by curvature effects flow in transverse directions and eddy making hughes 1954 as hughes 1954 described form factor for a hull can be determined by the ratio c t c f at the run in point since the c w is small enough be neglected in eq 1 however in order to find the run in point the speed range for the resistance test must be extended to very low f n and r e numbers which is rather challenging as the r e at such low speeds might be too low for turbulence stimulators to make sure the flow around the hull is turbulent additionally certain scatter in resistance measurements at low speeds due to worsening measurement accuracy for small forces can hinder the form factor determination as lindgren and dyne 1980 indicated as an alternative prohaska 1966 suggested a simple method to derive the form factor from resistance tests when no separation is present the form factor is expressed as 2 c t c w 1 k c f the wave resistance coefficient c w can be expressed as eq 3 which is the asymptotic expansion formula of wave making resistance coefficient presented by inui as cited in toki 2008 3 c w a f r 4 b f r 8 c f r 12 d f r 16 c t at model scale is then expressed together with the inui s asymptotic expansion formula eq 3 as 4 c tm 1 k c f c w 1 k c f a f r 4 b f r 8 c f r 12 d f r 16 neglecting the higher order terms of eq 4 as they are close to zero at low froude numbers and dividing each sides by c f the following linear relationship is obtained 5 c tm c f 1 k a f r 4 c f prohaska 1966 noted that when results of approximately 200 model tests have been plotted with eq 5 for f n between 0 1 and 0 2 the c t c f values for a great majority of the models plot on straight lines one of the exceptions when the c t c f values deviated from the straight line and points correlate with concave curves is with hull forms with c b 0 75 it was suspected that 1 k may be speed dependent or as prohaska 1966 stated can be easily explained by as resulting from increasing trim on the bow the other hull form prohaska observed where c t c f values plot on convex curves was twin screw models with appendages and for some models with full aft body lines which was explained by a certain separation prohaska 1966 it should be noted that detection of flow separation and treatment of deeply submerged transoms remain as challenges of the prohaska method however the main weakness of the prohaska method discussed in modern literature is the bulbous bow near the water surface and partly submerged bulbous bow in partial loaded conditions which is not mentioned by prohaska 1966 since the model test data used by prohaska dates back to 1966 and earlier when bulbous bows were not a popular design concept in order to illustrate this aspect of the uncertainty of form factor determination caused by the prohaska method the model test results of the resistance curves of two hulls are plotted as in eq 5 and presented in fig 1 and fig 2 in order to protect the confidentiality of the test results c t c f curves shown in figs 1 and 2 are slightly tilted without changing neither the general shape of the curves nor the relative position of each measurement point at the same froude number hull 1 and hull 2 are only different in bulbous bow and they are geometrically similar for the rest of the hull 95 identical hulls the bulbous bow of hull 1 features a mild goose neck design distinctly convex upper stem profile of the bulb and has significantly more volume close to water surface at design loading condition compared to hull 2 as can be seen from fig 1 not all c t c f values of hull 1 in design loading condition follow a straight line within the recommended f n range which is between 0 1 and 0 2 as indicated by the green vertical lines the concave shape of c t c f values for hull 1 can be explained by the presence of significant and often steep waves that are generated by the bulb the waves generated at significantly lower froude numbers than the design speed are too short in wave length to favourably interact with the bow waves of the hull on the other hand c t c f values of hull 2 reasonably follow a straight line which suits the description of prohaska 1966 since the waves are much smaller at low f n as a result of reduced the pressure gradient and moving the bulb volume away from the water surface considering that the two hulls are 95 identical large differences are observed in c t c f curves the uncertainly with the prohaska method further increases in the ballast loading conditions as shown in fig 2 the c t c f values of hull 1 within the recommended range shows a large hump which cannot be used for a line fit in other words the wave making resistance cannot be described by eq 4 and the linear relationship proposed by prohaska in eq 5 is not valid in ballast condition at the low speeds hull 2 also shows a hump in c t c f values which was not existent in the design condition in order to demonstrate that a different friction line would not have helped the c t c f values are also calculated with the katsui friction line katsui et al 2005 instead of the 1957 ittc model ship correlation line as seen in fig 1 the convex shape of the c t c f values persists as shown in this example quantifying the uncertainty or error of prohaska form factor determination method is difficult since it is very sensitive to the hull design considering that the bulbous bows are now a common feature of modern ship design it is hard to advocate the validity and practicality of the prohaska method for all hull designs and loading conditions one further aspect of uncertainty of form factor determination with the prohaska method originates from the experimental uncertainty u d the uncertainty on form factor can be significantly higher than the experimental uncertainty since it is not directly measured but obtained as a result of data reduction i e regression analysis this will be discussed thoroughly in section 4 when the towing tank tests for kvlcc2 in ballast loading condition are presented 3 participants and methods in total 9 different organisations with 7 different cfd codes contributed to the current study the organisations are listed in table 1 together with the main features of their methods the results will be discussed and presented with the id numbers of the organisations in the paper two equation turbulence models k ω sst rng k ε realizable k ε are used by the majority of the computations anisotropic models easm and rstm are not used by all organisations but easm model is still covering a large portion of the calculations only one organisation used the one equation spalart allmaras model simulations were performed using finite volume codes with 2nd order accurate schemes except one code with 3rd order accurate scheme the grids used were single or multi block structured grids butt joined curvilinear or overlapping techniques and unstructured ones computational domain shape and size varies with each code majority of the upstream boundaries are located between 1lpp and 1 5lpp from the fore perpendicular fp but ecn cnrs and sspa ctu are differing from others by using the distance of 5lpp and 0 5lpp respectively the downstream extent of the domains varied between 8lpp and 0 8lpp from the aft perpendicular ap while the common distance of downstream extent is between 2lpp and 3lpp lateral both sidewards and downwards extend is commonly located between 1 5lpp and 2 5lpp away from the ship center plane and free surface plane but two notable exceptions are 1lpp and 4lpp from um and ecn cnrs respectively all computations were performed as double model with a symmetry boundary condition at the ship center plane and free surface plane most popular upstream boundary condition is uniform in all variables with the exception of one participant with prescribed pressure the downstream conditions are usually zero gradient in the streamwise direction except the pressure quantity that is specified the lateral boundaries are dominated by far field boundary conditions but slip and zero gradient boundaries are also used majority of the computations approximately 60 are performed with wall resolved condition and the remaining simulations were performed with wall functions the cfd based form factor method considered for this study follows the assumptions of hughes 1954 and is derived using the relation 6 1 k c f c pv c f 0 c v c f 0 where the frictional resistance coefficient c f and viscous pressure coefficient c pv are obtained by the double body cfd simulation c f 0 in the denominator of eq 6 is the equivalent flat plate resistance in two dimensional flow obtained from the same reynolds number as the computations in this study three friction lines are considered the ittc 57 model ship correlation line ittc 1957 the katsui line katsui et al 2005 and numerical friction lines proposed by korkmaz et al 2019b it is worth mentioning that the ittc 57 line is not a pure friction line but it contains a component of form resistance 11 94 of the friction line of hughes 1954 it is included in the scope of the study because it is still the model to ship correlation line recommended by ittc 2014a the shortcomings of the prohaska method for the hulls with a pronounced bulbous bow have been mentioned in section 2 in a case when there is just a small gap between the top of the bulb and the still water surface a flow separation may be generated around the top of the bulb for the double body simulations such flow separation would not occur in free surface flow therefore the form factor obtained from the double body computation will be affected raven et al 2008 suggested that if the bulb is submerged more by trimming the hull bow down this issue can be prevented another drawback that is shared between cfd and efd based form factor determination methods is the large submerged transom which may cause flow separation in the wake the test cases used in this study do not possess the hull form features that may cause aforementioned issues for the cfd based form factor method therefore no corrections have been applied to the double body flow computations 4 test cases and computational conditions the two hulls used for the current study are kvlcc2 with rudder kcs with rudder the kvlcc2 and kcs hulls are designed at the korea research institute for ships and ocean engineering kriso to be used as open test cases for cfd predictions extensive towing tank tests and cfd investigations were carried out in the last two decades therefore hull lines and detailed hydrostatics are not presented the hull and rudder geometries are obtained from tokyo 2015 and simman 2008 workshops for kcs and kvlcc2 respectively the computational conditions for the study is presented in table 2 non dimensional quantities r e and f n are based on lpp the force coefficients are non dimensionalized with the corresponding wetted surface coefficients s l2pp to the loading conditions for each hull and loading condition two different speeds were used for the computations in order to investigate the importance and the effect of selecting a speed for the form factor determination the first speed is chosen in the low side of the regular model testing speed range where ct cf is close to the form factor see fig 1 determined by the prohaska method the second speed is the design speed of each vessel data for resistance tests of kvlcc2 and kcs at design draught are adopted from van et al 2011 the resistance test data of the kvlcc2 in ballast loading condition has never been published therefore sspa determined a typical ballast loading condition for very large crude carriers vlcc towing tank tests were performed at sspa s towing tank including an uncertainty analysis of the resistance tests 4 1 uncertainty analysis of kvlcc2 resistance tests in ballast draught a kvlcc2 model with a scale factor of 45 714 made of the plastic foam material divinycell was manufactured with 5 axis cnc milling machine at sspa after the surface finishing and painting the model was scanned with a 3d scanner to check the tolerances described in ittc 2014c a trip wire is mounted at 5 of l pp aft from the fore perpendicular for the turbulence stimulation the hull model is equipped with a dummy propeller hub and a rudder the geometry of the rudder is obtained from simman 2008 and the dummy hub is a simple cylinder with the diameter of the boss end of the hull the model tests were performed in sspa s towing tank which is 260 m long 10 m wide and 5 m deep the model tests were carried out in mid may 2020 the total resistance sinkage and trim were measured at froude numbers varying between 0 110 and 0 147 the mid sectional area of the kvlcc2 model in ballast loading condition is 0 155 of the towing tank section area therefore no blockage correction is applied the tests were started by performing one run per f n 0 119 and f n 0 142 speeds respectively it was followed by starting from the lowest f n and the speed is increased successively at each run after 20 min of waiting time there was a total of five repeat tests for f n 0 119 and f n 0 142 while the rest of the speeds were repeated four times the uncertainty regarding the wetted surface area are quantified by measuring the model ballasting the model and weights calibrated 25 separate pieces used for ballasting the model were weighted by two digital scales ittc 2014b resulting uncertainties on the wetted surface are presented in table 3 for f n 0 119 and f n 0 142 speeds the relative uncertainty of the towing speed is assessed by the bias limit of the towing carriage and they are presented in table 3 the water temperature during the tests showed less than 0 1 c variation as described in ittc 2014b the measured resistance is converted to 16 0 c which was used for the cfd computations prior to the tests the corresponding component of uncertainties in resistance due to temperature variation are presented in table 3 the model was scanned and checked at the model workshop the thermal deformation of the model is expected to be limited as the temperature difference between the model workshop and the towing tank is less than 5 c an in house design dynamometer with a sampling rate of 10 hz was used for measuring the resistance the measurement at each speed is obtained by averaging the time history of the signal as described in ittc 2014b the standard uncertainty of average of the sampling history varied between 0 0008 and 0 0015 while the average of all repetitions is 0 0011 therefore the uncertainty of one reading from the data acquisition system das is negligible the dynamometer available at the time of the towing tank tests were calibrated to a much greater range than the maximum model resistance as a result the uncertainty regarding to the dynamometer is the dominant source as can be seen in table 3 the dynamometer calibration was checked after the tests additionally a calibration with a range that was approximately 3 times the maximum model resistance was performed the uncertainty due to the dynamometer dropped nearly three times with the smaller range which would have halved the total uncertainty in table 3 based on the analysis described in ittc 2014b the significant components of uncertainties are combined through rss root sum square as seen in table 3 major sources of the uncertainties are originating from the dynamometer with the large calibration range and the precision of measurement in the repeat tests the uncertainty of resistance measurements for f n 0 119 and f n 0 142 are 0 74 and 0 53 respectively the expanded uncertainties in table 3 correspond to the confidence level of 95 in table 4 combined measurement uncertainties are presented in per cent of the measured data value which is the mean total resistance of all repeat tests at each speed the uncertainties are between 0 51 and 0 84 as seen in table 4 it is decreasing with increasing speed because at the high speeds the contribution from the dynamometer decreases as mentioned before one aspect of uncertainty of form factor determination with prohaska method originates from the experimental uncertainty u d in order to illustrate that the uncertainty on form factor is significantly higher than the experimental uncertainty the prohaska plot is presented in fig 4 with the error bars representing the experimental uncertainties presented in table 4 unlike the main discussion point in section 2 the c t c f values can be sensibly aligned to a line as the waves generated at the ballast loading condition were not too substantial as can be seen in fig 3 the regression line in fig 4 is obtained by applying the method explained by york et al 2004 this method considers the experimental uncertainties in the regression progress and predicts the uncertainties in the form factor as well the resulting regression line is indicated as the york s method in fig 4 where the uncertainty on the form factor is illustrated with an error bar at f n 4 c f 0 the uncertainty of form factor is calculated as 0 011 additionally a monte carlo simulation is performed to illustrate the variation on form factor due to measurement uncertainty for each iteration all measured point are varied as 7 c t c t u sd r where c t is measured point presented in table 4 u sd is the measurement uncertainty and r is normally distributed random number in every iteration a new regression line and form factor are calculated with the york et al 2004 method the error k k y o r k obtained from the monte carlo simulation is normalized by the uncertainty obtained from the york et al 2004 method σ y o r k and the probability density function pdf is calculated as can be seen in fig 5 the monte carlo simulation indicates a normal distribution for the normalized error of the form factor and the standard deviation of the error is equal to the uncertainty obtained from the york et al 2004 method as a result of using both methods the uncertainty of the form factor is calculated as 0 022 corresponding to 1 9 of 1 k for the 95 confidence interval 5 results the analysis of approximately 300 double body simulations of the two hulls under the conditions stated in table 2 is discussed in this section 5 1 friction and viscous pressure resistance in model scale firstly friction and viscous pressure resistance coefficients are investigated since only these quantities are directly computed by cfd codes instead form factor is a combination of the two computed values and a friction line therefore detecting the tendencies between different cfd methods might be hindered due to errors cancelling each other 5 1 1 uncertainty analysis uncertainty analysis is performed to quantify the grid uncertainty ug by shipflow and nagisa codes for the grid dependence study five geometrically similar grids were used with the former code and systematically refined grid triplets are prepared for latter both shipflow and nagisa performs the simulations in double precision in order to eliminate the round off errors the iterative uncertainties were quantified by the standard deviation of the force in percent of the average force over the last 10 of the iterations iterative uncertainty for cf and cpv were kept below 0 01 and 0 15 for shipflow while iterative uncertainty for cf cpv and ct for nagisa were kept below 0 1 of their mean values for all simulations in model scale therefore it was assumed that the numerical errors are dominated by the discretization errors and both iterative errors and round off errors are neglected for shipflow the procedure proposed by eça and hoekstra 2014 was used to predict the grid uncertainties which are presented for the finest grid as a ratio of the computed value u g s 1 in table 5 in order to quantify the grid uncertainty for nagisa three criteria are adopted e g factor of safety fs method proposed by xing and stern 2009 correction factor cf method and grid convergence index gci method shown in ittc 2017 table 6 summarizes the results for kvlcc2 in design and ballast loading condition and kcs in the cases where monotonic convergence is not obtained the solution change is less than 1 of s1 ε 21 ε 32 therefore ug is omitted and noted with a symbol in table 6 5 1 2 statistics of c f and c pv the simulations in model scale comprise computations from seven different codes and six different turbulence models with wall functions and wall resolved approaches these computations include not only the cfd setups according to the best practice guidelines bpg or standard settings but also setups that deviated from recommended guidelines since one of the aim of this study is to identify the methods that are not well suited for the form factor determination in order to differentiate the contribution of the computations with deliberately made undesired settings two different populations are considered when the statistics such as mean and standard deviation are calculated the first population denoted as p1 includes all simulations and the second population denoted as p2 is the computations performed with best practices or standard settings of each code it was deemed necessary to add one more population as a sub population of the latter because of concerns on the statistics being biased by a code significantly outnumbering others in some test cases therefore the third population denoted as p3 is obtained by selecting the computations from the two finest grids of each code per cfd approach such as turbulence model wall treatment this selection is based on the number of cells under the assumption that fine grids have less discretization uncertainty the mean and standard deviation of c f and c pv for each condition is calculated with the three previously mentioned populations as presented in table 7 and table 8 it is observed that statistics of different populations of the same condition showed limited variation except kvlcc2 in design condition which is the condition many of the deliberate variations were applied to cfd setups in fig 6 the population 2 and simulations with non desired cfd set ups are visualised by dividing all the computations for kvlcc2 in design condition into two groups computations with non standard cfd set ups and simulations with the best practice guidelines bpg or standard cfd set ups the small difference in statistics between the population 2 and 3 shows that the statistics are not biased even though some test cases are overcrowded with simulations from one code the computations performed with the best practices or the standard settings of each code population 2 will be used for the rest of the analysis except when the results of deliberate variations of cfd setups are discussed friction and viscous pressure resistance coefficients c f and c pv in model scale for kvlcc2 in both loading conditions and kcs in design condition are presented versus grid size in logarithmic scale in fig 7 and fig 8 in order to have references for the friction resistance coefficient the ittc 57 line and the katsui line are plotted in fig 7 as can be seen in figs 7 and 8 there is no distinct dependence of results on the grid size note that this is a comparison of unsystematically varied methods and grids however other dependencies such as the turbulence modelling and the wall treatment were found both on cf and cpv the frictional resistance coefficients from um participant 1 and sspa ctu participant 6 indicate a strong dependence on turbulence model while this effect is rather limited on the results of ecn cnrs participant 3 nmri participant 4 and ynu participant 9 the viscous pressure coefficients from ecn cnrs and sspa ctu show larger dependence on turbulence models than the others ecn cnrs and nmri performed simulations both with wall resolved and wall function both codes indicate a significant dependence on wall treatment especially for cf but also for cpv which is less sensitive to the wall treatment than the frictional resistance component variations of cfd setups the previously mentioned cfd setups that varied from recommended guidelines on kvlcc2 in design condition have been applied by um ecn cnrs sspa ctu and sssri um participant 1 varied grids focusing specifically to the grid resolution near the wall using two turbulent models as can be seen in fig 9 where all computations on kvlcc2 in design condition are presented k ω sst and spalart allmaras turbulence models shows high sensitivity on cf to both grid refinement and y variation however the variation on cpv is limited except for the coarsest grid set ecn cnrs participant 3 performed grid variations also with adaptive grid refinement when wall functions were used cf and cpv showed small variation even for the very coarse grids however wall resolved simulations of ecn cnrs are more grid dependent compared to wall functions this is explained by the increasing grid resolution near the wall rather than the increase in grid size for the wall resolved computations in addition to the systematic grid variations for the grid dependence studies sspa ctu participant 6 performed grid variations by coarsening the grid of the bow and the stern region of the kvlcc2 hull in the longitudinal direction while keeping the rest of the grid the same for this exercise the second finest grid and the coarsest grid of the grid dependence study was selected as a starting point coarsening the bow and stern regions up to grid density of one third of the starting grids did not show a significant variation on cf but some variation in cpv for the same turbulence model except for one case when the coarsest grid was further coarsened in the aft the cpv was calculated extremely high as seen in fig 6 highest two values from participant 6 while the variation of cf was limited the grid variations of sspa ctu on kvlcc2 showed that when the grid resolution normal to the wall is kept similar cf and cpv are more sensitive to the grid density in aftbody than forebody simulations of sssri participant 7 was performed with three different turbulence models as can be seen from fig 9 both cf and cpv obtained from reynolds stress turbulence model rstm were significantly higher than the realizable k ε and k ω sst models with similar grids and average y values additionally different types of wall functions were used with realizable k ε and k ω sst models while keeping the grids similar cf and cpv showed only marginal change due to different wall function type for the k ω sst model however the realizable k ε model showed a substantial variation in both cf and cpv due to different wall function treatment finally y is varied with the realizable k ε model it is observed that when the average y increases from 71 to 112 in steps of 11 cf also increases up to 2 while cpv decreases up to 4 5 as shown in fig 9 therefore a significant dependence of y and wall function treatment on viscous resistance is observed with the realizable k ε model 5 2 cfd based form factors with the ittc 57 line cfd based form factors are calculated using eq 6 and presented versus the number of grid points in fig 10 note that only the simulations performed according to the best practice guidelines or standard settings of each code are presented and logarithmic scale is used in the grid points axis for better clarity in addition to standard deviation in percentage of 1 k and mean of the cfd based form factors k form factors determined by model tests of van et al 2011 for kvlcc2 and kcs in design condition and kvlcc2 in ballast loading condition of sspa are plotted in fig 10 mean of the form factor predictions for the kvlcc2 in design condition at f n 0 119 and f n 0 142 are both close to the form factor determined experimentally the standard deviation of the form factors obtained from the unsystematically varied methods and grids at both speeds is around 1 9 if the form factor is used in extrapolation of the model resistance value for this kvlcc2 case this would cause approximately 3 spread in the predicted full scale resistance roughness correlation allowance and air resistance excluded number of grid cells among the computations varied between one million to 62 million however form factor predictions do not indicate dependence on the number of grid cells mean of the form factor predictions for the kcs in design condition at f n 0 26 is very close to the experimental value however at f n 0 152 the mean value of form factor is 0 015 smaller than the mean form factor at f n 0 26 as shown in table 9 in section 5 3 this difference was not as large for the kvlcc2 because the r e difference between the speeds were small 19 however r e difference between the speeds for the kcs hull is 71 which is big enough to reveal the speed dependency of the form factor as it is discussed in further detail in section 5 3 the standard deviation of 1 5 translates to approximately 1 in full scale resistance excluding the contribution of roughness correlation allowance and air resistance note that this is a remarkable result even though such a wide range methods and grids were used since kcs like hulls are the ones that suffers the most from the prohaska method because of the prominent bulb designs all the computations for kvlcc2 in ballast case had to be performed prior to the model tests the slight discrepancy in water temperature between computations and tests were corrected using ittc 2014b procedures for form factor determination form factor predictions for the kvlcc2 in ballast loading condition showed a similar standard deviation to the other cases however the mean value of the form factor is not as close to the experimentally determined form factor as the other cases as explained in section 4 uncertainty analysis was performed for the form factor when the uncertainty of the prohaska method on the experimentally determined form factor is considered majority of the simulations are still within the uncertainty range it is observed in fig 10 that some form factor predictions are relatively far from the experimentally derived form factor however it is encouraging to observe that there are some consistent patterns for most of the codes the form factor was under predicted similarly by ynu participant 9 and ecn cnrs participant 3 for both kvlcc2 and kcs hulls in design condition results of sssri participant 7 are also under predictions for all the cases it should be noted that as long as one code with a certain set up consistently predicts the form factor with the same tendency application of correlation factors c p or c a in the 1978 ittc power prediction method will help to reduce the discrepancies cfd code dependency the dependencies and tendencies of each code for the form factor predictions are plotted in fig 11 and fig 12 computations from each code are stacked in separate columns where box and whisker plots are placed with markers the box plot can be identified with the gray color and sized with the lower and upper quartiles lines extending from the boxes whiskers extend to the data within 1 5 times the interquartile range iqr the markers are colored with the turbulence models shaped according to the wall treatment type and sized according to the number of cells turbulence model dependency the choice of turbulence model stands out as a decisive element of the cfd based form factors when the results of um ecn cnrs nmri and sspa ctu are considered even if the same code and similar cfd set ups are used a significant dependence on turbulence models are observed however a general trend for each turbulence model cannot be maintained either for example ecn cnrs participant 3 nmri participant 4 and ynu participant 9 predicted higher form factors with easm turbulence model than with k ω sst while this is the opposite with sspa ctu participant 6 it should be also noted that the form factor predictions from the same turbulence model with different cfd codes are largely scattered therefore the dependence of form factors to the cfd codes surpasses the choice of the turbulence model wall treatment dependency the type of wall treatment and y can be considered as significant dependencies of form factor as it was the case for c f and c pv investigated earlier ecn cnrs and nmri performed computations with the same turbulence models of k ω sst and easm and also both participants had simulations with and without wall functions as can be seen from figs 11 and 12 form factor dependence on the wall treatment is observed with both ecn cnrs participant 3 and nmri participant 4 while a significant dependence on y was observed with the realizable k ε model for sssri on the right side of figs 11 and 12 simulations from all codes are sorted with the type of wall treatment the markers are colored with the type of the grid the box plots of both kvlcc2 and kcs indicate that interquartile range iqr of simulations with wall functions are smaller than wall resolved however the distance between the whiskers are similar for both approaches although the cfd results as a whole are a product of unsystematically varied methods and grids the comparison of median values of different wall modelling indicates that simulations with wall functions predict considerably smaller form factors compared to wall resolved approach 5 3 form factors with alternative friction lines as mentioned earlier in section 1 speed dependency or scale effects have been found on the form factor by the previous investigations however it should be noted that the form factors should always be considered with the friction line used as the physical meaning of speed dependency or scale effects on the form factor is that the viscous resistance of a ship is not proportional to the selected friction line even if the concept of hughes 1954 see section 2 is true different sizes of geosim models and double body simulations at different reynolds numbers will result in different form factors as a result of using an improper friction line the currently recommended fiction line the ittc 57 line ittc 1957 is in fact not a pure friction line as hughes 1954 hypothesis requires but a model ship correlation line therefore speed dependency of the form factors with ittc 57 line is not extraordinary but expected instead of the ittc 57 line c f 0 in eq 6 can be replaced by other friction lines such as katsui et al 2005 or numerical friction lines nfl that are derived by using the same code as the double body simulations prior to this study only sspa ctu obtained a nfl with the shipflow code for easm and k ω sst turbulence models korkmaz et al 2019b since other participants did not have numerical friction lines frictional resistance coefficients of infinitely thin 2d plates were computed by nmri sssri strathclyde and ynu with the same turbulence models wall treatment and reynolds number as the corresponding double body simulations these c f values obtained from the flat plate simulations were then used as c f 0 in eq 6 for the form factor determination form factors based on the ittc 57 line and the katsui line are also calculated using the same simulations where nfl data is available the mean values and the standard deviations of the form factors based on different friction lines are presented in table 9 the speed dependency can be identified by comparing the mean of the form factor predictions of different reynolds numbers at the same loading condition as expected speed dependency of form factors with the ittc 57 line is observed for the both hulls and the loading conditions the largest speed dependency however is observed for the form factors of the kcs hull with the ittc 57 line as the difference between the reynolds numbers is the greatest among other cases the speed dependencies are reduced considerably when the katsui line is used and they are almost completely eliminated with numerical friction lines for all test cases regardless of an existence of speed dependency of form factors the choice of speed from which the form factor will be determined is a relevant issue for cfd computation the extrapolated full scale viscous resistance predictions will be influenced by the choice of the model scale speed when the speed dependency exists therefore the speeds that correlates better with the experimentally determined form factors should be preferred based on the form factor predictions presented in table 9 design speeds of kvlcc2 and kcs are suggested if the ittc 57 line is used for the form factor determination another point of concern is choosing the speed that provides the smaller numerical uncertainties and modelling errors the grid uncertainties presented in tables 5 and 6 for shipflow and nagisa codes showed limited change of grid uncertainties with the speed while the change of u g were not systematically increasing or decreasing in terms of modelling errors numerical transition from laminar to turbulent flow can be concerning when the r e is too low as this phenomenon occurs even without the use of transition turbulent models as shown in eça and hoekstra 2008 and korkmaz et al 2019b as presented in table 9 the mean of form factors with ittc 57 line greatly differs from katsui line and nfl the physical explanation of this observation is that when ittc 57 line is used the form resistance see section 2 is significantly under predicted due to too large frictional resistance component in model scale the effect of the under prediction of form resistance to the full scale viscous resistance will be discussed in section 5 4 2 form factors with numerical friction lines for kvlcc2 are presented in fig 13 opposing to the results from the ittc 57 line the mean value of the form factors with nfl are almost identical for both speeds close investigation on the individual simulation points between the different speeds also support this suggestion except the simulations from strathclyde participant 8 and the coarse grids of sspa ctu participant 6 kvlcc2 in both loading conditions shows smaller speed dependency with ittc 57 line compared to kcs as the reynolds number difference between the two speeds is smaller it is worth noticing that the speed dependency is larger in design condition than the ballast loading condition with the ittc 57 line this is a consequence of the artificial steepness of the ittc 57 line which increases as the r e decreases therefore as any other model with big scale factor the ratio of ship to model length would kvlcc2 model in design condition suffers more from the scale effects with the ittc 57 line the standard deviations of the form factor in percentage of 1 k predictions for all cases are presented in table 9 using the katsui line the standard deviation of the form factor are the same in all cases compared to using the ittc 57 line as the same computations were used form factors with nfl showed an increase in the standard deviation for the kvlcc2 in design condition however the standard deviation is reduced significantly for kvlcc2 in ballast loading condition and especially for kcs due to a decrease in variation of form factors obtained from different turbulence models even though the dependence of turbulence models on form factor seems to decrease by the adoption the nfl of the same code and turbulence model as the double body simulation the form factors are not expected to be the same for different turbulence models application of nfl for different turbulence models arranges the quantity of form resistance with respect to the friction line of the respective turbulence model as a result nearly the same full scale viscous resistance values can be obtained by the different turbulence models as shown in section 5 4 2 as an alternative to the cfd based form factor determination method used in this study wang et al 2016 and terziev et al 2019 calculated the form factors simply by dividing the viscous pressure coefficient to friction coefficient k c pv c f obtained from the double body simulation with the hull therefore the need of any friction line is removed for form factor determination this method of form factor determination is dismissed in this study because of the deviation from the approach of hughes 1954 as c f from double body computation already includes the additional skin friction caused by the curvature effects which should have been included the form resistance as explained in section 2 5 4 full scale predictions 5 4 1 statics of computed c f and c pv in full scale full scale double body simulations are performed according to the conditions described in table 2 the friction and viscous pressure resistance coefficients are presented in fig 14 and fig 15 respectively the mean and standard deviation of the computed resistance coefficients are calculated excluding the results from nrc ocreand sssri who encountered difficulties with grid generation the mean of c f is by approximately 6 and 3 higher than the katsui line due to additional skin friction caused by the curvature effects for kvlcc2 and kcs respectively the standard deviation of c f in full scale is reduced considerably compared to model scale for kvlcc2 at both loading conditions mainly because of the reduction of dependence on turbulence models the standard deviation of c f is similar both in model and full scale for the kcs hull however the standard deviation of c pv is increased for kcs and kvlcc2 in design condition compared to model scale while the variation of c pv is similar in model and full scale for kvlcc2 in ballast condition considering the standard deviation and the quantity of c f and c pv observed in full scale simulations the viscous pressure resistance component is the dominant source of variation in c v as mentioned earlier the difficulties in the grid generation for nrc ocre and sssri can be observed through the average y values varied between 450 and 750 for nrc ocre and 8300 to 15 000 for sssri as a result mainly the predicted c f values are significantly higher than the mean of the rest of the computations a strong dependence on turbulence model was observed with the computations of sspa ctu in model scale however this dependence is reduced by half for sspa ctu except the kvlcc2 in ballast loading condition nmri performed two simulations per case where one with wall resolved higher number of grid cells and the other with wall function where the latter under predicted both friction and viscous pressure resistance coefficients compared to wall resolved approach 5 4 2 full scale viscous resistance extrapolation full scale viscous resistance predictions of kvlcc2 and kcs hulls are performed via extrapolation from model scale and compared with full scale computations in fig 16 and fig 17 the extrapolation to full scale is performed using the cfd based form factors and the ittc 57 katsui and numerical friction lines in figs 16 and 17 full scale viscous resistance predictions are presented as box and whisker plots with the markers the participants without full scale computations are excluded for clarity and fair comparison between extrapolated values and full scale computations the friction line used for the extrapolation and form factor determination is indicated within brackets on the y axis label the extrapolations based on the model tests data of van et al 2011 with the ittc 57 line is represented by a horizontal line that is almost coinciding with the mean c v values of the predictions from cfd based form factors for both kvlcc2 and kcs when the ittc 57 line is used full scale viscous resistance of kvlcc2 and kcs are approximately 6 6 and 5 5 lower on average compared to extrapolation based on katsui line the mean of the extrapolations based on the ittc 57 line is 9 7 and 8 0 lower than the full scale computations for kvlcc2 and kcs respectively similar conclusions were obtained by the investigations performed by raven et al 2008 on a containership which showed that c v from direct full scale computations are 7 4 higher than the extrapolation method with the ittc 57 line this difference is mainly due to too steep the ittc 57 line which causes an underestimated c v at full scale raven et al 2008 suggested that the underestimation of c v due to the ittc 57 line is mainly compensated by the correlation allowance c a in the ittc scaling procedures using the same model scale simulations but form factors and extrapolation with the katsui line the full scale viscous resistance values are similar to the predictions of full scale simulations the cv predictions with numerical friction lines are only performed with sspa ctu as others did not have numerical friction lines the mean of extrapolated full scale viscous resistance with nfl are in agreement with the mean of full scale computation results however the extrapolated values are slightly under predicted compared to direct full scale computations for both hulls agreement between the extrapolations with the katsui line and nfl is also noticeable as can be seen in figs 16 and 17 the standard deviation of full scale computations are twice as large as the standard deviation of model to full scale extrapolations with the ittc 57 and katsui lines for both hulls this means that full scale simulations are still less reliable than the model scale computations as the agreement on the cfd predictions are higher in model scale the standard deviations of extrapolations with the ittc 57 and katsui lines are almost identical but as discussed in section 5 3 the speed dependency on the form factor was noticeably reduced with the katsui line compared to the ittc 57 line when numerical friction lines are considered only the results from the sspa ctu are considered for the comparison of the standard deviations for a fair comparison for kvlcc2 and kcs the smallest standard deviations are observed with extrapolation with the numerical friction lines which also eliminated the speed dependency of the form factors almost completely the extrapolated full scale viscous resistance values presented in figs 16 and 17 were based on the model scale computations performed at f n 0 142 and f n 0 26 for kvlcc2 in design loading condition and kcs respectively as presented in table 9 the form factors were speed dependent when ittc 57 and katsui lines were used therefore the extrapolated cv values would be approximately 1 2 and 0 7 lower than the cv values presented in figs 16 and 17 when the model scale computations at f n 0 119 and f n 0 152 are used with ittc 57 and katsui lines respectively on the other hand the application of nfl eliminated the speed dependency of the form factors almost completely as shown in table 9 the standard deviation is perhaps a more essential measure for improving the power predictions compared to the absolute values of c v predictions as long as c v is predicted with the same tendency correlation factors c p or c a based on the experience of each institution can be used effectively to adjust the final predictions in terms of absolute values 6 conclusions this paper presents an investigation on cfd based form factor methods which was initiated by the ittc specialist committee combined cfd efd methods the assumptions underlying the form factor approach and the prohaska method is discussed and model test data is compared to the rans simulations performed by 7 different cfd codes the disposition to leave the prohaska method of form factor determination is explained through two types of uncertainty the linear relationship proposed by prohaska in eq 5 is not valid for the hulls with prominent bulb designs at fully or partially submerged conditions since a substantial portion of the merchant and naval fleet are equipped with bulbous bows the validity of the prohaska method as a common tool for all hull forms is under question as discussed in section 2 it is difficult to quantify this uncertainty as the case sensitivity is very high the second uncertainty source of the prohaska method originates from the experimental uncertainty as demonstrated with the model tests results of kvlcc2 in ballast condition the experimental uncertainty is noticeably amplified for the form factor as a result of the regression analysis this amplification of the uncertainty on the form factor can be much more severe if a hull with voluminous bulb is tested where the c t c f values often cannot be used in low speed range therefore uncertainty of 0 022 within 95 confidence interval on the form factor with prohaska method on kvlcc2 in ballast condition can be considered merely as a best case scenario model scale simulations are performed with seven different codes and six different turbulence models with wall functions and wall resolved approaches the resulting form factor predictions with the ittc 57 line from the computations with recommended or standard cfd setups compared well with the experimentally determined form factors for kvlcc2 and kcs in design loading condition at design speeds the cfd based form factors are mostly under predicted for kvlcc2 in ballast loading condition compared to experiments however the majority of the cfd based form factors were within the experimental uncertainty the form factors showed 1 5 2 5 standard deviation in percentage of 1 k even though the abundance of unsystematically varied methods and grids it should be noted that the experimental uncertainty of the form factor will be of similar levels even for the cases when the linear relationship proposed by prohaska holds model scale computations include not only the cfd setups according to the best practice guidelines or standard settings but also setups that deviated from the recommended guidelines as one of the goal of this study is to identify the methods that are not well suited for the form factor determination the resulting form factor predictions with the ittc 57 line from the computations with non standard cfd setups indicated that describing the boundary layer with a good quality grid in terms of the grid resolution and the first cell size normal to the wall is essential for both wall treatment types are considerably more sensitive to the grid density in aftbody than forebody and can be sensitive to the different types of wall functions with certain turbulence models such as realizable k ε as mentioned before different codes indicated varying dependencies on cfd setups and therefore general recommendations for all cfd setups cannot be made specifically for the sake of form factor determination instead it is observed that most of the codes with a certain cfd setup showed consistent patterns of form factor predictions among different test cases if these trends are confirmed with more hulls and test cases application of correlation factors c p or c a unique for each code and method will be able to reduce the differences in full scale predictions further speed dependency of the form factors are confirmed with the application of the ittc 57 line for all test cases the question of which model scale speed should be chosen for the cfd based form factors with the ittc 57 line cannot be answered within the scope of this study because of the differing trends of each code however the mean values of form factors with ittc 57 line are closer to the experimental values in design speeds of kvlcc2 and kcs hulls if another friction line is preferred such as the katsui or numerical friction lines the speed dependency on the form factor is reduced significantly and therefore decreasing the importance of the choice of the speed for the model scale simulations full scale viscous resistance is calculated by extrapolating the model scale results with different friction correlation lines and direct full scale simulations the scatter among the full scale computations are substantially higher than the extrapolations from the model scale for both kvlcc2 and kcs hulls even though the standard deviation of c f in full scale computations is reduced considerably compared to model scale computations for kvlcc2 at both loading conditions as a result of reduced dependence on turbulence models the increased discrepancy on full scale c pv predictions lead to a larger scatter of c v for full scale simulations hence the full scale simulations should not to be preferred over the form factor approach yet finally cfd based form factors can be considered as an alternative or supplementary method to the prohaska method it is considered as a step towards answering the request of ittc performance committee of 1978 future developments for the determination of form factors on a more scientific basis is expected ittc 1978 the selection of friction lines would also have an impact on reducing the scatter between the full scale predictions and sea trials due to elimination of scale effects however the improvements expected from a change of friction line are minor compared to the implementation of a cfd based form factor method although there are still shortcomings with full scale resistance predictions combination of efd and cfd is expected to provide immediate improvements to the 1978 ittc performance prediction method further studies should be performed with many more test cases and cfd codes to establish a better understanding for the dependencies of cfd methods on the form factor prediction as a final step comparison of sea trials and the power predictions with cfd based form factors should be performed for different types of

21190,the 1978 ittc power prediction method is used to predict the propulsive power of ships through towing tank testing the form factor approach and its determination in this method have been questioned this paper investigates the possibility to improve the power predictions by introducing combined cfd efd method where the experimental determination of form factor is replaced by double body rans computations applied for open cases kvlcc2 and kcs including first time published towing tank tests of kvlcc2 at ballast condition including an experimental uncertainty analysis specifically derived for the form factor computations from nine organisations and seven cfd codes are compared to the experiments the form factor predictions for both hulls in design loading condition compared well with the experimental results in general for the kvlcc2 ballast condition majority of the form factors were under predicted while staying within the experimental uncertainty speed dependency is observed with the application of ittc57 line but it is reduced with the katsui line and nearly eliminated by numerical friction lines comparison of the full scale viscous resistance predictions obtained by the extrapolations from model scale and direct full scale computations show that the combined cfd efd method show significantly less scatter and may thus be a preferred approach keywords ship resistance form factor cfd scale effects combined cfd efd methods experimental uncertainty analysis 1 introduction performance prediction of a ship is one of the most important tasks during the design phase as a ship design progresses from beginning to end the required confidence interval for the prediction method increases according to the majority of commercial tendencies presented by shipyards and ship owners towing tank tests are still considered as the last step of the performance prediction additionally legal authorities consider towing tank testing as a mandatory step in their evaluations such as eedi calculations as enforced by imo 2011 where the applicable ships must go through the pre verification by model testing during the design phase of a new ship towing tank testing has remained as the only practice for more than a century with high accuracy to predict the performance of a ship in deep and calm water since william froude introduced the extrapolation procedures in the 1870s the foundation of the international towing tank committee ittc in 1933 lead to improved and standardized procedures in nearly all aspects of performance prediction an important step towards a common prediction method was taken in 1973 when computer programs with different assumptions and extrapolation methods were created by sspa as requested by the ittc lindgren and dyne 1980 ten institutions known to have access to sea trials for different types of ships evaluated each method by starting from their model test results to calculate the shaft power and propeller rate of revolution ittc 1978 the 1978 ittc performance prediction method emerged as a result of comparing approximately one thousand sea trials to model test predictions and it is still in effect after going through several revisions even though towing tank testing and extrapolation methods have been debated discussed and improved over decades there are inherent and well known shortcomings due to scale effects since model tests are carried out at froude similarity while reynolds similarity cannot be fulfilled simultaneously in order to limit the effects of the shortcomings towing tank facilities must rely on experience and large databases of both model tests and sea trials computational fluid dynamics cfd has been seen as an alternative to towing tank testing because of cfd s ability to fulfill both froude and reynolds similarities while providing a great deal of detail about the flow however the accuracy of cfd on prediction of full scale performance is still under concern even though several studies presented by sun et al 2020 and niklas and pruszko 2019 demonstrated that full scale simulations can provide similar or better power predictions than towing tank experiments the results from reynolds averaged navier stokes rans solvers in full scale is highly dependent on the computational set up e g the choice of turbulence model and modelling of hull roughness the results of lloyd s register workshop on ship scale hydrodynamics ponkratov 2016 also confirmed that differences between the numerical setups can lead to very diverse predictions on both power and propeller turning rate unlike the limited full scale verification and validation v v studies mainly due to lack of full scale test data assessment of state of the art in cfd methods in model scale has been a well established practice since 1980 larsson et al 2014 according to the resistance statistics of larsson et al 2014 the mean comparison error in per cent of the measured data value is 1 7 and 1 3 for kvlcc2 and kcs in fixed trim and sinkage condition while the standard deviations are 1 3 and 1 2 of the data value respectively it was also noted that the mean comparison error and standard deviation in self propelled cases are considerably higher than those in the resistance cases larsson et al 2014 as identified by the combined cfd efd methods ittc specialist committee combination of efd and cfd could be a feasible solution to increase the accuracy of power predictions instead of choosing efd or cfd for the time being if a part of the model testing or extrapolation procedure causes higher uncertainty than the numerical uncertainty and physical modelling errors of the cfd applications accuracy will be increased in the 1978 ittc performance prediction method the form factor has been identified by the specialist committee as one of the major causes of uncertainties due to the prohaska method prohaska 1966 and scale effects on form factor for the determination of full scale resistance of ships form factor determination method suggested by prohaska 1966 was recommended by 14th ittc meeting ittc 1975 when standardized performance prediction procedures were formulated and debated during the formulation of the 1978 ittc power prediction method the form factor concept was found superior to 2 d methods such as the 1957 power prediction method as it led to a better ship model correlation ittc 1978 the form factor determination method remained as the prohaska method however the main issue with the prohaska method was described by the ittc as stated below the problems of ships with partly submerged bulbous bows and the effects of wave breaking resistance for blunt bow forms need further consideration in both cases it is probably advisable to lower the speed limits future developments for the determination of form factors on a more scientific basis is expected from the resistance committee ittc 1978 in the 1978 ittc power prediction method the form factor concept of hughes 1954 was adopted it suggests that viscous resistance of a ship can be expressed in relation to a two dimensional turbulent friction line and the form factor is independent of reynolds number as it will be explained in more detail in section 2 the prohaska method can be replaced by model scale double body cfd computations which is one of the least numerically complicated cfd applications since modelling of propulsors free surface and roughness are omitted after the form factor determination method the second error source was identified as the scale effects or speed dependency on form factor when the 1978 ittc method was accepted there has been substantial evidence on the scale effects on form factor with ittc 57 line ittc 1978 further re analysis of geosim test data performed by garcía gómez 2000 and toki 2008 confirmed the scale effects additionally cfd studies performed by pereira et al 2017 showed that the speed dependency of form factors with the ittc 57 line were larger than the numerical uncertainties terziev tezdogan and incecik 2019 also showed that form factor is reynolds number dependent and additionally suggested that the form factor varies with froude number the cfd investigations presented by raven et al 2008 wang et al 2015 dogrul et al 2020 and korkmaz werner and bensow 2019a supported the existence of scale effects or speed dependency on form factor and indicated that the main cause of the scale effects are due to the ittc 57 model ship correlation line rather than the hypothesis of hughes 1954 cfd based form factor methods were investigated by korkmaz et al 2019a and wang et al 2019 in further detail for sensitivity of form factor to grid density and type speed dependency presence of rudder sinkage and trim the latter investigation also demonstrated that cfd based form factors correlated better with the sea trials compared to the prohaska method as a continuation of the initial study started by the combined cfd efd methods specialist committee in this paper cfd based form factor methods have been investigated as an alternative method to the prohaska method kvlcc2 in design and ballast loading condition kcs in design loading condition are computed at two speeds at both model and full scale the model tests of kvlcc2 in ballast loading condition performed at sspa s towing tank and the resistance data together with the measurement uncertainty analysis is presented for the first time in the literature wide range of cfd methods and setups are compared with the contribution from 9 different organisations and 7 different cfd codes in order to quantify the sensitivity of different cfd approaches on form factor non ideal cfd setups are also computed and discussed the scale effects on the form factor are presented by using the friction line proposed by katsui et al 2005 and numerical friction lines suggested by korkmaz et al 2019b in comparison to form factor based on the ittc 57 model ship correlation line the following research questions are aimed to be answered by this study can cfd based form factors with state of the art cfd codes be an alternative or supplement to the prohaska method which cfd methods and setups are not fit for reliable cfd based form factor predictions can the scale effects on form factor be prevented should the full scale simulations replace the extrapolation methods for full scale resistance predictions this paper is structured as follows section 2 describes the background of the form factor concept and its determination by experimental methods the flow solvers numerical methods computational domain and boundary conditions procedure of cfd based form factor calculation are presented in section 3 the computational conditions and details of the kvlcc2 towing tank tests in ballast condition are presented in section 4 in section 5 results and discussions are presented and conclusions are summarized in section 6 2 background of the form factor concept and experimental determination methods the form factor concept has been long discussed since the early 20 t h century ittc 1957 stated that ship resistance extrapolation based on three dimensional analysis such as form factor approach has been considered when the ittc 1957 line was selected in fact some researchers believed that a two dimensional flow line is not sufficient for the extrapolation problem ittc 1957 but rather that each hull form requires a separate extrapolator such as hughes 1954 the definition of form factor as described by hughes was adopted by the ittc 1972 and it is still in practice the wave making resistance depends on the froude number and at low speeds it becomes negligible for most hulls thus in carefully conducted experiments where care is taken with regard to turbulence stimulation measurement accuracy at low speeds and good surface finish a point in the c t curve can be found from this point towards smaller froude numbers the curve of c t is sensibly parallel to the two dimensional turbulent friction line this is called by hughes the low froude number run in point hughes 1954 the total resistance curve is formulated as 1 c t c f c f o r m c w c f o r m k c f where c f is the resistance equivalent to a flat plate in two dimensional flow c f o r m is form resistance due to the shape of the hull c w is wave resistance and k is the form factor c f o r m is proportional to c f when the flow is turbulent and the given hull is smooth streamlined without separation and in symmetrical form when towed in zero incidence angle c f o r m is made up of components due to additional skin friction caused by curvature effects flow in transverse directions and eddy making hughes 1954 as hughes 1954 described form factor for a hull can be determined by the ratio c t c f at the run in point since the c w is small enough be neglected in eq 1 however in order to find the run in point the speed range for the resistance test must be extended to very low f n and r e numbers which is rather challenging as the r e at such low speeds might be too low for turbulence stimulators to make sure the flow around the hull is turbulent additionally certain scatter in resistance measurements at low speeds due to worsening measurement accuracy for small forces can hinder the form factor determination as lindgren and dyne 1980 indicated as an alternative prohaska 1966 suggested a simple method to derive the form factor from resistance tests when no separation is present the form factor is expressed as 2 c t c w 1 k c f the wave resistance coefficient c w can be expressed as eq 3 which is the asymptotic expansion formula of wave making resistance coefficient presented by inui as cited in toki 2008 3 c w a f r 4 b f r 8 c f r 12 d f r 16 c t at model scale is then expressed together with the inui s asymptotic expansion formula eq 3 as 4 c tm 1 k c f c w 1 k c f a f r 4 b f r 8 c f r 12 d f r 16 neglecting the higher order terms of eq 4 as they are close to zero at low froude numbers and dividing each sides by c f the following linear relationship is obtained 5 c tm c f 1 k a f r 4 c f prohaska 1966 noted that when results of approximately 200 model tests have been plotted with eq 5 for f n between 0 1 and 0 2 the c t c f values for a great majority of the models plot on straight lines one of the exceptions when the c t c f values deviated from the straight line and points correlate with concave curves is with hull forms with c b 0 75 it was suspected that 1 k may be speed dependent or as prohaska 1966 stated can be easily explained by as resulting from increasing trim on the bow the other hull form prohaska observed where c t c f values plot on convex curves was twin screw models with appendages and for some models with full aft body lines which was explained by a certain separation prohaska 1966 it should be noted that detection of flow separation and treatment of deeply submerged transoms remain as challenges of the prohaska method however the main weakness of the prohaska method discussed in modern literature is the bulbous bow near the water surface and partly submerged bulbous bow in partial loaded conditions which is not mentioned by prohaska 1966 since the model test data used by prohaska dates back to 1966 and earlier when bulbous bows were not a popular design concept in order to illustrate this aspect of the uncertainty of form factor determination caused by the prohaska method the model test results of the resistance curves of two hulls are plotted as in eq 5 and presented in fig 1 and fig 2 in order to protect the confidentiality of the test results c t c f curves shown in figs 1 and 2 are slightly tilted without changing neither the general shape of the curves nor the relative position of each measurement point at the same froude number hull 1 and hull 2 are only different in bulbous bow and they are geometrically similar for the rest of the hull 95 identical hulls the bulbous bow of hull 1 features a mild goose neck design distinctly convex upper stem profile of the bulb and has significantly more volume close to water surface at design loading condition compared to hull 2 as can be seen from fig 1 not all c t c f values of hull 1 in design loading condition follow a straight line within the recommended f n range which is between 0 1 and 0 2 as indicated by the green vertical lines the concave shape of c t c f values for hull 1 can be explained by the presence of significant and often steep waves that are generated by the bulb the waves generated at significantly lower froude numbers than the design speed are too short in wave length to favourably interact with the bow waves of the hull on the other hand c t c f values of hull 2 reasonably follow a straight line which suits the description of prohaska 1966 since the waves are much smaller at low f n as a result of reduced the pressure gradient and moving the bulb volume away from the water surface considering that the two hulls are 95 identical large differences are observed in c t c f curves the uncertainly with the prohaska method further increases in the ballast loading conditions as shown in fig 2 the c t c f values of hull 1 within the recommended range shows a large hump which cannot be used for a line fit in other words the wave making resistance cannot be described by eq 4 and the linear relationship proposed by prohaska in eq 5 is not valid in ballast condition at the low speeds hull 2 also shows a hump in c t c f values which was not existent in the design condition in order to demonstrate that a different friction line would not have helped the c t c f values are also calculated with the katsui friction line katsui et al 2005 instead of the 1957 ittc model ship correlation line as seen in fig 1 the convex shape of the c t c f values persists as shown in this example quantifying the uncertainty or error of prohaska form factor determination method is difficult since it is very sensitive to the hull design considering that the bulbous bows are now a common feature of modern ship design it is hard to advocate the validity and practicality of the prohaska method for all hull designs and loading conditions one further aspect of uncertainty of form factor determination with the prohaska method originates from the experimental uncertainty u d the uncertainty on form factor can be significantly higher than the experimental uncertainty since it is not directly measured but obtained as a result of data reduction i e regression analysis this will be discussed thoroughly in section 4 when the towing tank tests for kvlcc2 in ballast loading condition are presented 3 participants and methods in total 9 different organisations with 7 different cfd codes contributed to the current study the organisations are listed in table 1 together with the main features of their methods the results will be discussed and presented with the id numbers of the organisations in the paper two equation turbulence models k ω sst rng k ε realizable k ε are used by the majority of the computations anisotropic models easm and rstm are not used by all organisations but easm model is still covering a large portion of the calculations only one organisation used the one equation spalart allmaras model simulations were performed using finite volume codes with 2nd order accurate schemes except one code with 3rd order accurate scheme the grids used were single or multi block structured grids butt joined curvilinear or overlapping techniques and unstructured ones computational domain shape and size varies with each code majority of the upstream boundaries are located between 1lpp and 1 5lpp from the fore perpendicular fp but ecn cnrs and sspa ctu are differing from others by using the distance of 5lpp and 0 5lpp respectively the downstream extent of the domains varied between 8lpp and 0 8lpp from the aft perpendicular ap while the common distance of downstream extent is between 2lpp and 3lpp lateral both sidewards and downwards extend is commonly located between 1 5lpp and 2 5lpp away from the ship center plane and free surface plane but two notable exceptions are 1lpp and 4lpp from um and ecn cnrs respectively all computations were performed as double model with a symmetry boundary condition at the ship center plane and free surface plane most popular upstream boundary condition is uniform in all variables with the exception of one participant with prescribed pressure the downstream conditions are usually zero gradient in the streamwise direction except the pressure quantity that is specified the lateral boundaries are dominated by far field boundary conditions but slip and zero gradient boundaries are also used majority of the computations approximately 60 are performed with wall resolved condition and the remaining simulations were performed with wall functions the cfd based form factor method considered for this study follows the assumptions of hughes 1954 and is derived using the relation 6 1 k c f c pv c f 0 c v c f 0 where the frictional resistance coefficient c f and viscous pressure coefficient c pv are obtained by the double body cfd simulation c f 0 in the denominator of eq 6 is the equivalent flat plate resistance in two dimensional flow obtained from the same reynolds number as the computations in this study three friction lines are considered the ittc 57 model ship correlation line ittc 1957 the katsui line katsui et al 2005 and numerical friction lines proposed by korkmaz et al 2019b it is worth mentioning that the ittc 57 line is not a pure friction line but it contains a component of form resistance 11 94 of the friction line of hughes 1954 it is included in the scope of the study because it is still the model to ship correlation line recommended by ittc 2014a the shortcomings of the prohaska method for the hulls with a pronounced bulbous bow have been mentioned in section 2 in a case when there is just a small gap between the top of the bulb and the still water surface a flow separation may be generated around the top of the bulb for the double body simulations such flow separation would not occur in free surface flow therefore the form factor obtained from the double body computation will be affected raven et al 2008 suggested that if the bulb is submerged more by trimming the hull bow down this issue can be prevented another drawback that is shared between cfd and efd based form factor determination methods is the large submerged transom which may cause flow separation in the wake the test cases used in this study do not possess the hull form features that may cause aforementioned issues for the cfd based form factor method therefore no corrections have been applied to the double body flow computations 4 test cases and computational conditions the two hulls used for the current study are kvlcc2 with rudder kcs with rudder the kvlcc2 and kcs hulls are designed at the korea research institute for ships and ocean engineering kriso to be used as open test cases for cfd predictions extensive towing tank tests and cfd investigations were carried out in the last two decades therefore hull lines and detailed hydrostatics are not presented the hull and rudder geometries are obtained from tokyo 2015 and simman 2008 workshops for kcs and kvlcc2 respectively the computational conditions for the study is presented in table 2 non dimensional quantities r e and f n are based on lpp the force coefficients are non dimensionalized with the corresponding wetted surface coefficients s l2pp to the loading conditions for each hull and loading condition two different speeds were used for the computations in order to investigate the importance and the effect of selecting a speed for the form factor determination the first speed is chosen in the low side of the regular model testing speed range where ct cf is close to the form factor see fig 1 determined by the prohaska method the second speed is the design speed of each vessel data for resistance tests of kvlcc2 and kcs at design draught are adopted from van et al 2011 the resistance test data of the kvlcc2 in ballast loading condition has never been published therefore sspa determined a typical ballast loading condition for very large crude carriers vlcc towing tank tests were performed at sspa s towing tank including an uncertainty analysis of the resistance tests 4 1 uncertainty analysis of kvlcc2 resistance tests in ballast draught a kvlcc2 model with a scale factor of 45 714 made of the plastic foam material divinycell was manufactured with 5 axis cnc milling machine at sspa after the surface finishing and painting the model was scanned with a 3d scanner to check the tolerances described in ittc 2014c a trip wire is mounted at 5 of l pp aft from the fore perpendicular for the turbulence stimulation the hull model is equipped with a dummy propeller hub and a rudder the geometry of the rudder is obtained from simman 2008 and the dummy hub is a simple cylinder with the diameter of the boss end of the hull the model tests were performed in sspa s towing tank which is 260 m long 10 m wide and 5 m deep the model tests were carried out in mid may 2020 the total resistance sinkage and trim were measured at froude numbers varying between 0 110 and 0 147 the mid sectional area of the kvlcc2 model in ballast loading condition is 0 155 of the towing tank section area therefore no blockage correction is applied the tests were started by performing one run per f n 0 119 and f n 0 142 speeds respectively it was followed by starting from the lowest f n and the speed is increased successively at each run after 20 min of waiting time there was a total of five repeat tests for f n 0 119 and f n 0 142 while the rest of the speeds were repeated four times the uncertainty regarding the wetted surface area are quantified by measuring the model ballasting the model and weights calibrated 25 separate pieces used for ballasting the model were weighted by two digital scales ittc 2014b resulting uncertainties on the wetted surface are presented in table 3 for f n 0 119 and f n 0 142 speeds the relative uncertainty of the towing speed is assessed by the bias limit of the towing carriage and they are presented in table 3 the water temperature during the tests showed less than 0 1 c variation as described in ittc 2014b the measured resistance is converted to 16 0 c which was used for the cfd computations prior to the tests the corresponding component of uncertainties in resistance due to temperature variation are presented in table 3 the model was scanned and checked at the model workshop the thermal deformation of the model is expected to be limited as the temperature difference between the model workshop and the towing tank is less than 5 c an in house design dynamometer with a sampling rate of 10 hz was used for measuring the resistance the measurement at each speed is obtained by averaging the time history of the signal as described in ittc 2014b the standard uncertainty of average of the sampling history varied between 0 0008 and 0 0015 while the average of all repetitions is 0 0011 therefore the uncertainty of one reading from the data acquisition system das is negligible the dynamometer available at the time of the towing tank tests were calibrated to a much greater range than the maximum model resistance as a result the uncertainty regarding to the dynamometer is the dominant source as can be seen in table 3 the dynamometer calibration was checked after the tests additionally a calibration with a range that was approximately 3 times the maximum model resistance was performed the uncertainty due to the dynamometer dropped nearly three times with the smaller range which would have halved the total uncertainty in table 3 based on the analysis described in ittc 2014b the significant components of uncertainties are combined through rss root sum square as seen in table 3 major sources of the uncertainties are originating from the dynamometer with the large calibration range and the precision of measurement in the repeat tests the uncertainty of resistance measurements for f n 0 119 and f n 0 142 are 0 74 and 0 53 respectively the expanded uncertainties in table 3 correspond to the confidence level of 95 in table 4 combined measurement uncertainties are presented in per cent of the measured data value which is the mean total resistance of all repeat tests at each speed the uncertainties are between 0 51 and 0 84 as seen in table 4 it is decreasing with increasing speed because at the high speeds the contribution from the dynamometer decreases as mentioned before one aspect of uncertainty of form factor determination with prohaska method originates from the experimental uncertainty u d in order to illustrate that the uncertainty on form factor is significantly higher than the experimental uncertainty the prohaska plot is presented in fig 4 with the error bars representing the experimental uncertainties presented in table 4 unlike the main discussion point in section 2 the c t c f values can be sensibly aligned to a line as the waves generated at the ballast loading condition were not too substantial as can be seen in fig 3 the regression line in fig 4 is obtained by applying the method explained by york et al 2004 this method considers the experimental uncertainties in the regression progress and predicts the uncertainties in the form factor as well the resulting regression line is indicated as the york s method in fig 4 where the uncertainty on the form factor is illustrated with an error bar at f n 4 c f 0 the uncertainty of form factor is calculated as 0 011 additionally a monte carlo simulation is performed to illustrate the variation on form factor due to measurement uncertainty for each iteration all measured point are varied as 7 c t c t u sd r where c t is measured point presented in table 4 u sd is the measurement uncertainty and r is normally distributed random number in every iteration a new regression line and form factor are calculated with the york et al 2004 method the error k k y o r k obtained from the monte carlo simulation is normalized by the uncertainty obtained from the york et al 2004 method σ y o r k and the probability density function pdf is calculated as can be seen in fig 5 the monte carlo simulation indicates a normal distribution for the normalized error of the form factor and the standard deviation of the error is equal to the uncertainty obtained from the york et al 2004 method as a result of using both methods the uncertainty of the form factor is calculated as 0 022 corresponding to 1 9 of 1 k for the 95 confidence interval 5 results the analysis of approximately 300 double body simulations of the two hulls under the conditions stated in table 2 is discussed in this section 5 1 friction and viscous pressure resistance in model scale firstly friction and viscous pressure resistance coefficients are investigated since only these quantities are directly computed by cfd codes instead form factor is a combination of the two computed values and a friction line therefore detecting the tendencies between different cfd methods might be hindered due to errors cancelling each other 5 1 1 uncertainty analysis uncertainty analysis is performed to quantify the grid uncertainty ug by shipflow and nagisa codes for the grid dependence study five geometrically similar grids were used with the former code and systematically refined grid triplets are prepared for latter both shipflow and nagisa performs the simulations in double precision in order to eliminate the round off errors the iterative uncertainties were quantified by the standard deviation of the force in percent of the average force over the last 10 of the iterations iterative uncertainty for cf and cpv were kept below 0 01 and 0 15 for shipflow while iterative uncertainty for cf cpv and ct for nagisa were kept below 0 1 of their mean values for all simulations in model scale therefore it was assumed that the numerical errors are dominated by the discretization errors and both iterative errors and round off errors are neglected for shipflow the procedure proposed by eça and hoekstra 2014 was used to predict the grid uncertainties which are presented for the finest grid as a ratio of the computed value u g s 1 in table 5 in order to quantify the grid uncertainty for nagisa three criteria are adopted e g factor of safety fs method proposed by xing and stern 2009 correction factor cf method and grid convergence index gci method shown in ittc 2017 table 6 summarizes the results for kvlcc2 in design and ballast loading condition and kcs in the cases where monotonic convergence is not obtained the solution change is less than 1 of s1 ε 21 ε 32 therefore ug is omitted and noted with a symbol in table 6 5 1 2 statistics of c f and c pv the simulations in model scale comprise computations from seven different codes and six different turbulence models with wall functions and wall resolved approaches these computations include not only the cfd setups according to the best practice guidelines bpg or standard settings but also setups that deviated from recommended guidelines since one of the aim of this study is to identify the methods that are not well suited for the form factor determination in order to differentiate the contribution of the computations with deliberately made undesired settings two different populations are considered when the statistics such as mean and standard deviation are calculated the first population denoted as p1 includes all simulations and the second population denoted as p2 is the computations performed with best practices or standard settings of each code it was deemed necessary to add one more population as a sub population of the latter because of concerns on the statistics being biased by a code significantly outnumbering others in some test cases therefore the third population denoted as p3 is obtained by selecting the computations from the two finest grids of each code per cfd approach such as turbulence model wall treatment this selection is based on the number of cells under the assumption that fine grids have less discretization uncertainty the mean and standard deviation of c f and c pv for each condition is calculated with the three previously mentioned populations as presented in table 7 and table 8 it is observed that statistics of different populations of the same condition showed limited variation except kvlcc2 in design condition which is the condition many of the deliberate variations were applied to cfd setups in fig 6 the population 2 and simulations with non desired cfd set ups are visualised by dividing all the computations for kvlcc2 in design condition into two groups computations with non standard cfd set ups and simulations with the best practice guidelines bpg or standard cfd set ups the small difference in statistics between the population 2 and 3 shows that the statistics are not biased even though some test cases are overcrowded with simulations from one code the computations performed with the best practices or the standard settings of each code population 2 will be used for the rest of the analysis except when the results of deliberate variations of cfd setups are discussed friction and viscous pressure resistance coefficients c f and c pv in model scale for kvlcc2 in both loading conditions and kcs in design condition are presented versus grid size in logarithmic scale in fig 7 and fig 8 in order to have references for the friction resistance coefficient the ittc 57 line and the katsui line are plotted in fig 7 as can be seen in figs 7 and 8 there is no distinct dependence of results on the grid size note that this is a comparison of unsystematically varied methods and grids however other dependencies such as the turbulence modelling and the wall treatment were found both on cf and cpv the frictional resistance coefficients from um participant 1 and sspa ctu participant 6 indicate a strong dependence on turbulence model while this effect is rather limited on the results of ecn cnrs participant 3 nmri participant 4 and ynu participant 9 the viscous pressure coefficients from ecn cnrs and sspa ctu show larger dependence on turbulence models than the others ecn cnrs and nmri performed simulations both with wall resolved and wall function both codes indicate a significant dependence on wall treatment especially for cf but also for cpv which is less sensitive to the wall treatment than the frictional resistance component variations of cfd setups the previously mentioned cfd setups that varied from recommended guidelines on kvlcc2 in design condition have been applied by um ecn cnrs sspa ctu and sssri um participant 1 varied grids focusing specifically to the grid resolution near the wall using two turbulent models as can be seen in fig 9 where all computations on kvlcc2 in design condition are presented k ω sst and spalart allmaras turbulence models shows high sensitivity on cf to both grid refinement and y variation however the variation on cpv is limited except for the coarsest grid set ecn cnrs participant 3 performed grid variations also with adaptive grid refinement when wall functions were used cf and cpv showed small variation even for the very coarse grids however wall resolved simulations of ecn cnrs are more grid dependent compared to wall functions this is explained by the increasing grid resolution near the wall rather than the increase in grid size for the wall resolved computations in addition to the systematic grid variations for the grid dependence studies sspa ctu participant 6 performed grid variations by coarsening the grid of the bow and the stern region of the kvlcc2 hull in the longitudinal direction while keeping the rest of the grid the same for this exercise the second finest grid and the coarsest grid of the grid dependence study was selected as a starting point coarsening the bow and stern regions up to grid density of one third of the starting grids did not show a significant variation on cf but some variation in cpv for the same turbulence model except for one case when the coarsest grid was further coarsened in the aft the cpv was calculated extremely high as seen in fig 6 highest two values from participant 6 while the variation of cf was limited the grid variations of sspa ctu on kvlcc2 showed that when the grid resolution normal to the wall is kept similar cf and cpv are more sensitive to the grid density in aftbody than forebody simulations of sssri participant 7 was performed with three different turbulence models as can be seen from fig 9 both cf and cpv obtained from reynolds stress turbulence model rstm were significantly higher than the realizable k ε and k ω sst models with similar grids and average y values additionally different types of wall functions were used with realizable k ε and k ω sst models while keeping the grids similar cf and cpv showed only marginal change due to different wall function type for the k ω sst model however the realizable k ε model showed a substantial variation in both cf and cpv due to different wall function treatment finally y is varied with the realizable k ε model it is observed that when the average y increases from 71 to 112 in steps of 11 cf also increases up to 2 while cpv decreases up to 4 5 as shown in fig 9 therefore a significant dependence of y and wall function treatment on viscous resistance is observed with the realizable k ε model 5 2 cfd based form factors with the ittc 57 line cfd based form factors are calculated using eq 6 and presented versus the number of grid points in fig 10 note that only the simulations performed according to the best practice guidelines or standard settings of each code are presented and logarithmic scale is used in the grid points axis for better clarity in addition to standard deviation in percentage of 1 k and mean of the cfd based form factors k form factors determined by model tests of van et al 2011 for kvlcc2 and kcs in design condition and kvlcc2 in ballast loading condition of sspa are plotted in fig 10 mean of the form factor predictions for the kvlcc2 in design condition at f n 0 119 and f n 0 142 are both close to the form factor determined experimentally the standard deviation of the form factors obtained from the unsystematically varied methods and grids at both speeds is around 1 9 if the form factor is used in extrapolation of the model resistance value for this kvlcc2 case this would cause approximately 3 spread in the predicted full scale resistance roughness correlation allowance and air resistance excluded number of grid cells among the computations varied between one million to 62 million however form factor predictions do not indicate dependence on the number of grid cells mean of the form factor predictions for the kcs in design condition at f n 0 26 is very close to the experimental value however at f n 0 152 the mean value of form factor is 0 015 smaller than the mean form factor at f n 0 26 as shown in table 9 in section 5 3 this difference was not as large for the kvlcc2 because the r e difference between the speeds were small 19 however r e difference between the speeds for the kcs hull is 71 which is big enough to reveal the speed dependency of the form factor as it is discussed in further detail in section 5 3 the standard deviation of 1 5 translates to approximately 1 in full scale resistance excluding the contribution of roughness correlation allowance and air resistance note that this is a remarkable result even though such a wide range methods and grids were used since kcs like hulls are the ones that suffers the most from the prohaska method because of the prominent bulb designs all the computations for kvlcc2 in ballast case had to be performed prior to the model tests the slight discrepancy in water temperature between computations and tests were corrected using ittc 2014b procedures for form factor determination form factor predictions for the kvlcc2 in ballast loading condition showed a similar standard deviation to the other cases however the mean value of the form factor is not as close to the experimentally determined form factor as the other cases as explained in section 4 uncertainty analysis was performed for the form factor when the uncertainty of the prohaska method on the experimentally determined form factor is considered majority of the simulations are still within the uncertainty range it is observed in fig 10 that some form factor predictions are relatively far from the experimentally derived form factor however it is encouraging to observe that there are some consistent patterns for most of the codes the form factor was under predicted similarly by ynu participant 9 and ecn cnrs participant 3 for both kvlcc2 and kcs hulls in design condition results of sssri participant 7 are also under predictions for all the cases it should be noted that as long as one code with a certain set up consistently predicts the form factor with the same tendency application of correlation factors c p or c a in the 1978 ittc power prediction method will help to reduce the discrepancies cfd code dependency the dependencies and tendencies of each code for the form factor predictions are plotted in fig 11 and fig 12 computations from each code are stacked in separate columns where box and whisker plots are placed with markers the box plot can be identified with the gray color and sized with the lower and upper quartiles lines extending from the boxes whiskers extend to the data within 1 5 times the interquartile range iqr the markers are colored with the turbulence models shaped according to the wall treatment type and sized according to the number of cells turbulence model dependency the choice of turbulence model stands out as a decisive element of the cfd based form factors when the results of um ecn cnrs nmri and sspa ctu are considered even if the same code and similar cfd set ups are used a significant dependence on turbulence models are observed however a general trend for each turbulence model cannot be maintained either for example ecn cnrs participant 3 nmri participant 4 and ynu participant 9 predicted higher form factors with easm turbulence model than with k ω sst while this is the opposite with sspa ctu participant 6 it should be also noted that the form factor predictions from the same turbulence model with different cfd codes are largely scattered therefore the dependence of form factors to the cfd codes surpasses the choice of the turbulence model wall treatment dependency the type of wall treatment and y can be considered as significant dependencies of form factor as it was the case for c f and c pv investigated earlier ecn cnrs and nmri performed computations with the same turbulence models of k ω sst and easm and also both participants had simulations with and without wall functions as can be seen from figs 11 and 12 form factor dependence on the wall treatment is observed with both ecn cnrs participant 3 and nmri participant 4 while a significant dependence on y was observed with the realizable k ε model for sssri on the right side of figs 11 and 12 simulations from all codes are sorted with the type of wall treatment the markers are colored with the type of the grid the box plots of both kvlcc2 and kcs indicate that interquartile range iqr of simulations with wall functions are smaller than wall resolved however the distance between the whiskers are similar for both approaches although the cfd results as a whole are a product of unsystematically varied methods and grids the comparison of median values of different wall modelling indicates that simulations with wall functions predict considerably smaller form factors compared to wall resolved approach 5 3 form factors with alternative friction lines as mentioned earlier in section 1 speed dependency or scale effects have been found on the form factor by the previous investigations however it should be noted that the form factors should always be considered with the friction line used as the physical meaning of speed dependency or scale effects on the form factor is that the viscous resistance of a ship is not proportional to the selected friction line even if the concept of hughes 1954 see section 2 is true different sizes of geosim models and double body simulations at different reynolds numbers will result in different form factors as a result of using an improper friction line the currently recommended fiction line the ittc 57 line ittc 1957 is in fact not a pure friction line as hughes 1954 hypothesis requires but a model ship correlation line therefore speed dependency of the form factors with ittc 57 line is not extraordinary but expected instead of the ittc 57 line c f 0 in eq 6 can be replaced by other friction lines such as katsui et al 2005 or numerical friction lines nfl that are derived by using the same code as the double body simulations prior to this study only sspa ctu obtained a nfl with the shipflow code for easm and k ω sst turbulence models korkmaz et al 2019b since other participants did not have numerical friction lines frictional resistance coefficients of infinitely thin 2d plates were computed by nmri sssri strathclyde and ynu with the same turbulence models wall treatment and reynolds number as the corresponding double body simulations these c f values obtained from the flat plate simulations were then used as c f 0 in eq 6 for the form factor determination form factors based on the ittc 57 line and the katsui line are also calculated using the same simulations where nfl data is available the mean values and the standard deviations of the form factors based on different friction lines are presented in table 9 the speed dependency can be identified by comparing the mean of the form factor predictions of different reynolds numbers at the same loading condition as expected speed dependency of form factors with the ittc 57 line is observed for the both hulls and the loading conditions the largest speed dependency however is observed for the form factors of the kcs hull with the ittc 57 line as the difference between the reynolds numbers is the greatest among other cases the speed dependencies are reduced considerably when the katsui line is used and they are almost completely eliminated with numerical friction lines for all test cases regardless of an existence of speed dependency of form factors the choice of speed from which the form factor will be determined is a relevant issue for cfd computation the extrapolated full scale viscous resistance predictions will be influenced by the choice of the model scale speed when the speed dependency exists therefore the speeds that correlates better with the experimentally determined form factors should be preferred based on the form factor predictions presented in table 9 design speeds of kvlcc2 and kcs are suggested if the ittc 57 line is used for the form factor determination another point of concern is choosing the speed that provides the smaller numerical uncertainties and modelling errors the grid uncertainties presented in tables 5 and 6 for shipflow and nagisa codes showed limited change of grid uncertainties with the speed while the change of u g were not systematically increasing or decreasing in terms of modelling errors numerical transition from laminar to turbulent flow can be concerning when the r e is too low as this phenomenon occurs even without the use of transition turbulent models as shown in eça and hoekstra 2008 and korkmaz et al 2019b as presented in table 9 the mean of form factors with ittc 57 line greatly differs from katsui line and nfl the physical explanation of this observation is that when ittc 57 line is used the form resistance see section 2 is significantly under predicted due to too large frictional resistance component in model scale the effect of the under prediction of form resistance to the full scale viscous resistance will be discussed in section 5 4 2 form factors with numerical friction lines for kvlcc2 are presented in fig 13 opposing to the results from the ittc 57 line the mean value of the form factors with nfl are almost identical for both speeds close investigation on the individual simulation points between the different speeds also support this suggestion except the simulations from strathclyde participant 8 and the coarse grids of sspa ctu participant 6 kvlcc2 in both loading conditions shows smaller speed dependency with ittc 57 line compared to kcs as the reynolds number difference between the two speeds is smaller it is worth noticing that the speed dependency is larger in design condition than the ballast loading condition with the ittc 57 line this is a consequence of the artificial steepness of the ittc 57 line which increases as the r e decreases therefore as any other model with big scale factor the ratio of ship to model length would kvlcc2 model in design condition suffers more from the scale effects with the ittc 57 line the standard deviations of the form factor in percentage of 1 k predictions for all cases are presented in table 9 using the katsui line the standard deviation of the form factor are the same in all cases compared to using the ittc 57 line as the same computations were used form factors with nfl showed an increase in the standard deviation for the kvlcc2 in design condition however the standard deviation is reduced significantly for kvlcc2 in ballast loading condition and especially for kcs due to a decrease in variation of form factors obtained from different turbulence models even though the dependence of turbulence models on form factor seems to decrease by the adoption the nfl of the same code and turbulence model as the double body simulation the form factors are not expected to be the same for different turbulence models application of nfl for different turbulence models arranges the quantity of form resistance with respect to the friction line of the respective turbulence model as a result nearly the same full scale viscous resistance values can be obtained by the different turbulence models as shown in section 5 4 2 as an alternative to the cfd based form factor determination method used in this study wang et al 2016 and terziev et al 2019 calculated the form factors simply by dividing the viscous pressure coefficient to friction coefficient k c pv c f obtained from the double body simulation with the hull therefore the need of any friction line is removed for form factor determination this method of form factor determination is dismissed in this study because of the deviation from the approach of hughes 1954 as c f from double body computation already includes the additional skin friction caused by the curvature effects which should have been included the form resistance as explained in section 2 5 4 full scale predictions 5 4 1 statics of computed c f and c pv in full scale full scale double body simulations are performed according to the conditions described in table 2 the friction and viscous pressure resistance coefficients are presented in fig 14 and fig 15 respectively the mean and standard deviation of the computed resistance coefficients are calculated excluding the results from nrc ocreand sssri who encountered difficulties with grid generation the mean of c f is by approximately 6 and 3 higher than the katsui line due to additional skin friction caused by the curvature effects for kvlcc2 and kcs respectively the standard deviation of c f in full scale is reduced considerably compared to model scale for kvlcc2 at both loading conditions mainly because of the reduction of dependence on turbulence models the standard deviation of c f is similar both in model and full scale for the kcs hull however the standard deviation of c pv is increased for kcs and kvlcc2 in design condition compared to model scale while the variation of c pv is similar in model and full scale for kvlcc2 in ballast condition considering the standard deviation and the quantity of c f and c pv observed in full scale simulations the viscous pressure resistance component is the dominant source of variation in c v as mentioned earlier the difficulties in the grid generation for nrc ocre and sssri can be observed through the average y values varied between 450 and 750 for nrc ocre and 8300 to 15 000 for sssri as a result mainly the predicted c f values are significantly higher than the mean of the rest of the computations a strong dependence on turbulence model was observed with the computations of sspa ctu in model scale however this dependence is reduced by half for sspa ctu except the kvlcc2 in ballast loading condition nmri performed two simulations per case where one with wall resolved higher number of grid cells and the other with wall function where the latter under predicted both friction and viscous pressure resistance coefficients compared to wall resolved approach 5 4 2 full scale viscous resistance extrapolation full scale viscous resistance predictions of kvlcc2 and kcs hulls are performed via extrapolation from model scale and compared with full scale computations in fig 16 and fig 17 the extrapolation to full scale is performed using the cfd based form factors and the ittc 57 katsui and numerical friction lines in figs 16 and 17 full scale viscous resistance predictions are presented as box and whisker plots with the markers the participants without full scale computations are excluded for clarity and fair comparison between extrapolated values and full scale computations the friction line used for the extrapolation and form factor determination is indicated within brackets on the y axis label the extrapolations based on the model tests data of van et al 2011 with the ittc 57 line is represented by a horizontal line that is almost coinciding with the mean c v values of the predictions from cfd based form factors for both kvlcc2 and kcs when the ittc 57 line is used full scale viscous resistance of kvlcc2 and kcs are approximately 6 6 and 5 5 lower on average compared to extrapolation based on katsui line the mean of the extrapolations based on the ittc 57 line is 9 7 and 8 0 lower than the full scale computations for kvlcc2 and kcs respectively similar conclusions were obtained by the investigations performed by raven et al 2008 on a containership which showed that c v from direct full scale computations are 7 4 higher than the extrapolation method with the ittc 57 line this difference is mainly due to too steep the ittc 57 line which causes an underestimated c v at full scale raven et al 2008 suggested that the underestimation of c v due to the ittc 57 line is mainly compensated by the correlation allowance c a in the ittc scaling procedures using the same model scale simulations but form factors and extrapolation with the katsui line the full scale viscous resistance values are similar to the predictions of full scale simulations the cv predictions with numerical friction lines are only performed with sspa ctu as others did not have numerical friction lines the mean of extrapolated full scale viscous resistance with nfl are in agreement with the mean of full scale computation results however the extrapolated values are slightly under predicted compared to direct full scale computations for both hulls agreement between the extrapolations with the katsui line and nfl is also noticeable as can be seen in figs 16 and 17 the standard deviation of full scale computations are twice as large as the standard deviation of model to full scale extrapolations with the ittc 57 and katsui lines for both hulls this means that full scale simulations are still less reliable than the model scale computations as the agreement on the cfd predictions are higher in model scale the standard deviations of extrapolations with the ittc 57 and katsui lines are almost identical but as discussed in section 5 3 the speed dependency on the form factor was noticeably reduced with the katsui line compared to the ittc 57 line when numerical friction lines are considered only the results from the sspa ctu are considered for the comparison of the standard deviations for a fair comparison for kvlcc2 and kcs the smallest standard deviations are observed with extrapolation with the numerical friction lines which also eliminated the speed dependency of the form factors almost completely the extrapolated full scale viscous resistance values presented in figs 16 and 17 were based on the model scale computations performed at f n 0 142 and f n 0 26 for kvlcc2 in design loading condition and kcs respectively as presented in table 9 the form factors were speed dependent when ittc 57 and katsui lines were used therefore the extrapolated cv values would be approximately 1 2 and 0 7 lower than the cv values presented in figs 16 and 17 when the model scale computations at f n 0 119 and f n 0 152 are used with ittc 57 and katsui lines respectively on the other hand the application of nfl eliminated the speed dependency of the form factors almost completely as shown in table 9 the standard deviation is perhaps a more essential measure for improving the power predictions compared to the absolute values of c v predictions as long as c v is predicted with the same tendency correlation factors c p or c a based on the experience of each institution can be used effectively to adjust the final predictions in terms of absolute values 6 conclusions this paper presents an investigation on cfd based form factor methods which was initiated by the ittc specialist committee combined cfd efd methods the assumptions underlying the form factor approach and the prohaska method is discussed and model test data is compared to the rans simulations performed by 7 different cfd codes the disposition to leave the prohaska method of form factor determination is explained through two types of uncertainty the linear relationship proposed by prohaska in eq 5 is not valid for the hulls with prominent bulb designs at fully or partially submerged conditions since a substantial portion of the merchant and naval fleet are equipped with bulbous bows the validity of the prohaska method as a common tool for all hull forms is under question as discussed in section 2 it is difficult to quantify this uncertainty as the case sensitivity is very high the second uncertainty source of the prohaska method originates from the experimental uncertainty as demonstrated with the model tests results of kvlcc2 in ballast condition the experimental uncertainty is noticeably amplified for the form factor as a result of the regression analysis this amplification of the uncertainty on the form factor can be much more severe if a hull with voluminous bulb is tested where the c t c f values often cannot be used in low speed range therefore uncertainty of 0 022 within 95 confidence interval on the form factor with prohaska method on kvlcc2 in ballast condition can be considered merely as a best case scenario model scale simulations are performed with seven different codes and six different turbulence models with wall functions and wall resolved approaches the resulting form factor predictions with the ittc 57 line from the computations with recommended or standard cfd setups compared well with the experimentally determined form factors for kvlcc2 and kcs in design loading condition at design speeds the cfd based form factors are mostly under predicted for kvlcc2 in ballast loading condition compared to experiments however the majority of the cfd based form factors were within the experimental uncertainty the form factors showed 1 5 2 5 standard deviation in percentage of 1 k even though the abundance of unsystematically varied methods and grids it should be noted that the experimental uncertainty of the form factor will be of similar levels even for the cases when the linear relationship proposed by prohaska holds model scale computations include not only the cfd setups according to the best practice guidelines or standard settings but also setups that deviated from the recommended guidelines as one of the goal of this study is to identify the methods that are not well suited for the form factor determination the resulting form factor predictions with the ittc 57 line from the computations with non standard cfd setups indicated that describing the boundary layer with a good quality grid in terms of the grid resolution and the first cell size normal to the wall is essential for both wall treatment types are considerably more sensitive to the grid density in aftbody than forebody and can be sensitive to the different types of wall functions with certain turbulence models such as realizable k ε as mentioned before different codes indicated varying dependencies on cfd setups and therefore general recommendations for all cfd setups cannot be made specifically for the sake of form factor determination instead it is observed that most of the codes with a certain cfd setup showed consistent patterns of form factor predictions among different test cases if these trends are confirmed with more hulls and test cases application of correlation factors c p or c a unique for each code and method will be able to reduce the differences in full scale predictions further speed dependency of the form factors are confirmed with the application of the ittc 57 line for all test cases the question of which model scale speed should be chosen for the cfd based form factors with the ittc 57 line cannot be answered within the scope of this study because of the differing trends of each code however the mean values of form factors with ittc 57 line are closer to the experimental values in design speeds of kvlcc2 and kcs hulls if another friction line is preferred such as the katsui or numerical friction lines the speed dependency on the form factor is reduced significantly and therefore decreasing the importance of the choice of the speed for the model scale simulations full scale viscous resistance is calculated by extrapolating the model scale results with different friction correlation lines and direct full scale simulations the scatter among the full scale computations are substantially higher than the extrapolations from the model scale for both kvlcc2 and kcs hulls even though the standard deviation of c f in full scale computations is reduced considerably compared to model scale computations for kvlcc2 at both loading conditions as a result of reduced dependence on turbulence models the increased discrepancy on full scale c pv predictions lead to a larger scatter of c v for full scale simulations hence the full scale simulations should not to be preferred over the form factor approach yet finally cfd based form factors can be considered as an alternative or supplementary method to the prohaska method it is considered as a step towards answering the request of ittc performance committee of 1978 future developments for the determination of form factors on a more scientific basis is expected ittc 1978 the selection of friction lines would also have an impact on reducing the scatter between the full scale predictions and sea trials due to elimination of scale effects however the improvements expected from a change of friction line are minor compared to the implementation of a cfd based form factor method although there are still shortcomings with full scale resistance predictions combination of efd and cfd is expected to provide immediate improvements to the 1978 ittc performance prediction method further studies should be performed with many more test cases and cfd codes to establish a better understanding for the dependencies of cfd methods on the form factor prediction as a final step comparison of sea trials and the power predictions with cfd based form factors should be performed for different types of

21191,the paper presents experimental and finite element analyses of the ultimate strength of a stiffened panel with a large opening on the plating and multi small openings on the longitudinal and transverse girders and subjected to combined uniaxial and lateral loads this investigation provides practical information to estimate the effect of the large and small openings on the ultimate compressive strength of deck panels in large passenger ships the experimental results are presented in terms of the load displacement and strain data overall and local structural collapse showing agreement with the simulations performed by the abaqus finite element solver the results show that the abnormal shape of the plate opening and its reinforcements change the overall buckling and collapse behaviour of the stiffened panel under compressive loads the finite element analysis also discusses the effect of initial imperfections lateral loads and various openings on the ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panel keywords ultimate strength experiment numerical simulation stiffened panel opening passenger ship 1 introduction large passenger ships are multi decked ships designed exclusively for the carriage of passengers and specifically for cruises a deck panel as an assembly of plating and stiffeners is penetrated by varieties of large openings on the plating due to the requirement of atrium theatre swimming pool etc and small openings on the stiffeners for running hvac heating ventilation and air conditioning systems passing pipes cables lightening and other design reasons the novel design complicates the issue of the strength of deck structure in the longitudinal vertical bending the existence of the openings can cause structural fracture stress concentrations and reduction in the ultimate strength the ship deck panels are subjected to both uniaxial compression induced by the hull girder sagging bending moment and lateral pressure load by the accommodation and public spaces for the stiffened panels without openings numerous investigations have been performed by employing analytical empirical experimental and numerical methods to analyse their buckling and ultimate behaviours in axial compression zhang 2016 kim et al 2018 generally the buckling and ultimate strength of stiffened plates are strongly affected by the flexural stiffness of stiffeners various failure modes were categorised as plate buckling flexural buckling of stiffener with attached plate restrained torsional buckling of stiffener and overall grillage buckling some studies were performed on steel plates and stiffened panels with openings experimental research is one of the most rigorous methods to analyse the mechanical behaviour of novel structures shanmugam et al 1986 performed ultimate compressive experiments on stiffened panels with circular or square openings proposing the effective width concept to analyse the loss in stiffness of plates kim et al 2009 conducted a series of experiments on the perforated plates and stiffened plates varying the aspect ratio and slenderness of plates the size shape and location of openings kumar et al 2009a 2009b carried out experimental investigations on the ultimate strength of stiffened plates with a central circular or square opening subjected to combined uniaxial and lateral loads recently saad eldeen et al 2016 2017 2018 carried out a series of ultimate strength experiments of steel plates and stiffened panels having a central opening of different shape and size in addition to different constructional steels the ultimate load carrying capacity decreases with the residual breadth of perforated plates and stiffened panels the stiffened panels show higher ultimate strength than the plates represented by the less lateral displacement between reinforcements generally experimental results are often used to derive analytical expressions and to validate the finite element methods nowadays the nonlinear finite element method is the preferred tool for predicting the ultimate carrying capacity of ship structures especially for the analysis of novel structure li et al 2017 2018 2019 and the analysis of novel strength such as cyclic ultimate strength proposed by liu and guedes soares 2020 the finite element analysis can provide an in depth understanding of the strength of stiffened panels with various openings shanmugam et al 1999 performed a series of finite element analyses of the ultimate compressive strength of plates with an opening in order to establish the design formulae considering various boundary conditions opening sizes loading types and plate slenderness ratios it was found that the plate with a circular opening generally has a higher ultimate load than the plate with a square opening where the diameter of the circular opening is equal to the side length of the square opening el sawy et al 2004 analysed the buckling of square and rectangular plates with a circular opening considering the plates with simply supported edges and subjected to axial compression they concluded that the critical buckling stress decreases with the plate slenderness and the opening size paik 2007 investigated the ultimate strength characteristics of steel plates with a single circular hole subjected to axial compression a series of finite element analyses were carried out with different hole diameters and an empirical formula was developed the parametric studies were conducted comprehensively by wang et al 2009 to investigate the effect of aspect ratio and slenderness of plates shape and dimension of openings shear and compressive loading conditions on the buckling and ultimate strength of plates with openings for representing the actual condition of ship deck panels a combination of axial and lateral loads should be applied ultimate strength of perforated plates and stiffened panels are affected strongly by the boundary conditions kim et al 2009 simply supported boundary conditions are considered along the loading and reactive edges and only the rotation about the longitudinal edge is restrained along the unloaded edges kumar et al 2009a 2009b this condition generates the actual situation of continuity between individual stiffened panels for further investigation on the ultimate behaviour of ship deck panels under combined lateral pressure and uniaxial loads yu et al 2015 performed a series of numerical analyses of stiffened plates with a square opening to study the influence of design variables design formulae corresponding to different opening types were fitted aiming to be applied in the basic design of practical engineering structures the ultimate strength of plates and stiffened panels with a circular elliptical or rectangular opening on the plating has been extensively studied however there are a limited number of studies related to the ultimate strength of stiffened panels with openings on the web of stiffeners this structural type is often used in the deck of large passenger and ro ro ships recently doan et al 2020 and liu et al 2020 analysed numerically the ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panels discussing the effect of the stiffener openings the opening takes an essential part in changing the stress distribution and diverging the ultimate load carrying capacity of the stiffened panels generally the finite element simulations should be validated against large scale experiments before being implemented in the structural design of novel vessels liu et al 2018 xu et al 2019 2020 wang et al 2020a 2020b novel structural types are introduced and developed in order to satisfy the special arrangements requested by ship owners in the design of passenger ships it is lack of understanding of the buckling and ultimate behaviours of the novel structures the present paper performed experimental and finite element analyses of the ultimate strength of a stiffened panel with a large opening on the plating and multi openings on the longitudinal and transverse girders and subjected to combined uniaxial and lateral loads the objective of the present study is to analyse the ultimate strength of the perforated panels existing in the deck structures for constructing the atrium in large passenger ships the experimentally obtained load displacement relationship and structural collapse modes are compared with the nonlinear finite element analyses the load and boundary of the studied panel is described for better understanding its experimental representation of the deck panels in large passenger ships the influence of initial imperfections and lateral loads on the ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panel is discussed moreover the structural openings and reinforcements are investigated to analyse their influence on structural strength 2 experimental details the experimental programme evaluates the ultimate compressive strength of a stiffened panel with a large opening on the plating and multi openings on the longitudinal and transverse girders and subjected to combined axial and lateral loads 2 1 description of the specimen the geometrical dimensions of the stiffened panel specimen are shown in table 1 and fig 1 there are a large opening on the plating and numerous small openings on the longitudinal and transverse girders the shape of the large opening is an ellipse with a rectangle at its edge and this abnormal shape can be found in the atrium decks of passenger ships the opening size is larger than half breadth of the ship providing a large space for entertainment the circular and elongated circular openings on the longitudinal and transverse girders can be also found in the decks of passenger ships for passing pipes cables and lightening etc the panel specimen is designed on the basis of the actual opening shape in real ship deck the testing capability of the equipment in the laboratory and the manufacture of test model etc it should be mentioned that the plate thicknesses and the stiffener scantlings are designed without exactly referring to a prototype structure the structural components of the panel specimen are built of 3 0 mm and 4 5 mm plates the plating is 3 0 mm thickness the longitudinal and the transverse girders are t45 12 4 5 4 5 mm tee bar the longitudinal stiffener is 15 3 0 flat bar and the coaming of the large opening is l45 12 4 5 mm angle bar the specimen plate is strengthened using 6 0 mm thickness closing to the endpoints of the major axis of the elliptical opening see fig 1 the principal parameters affecting the ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panels are the plate and column slenderness ratio β and λ 1 β b t p σ y e 2 λ a r σ y e in ship structures the practical range of β and λ for the stiffener associated with plating are 1 0 4 5 and 0 15 0 90 respectively smith 1975 in passenger ship structures the typical range of β and λ are 2 0 6 0 and 0 15 0 40 respectively here the β and λ are analysed at 1 971 and 0 247 respectively the structural strength depends on the geometry of the structural components and their material properties the mechanical properties of the steels that are used to fabricate the specimen are defined by quasi static tensile tests the uniaxial tensile tests are performed following a standard tensile test procedure as described in gb t 228 1 2010 the tensile stress strain relationships are presented in fig 2 the yield stresses of the 3 0 mm and 4 5 mm steel materials used in the specimen are 395 mpa and 470 mpa respectively geometrical initial imperfections on the specimen plating are measured by a 3d laser scanner and the boundary lines of the specimen compose of a reference plane zero for the panel specimen 2030 3240 mm the overall out of plane deformation is from 6 5 mm to 6 0 mm fig 3 the initial imperfection of plate elements between stiffeners is about 1 0 mm similar to the imperfection calculated by the empirical formula 0 1tβ 2 0 1 3 0 1 9712 1 2 mm 2 2 experimental setup the deck stiffened panel is supported by the side shells and transverse girders or bulkheads the load and boundary condition fig 4 are prescribed appropriately in the experiment as shown in fig 5 the lateral and uniaxial forces are enforced by eight hydraulic cylinders respectively each hydraulic cylinder can apply the load until 30 t and the synchronization of eight hydraulic cylinders is achieved by controlling the oil pumps a load transducer is used to measure the output force of one more synchronous hydraulic cylinder fig 5b the lateral load aims to simulate the design pressure load of the deck due to the activities of its use and the structural self weight the uniaxial load aims to simulate the uniaxial compression induced by the hull girder sagging bending moment for imposing the lateral load in the experiment concentrated loads are applied at eight intersections of the longitudinal and transverse girders instead of the uniform pressure the uniaxial loading position is reinforced by a rigid beam to provide a uniformly distributed load for the specimen and to avoid the stress concentrations the unloaded edges are simply supported by the clamping fixtures where the z displacement and y rotation are constrained see figs 4 and 5 it should be mentioned that there are gaps between the unloaded edges and the clamping fixtures to allow the x displacement in the specimen edges the procedure for conducting the experiment is described as follows 1 the loading and unloading are repeated three times in the elastic stage to eliminate partially the weld induced residual stresses in the specimen and to calibrate the testing equipment and measuring instrument the maximum lateral and uniaxial loads are about 8 0 t and 24 0 t respectively 2 the lateral load is imposed by the hydraulic cylinders until 8 0 t out of plane load pressure of 1 6 t m2 firstly and then uniaxial load is applied until the test specimen collapses the layout of displacement transducers and strain gauges is shown in fig 6 three displacement transducers are installed at the uniaxial load locations to measure the uniaxial deformation of the test specimen and four displacement transducers are installed at the lateral locations to measure the out of plane deformation of the test specimen three direction strain gauges are arranged at the stress concentration regions especially at the minimum breadth of the specimen due to the opening some key points are presented in fig 6 the finite element analyses were performed before the experiment in order to search the regions of stress concentration in the test specimen 3 finite element model a nonlinear finite element analysis of the panel specimen is performed using the commercial software abaqus version 6 14 the finite element model is shown in fig 7 the riks arc length control algorithm is employed to solve the static nonlinear problem due to the high level of geometric and material nonlinearities the large displacements and the finite strains are also activated the finite element model is generated using s4r type shell elements this finite element is a 4 node quadrilateral stress displacement shell element with reduced integration and a large strain formulation dassault 2014 in order to analyse the local buckling in the girders six finite elements in the web of girders are generated and the element size is selected at about 7 5 mm this mesh density is sufficient to capture the global and the local buckling of plates and stiffeners accurately the finite element model consists of 92 828 nodes and 91 806 shell elements the material properties of the high strength steels with thickness of 3 0 mm and 4 5 mm are defined by an elastic perfectly plastic material model with a yield stress of 395 mpa and of 470 mpa respectively young s modulus of 206 gpa and poisson s ratio of 0 3 are also defined the actual geometry of stiffened panel specimen with scanned initial geometrical imperfections fig 3 is used to create the finite element model similar modelling was presented by yu et al 2019 as the initial preloading cycles were used to eliminate the residual stresses partially in the experiment the welding induced residual stresses are not explicitly modelled in the finite element analysis residual stresses reduce the plate ultimate strength and different mechanical behaviours are presented for various shapes of initial deflection paik et al 2004 as the actual residual stresses in the specimen cannot be fully reflected in the numerical analysis it is generally not considered for the study purpose paik et al 2008 wang et al 2019 2020b for the loading edge only the x displacement is free in whose direction the external load is applied and for the reactive edge the fully clamped condition is considered see fig 7 the z displacement and y rotation are constrained at all the nodes along the unloaded edges this condition is to generate the actual boundary of the specimen in the experiment the uniaxial load is applied at all the nodes along the loading edge and ultimate load of the specimen is determined from the peak value of the uniaxial load at the initial loading the total lateral load of 8 0 t is applied at the nodes where the lateral hydraulic cylinders are placed 4 experiment and numerical results 4 1 lateral pre loading stage the loads applied by lateral hydraulic cylinders are considered as the initial pre loading condition of the panel specimen the experimental and numerical lateral load displacement curves of the panel specimen are presented in fig 8 the resulting load is the total lateral load and the resulting displacement is the out of plane deformation at the location of d5 fig 6 the locations of d4 d6 and d7 present similar deformation due to symmetry theoretically the elastic deformation increases linearly with the lateral load in the experiment the deformation shows nonlinear since the gaps exist between the specimen and the supports and the reduction of initial gaps leads to larger lateral displacement during the loading process it causes that the numerical deformation is much smaller than the experimental one at the end it should be mentioned that in the experiment the gaps of edge supports are inevitable to allow the uniaxial sliding movements in the ultimate loading stage in the experiment von mises stresses can be obtained based on the data measured by the three direction strain gauges showing agreement with the numerical results stress comparison at some key points closing to the large opening is shown in fig 9 generally the stress level is relatively low 40 mpa closing to the large opening in the lateral pre loading stage theoretically the elastic stress increases linearly with the lateral load in the experiment the increase of elastic stress is nonlinear due to the lateral movement of specimen indicated in fig 8 it causes the discrepancy between the numerical and experimental results however the low stress level will not lead to a large error for the numerical prediction in the ultimate loading stage 4 2 ultimate loading stage 4 2 1 load versus displacement the experimental and numerical axial load displacement curves of the panel specimen are presented in fig 10 a the resulting axial force is the total axial load applied by eight hydraulic cylinders and the resulting axial displacement is the mean value measured by three transducers at the load positions d1 d3 in fig 6 here the experimental and numerical maximum applied loads i e the ultimate compressive strength of the panel specimen are 136 6 t and 141 8 t respectively at the collapse of test model with rapidly increasing deformations the experimental load displacement relationship shows an almost linear relationship until the loading force of 92 6 t after this point the curve shows a noticeable nonlinear relationship with a reduced slope due to the spread of buckling and plasticity in the panel specimen finally the curve reaches its maximum at 136 6 t which is the ultimate load carrying capacity of the panel specimen as the structure cannot withstand more substantial external loading the numerical ultimate load is 141 8 t showing a good agreement with the experimental one error of 3 8 the slightly overestimated ultimate load may be due to the fact that the residual stresses induced by the welds are not considered in the simulation it can be seen that the numerical axial displacement at the ultimate load is much smaller than the experimental one 3 03 mm versus 8 87 mm and the slopes of the load displacement curves show apparent differences of elastic stiffness see fig 10a one of the reasons for that is the existence of gaps between the specimen and the supports at the beginning of the experiment resulting in the specimen not being in full contact with the supports during the initial loading process the experimental test cannot satisfy the zero displacement condition at the supports but the zero displacement constraints are imposed in the numerical analysis a similar issue is also observed in the compressive test of stiffened panels see fig 12 in kim et al 2009 and fig 20 in xu and guedes soares 2013 the increase in the axial displacement for the structural supports is restrained until the contact gaps at the structural supports are sufficiently closed the resultant average stress strain relationships for the panel specimen are presented in fig 10b the average stress is calculated by dividing the applied external force to the original cross sectional area of the panel 13 172 mm2 and the average strain is calculated by dividing the developed axial displacement by the original length of the panel 2030 mm here the average stresses are 101 7 mpa and 105 5 mpa for the experiment and simulation respectively the low average stress indicates that the large opening decreases rapidly the ultimate compressive strength in another perspective the average stress is 218 5 mpa when dividing by the cross sectional area at the residual breadth of perforated stiffened panel 6129 mm2 the ratio of average stress and yield stress is 0 55 when taking the material yield stress of 395 mpa it should be mentioned that this ratio is strongly affected by the boundary conditions xu et al 2013 here the boundary at the weakest cross section is simply supported at the unloading edges and free at the ends of large opening thus the normalised strength of 0 55 is larger than the one of about 0 35 for perforated plates in saad eldeen et al 2016 where the unloading edges are free of course the normalised strength is smaller than the analytical results of intact stiffened panels 0 75 and 0 65 given by the methods in faulkner 1975 and zhang and khan 2009 respectively more empirical formulae for intact panels can be found in kim et al 2017 2018 2019 xu et al 2018 ao et al 2019 and anyfantis 2020 4 2 2 deformation the panel specimen collapses when a sudden and significant deformation is observed accompanied with a noticeable reduction of the uniaxial external loads the permanent experimental and numerical deformation shapes of panel specimen are presented in fig 11 and the local deformation of the panel specimen is given in fig 12 the panel specimen starts to collapse at a corner of the rectangular opening closing to the large elliptical opening and the buckled region spreads rapidly towards the unloading edge and along the nearest weak cross section generally the overall collapse of panel specimen is mainly induced by the plastic buckling at the weak cross section as seen in the geometrical dimensions fig 1 the weakest cross section may occur at the major axis of the elliptical opening however the strengthening at the endpoints of the major axis of the elliptical opening prevents the buckling failure at the residual cross section with the shortest transverse distance to the unloaded edge the experimental and numerical lateral deformations measured by the displacement transducers versus the axial loading are plotted in fig 13 the deformation process of the panel specimen is summarised herein initially the panel specimen has large out of plane deformation due to the lateral loadings the experimental lateral displacements increases slightly before the axial loading of 92 6 t since the corresponding axial displacement is relatively small see fig 10a afterwards the lateral displacements increase rapidly with the axial displacement of panel specimen the buckling occurs rapidly in the plate elements between girders subjected to compressive loadings afterwards the longitudinal girders suffer larger inner forces and buckle finally most structural components in and around the stress concentration zone are yielding and the plastic hinges are developed closing to the opening leading to overall structural collapse generally the tendency of experimental out of plane deformation can be captured by the simulation this discrepancy is due to the fact that the axial deformation is not well predicted see fig 10 4 2 3 stress von mises stresses can be obtained based on the data measured by the three direction strain gauges the resulting von mises stresses of some experimentally measured points presented in fig 6 compared to the numerical results are shown in fig 14 the analysed value takes the corresponding material yield stress 395 mpa and 470 mpa when exceeding this magnitude since the formulae of material mechanics for calculating the stresses is based on linear elasticity more details about the distribution of the numerical von mises stresses at the ultimate limit state can be found in fig 11b in general the experimental stresses are predicted approximately by the simulation the stresses are mainly concentrated at two weak cross sections see red regions in fig 11b i e from the corner of the rectangular opening to the unloading edge and from the endpoint of the elliptical opening to the unloading edge the stress concentration can be also observed in fig 14 see p1 and p4 the stress variation during the loading process is summarised herein the stresses of measured points show good linearity in the elastic range beyond the loading of 92 6 t the stresses measured in p1 increase abruptly in the experiment indicating that there is a possibility of local buckling in the vicinity of the point this phenomenon can be also observed in fig 10a where the load displacement curves show an abrupt change at the load of 92 6 t moreover the steel material yields at p1 when the applied load is 115 5 t accelerating the stress transmission at the weak cross section it implies that the large plastic buckling of the weak cross section induces the overall collapse of the perforated stiffened panel on the other hand although the large stress at p4 is observed the concentrated stress is not transmitted to its vicinity see p7 and p8 due to the plate reinforcement 4 2 4 progressive collapse process the progressive collapse process of the panel specimen is summarised herein according to the validated numerical results initially the panel undergoes elastic deformation and the maximum stresses are mainly concentrated at the longitudinal stiffeners fig 15 a with the increase of the loading the buckling occurs at the stiffened plate elements between longitudinal and transverse girders fig 15b afterwards the stresses are mainly concentrated at the openings on the longitudinal girders and the plastic buckling occurs at the longitudinal girders fig 15c finally the plastic buckling is developed along the weak cross section leading to the overall structural collapse fig 15d 5 discussion some aspects of particular relevance to the effect of initial imperfections lateral loads and various structural openings on the ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panel are discussed in next subsections 5 1 effect of initial imperfections the initial out of plane deformation is integrated directly into the finite element analysis in section 3 here one more simulation is performed omitting the initial deformation and the comparison of the average stress strain relationships for the stiffened panel specimen is shown in fig 16 it is observed that the effect of initial imperfections is about 2 3 showing that the initial geometrical imperfections affect the elastic plastic buckling strength slightly 5 2 effect of lateral loads in this model the lateral load is varied to analyse its effect on the ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panel see fig 17 here the initial imperfections are not integrated into the finite element model the reference model uses 1 6 t m2 lateral loads instead of 8 0 t concentrated loads curve 2 in fig 17 the numerical results show that omitting and doubling the lateral loads cause the difference of 1 5 and 2 1 respectively generally the lateral loads affect slightly the ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panel since the lateral loads are relatively small the deck design pressure load is much smaller than the compressive load induced by the sagging bending moment it indicates that the design pressure of ship deck affects slightly the ultimate strength of deck structures under axial compression similar phenomenon can be also found in cargo ships where the cargo pressure affects slightly the ultimate longitudinal strength 10 for example a container ship analysed by liu and guedes soares 2020 one more simulation is performed applying the uniaxial and lateral loads simultaneously the simultaneous loads predict a little bit smaller ultimate compressive strength about 0 5 than the two step loads 5 3 effect of openings in this section both the initial imperfections and lateral loads are not considered in the finite element models the analysis presented in curve 1 in fig 17 is used as the reference see curve 1 in fig 18 a and b a simulation is performed for an intact stiffened panel without the large opening on the plating and the comparison of the average stress strain relationships is shown in curves 1 and 2 in fig 18a it is observed that the large opening decreases the ultimate compressive strength of 55 9 this magnitude is basically consistent with the reduced ratio of 53 5 7043 13 172 at the major axis of the elliptical opening the abnormal shape of the large opening includes an ellipse attached with a rectangle here one more simulation is performed only modelling the elliptical opening see curve 3 in fig 18a it aims to investigate the effect of the attached rectangular opening it is observed that the results are very similar for these two types of openings it indicates that the buckling strength of these two weak cross sections are very close 0 5 the reinforcements at the endpoints of the major axis of the large opening increases the buckling strength of the perforated stiffened panel here one more simulation is performed not modelling the reinforcements see curve 4 in fig 18b it is found that the reinforcements increase the ultimate strength of 9 9 thus it can be concluded that the design of reinforcements can improve effectively the buckling strength as well as the fatigue strength from the buckling strength point of view the buckling strength of the weakest cross section should be improved to reach the strength of the second weakest cross section it reflects the equivalent strength concept in the design of perforated stiffened panel the multi openings on the longitudinal and transverse girders affect the buckling strength of stiffened panels one more simulation is performed without these openings see curve 5 in fig 18b it can be seen that the multi openings on girders reduce the buckling strength of 10 6 according to the equivalent strength concept the girder with multi openings can be equivalent to smaller girder without openings generally the layout of large opening on the plating and multi small openings on the longitudinal and transverse girders is to satisfy the functional requirements the equivalent strength concept can be used for the optimal design of the novel structures 6 conclusions experimental and finite element analyses of the ultimate strength of perforated stiffened panel subjected to combined lateral and axial loads have been performed in the present study revealing the progressive collapse mechanism of the stiffened panel with various openings the ultimate compressive load analysed by numerical simulation is in a good agreement with the experimental one the sequencing of the accuracy of numerical prediction is ultimate load structural stress and deformation displacement the effect of lateral loads on the ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panel is very small in the present study it indicates that the lateral pressure load of decks affects slightly the ultimate strength of ships under sagging bending moments the large opening on the plating and the multi small openings on the longitudinal and transverse girders decrease the ultimate strength of stiffened plate significantly it is found however that the reinforcements at the endpoints of the elliptical opening improve the ultimate strength of stiffened panel according to the equivalent buckling strength concept this concept should be paid attention in the optimal design of the novel stiffened panel the buckling strengths at two weakest cross sections are very close indicating the effective structural design credit authorship

21191,the paper presents experimental and finite element analyses of the ultimate strength of a stiffened panel with a large opening on the plating and multi small openings on the longitudinal and transverse girders and subjected to combined uniaxial and lateral loads this investigation provides practical information to estimate the effect of the large and small openings on the ultimate compressive strength of deck panels in large passenger ships the experimental results are presented in terms of the load displacement and strain data overall and local structural collapse showing agreement with the simulations performed by the abaqus finite element solver the results show that the abnormal shape of the plate opening and its reinforcements change the overall buckling and collapse behaviour of the stiffened panel under compressive loads the finite element analysis also discusses the effect of initial imperfections lateral loads and various openings on the ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panel keywords ultimate strength experiment numerical simulation stiffened panel opening passenger ship 1 introduction large passenger ships are multi decked ships designed exclusively for the carriage of passengers and specifically for cruises a deck panel as an assembly of plating and stiffeners is penetrated by varieties of large openings on the plating due to the requirement of atrium theatre swimming pool etc and small openings on the stiffeners for running hvac heating ventilation and air conditioning systems passing pipes cables lightening and other design reasons the novel design complicates the issue of the strength of deck structure in the longitudinal vertical bending the existence of the openings can cause structural fracture stress concentrations and reduction in the ultimate strength the ship deck panels are subjected to both uniaxial compression induced by the hull girder sagging bending moment and lateral pressure load by the accommodation and public spaces for the stiffened panels without openings numerous investigations have been performed by employing analytical empirical experimental and numerical methods to analyse their buckling and ultimate behaviours in axial compression zhang 2016 kim et al 2018 generally the buckling and ultimate strength of stiffened plates are strongly affected by the flexural stiffness of stiffeners various failure modes were categorised as plate buckling flexural buckling of stiffener with attached plate restrained torsional buckling of stiffener and overall grillage buckling some studies were performed on steel plates and stiffened panels with openings experimental research is one of the most rigorous methods to analyse the mechanical behaviour of novel structures shanmugam et al 1986 performed ultimate compressive experiments on stiffened panels with circular or square openings proposing the effective width concept to analyse the loss in stiffness of plates kim et al 2009 conducted a series of experiments on the perforated plates and stiffened plates varying the aspect ratio and slenderness of plates the size shape and location of openings kumar et al 2009a 2009b carried out experimental investigations on the ultimate strength of stiffened plates with a central circular or square opening subjected to combined uniaxial and lateral loads recently saad eldeen et al 2016 2017 2018 carried out a series of ultimate strength experiments of steel plates and stiffened panels having a central opening of different shape and size in addition to different constructional steels the ultimate load carrying capacity decreases with the residual breadth of perforated plates and stiffened panels the stiffened panels show higher ultimate strength than the plates represented by the less lateral displacement between reinforcements generally experimental results are often used to derive analytical expressions and to validate the finite element methods nowadays the nonlinear finite element method is the preferred tool for predicting the ultimate carrying capacity of ship structures especially for the analysis of novel structure li et al 2017 2018 2019 and the analysis of novel strength such as cyclic ultimate strength proposed by liu and guedes soares 2020 the finite element analysis can provide an in depth understanding of the strength of stiffened panels with various openings shanmugam et al 1999 performed a series of finite element analyses of the ultimate compressive strength of plates with an opening in order to establish the design formulae considering various boundary conditions opening sizes loading types and plate slenderness ratios it was found that the plate with a circular opening generally has a higher ultimate load than the plate with a square opening where the diameter of the circular opening is equal to the side length of the square opening el sawy et al 2004 analysed the buckling of square and rectangular plates with a circular opening considering the plates with simply supported edges and subjected to axial compression they concluded that the critical buckling stress decreases with the plate slenderness and the opening size paik 2007 investigated the ultimate strength characteristics of steel plates with a single circular hole subjected to axial compression a series of finite element analyses were carried out with different hole diameters and an empirical formula was developed the parametric studies were conducted comprehensively by wang et al 2009 to investigate the effect of aspect ratio and slenderness of plates shape and dimension of openings shear and compressive loading conditions on the buckling and ultimate strength of plates with openings for representing the actual condition of ship deck panels a combination of axial and lateral loads should be applied ultimate strength of perforated plates and stiffened panels are affected strongly by the boundary conditions kim et al 2009 simply supported boundary conditions are considered along the loading and reactive edges and only the rotation about the longitudinal edge is restrained along the unloaded edges kumar et al 2009a 2009b this condition generates the actual situation of continuity between individual stiffened panels for further investigation on the ultimate behaviour of ship deck panels under combined lateral pressure and uniaxial loads yu et al 2015 performed a series of numerical analyses of stiffened plates with a square opening to study the influence of design variables design formulae corresponding to different opening types were fitted aiming to be applied in the basic design of practical engineering structures the ultimate strength of plates and stiffened panels with a circular elliptical or rectangular opening on the plating has been extensively studied however there are a limited number of studies related to the ultimate strength of stiffened panels with openings on the web of stiffeners this structural type is often used in the deck of large passenger and ro ro ships recently doan et al 2020 and liu et al 2020 analysed numerically the ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panels discussing the effect of the stiffener openings the opening takes an essential part in changing the stress distribution and diverging the ultimate load carrying capacity of the stiffened panels generally the finite element simulations should be validated against large scale experiments before being implemented in the structural design of novel vessels liu et al 2018 xu et al 2019 2020 wang et al 2020a 2020b novel structural types are introduced and developed in order to satisfy the special arrangements requested by ship owners in the design of passenger ships it is lack of understanding of the buckling and ultimate behaviours of the novel structures the present paper performed experimental and finite element analyses of the ultimate strength of a stiffened panel with a large opening on the plating and multi openings on the longitudinal and transverse girders and subjected to combined uniaxial and lateral loads the objective of the present study is to analyse the ultimate strength of the perforated panels existing in the deck structures for constructing the atrium in large passenger ships the experimentally obtained load displacement relationship and structural collapse modes are compared with the nonlinear finite element analyses the load and boundary of the studied panel is described for better understanding its experimental representation of the deck panels in large passenger ships the influence of initial imperfections and lateral loads on the ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panel is discussed moreover the structural openings and reinforcements are investigated to analyse their influence on structural strength 2 experimental details the experimental programme evaluates the ultimate compressive strength of a stiffened panel with a large opening on the plating and multi openings on the longitudinal and transverse girders and subjected to combined axial and lateral loads 2 1 description of the specimen the geometrical dimensions of the stiffened panel specimen are shown in table 1 and fig 1 there are a large opening on the plating and numerous small openings on the longitudinal and transverse girders the shape of the large opening is an ellipse with a rectangle at its edge and this abnormal shape can be found in the atrium decks of passenger ships the opening size is larger than half breadth of the ship providing a large space for entertainment the circular and elongated circular openings on the longitudinal and transverse girders can be also found in the decks of passenger ships for passing pipes cables and lightening etc the panel specimen is designed on the basis of the actual opening shape in real ship deck the testing capability of the equipment in the laboratory and the manufacture of test model etc it should be mentioned that the plate thicknesses and the stiffener scantlings are designed without exactly referring to a prototype structure the structural components of the panel specimen are built of 3 0 mm and 4 5 mm plates the plating is 3 0 mm thickness the longitudinal and the transverse girders are t45 12 4 5 4 5 mm tee bar the longitudinal stiffener is 15 3 0 flat bar and the coaming of the large opening is l45 12 4 5 mm angle bar the specimen plate is strengthened using 6 0 mm thickness closing to the endpoints of the major axis of the elliptical opening see fig 1 the principal parameters affecting the ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panels are the plate and column slenderness ratio β and λ 1 β b t p σ y e 2 λ a r σ y e in ship structures the practical range of β and λ for the stiffener associated with plating are 1 0 4 5 and 0 15 0 90 respectively smith 1975 in passenger ship structures the typical range of β and λ are 2 0 6 0 and 0 15 0 40 respectively here the β and λ are analysed at 1 971 and 0 247 respectively the structural strength depends on the geometry of the structural components and their material properties the mechanical properties of the steels that are used to fabricate the specimen are defined by quasi static tensile tests the uniaxial tensile tests are performed following a standard tensile test procedure as described in gb t 228 1 2010 the tensile stress strain relationships are presented in fig 2 the yield stresses of the 3 0 mm and 4 5 mm steel materials used in the specimen are 395 mpa and 470 mpa respectively geometrical initial imperfections on the specimen plating are measured by a 3d laser scanner and the boundary lines of the specimen compose of a reference plane zero for the panel specimen 2030 3240 mm the overall out of plane deformation is from 6 5 mm to 6 0 mm fig 3 the initial imperfection of plate elements between stiffeners is about 1 0 mm similar to the imperfection calculated by the empirical formula 0 1tβ 2 0 1 3 0 1 9712 1 2 mm 2 2 experimental setup the deck stiffened panel is supported by the side shells and transverse girders or bulkheads the load and boundary condition fig 4 are prescribed appropriately in the experiment as shown in fig 5 the lateral and uniaxial forces are enforced by eight hydraulic cylinders respectively each hydraulic cylinder can apply the load until 30 t and the synchronization of eight hydraulic cylinders is achieved by controlling the oil pumps a load transducer is used to measure the output force of one more synchronous hydraulic cylinder fig 5b the lateral load aims to simulate the design pressure load of the deck due to the activities of its use and the structural self weight the uniaxial load aims to simulate the uniaxial compression induced by the hull girder sagging bending moment for imposing the lateral load in the experiment concentrated loads are applied at eight intersections of the longitudinal and transverse girders instead of the uniform pressure the uniaxial loading position is reinforced by a rigid beam to provide a uniformly distributed load for the specimen and to avoid the stress concentrations the unloaded edges are simply supported by the clamping fixtures where the z displacement and y rotation are constrained see figs 4 and 5 it should be mentioned that there are gaps between the unloaded edges and the clamping fixtures to allow the x displacement in the specimen edges the procedure for conducting the experiment is described as follows 1 the loading and unloading are repeated three times in the elastic stage to eliminate partially the weld induced residual stresses in the specimen and to calibrate the testing equipment and measuring instrument the maximum lateral and uniaxial loads are about 8 0 t and 24 0 t respectively 2 the lateral load is imposed by the hydraulic cylinders until 8 0 t out of plane load pressure of 1 6 t m2 firstly and then uniaxial load is applied until the test specimen collapses the layout of displacement transducers and strain gauges is shown in fig 6 three displacement transducers are installed at the uniaxial load locations to measure the uniaxial deformation of the test specimen and four displacement transducers are installed at the lateral locations to measure the out of plane deformation of the test specimen three direction strain gauges are arranged at the stress concentration regions especially at the minimum breadth of the specimen due to the opening some key points are presented in fig 6 the finite element analyses were performed before the experiment in order to search the regions of stress concentration in the test specimen 3 finite element model a nonlinear finite element analysis of the panel specimen is performed using the commercial software abaqus version 6 14 the finite element model is shown in fig 7 the riks arc length control algorithm is employed to solve the static nonlinear problem due to the high level of geometric and material nonlinearities the large displacements and the finite strains are also activated the finite element model is generated using s4r type shell elements this finite element is a 4 node quadrilateral stress displacement shell element with reduced integration and a large strain formulation dassault 2014 in order to analyse the local buckling in the girders six finite elements in the web of girders are generated and the element size is selected at about 7 5 mm this mesh density is sufficient to capture the global and the local buckling of plates and stiffeners accurately the finite element model consists of 92 828 nodes and 91 806 shell elements the material properties of the high strength steels with thickness of 3 0 mm and 4 5 mm are defined by an elastic perfectly plastic material model with a yield stress of 395 mpa and of 470 mpa respectively young s modulus of 206 gpa and poisson s ratio of 0 3 are also defined the actual geometry of stiffened panel specimen with scanned initial geometrical imperfections fig 3 is used to create the finite element model similar modelling was presented by yu et al 2019 as the initial preloading cycles were used to eliminate the residual stresses partially in the experiment the welding induced residual stresses are not explicitly modelled in the finite element analysis residual stresses reduce the plate ultimate strength and different mechanical behaviours are presented for various shapes of initial deflection paik et al 2004 as the actual residual stresses in the specimen cannot be fully reflected in the numerical analysis it is generally not considered for the study purpose paik et al 2008 wang et al 2019 2020b for the loading edge only the x displacement is free in whose direction the external load is applied and for the reactive edge the fully clamped condition is considered see fig 7 the z displacement and y rotation are constrained at all the nodes along the unloaded edges this condition is to generate the actual boundary of the specimen in the experiment the uniaxial load is applied at all the nodes along the loading edge and ultimate load of the specimen is determined from the peak value of the uniaxial load at the initial loading the total lateral load of 8 0 t is applied at the nodes where the lateral hydraulic cylinders are placed 4 experiment and numerical results 4 1 lateral pre loading stage the loads applied by lateral hydraulic cylinders are considered as the initial pre loading condition of the panel specimen the experimental and numerical lateral load displacement curves of the panel specimen are presented in fig 8 the resulting load is the total lateral load and the resulting displacement is the out of plane deformation at the location of d5 fig 6 the locations of d4 d6 and d7 present similar deformation due to symmetry theoretically the elastic deformation increases linearly with the lateral load in the experiment the deformation shows nonlinear since the gaps exist between the specimen and the supports and the reduction of initial gaps leads to larger lateral displacement during the loading process it causes that the numerical deformation is much smaller than the experimental one at the end it should be mentioned that in the experiment the gaps of edge supports are inevitable to allow the uniaxial sliding movements in the ultimate loading stage in the experiment von mises stresses can be obtained based on the data measured by the three direction strain gauges showing agreement with the numerical results stress comparison at some key points closing to the large opening is shown in fig 9 generally the stress level is relatively low 40 mpa closing to the large opening in the lateral pre loading stage theoretically the elastic stress increases linearly with the lateral load in the experiment the increase of elastic stress is nonlinear due to the lateral movement of specimen indicated in fig 8 it causes the discrepancy between the numerical and experimental results however the low stress level will not lead to a large error for the numerical prediction in the ultimate loading stage 4 2 ultimate loading stage 4 2 1 load versus displacement the experimental and numerical axial load displacement curves of the panel specimen are presented in fig 10 a the resulting axial force is the total axial load applied by eight hydraulic cylinders and the resulting axial displacement is the mean value measured by three transducers at the load positions d1 d3 in fig 6 here the experimental and numerical maximum applied loads i e the ultimate compressive strength of the panel specimen are 136 6 t and 141 8 t respectively at the collapse of test model with rapidly increasing deformations the experimental load displacement relationship shows an almost linear relationship until the loading force of 92 6 t after this point the curve shows a noticeable nonlinear relationship with a reduced slope due to the spread of buckling and plasticity in the panel specimen finally the curve reaches its maximum at 136 6 t which is the ultimate load carrying capacity of the panel specimen as the structure cannot withstand more substantial external loading the numerical ultimate load is 141 8 t showing a good agreement with the experimental one error of 3 8 the slightly overestimated ultimate load may be due to the fact that the residual stresses induced by the welds are not considered in the simulation it can be seen that the numerical axial displacement at the ultimate load is much smaller than the experimental one 3 03 mm versus 8 87 mm and the slopes of the load displacement curves show apparent differences of elastic stiffness see fig 10a one of the reasons for that is the existence of gaps between the specimen and the supports at the beginning of the experiment resulting in the specimen not being in full contact with the supports during the initial loading process the experimental test cannot satisfy the zero displacement condition at the supports but the zero displacement constraints are imposed in the numerical analysis a similar issue is also observed in the compressive test of stiffened panels see fig 12 in kim et al 2009 and fig 20 in xu and guedes soares 2013 the increase in the axial displacement for the structural supports is restrained until the contact gaps at the structural supports are sufficiently closed the resultant average stress strain relationships for the panel specimen are presented in fig 10b the average stress is calculated by dividing the applied external force to the original cross sectional area of the panel 13 172 mm2 and the average strain is calculated by dividing the developed axial displacement by the original length of the panel 2030 mm here the average stresses are 101 7 mpa and 105 5 mpa for the experiment and simulation respectively the low average stress indicates that the large opening decreases rapidly the ultimate compressive strength in another perspective the average stress is 218 5 mpa when dividing by the cross sectional area at the residual breadth of perforated stiffened panel 6129 mm2 the ratio of average stress and yield stress is 0 55 when taking the material yield stress of 395 mpa it should be mentioned that this ratio is strongly affected by the boundary conditions xu et al 2013 here the boundary at the weakest cross section is simply supported at the unloading edges and free at the ends of large opening thus the normalised strength of 0 55 is larger than the one of about 0 35 for perforated plates in saad eldeen et al 2016 where the unloading edges are free of course the normalised strength is smaller than the analytical results of intact stiffened panels 0 75 and 0 65 given by the methods in faulkner 1975 and zhang and khan 2009 respectively more empirical formulae for intact panels can be found in kim et al 2017 2018 2019 xu et al 2018 ao et al 2019 and anyfantis 2020 4 2 2 deformation the panel specimen collapses when a sudden and significant deformation is observed accompanied with a noticeable reduction of the uniaxial external loads the permanent experimental and numerical deformation shapes of panel specimen are presented in fig 11 and the local deformation of the panel specimen is given in fig 12 the panel specimen starts to collapse at a corner of the rectangular opening closing to the large elliptical opening and the buckled region spreads rapidly towards the unloading edge and along the nearest weak cross section generally the overall collapse of panel specimen is mainly induced by the plastic buckling at the weak cross section as seen in the geometrical dimensions fig 1 the weakest cross section may occur at the major axis of the elliptical opening however the strengthening at the endpoints of the major axis of the elliptical opening prevents the buckling failure at the residual cross section with the shortest transverse distance to the unloaded edge the experimental and numerical lateral deformations measured by the displacement transducers versus the axial loading are plotted in fig 13 the deformation process of the panel specimen is summarised herein initially the panel specimen has large out of plane deformation due to the lateral loadings the experimental lateral displacements increases slightly before the axial loading of 92 6 t since the corresponding axial displacement is relatively small see fig 10a afterwards the lateral displacements increase rapidly with the axial displacement of panel specimen the buckling occurs rapidly in the plate elements between girders subjected to compressive loadings afterwards the longitudinal girders suffer larger inner forces and buckle finally most structural components in and around the stress concentration zone are yielding and the plastic hinges are developed closing to the opening leading to overall structural collapse generally the tendency of experimental out of plane deformation can be captured by the simulation this discrepancy is due to the fact that the axial deformation is not well predicted see fig 10 4 2 3 stress von mises stresses can be obtained based on the data measured by the three direction strain gauges the resulting von mises stresses of some experimentally measured points presented in fig 6 compared to the numerical results are shown in fig 14 the analysed value takes the corresponding material yield stress 395 mpa and 470 mpa when exceeding this magnitude since the formulae of material mechanics for calculating the stresses is based on linear elasticity more details about the distribution of the numerical von mises stresses at the ultimate limit state can be found in fig 11b in general the experimental stresses are predicted approximately by the simulation the stresses are mainly concentrated at two weak cross sections see red regions in fig 11b i e from the corner of the rectangular opening to the unloading edge and from the endpoint of the elliptical opening to the unloading edge the stress concentration can be also observed in fig 14 see p1 and p4 the stress variation during the loading process is summarised herein the stresses of measured points show good linearity in the elastic range beyond the loading of 92 6 t the stresses measured in p1 increase abruptly in the experiment indicating that there is a possibility of local buckling in the vicinity of the point this phenomenon can be also observed in fig 10a where the load displacement curves show an abrupt change at the load of 92 6 t moreover the steel material yields at p1 when the applied load is 115 5 t accelerating the stress transmission at the weak cross section it implies that the large plastic buckling of the weak cross section induces the overall collapse of the perforated stiffened panel on the other hand although the large stress at p4 is observed the concentrated stress is not transmitted to its vicinity see p7 and p8 due to the plate reinforcement 4 2 4 progressive collapse process the progressive collapse process of the panel specimen is summarised herein according to the validated numerical results initially the panel undergoes elastic deformation and the maximum stresses are mainly concentrated at the longitudinal stiffeners fig 15 a with the increase of the loading the buckling occurs at the stiffened plate elements between longitudinal and transverse girders fig 15b afterwards the stresses are mainly concentrated at the openings on the longitudinal girders and the plastic buckling occurs at the longitudinal girders fig 15c finally the plastic buckling is developed along the weak cross section leading to the overall structural collapse fig 15d 5 discussion some aspects of particular relevance to the effect of initial imperfections lateral loads and various structural openings on the ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panel are discussed in next subsections 5 1 effect of initial imperfections the initial out of plane deformation is integrated directly into the finite element analysis in section 3 here one more simulation is performed omitting the initial deformation and the comparison of the average stress strain relationships for the stiffened panel specimen is shown in fig 16 it is observed that the effect of initial imperfections is about 2 3 showing that the initial geometrical imperfections affect the elastic plastic buckling strength slightly 5 2 effect of lateral loads in this model the lateral load is varied to analyse its effect on the ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panel see fig 17 here the initial imperfections are not integrated into the finite element model the reference model uses 1 6 t m2 lateral loads instead of 8 0 t concentrated loads curve 2 in fig 17 the numerical results show that omitting and doubling the lateral loads cause the difference of 1 5 and 2 1 respectively generally the lateral loads affect slightly the ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panel since the lateral loads are relatively small the deck design pressure load is much smaller than the compressive load induced by the sagging bending moment it indicates that the design pressure of ship deck affects slightly the ultimate strength of deck structures under axial compression similar phenomenon can be also found in cargo ships where the cargo pressure affects slightly the ultimate longitudinal strength 10 for example a container ship analysed by liu and guedes soares 2020 one more simulation is performed applying the uniaxial and lateral loads simultaneously the simultaneous loads predict a little bit smaller ultimate compressive strength about 0 5 than the two step loads 5 3 effect of openings in this section both the initial imperfections and lateral loads are not considered in the finite element models the analysis presented in curve 1 in fig 17 is used as the reference see curve 1 in fig 18 a and b a simulation is performed for an intact stiffened panel without the large opening on the plating and the comparison of the average stress strain relationships is shown in curves 1 and 2 in fig 18a it is observed that the large opening decreases the ultimate compressive strength of 55 9 this magnitude is basically consistent with the reduced ratio of 53 5 7043 13 172 at the major axis of the elliptical opening the abnormal shape of the large opening includes an ellipse attached with a rectangle here one more simulation is performed only modelling the elliptical opening see curve 3 in fig 18a it aims to investigate the effect of the attached rectangular opening it is observed that the results are very similar for these two types of openings it indicates that the buckling strength of these two weak cross sections are very close 0 5 the reinforcements at the endpoints of the major axis of the large opening increases the buckling strength of the perforated stiffened panel here one more simulation is performed not modelling the reinforcements see curve 4 in fig 18b it is found that the reinforcements increase the ultimate strength of 9 9 thus it can be concluded that the design of reinforcements can improve effectively the buckling strength as well as the fatigue strength from the buckling strength point of view the buckling strength of the weakest cross section should be improved to reach the strength of the second weakest cross section it reflects the equivalent strength concept in the design of perforated stiffened panel the multi openings on the longitudinal and transverse girders affect the buckling strength of stiffened panels one more simulation is performed without these openings see curve 5 in fig 18b it can be seen that the multi openings on girders reduce the buckling strength of 10 6 according to the equivalent strength concept the girder with multi openings can be equivalent to smaller girder without openings generally the layout of large opening on the plating and multi small openings on the longitudinal and transverse girders is to satisfy the functional requirements the equivalent strength concept can be used for the optimal design of the novel structures 6 conclusions experimental and finite element analyses of the ultimate strength of perforated stiffened panel subjected to combined lateral and axial loads have been performed in the present study revealing the progressive collapse mechanism of the stiffened panel with various openings the ultimate compressive load analysed by numerical simulation is in a good agreement with the experimental one the sequencing of the accuracy of numerical prediction is ultimate load structural stress and deformation displacement the effect of lateral loads on the ultimate compressive strength of stiffened panel is very small in the present study it indicates that the lateral pressure load of decks affects slightly the ultimate strength of ships under sagging bending moments the large opening on the plating and the multi small openings on the longitudinal and transverse girders decrease the ultimate strength of stiffened plate significantly it is found however that the reinforcements at the endpoints of the elliptical opening improve the ultimate strength of stiffened panel according to the equivalent buckling strength concept this concept should be paid attention in the optimal design of the novel stiffened panel the buckling strengths at two weakest cross sections are very close indicating the effective structural design credit authorship

21192,wave energy is one of the most difficult energies to be captured among marine renewables with the technical progress wave energy converters wecs are being tested in relatively deeper waters which makes floating concepts almost the only choice in this paper a two body heaving wec where the wave energy is absorbed through the relative motion between the outer annular and the inner cylindrical buoys is studied both experimental and numerical studies are adopted for regular wave conditions in the physical model test a hydraulic system is used to achieve constant power take off pto damping force numerical simulations validated against experimental data are applied using both the frequency domain and the time domains analyses different types of ptos including constant linear and nonlinear damping forces are undertaken to evaluate the hydrodynamic and power absorption performance of such device keywords two body heaving wave energy converter physical model test numerical simulation power take off 1 introduction according to the vision for international deployment of ocean energy by ocean energy system 2018 the global potential of ocean renewable energy which could be developed is about 748 gw and the level of its consumption could reduce up to 5 2 billion tons of co2 emission by 2050 utilization of ocean energy resources will contribute to the world s future sustainable power supply although wave energy converters wecs extracting energy from the ocean surface are facing issues of both safety and efficiency they still represent a very remarkable share of the overall global supply in the future various forms of wecs have been developed worldwide though none of them has been stood out as a definitive choice ji et al 2020 from the perspective of marine resources offshore regions have relatively more abundant and stable wave energy than near shore in most sea areas castro and chiang 2020 zheng et al 2014 thereby with the technical progress floating wecs are becoming a hotspot generally a floating wec system consists of floats which react each other to harness energy from the relative motion in between compared to fixed ones it is more flexible as it less affected by water depth and is not limited by the power take off pto forms besides it is easier to deploy and maintain for the multi body form it leads to multiple resonant characteristic which broadens the operational sea condition taking the advantages many floating wecs have been investigated some devices absorb energy using relative motion of the sealed hull and heavy counterweights inside crowley et al 2018 whose concept amplifies the energy under low frequency and small amplitude waves one of the representatives is the wello penguin and the full scale prototype of which has been tested in the european marine energy center tethys 2019 another wec under this principle is searev which utilizes the interaction between the pendular wheel and the hull to produce electricity and where the center of gravity of the wheel is off centred cordonnier et al 2015 the approach of using wave curvature along its propagation direction to extract energy is also considered and most of which incorporate hydraulic system to convert energy the raft type one such as mccabe wave pump which articulates three rectangular floating pontoons uses the relative motion in pitch to drive the energy conversion system liu et al 2018 this methodology also underpins the design of pelamis whose four rafts move adjacently and drive the hydraulic ptos to absorb energy henderson 2006 although the above novel wecs have been well studied point absorbers utilizing heave motion for wave energy conversion still occupy a certain proportion in wave energy devices this kind of wec typically employs floats to react against each other to generate mechanical energy which is extracted by means of pto powerbuoy a cost effective two body heaving wec utilizes relative motion between a float and a spar with a heave plate to drive the push rod and convert wave energy van rij et al 2017 inspired by the powerbuoy the u s department of energy funded reference model 3 neary et al 2014 apart of that many other two body heaving wecs with different functions are invented some of which are connected to the grid rusu and onea 2017 and some are used to power mobile devices dai et al 2017

streamlined submerged body is adopted in wavebob to achieve greater relative velocity windt et al 2018 a heave plate is presented in aegir dynamo to give the steady reference to the floats al habaibeh et al 2010 in addition martin et al 2020 investigated cylinder sphere and plate type floats giving sequence of the response performances from the best to the worst beatty et al 2015 2019 compared different shapes of submerged floats on both response amplitude operator rao and pto summarily the dimension of a float including draught and diameter also affects its hydrodynamic response amiri et al 2016 mass ratio between floats has an effect on the energy absorption as well liang and zuo 2017 which controls the relative motion with pto together aside from the design of the floats pto is another vital aspect to wec electromechanical pto castro and chiang 2020 linear generator tan et al 2020 hydraulic pto xu et al 2019 and other different forms of pto emerge in endlessly electromechanical pto utilizes rack and pinion system combined generator to realize power conversion the electrical resistance of the generator and the radius of the pinions have an effect on the pto damping some mechanical pto systems would assemble a variable inertia flywheel to reach the resonance condition in this case the rotational inertia and inertia disc radius should be in consideration hernández et al 2017 linear generators directly link to the wave without any motion transmission and several key design parameters that will significantly affect the pto damping coefficient i e the width of the coil and the radius of the central shaft which in turn affect the energy capture performance in the hydraulic system the damping coefficient of hydraulic cylinder and pressure drop determine the pto damping together the piston displacement and accumulator define the pto stiffness negandari et al 2018 in a word both the magnitudes of pto damping and pto stiffness have an influence on the peak value of capture power what s more pto damping also affects the resonance point falnes 1999 subsequently different methods are used to find the optimal pto liang and zuo 2017 found closed form solutions for both optimal and suboptimal pto designs jin et al 2019 used a linear frequency domain model to control generator damping and stiffness actively it is believed that under optimal shape and pto designs when wave frequency is within the natural frequencies of the two floats two float heaving wec can produce more power than single float one nevertheless the passive motion of a wec under wave excitation could not get an ideal energy efficiency as the development of control strategy passive loading equivalent saturation control and maximum stroke control are applied providing the possibility of obtaining higher average power van den berg et al 2011 multi resonant control and q learning algorithm are also introduced to maximize the energy harvesting abdelkhalik and zou 2019 anderlini et al 2018 generalized analytical phase control conditions bubbar and buckham 2020 and unlatching control strategy could also increase average energy absorption henriques et al 2012 this paper focuses on a fundamental study of a two body heaving wec under regular waves seeking the maximum power extraction with optimal pto damping the dynamic performance is primarily dependent on the pto force most previous studies have used various methods to apply linear pto damping force such as mechanical method martin et al 2020 or linear generator tan et al 2020 although linear pto damping is simple and common for analysis constant pto force is also another major damping form thus in this paper the physical model test is conducted to explore the hydrodynamic performance of the wec and constant pto damping force is applied to the model via a specially designed hydraulic control in numerical simulation part both linear and non linear pto damping forces are determined the results presented in this paper are all model scale values the paper is organized as follows in section 2 a two body heaving wec physical model test is established where the constant pto damping force is introduced in the model test section 3 introduces the method of simulation section 4 illustrates the comparative analysis of experimental and numerical results where the simulation model is validated by free decay rao and power capture tests section 5 discusses the results of the numerical dynamics model revealing the characteristics of the wec finally section 6 draws the conclusion of the study giving methodological comparison and suggestion to the two body heaving wec optimization and expectation of the further work as well 2 physical model test 2 1 model setup a 1 9 scale model test of the proposed wec based on the froude similarity law is conducted in shandong provincial key laboratory of ocean engineering as shown in fig 1 the wave tank is 60 m long 36 m wide 1 5 m deep and features a piston type wave maker which can generate waves with heights ranging from 0 05 m to 0 25 m and periods ranging from 0 5 s to 2 5 s in both regular and irregular wave conditions the tank absorbs wave energy with a sloped porous medium at the end and vertical ones in front of the flanks to minimize the wave reflection the layout of the wave tank for the physical model test is shown in fig 2 the water depth of the physical model test is 1 10 m and the model is placed 30 m from the wave maker and 7 m from one side of the flanks so that the wall effect can be ignored wave gauges are used to measure the fluctuation of the water surface an ndi optotrack certus is used to record the motions of the floats before the physical model test all measurements are calibrated fig 3 shows the positions of the wave gauges and the ndi the wec consists of two coaxial floats which are neutrally buoyant and only have the heave motions the model set is a non mooring system as shown in fig 4 the outer float moves along three guide rods ①②③ while the inner one moves along the other two ④⑤ a frame is assembled outside of the model set and fixed to the tank to make sure the model stays in an upright position the geometric parameters of the model are given in table 1 in detail in the test a hydraulic system is applied to provide the pto damping as shown in fig 5 it controls constant pto force by adjusting hydraulic pressure in the hydraulic system relief valve 6 is used to keep steady pressure and regulate pressure solenoid operated directional valve 7 is intended to exhaust gas from the hydraulic circuit proportional valve 9 is assembled to control the hydraulic pressure the error between the pto force provided by the hydraulic system and the desired value is within 10 and the error of the period is within 1 it can be considered that the pto damping force applied by the hydraulic system can meet the test requirement more detailed analysis of the pto force is shown in section 4 3 2 2 regular wave condition sea state of north china presents the characteristics of small wave height and short wave period as one of the most representative sea zhaitang island has been selected as a marine energy test center in north china the most frequent occurring wave conditions of this island include the wave heights of 0 25 0 75 m and the wave periods of 3 0 4 0 s liu et al 2017 considering capacity of the wave tank and inherent performance of the wec the model test selects the conditions with a wave height range between 0 075 and 0 20 m and a period between 1 05 and 2 30 s 3 numerical model the numerical model is established using the boundary element method software ansys aqwa to obtain the inviscid hydrodynamic coefficients such as added mass and radiation damping panel methods are used to analyze the hydrodynamic behavior in waves fig 6 the numerical model simulates the hydrostatic restoring force radiation force and wave excitation force the additional user defined viscous force which is obtained by experimental data can be optionally included in the equation of motion furthermore the pto damping force is also imposed through user defined process the governing equation of the two body heaving wec in frequency domain is 1 ω 2 m 1 a 11 a 1 i ω b 11 b v i s 1 c 1 z 1 ω 2 a 12 i ω b 12 z 2 f e 1 ω 2 m 2 a 22 a 2 i ω b 22 b v i s 2 c 2 z 2 ω 2 a 21 i ω b 21 z 1 f e 2 where subscript 1 denotes to the outer float and 2 represents the inner float respectively m i stands for the mass of a float a i j is the added mass and a i is the amended added mass b i j is the radiation damping coefficient c is the restoring force coefficient b v i s i is the linearized viscous damping coefficient f e i is the complex amplitude of the exciting force on a float which causes its heave motion z i is the complex amplitude of the heave motion of a float in frequency domain analysis pto damping force is not taken into account and all the motions are harmonic the amended added mass and linearized viscous damping coefficients are complemented by free decay test which is discussed in section 4 1 the set of dynamic equations describing two floats heave motions in time domain can be expressed as follows 2 m 1 a 11 a 1 z 1 t a 12 z 2 t k 11 t z 1 t k 12 t z 2 t b v i s 1 z 1 t c 1 z 1 t f e 1 t f p t o t m 2 a 22 a 2 z 2 t a 21 z 1 t

are the velocity and the acceleration respectively the symbol denotes the operation of convolution f p t o is the pto damping force further k i j t is the radiation force impulse response function which is the inverse fourier transform of 3 k i j ω i ω a i j ω a i j b i j ω where a i j is the added mass when ω in time domain analysis pto damping force are calculated at each timestep by user defined routine the pto damping force yields f p t o b s g n z 1 z 2 z 1 z 2 1 n where b is the damping coefficient and n is the pto nonlinear factor if n 1 the pto force is linear and if n the pto force is a coulomb pto and its value is constant in fact when n 100 the nonlinear pto force can be very close to a constant pto force which is shown in fig 7 the results of the time domain analysis only remain the steady state response 4 model validation and comparison of numerical and experimental results in this section the numerical model is calibrated by heave decay physical model test and validated by regular wave physical model tests the conditions regarding to the pto damping force are different in the frequency domain and time domain analyses for power capture test the model test only considers the constant pto damping force while the time domain numerical model simulates both linear and nonlinear pto damping force including the case of constant pto damping force the frequency domain numerical model only considers the cases with no pto table 2 lists the differences in these cases 4 1 heave decay with no pto free decay test is taken to check the natural periods and the hydrodynamic coefficients of the model could be determined at these natural periods here the free decay test is carried out in still water for heave motions the heave decay tests of the two floats are carried out separately one of the floats is forced to an initial displacement along the vertical axis and then is allowed to return naturally to its equilibrium position during the process the decay motion of the float is recorded while the natural period in heave is measured as the period between peaks of the recorded motion at the same time the other float keeps at the equilibrium position in the data analysis the total added mass a and the damping coefficient b are determined from the exponential decay curve which are calculated in the following equations 4 and 5 4 a k ω 0 2 m 5 b 2 c ξ ω 0 where ω 0 2 π t is the natural frequency of oscillation c is the restoring force coefficient m is the mass of a float and ξ is the damping ratio based on the decay test data of the physical model and the hydrodynamic coefficients calculated by the software numerical model is calibrated by modifying the amended added mass and the linearized viscous damping coefficient to match the real motion of the floats considering the viscous effects fig 8 shows the results of a free oscillation test in heave of the two floating bodies the decay curves from the experimental and numerical results are quite close as shown in fig 8 the natural period of the outer float is approximately 1 29 s whereas the natural period of the inner one is approximately 1 82 s 4 2 heave motion rao with no pto in regular waves regular wave test without the influence of pto is undertaken to obtain the heave motion rao and to assess the validity of the numerical simulation modified by free decay test as discussed in section 4 1 without the experimental data the heave motion rao of this system will be heavily over predicted the model tests are performed with two floating bodies coupled the heave motion rao which is defined as the amplitude of the body s heave motion normalized by the wave amplitude and also regarded as a function of wave period is used to evaluate the hydrodynamic performance of the two body heaving wec the experimental raos are obtained from regular wave tests without pto damping force the ratio between heave motion response and wave signals is obtained over a range of wave periods under regular wave conditions noting that the numerical results conduct two simulation results in frequency and time domain respectively experimental and numerical heave motion raos of the two bodies without pto damping force are plotted in fig 9 which are in good agreement fig 9 a shows that the outer float has a good wave following property in most periods the responses have a great promotion from 1 05 s to 1 30 s and remain approximately 1 0 afterwards fig 9 b reveals that the inner float is more sensitive to the wave period than the outer one which has an obvious resonance range that may be due to the streamline shape of the float at 1 80 s the resonance condition is approached where the heave displacement amplitude is three times of the incident wave the relative heave motion rao is defined as the ratio of the amplitude of the instantaneous relative movement of the outer and inner floats to the wave amplitude which is shown in fig 9 c it also obtains the peak value at the period of 1 80 s since the outer float has no distinct peak value of rao the relative motion appears to have a similar tendency to that of the inner float when the wave period is small the inner float has a weak response and the performance of the system mainly depends on the response of the outer one as the period increases to the resonance range of the inner float it interacts strongly with wave which leads to a large relative motion when the wave period continues increasing the motions of two floats tend to be consistent and the relative motion is reduced regardless of large wave periods the relative motion has a better performance than any of the two single floats especially when the period is small the opposite phenomenon occurs under large wave periods in summary the two body heaving wec has better response than a single body one under shorter wave periods the motion characteristics of the outer and inner floats are mixed to supply a greater contribution to the united system the heave motion rao curves show that this model is suitable for the selected sea state with the outer float as the absorber the numerical model is valid under free oscillation when supplied with experimentally derived added mass and damping coefficients 4 3 pto force and relative float motion in regular waves the cases of constant pto damping force supplied by the hydraulic system in physical model test are taken into account fig 10 a and b illustrate the comparisons of the changes of pto damping force with time and with relative motion the data are recorded from time domain numerical model and physical model test time series of relative motion is shown in fig 10 c numerical results are more stable and higher than experimental ones but the periodicity is good fig 10 d and e show the comparisons of the amplitudes of pto damping force relative motion and relative velocity between physical model test and time domain simulation results under two regular wave cases with t 1 30 s h 0 175 m case 1 and h 0 20 m case 2 respectively the trends of curves between them are quite similar pto damping force is measured by pressure sensor in physical model test while the numerical model results are the configured values as shown in fig 10 the pto damping force applied to the wec in the physical model test is relatively smaller compared to the numerical model however focusing on wec relative motion and relative velocity numerical results perform better than experimental ones that may cause by the friction loss of the hydraulic system the pto damping force applied in the model test is obtained by multiplying the pressure difference of the hydraulic cylinder by the cavity area ignoring the friction of the hydraulic system therefore the measured pto damping force in the physical model test is less than the actual damping force applied to the floats and the relative motion is smaller than numerical ones it is believed that in the full scale model the proportion of friction loss is small so that it is not taken into account in the following numerical model in fig 10 f and g the comparisons of capture width ratio cwr under case 1 and 2 are investigated which are the combination of pto force and relative motion shown in fig 10 d and e there is a certain difference in absolute values but the trends of the curve are consistent for more proof the comparisons of the optimal coefficient between physical model test and time domain simulation are illustrated in fig 10 h in addition to case 1 and 2 case 3 t 1 55 s h 0 175 m and case 4 t 1 55 s h 0 20 m are added for comparison it can be seen that there is a good match between the physical and simulation model in terms of the optimal coefficient it can also be proved that the constant pto damping force can be applied in the numerical simulation based on the above discussions the numerical dynamics model agrees well with experimental results in terms of displacements rao pto force and power capture the numerical dynamics model is considered to be valid for the purposes of this study to further explore the properties of wec the below part is discussed by simulation model data what s more in order to show the performance in more detail the simulation extends the wave conditions to the wave height between 0 05 and 0 08 m and the wave period between 0 80 and 2 60 s 5 power capture performance with different ptos for regular wave conditions sensitivity study of power capture performance of the two body heaving wec is conducted in this section using time domain numerical simulation models power capture performance under different pto models wave heights and periods are compared phase angle between different pto damping forces are also contrasted all of the analyses are based on the time domain simulation results nondimensional numbers are suggested to obtain the laws of performance for upscaled wec table 3 shows the dimensional and the corresponding nondimensional quantities used in this section 5 1 power capture performance for different wave heights data from time domain model results with constant pto damping are given in fig 11 the wave heights are h 0 10 0 20 m with the interval of 0 02 m and t 1 40 s the data plotted are mechanical power capture and cwr as a function of pto damping force the energy captured is calculated by multiplying pto damping with relative motion during the time history as shown in fig 11 a the higher wave height is the more power produces the optimal pto damping force increase with the increase of the wave height meanwhile the cwr is also proportional to the wave height as shown in fig 11 b normalize the pto damping force by ρ g d 2 h where ρ is wave density g is gravitational acceleration d is the diameter of the outer float and h is the wave height for one certain wave period the curve of mean power is consistent with the change of normalized force under various wave heights in respect of linear pto damping force condition the mean power and its corresponding cwr increase first and then decrease along with the increase of damping coefficient as shown in fig 12 the captured power is proportional to the wave height while the curves of cwr at different wave heights are coincident in contrast to constant pto force the optimal pto damping coefficient is fixed for one wave period what s more the energy acquisition of the device under linear damping is more moderate with the change of damping coefficient 5 2 optimal pto damping coefficients for the two body heaving wec the curves of optimal coefficients of pto damping force which is defined as the corresponding damping coefficient when the maximum energy is reached at certain period are shown in fig 13 for constant damping force as seen in fig 13 a and b the optimal coefficient goes up to a peak value and subsequently declines with the increase of wave period in particular the optimal damping coefficient reaches the maximum value under the optimal capture wave period obviously higher wave heights will have larger optimal coefficient when the optimal coefficient normalized by ρ g d 2 h it only depends on the wave period accordingly the optimal coefficient of constant damping is proportional to wave height fig 13 c and d show that the optimal damping coefficient of linear pto damping force decreases first with respect to wave period and normalized wave period and then increases again when the period gets to the synchronous motion of the two floats wave height has no effect on the optimal coefficient under linear pto damping force it can be seen that the optimized damping coefficients can be so different under different periods the characteristics of optimal damping and power capture are so different due to hydrodynamic properties as expected for constant pto damping force both wave height and period affect the power capture and optimal coefficient whereas linear damping only wave period does 5 3 sensitivity study for regular wave conditions when the pto damping coefficient is fixed constant pto damping force exhibits different capacities under different wave height while linear pto damping force remains consistent as shown in fig 14 this is because as discussed above the optimal coefficient that can be obtained at different wave heights are different with constant pto damping force and in regard to linear system only the incident wave period matters observing from fig 9 c the peak value of relative heave motion rao appears at 1 80 s however the high relative motion amplitude is associated with low power production as shown in fig 14 a and c therefore blindly increasing the relative motion does not improve energy production due to the influence of pto damping force the maximum response interval of the system changes moving towards the shorter wave periods the results of the model show that the system has a good power capacity under small wave periods between 1 40 and 1 60 s that is between the resonance periods of the two bodies the ability of power capture gets worse when wave period exceeds the optimal range and synchronism occurs the power capture performance with different constant pto damping force varies with the wave height observing the curves of mean power in fig 15 a as the pto damping rising the curvature of energy growth ascends for its corresponding cwr as shown in fig 15 b cwr falls down with the increase of the wave height under small constant pto damping force then as the force increases the degree of decrease becomes slower and turns to an upward tendency and from the convex curve to concave curve gradually therefore in the power capture range as the constant pto force goes up the energy obtained will ascend at a faster rate as the wave height goes up differ from constant force wave height improves the mean power capture monotonically under linear damping while the corresponding cwr does not change as shown in fig 15 c and d 5 4 power capture performance with different pto models the comparisons of optimal mean power capture as a function of wave period between constant and linear pto forces are shown in fig 16 when the wave period is shorter than 1 80 s the resonance period of the inner float linear pto damping force are better than the constant one when the period exceeds 1 80 s the difference is very tiny wave height has no impact on the optimal power for cwr comparison wave height has no influence on the maximum power capture as introduced in section 3 the pto damping force yields f p t o b s g n z 1 z 2 z 1 z 2 1 n the pto nonlinear factor n is introduced to evaluate power capacity which is used to characterize the nonlinearity of pto damping force in order to better display in the figure here assuming that the pto nonlinear factor of constant pto damping force is 150 as shown in fig 17 the maximum power increases first and then drops down with the increase of n and reaches the maximum when n 1 that is the linear damping in this comparative analysis the pto damping coefficient is set to an optimized value that is specific to each pto and wave conditions it indicates that the linear damping is the optimal pto damping form to this system contour plots of mean power production and cwr as a function of h and t for constant and linear pto damping forces are shown in fig 18 the optimum passive pto damping force was chosen for each wave condition linear pto damping force has a better power capture performance than constant force under the same sea state but with very litter difference in that sense changing the type of pto damping force can only improve the capacity to a limited extent the main power band is concentrated between the heave natural periods of the two bodies wave period corresponding to the peak value of the mean power is longer than the period corresponding to the peak value of cwr 5 5 phase angle with different pto models the phase angle is used to describe the phase difference between the outer and the inner floats the phase angle is larger in the absence of pto forces than that in the presence of pto force the maximum phase angle without pto force is 125 at 1 60 s and approximately zero phase angle above 2 0 s as shown in fig 19 it is very difficult to make these two bodies move in opposite direction under passive damping they get a maximum phase angle at 1 80 s which is the natural period of the inner float the pto damping force reduces phase angle by 55 when the wave period exceeds 1 80 s the phase angle plunged to zero 6 conclusions in this paper a 1 9 scaled model of a two body heaving wec is studied both experimentally and numerically with focus on the power absorption performance and the motion characteristics of the wec the linearized viscous damping coefficients derived from the physical decay model test is used to calibrate the numerical model to achieve a good comparison to the experimental results the numerical result under regular wave condition has a good agreement with that of the physical model test sensitive study of this system is conducted using the validated time domain numerical models and the conclusion that larger relative movement does not mean better power capture is drawn linear pto damping system is more suitable for this system with consideration of the pto nonlinear factor n for the different wave heights that were considered in this study the wec system behaves linearly the hydrodynamic performance of this system depends on the coupling property of the two floats and has a decent motion response in resonance range the power production is markedly affected by the wave period phase angle between the two floats is not the only indicator of power capacity in terms of power capture the system has a good performance when the wave period is between the two floats natural periods and especially at the average value of their natural periods as a result a larger separation between two natural periods is beneficial leading to a wider and higher capture band the paper addresses the dynamic performance of the two body wec with no active phase control which will be applied

21192,wave energy is one of the most difficult energies to be captured among marine renewables with the technical progress wave energy converters wecs are being tested in relatively deeper waters which makes floating concepts almost the only choice in this paper a two body heaving wec where the wave energy is absorbed through the relative motion between the outer annular and the inner cylindrical buoys is studied both experimental and numerical studies are adopted for regular wave conditions in the physical model test a hydraulic system is used to achieve constant power take off pto damping force numerical simulations validated against experimental data are applied using both the frequency domain and the time domains analyses different types of ptos including constant linear and nonlinear damping forces are undertaken to evaluate the hydrodynamic and power absorption performance of such device keywords two body heaving wave energy converter physical model test numerical simulation power take off 1 introduction according to the vision for international deployment of ocean energy by ocean energy system 2018 the global potential of ocean renewable energy which could be developed is about 748 gw and the level of its consumption could reduce up to 5 2 billion tons of co2 emission by 2050 utilization of ocean energy resources will contribute to the world s future sustainable power supply although wave energy converters wecs extracting energy from the ocean surface are facing issues of both safety and efficiency they still represent a very remarkable share of the overall global supply in the future various forms of wecs have been developed worldwide though none of them has been stood out as a definitive choice ji et al 2020 from the perspective of marine resources offshore regions have relatively more abundant and stable wave energy than near shore in most sea areas castro and chiang 2020 zheng et al 2014 thereby with the technical progress floating wecs are becoming a hotspot generally a floating wec system consists of floats which react each other to harness energy from the relative motion in between compared to fixed ones it is more flexible as it less affected by water depth and is not limited by the power take off pto forms besides it is easier to deploy and maintain for the multi body form it leads to multiple resonant characteristic which broadens the operational sea condition taking the advantages many floating wecs have been investigated some devices absorb energy using relative motion of the sealed hull and heavy counterweights inside crowley et al 2018 whose concept amplifies the energy under low frequency and small amplitude waves one of the representatives is the wello penguin and the full scale prototype of which has been tested in the european marine energy center tethys 2019 another wec under this principle is searev which utilizes the interaction between the pendular wheel and the hull to produce electricity and where the center of gravity of the wheel is off centred cordonnier et al 2015 the approach of using wave curvature along its propagation direction to extract energy is also considered and most of which incorporate hydraulic system to convert energy the raft type one such as mccabe wave pump which articulates three rectangular floating pontoons uses the relative motion in pitch to drive the energy conversion system liu et al 2018 this methodology also underpins the design of pelamis whose four rafts move adjacently and drive the hydraulic ptos to absorb energy henderson 2006 although the above novel wecs have been well studied point absorbers utilizing heave motion for wave energy conversion still occupy a certain proportion in wave energy devices this kind of wec typically employs floats to react against each other to generate mechanical energy which is extracted by means of pto powerbuoy a cost effective two body heaving wec utilizes relative motion between a float and a spar with a heave plate to drive the push rod and convert wave energy van rij et al 2017 inspired by the powerbuoy the u s department of energy funded reference model 3 neary et al 2014 apart of that many other two body heaving wecs with different functions are invented some of which are connected to the grid rusu and onea 2017 and some are used to power mobile devices dai et al 2017 shi et al 2019 optimization of size and shape is an important aspect of improving energy capture son et al 2014 2016 designed a shaped bottom named berkeley wedge to increase the dynamic response a streamlined submerged body is adopted in wavebob to achieve greater relative velocity windt et al 2018 a heave plate is presented in aegir dynamo to give the steady reference to the floats al habaibeh et al 2010 in addition martin et al 2020 investigated cylinder sphere and plate type floats giving sequence of the response performances from the best to the worst beatty et al 2015 2019 compared different shapes of submerged floats on both response amplitude operator rao and pto summarily the dimension of a float including draught and diameter also affects its hydrodynamic response amiri et al 2016 mass ratio between floats has an effect on the energy absorption as well liang and zuo 2017 which controls the relative motion with pto together aside from the design of the floats pto is another vital aspect to wec electromechanical pto castro and chiang 2020 linear generator tan et al 2020 hydraulic pto xu et al 2019 and other different forms of pto emerge in endlessly electromechanical pto utilizes rack and pinion system combined generator to realize power conversion the electrical resistance of the generator and the radius of the pinions have an effect on the pto damping some mechanical pto systems would assemble a variable inertia flywheel to reach the resonance condition in this case the rotational inertia and inertia disc radius should be in consideration hernández et al 2017 linear generators directly link to the wave without any motion transmission and several key design parameters that will significantly affect the pto damping coefficient i e the width of the coil and the radius of the central shaft which in turn affect the energy capture performance in the hydraulic system the damping coefficient of hydraulic cylinder and pressure drop determine the pto damping together the piston displacement and accumulator define the pto stiffness negandari et al 2018 in a word both the magnitudes of pto damping and pto stiffness have an influence on the peak value of capture power what s more pto damping also affects the resonance point falnes 1999 subsequently different methods are used to find the optimal pto liang and zuo 2017 found closed form solutions for both optimal and suboptimal pto designs jin et al 2019 used a linear frequency domain model to control generator damping and stiffness actively it is believed that under optimal shape and pto designs when wave frequency is within the natural frequencies of the two floats two float heaving wec can produce more power than single float one nevertheless the passive motion of a wec under wave excitation could not get an ideal energy efficiency as the development of control strategy passive loading equivalent saturation control and maximum stroke control are applied providing the possibility of obtaining higher average power van den berg et al 2011 multi resonant control and q learning algorithm are also introduced to maximize the energy harvesting abdelkhalik and zou 2019 anderlini et al 2018 generalized analytical phase control conditions bubbar and buckham 2020 and unlatching control strategy could also increase average energy absorption henriques et al 2012 this paper focuses on a fundamental study of a two body heaving wec under regular waves seeking the maximum power extraction with optimal pto damping the dynamic performance is primarily dependent on the pto force most previous studies have used various methods to apply linear pto damping force such as mechanical method martin et al 2020 or linear generator tan et al 2020 although linear pto damping is simple and common for analysis constant pto force is also another major damping form thus in this paper the physical model test is conducted to explore the hydrodynamic performance of the wec and constant pto damping force is applied to the model via a specially designed hydraulic control in numerical simulation part both linear and non linear pto damping forces are determined the results presented in this paper are all model scale values the paper is organized as follows in section 2 a two body heaving wec physical model test is established where the constant pto damping force is introduced in the model test section 3 introduces the method of simulation section 4 illustrates the comparative analysis of experimental and numerical results where the simulation model is validated by free decay rao and power capture tests section 5 discusses the results of the numerical dynamics model revealing the characteristics of the wec finally section 6 draws the conclusion of the study giving methodological comparison and suggestion to the two body heaving wec optimization and expectation of the further work as well 2 physical model test 2 1 model setup a 1 9 scale model test of the proposed wec based on the froude similarity law is conducted in shandong provincial key laboratory of ocean engineering as shown in fig 1 the wave tank is 60 m long 36 m wide 1 5 m deep and features a piston type wave maker which can generate waves with heights ranging from 0 05 m to 0 25 m and periods ranging from 0 5 s to 2 5 s in both regular and irregular wave conditions the tank absorbs wave energy with a sloped porous medium at the end and vertical ones in front of the flanks to minimize the wave reflection the layout of the wave tank for the physical model test is shown in fig 2 the water depth of the physical model test is 1 10 m and the model is placed 30 m from the wave maker and 7 m from one side of the flanks so that the wall effect can be ignored wave gauges are used to measure the fluctuation of the water surface an ndi optotrack certus is used to record the motions of the floats before the physical model test all measurements are calibrated fig 3 shows the positions of the wave gauges and the ndi the wec consists of two coaxial floats which are neutrally buoyant and only have the heave motions the model set is a non mooring system as shown in fig 4 the outer float moves along three guide rods ①②③ while the inner one moves along the other two ④⑤ a frame is assembled outside of the model set and fixed to the tank to make sure the model stays in an upright position the geometric parameters of the model are given in table 1 in detail in the test a hydraulic system is applied to provide the pto damping as shown in fig 5 it controls constant pto force by adjusting hydraulic pressure in the hydraulic system relief valve 6 is used to keep steady pressure and regulate pressure solenoid operated directional valve 7 is intended to exhaust gas from the hydraulic circuit proportional valve 9 is assembled to control the hydraulic pressure the error between the pto force provided by the hydraulic system and the desired value is within 10 and the error of the period is within 1 it can be considered that the pto damping force applied by the hydraulic system can meet the test requirement more detailed analysis of the pto force is shown in section 4 3 2 2 regular wave condition sea state of north china presents the characteristics of small wave height and short wave period as one of the most representative sea zhaitang island has been selected as a marine energy test center in north china the most frequent occurring wave conditions of this island include the wave heights of 0 25 0 75 m and the wave periods of 3 0 4 0 s liu et al 2017 considering capacity of the wave tank and inherent performance of the wec the model test selects the conditions with a wave height range between 0 075 and 0 20 m and a period between 1 05 and 2 30 s 3 numerical model the numerical model is established using the boundary element method software ansys aqwa to obtain the inviscid hydrodynamic coefficients such as added mass and radiation damping panel methods are used to analyze the hydrodynamic behavior in waves fig 6 the numerical model simulates the hydrostatic restoring force radiation force and wave excitation force the additional user defined viscous force which is obtained by experimental data can be optionally included in the equation of motion furthermore the pto damping force is also imposed through user defined process the governing equation of the two body heaving wec in frequency domain is 1 ω 2 m 1 a 11 a 1 i ω b 11 b v i s 1 c 1 z 1 ω 2 a 12 i ω b 12 z 2 f e 1 ω 2 m 2 a 22 a 2 i ω b 22 b v i s 2 c 2 z 2 ω 2 a 21 i ω b 21 z 1 f e 2 where subscript 1 denotes to the outer float and 2 represents the inner float respectively m i stands for the mass of a float a i j is the added mass and a i is the amended added mass b i j is the radiation damping coefficient c is the restoring force coefficient b v i s i is the linearized viscous damping coefficient f e i is the complex amplitude of the exciting force on a float which causes its heave motion z i is the complex amplitude of the heave motion of a float in frequency domain analysis pto damping force is not taken into account and all the motions are harmonic the amended added mass and linearized viscous damping coefficients are complemented by free decay test which is discussed in section 4 1 the set of dynamic equations describing two floats heave motions in time domain can be expressed as follows 2 m 1 a 11 a 1 z 1 t a 12 z 2 t k 11 t z 1 t k 12 t z 2 t b v i s 1 z 1 t c 1 z 1 t f e 1 t f p t o t m 2 a 22 a 2 z 2 t a 21 z 1 t k 22 t z 2 t k 21 t z 1 t b v i s 2 z 2 t c 2 z 2 t f e 2 t f p t o t where f e i is the exciting force on a float which causes its heave motion z t is the heave motion of a float where z t and z t are the velocity and the acceleration respectively the symbol denotes the operation of convolution f p t o is the pto damping force further k i j t is the radiation force impulse response function which is the inverse fourier transform of 3 k i j ω i ω a i j ω a i j b i j ω where a i j is the added mass when ω in time domain analysis pto damping force are calculated at each timestep by user defined routine the pto damping force yields f p t o b s g n z 1 z 2 z 1 z 2 1 n where b is the damping coefficient and n is the pto nonlinear factor if n 1 the pto force is linear and if n the pto force is a coulomb pto and its value is constant in fact when n 100 the nonlinear pto force can be very close to a constant pto force which is shown in fig 7 the results of the time domain analysis only remain the steady state response 4 model validation and comparison of numerical and experimental results in this section the numerical model is calibrated by heave decay physical model test and validated by regular wave physical model tests the conditions regarding to the pto damping force are different in the frequency domain and time domain analyses for power capture test the model test only considers the constant pto damping force while the time domain numerical model simulates both linear and nonlinear pto damping force including the case of constant pto damping force the frequency domain numerical model only considers the cases with no pto table 2 lists the differences in these cases 4 1 heave decay with no pto free decay test is taken to check the natural periods and the hydrodynamic coefficients of the model could be determined at these natural periods here the free decay test is carried out in still water for heave motions the heave decay tests of the two floats are carried out separately one of the floats is forced to an initial displacement along the vertical axis and then is allowed to return naturally to its equilibrium position during the process the decay motion of the float is recorded while the natural period in heave is measured as the period between peaks of the recorded motion at the same time the other float keeps at the equilibrium position in the data analysis the total added mass a and the damping coefficient b are determined from the exponential decay curve which are calculated in the following equations 4 and 5 4 a k ω 0 2 m 5 b 2 c ξ ω 0 where ω 0 2 π t is the natural frequency of oscillation c is the restoring force coefficient m is the mass of a float and ξ is the damping ratio based on the decay test data of the physical model and the hydrodynamic coefficients calculated by the software numerical model is calibrated by modifying the amended added mass and the linearized viscous damping coefficient to match the real motion of the floats considering the viscous effects fig 8 shows the results of a free oscillation test in heave of the two floating bodies the decay curves from the experimental and numerical results are quite close as shown in fig 8 the natural period of the outer float is approximately 1 29 s whereas the natural period of the inner one is approximately 1 82 s 4 2 heave motion rao with no pto in regular waves regular wave test without the influence of pto is undertaken to obtain the heave motion rao and to assess the validity of the numerical simulation modified by free decay test as discussed in section 4 1 without the experimental data the heave motion rao of this system will be heavily over predicted the model tests are performed with two floating bodies coupled the heave motion rao which is defined as the amplitude of the body s heave motion normalized by the wave amplitude and also regarded as a function of wave period is used to evaluate the hydrodynamic performance of the two body heaving wec the experimental raos are obtained from regular wave tests without pto damping force the ratio between heave motion response and wave signals is obtained over a range of wave periods under regular wave conditions noting that the numerical results conduct two simulation results in frequency and time domain respectively experimental and numerical heave motion raos of the two bodies without pto damping force are plotted in fig 9 which are in good agreement fig 9 a shows that the outer float has a good wave following property in most periods the responses have a great promotion from 1 05 s to 1 30 s and remain approximately 1 0 afterwards fig 9 b reveals that the inner float is more sensitive to the wave period than the outer one which has an obvious resonance range that may be due to the streamline shape of the float at 1 80 s the resonance condition is approached where the heave displacement amplitude is three times of the incident wave the relative heave motion rao is defined as the ratio of the amplitude of the instantaneous relative movement of the outer and inner floats to the wave amplitude which is shown in fig 9 c it also obtains the peak value at the period of 1 80 s since the outer float has no distinct peak value of rao the relative motion appears to have a similar tendency to that of the inner float when the wave period is small the inner float has a weak response and the performance of the system mainly depends on the response of the outer one as the period increases to the resonance range of the inner float it interacts strongly with wave which leads to a large relative motion when the wave period continues increasing the motions of two floats tend to be consistent and the relative motion is reduced regardless of large wave periods the relative motion has a better performance than any of the two single floats especially when the period is small the opposite phenomenon occurs under large wave periods in summary the two body heaving wec has better response than a single body one under shorter wave periods the motion characteristics of the outer and inner floats are mixed to supply a greater contribution to the united system the heave motion rao curves show that this model is suitable for the selected sea state with the outer float as the absorber the numerical model is valid under free oscillation when supplied with experimentally derived added mass and damping coefficients 4 3 pto force and relative float motion in regular waves the cases of constant pto damping force supplied by the hydraulic system in physical model test are taken into account fig 10 a and b illustrate the comparisons of the changes of pto damping force with time and with relative motion the data are recorded from time domain numerical model and physical model test time series of relative motion is shown in fig 10 c numerical results are more stable and higher than experimental ones but the periodicity is good fig 10 d and e show the comparisons of the amplitudes of pto damping force relative motion and relative velocity between physical model test and time domain simulation results under two regular wave cases with t 1 30 s h 0 175 m case 1 and h 0 20 m case 2 respectively the trends of curves between them are quite similar pto damping force is measured by pressure sensor in physical model test while the numerical model results are the configured values as shown in fig 10 the pto damping force applied to the wec in the physical model test is relatively smaller compared to the numerical model however focusing on wec relative motion and relative velocity numerical results perform better than experimental ones that may cause by the friction loss of the hydraulic system the pto damping force applied in the model test is obtained by multiplying the pressure difference of the hydraulic cylinder by the cavity area ignoring the friction of the hydraulic system therefore the measured pto damping force in the physical model test is less than the actual damping force applied to the floats and the relative motion is smaller than numerical ones it is believed that in the full scale model the proportion of friction loss is small so that it is not taken into account in the following numerical model in fig 10 f and g the comparisons of capture width ratio cwr under case 1 and 2 are investigated which are the combination of pto force and relative motion shown in fig 10 d and e there is a certain difference in absolute values but the trends of the curve are consistent for more proof the comparisons of the optimal coefficient between physical model test and time domain simulation are illustrated in fig 10 h in addition to case 1 and 2 case 3 t 1 55 s h 0 175 m and case 4 t 1 55 s h 0 20 m are added for comparison it can be seen that there is a good match between the physical and simulation model in terms of the optimal coefficient it can also be proved that the constant pto damping force can be applied in the numerical simulation based on the above discussions the numerical dynamics model agrees well with experimental results in terms of displacements rao pto force and power capture the numerical dynamics model is considered to be valid for the purposes of this study to further explore the properties of wec the below part is discussed by simulation model data what s more in order to show the performance in more detail the simulation extends the wave conditions to the wave height between 0 05 and 0 08 m and the wave period between 0 80 and 2 60 s 5 power capture performance with different ptos for regular wave conditions sensitivity study of power capture performance of the two body heaving wec is conducted in this section using time domain numerical simulation models power capture performance under different pto models wave heights and periods are compared phase angle between different pto damping forces are also contrasted all of the analyses are based on the time domain simulation results nondimensional numbers are suggested to obtain the laws of performance for upscaled wec table 3 shows the dimensional and the corresponding nondimensional quantities used in this section 5 1 power capture performance for different wave heights data from time domain model results with constant pto damping are given in fig 11 the wave heights are h 0 10 0 20 m with the interval of 0 02 m and t 1 40 s the data plotted are mechanical power capture and cwr as a function of pto damping force the energy captured is calculated by multiplying pto damping with relative motion during the time history as shown in fig 11 a the higher wave height is the more power produces the optimal pto damping force increase with the increase of the wave height meanwhile the cwr is also proportional to the wave height as shown in fig 11 b normalize the pto damping force by ρ g d 2 h where ρ is wave density g is gravitational acceleration d is the diameter of the outer float and h is the wave height for one certain wave period the curve of mean power is consistent with the change of normalized force under various wave heights in respect of linear pto damping force condition the mean power and its corresponding cwr increase first and then decrease along with the increase of damping coefficient as shown in fig 12 the captured power is proportional to the wave height while the curves of cwr at different wave heights are coincident in contrast to constant pto force the optimal pto damping coefficient is fixed for one wave period what s more the energy acquisition of the device under linear damping is more moderate with the change of damping coefficient 5 2 optimal pto damping coefficients for the two body heaving wec the curves of optimal coefficients of pto damping force which is defined as the corresponding damping coefficient when the maximum energy is reached at certain period are shown in fig 13 for constant damping force as seen in fig 13 a and b the optimal coefficient goes up to a peak value and subsequently declines with the increase of wave period in particular the optimal damping coefficient reaches the maximum value under the optimal capture wave period obviously higher wave heights will have larger optimal coefficient when the optimal coefficient normalized by ρ g d 2 h it only depends on the wave period accordingly the optimal coefficient of constant damping is proportional to wave height fig 13 c and d show that the optimal damping coefficient of linear pto damping force decreases first with respect to wave period and normalized wave period and then increases again when the period gets to the synchronous motion of the two floats wave height has no effect on the optimal coefficient under linear pto damping force it can be seen that the optimized damping coefficients can be so different under different periods the characteristics of optimal damping and power capture are so different due to hydrodynamic properties as expected for constant pto damping force both wave height and period affect the power capture and optimal coefficient whereas linear damping only wave period does 5 3 sensitivity study for regular wave conditions when the pto damping coefficient is fixed constant pto damping force exhibits different capacities under different wave height while linear pto damping force remains consistent as shown in fig 14 this is because as discussed above the optimal coefficient that can be obtained at different wave heights are different with constant pto damping force and in regard to linear system only the incident wave period matters observing from fig 9 c the peak value of relative heave motion rao appears at 1 80 s however the high relative motion amplitude is associated with low power production as shown in fig 14 a and c therefore blindly increasing the relative motion does not improve energy production due to the influence of pto damping force the maximum response interval of the system changes moving towards the shorter wave periods the results of the model show that the system has a good power capacity under small wave periods between 1 40 and 1 60 s that is between the resonance periods of the two bodies the ability of power capture gets worse when wave period exceeds the optimal range and synchronism occurs the power capture performance with different constant pto damping force varies with the wave height observing the curves of mean power in fig 15 a as the pto damping rising the curvature of energy growth ascends for its corresponding cwr as shown in fig 15 b cwr falls down with the increase of the wave height under small constant pto damping force then as the force increases the degree of decrease becomes slower and turns to an upward tendency and from the convex curve to concave curve gradually therefore in the power capture range as the constant pto force goes up the energy obtained will ascend at a faster rate as the wave height goes up differ from constant force wave height improves the mean power capture monotonically under linear damping while the corresponding cwr does not change as shown in fig 15 c and d 5 4 power capture performance with different pto models the comparisons of optimal mean power capture as a function of wave period between constant and linear pto forces are shown in fig 16 when the wave period is shorter than 1 80 s the resonance period of the inner float linear pto damping force are better than the constant one when the period exceeds 1 80 s the difference is very tiny wave height has no impact on the optimal power for cwr comparison wave height has no influence on the maximum power capture as introduced in section 3 the pto damping force yields f p t o b s g n z 1 z 2 z 1 z 2 1 n the pto nonlinear factor n is introduced to evaluate power capacity which is used to characterize the nonlinearity of pto damping force in order to better display in the figure here assuming that the pto nonlinear factor of constant pto damping force is 150 as shown in fig 17 the maximum power increases first and then drops down with the increase of n and reaches the maximum when n 1 that is the linear damping in this comparative analysis the pto damping coefficient is set to an optimized value that is specific to each pto and wave conditions it indicates that the linear damping is the optimal pto damping form to this system contour plots of mean power production and cwr as a function of h and t for constant and linear pto damping forces are shown in fig 18 the optimum passive pto damping force was chosen for each wave condition linear pto damping force has a better power capture performance than constant force under the same sea state but with very litter difference in that sense changing the type of pto damping force can only improve the capacity to a limited extent the main power band is concentrated between the heave natural periods of the two bodies wave period corresponding to the peak value of the mean power is longer than the period corresponding to the peak value of cwr 5 5 phase angle with different pto models the phase angle is used to describe the phase difference between the outer and the inner floats the phase angle is larger in the absence of pto forces than that in the presence of pto force the maximum phase angle without pto force is 125 at 1 60 s and approximately zero phase angle above 2 0 s as shown in fig 19 it is very difficult to make these two bodies move in opposite direction under passive damping they get a maximum phase angle at 1 80 s which is the natural period of the inner float the pto damping force reduces phase angle by 55 when the wave period exceeds 1 80 s the phase angle plunged to zero 6 conclusions in this paper a 1 9 scaled model of a two body heaving wec is studied both experimentally and numerically with focus on the power absorption performance and the motion characteristics of the wec the linearized viscous damping coefficients derived from the physical decay model test is used to calibrate the numerical model to achieve a good comparison to the experimental results the numerical result under regular wave condition has a good agreement with that of the physical model test sensitive study of this system is conducted using the validated time domain numerical models and the conclusion that larger relative movement does not mean better power capture is drawn linear pto damping system is more suitable for this system with consideration of the pto nonlinear factor n for the different wave heights that were considered in this study the wec system behaves linearly the hydrodynamic performance of this system depends on the coupling property of the two floats and has a decent motion response in resonance range the power production is markedly affected by the wave period phase angle between the two floats is not the only indicator of power capacity in terms of power capture the system has a good performance when the wave period is between the two floats natural periods and especially at the average value of their natural periods as a result a larger separation between two natural periods is beneficial leading to a wider and higher capture band the paper addresses the dynamic performance of the two body wec with no active phase control which will be applied

theory lqr control algorithm 1 introduction deepwater drilling riser system is key equipment connecting subsea wellhead and drilling platform normally the drilling riser system connects drilling platform with subsea wellhead to form an integrated drilling channel however the connected drilling riser system should disconnect in the bottom to guarantee the safety of the whole drilling riser system under dangerous conditions such as typhoon and the loss of dynamic positioning system liu et al 2013 2016 once the drilling riser is disconnected in the bottom the drilling riser system rapidly moves upward under the influence of tension the rapid riser movement after the disconnection is often called recoil in offshore oil and gas engineering the riser recoil can cause the drilling riser system failure such as the top response of the riser system exceeding the slip joint stroke and the lower marine riser package lmrp colliding with the subsea blowout preventer bop chang et al 2018 nie

and potential hazards of riser recoil response and simulated the recoil response of riser using risten program puccio et al 1998 analyzed some of the significant variables affecting the velocity and displacement of the riser string and lmrp during an emergency disconnect sequence stahl et al 2004 conducted riser recoil analysis to determine appropriate tension settings and operating limits the recoil analysis showed that avoiding the collision between lmrp and bop and preventing the relaxation of tensioning rope govern the selection of top tension settings and the maximum sea state in which the riser could remain connected lang et al 2009 developed a disconnect and recoil analysis software tool that for the first time has been integrated with a 3d finite element fe structural model of the drilling riser system grytoyr et al 2009 2010 2011 presented a methodology for the dynamic analysis of marine riser disconnect and recoil using general purpose riser fea programs the methodology

recoil response based on herschel bulkley rheology model ma et al 2013 conducted riser recoil analysis during and immediately following an emergency disconnect the influence of riser stack up drilling mud density water depths and associated top tensions are studied recently some researchers focused on the effect of mud discharge on riser recoil behavior meng et al 2018 su et al 2018 wang and gao 2019 wang et al 2020 summarized various mud discharge models and determined the application condition of each mud discharge model meng et al 2020 established a fully coupled integrated model between riser and discharge mud for recoil analysis it turned out that the recoil response of the riser can be affected by discharge mud remarkably however previous studies mainly focus on riser recoil analysis there are few researches on riser recoil control he et al 2016 conducted modeling and simulation for recoil control system of deepwater drilling riser a control method of using fuzzy pid controller is proposed to control the vertical displacement of the riser system it is of great significance to further conduct riser recoil control study based on existing riser recoil analysis achievements the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 establishes riser recoil model section 3 designs a controller which can adjust the opening of recoil control valve in real time according to the recoil response of the riser system based on optimal control theory and linear quadratic regulator lqr control algorithm section 4 presents simulation models for riser recoil analysis section 5 conducts riser recoil analysis with controller and without controller and compared with each other section 6 provides the conclusion 2 riser recoil model the emergency disconnection of a drilling riser system is shown in fig 1 in the event of an emergency disconnection the connector between bop and lmrp should be unlocked the drilling mud inside riser then discharges and seawater enters the riser through the refill valve the riser system begins to recoil due to the tension which is applied to the top of the riser to prevent the riser from buckling therefore the recoil response of the riser system is a result of the coupling effect of platform tensioner riser and discharge mud a coupling recoil analysis model needs to be established before designing a recoil controller for the deepwater drilling riser system 2 1 tensioner model tensioners are key components in the recoil analysis and control of a drilling riser system as shown in fig 2 a tensioner is mainly composed of high pressure air vessel high pressure accumulator low pressure nitrogen vessel recoil control valve etc the upper end and lower end of the hydraulic cylinder are connected with low pressure nitrogen vessel and high pressure accumulator respectively the pressure difference between the high pressure side and low pressure side of the hydraulic cylinder provides a tension for the riser system in addition the recoil control valve can produce pressure drop which depends on valve opening liquid flow rate etc in order to control the recoil response of the riser system the opening of the recoil control valve should be changed in real time according to the recoil response of the riser system zhang et al 2013a b chen et al 2019 hydraulic oil is often considered as incompressible fluid the pressure at the rod side of hydraulic cylinder is equal to the difference between the pressure of high pressure accumulator and the pressure drop of recoil control valve the pressure at the rod less side of hydraulic cylinder is equal to the pressure of low pressure nitrogen vessel the tension that a hydraulic cylinder can provide at time t is expressed as guimarães pestana et al 2016 wang et al 2018 1 f t p h p pd a r p l a p where p h is the pressure of high pressure air vessel at time t namely the pressure of high pressure accumulator at time t pa p pd is the pressure drop generated by recoil control valve at time t pa when the piston moves upward relative to the hydraulic cylinder the pressure drop is positive and whereas negative a r is the area of piston at rod side m2 p l is the pressure of low pressure nitrogen vessel at time t namely the pressure on the rod less side of the hydraulic cylinder at time t pa a p is the area of piston at rod less side m2 at time t the pressure of high pressure air vessel can be expressed as 2 p η p η 0 v η 0 n v η n where p h0 is the pressure of the high pressure air vessel at the initial time pa v h0 is the volume of high pressure gas at the initial moment m3 n is a constant relative to the properties of gas and its value ranges from 1 0 to 1 4 usually 1 4 v h is the volume of high pressure gas at time t which can be written as 3 v h v h 0 a r x p where x p is the displacement of piston relative to hydraulic cylinder at time t m by substituting eq 3 into eq 2 the pressure of high pressure air vessel at time t can be written as follows 4 p η p η 0 v η 0 n v η 0 a r x p n in a similar way the pressure of low pressure nitrogen vessel at time t can be expressed as 5 p l p l 0 v l 0 n v l 0 a p x p n where p l0 is the pressure of low pressure nitrogen vessel at the initial time pa v l0 is the volume of low pressure gas at the initial time m3 the hydraulic oil flowing through a recoil control valve is regarded as turbulent state the pressure drop generated by the recoil control valve at time t can be expressed as 6 p pd ζ ρ v a 2 2 where ζ is flow resistance coefficient of the recoil control valve ζ is often regarded as a constant since the change in ζ is small ρ is the density of hydraulic oil kg m3 v a is the average flow rate of hydraulic oil through the recoil control valve port at time t m s the average flow rate of hydraulic oil through the recoil control valve port at time t can be expressed by the motion velocity of piston relative to the hydraulic cylinder 7 v a x p a r λ a where x p is the motion velocity of piston relative to hydraulic cylinder at time t m s λ is the opening of recoil control valve at time t a is the maximum flow area of recoil control valve port m2 by substituting eq 7 into eq 6 the pressure drop of recoil control valve at time t can be expressed as 8 p p ⅆ ζ ρ x p 3 a r 2 2 x p λ 2 a 2 by substituting eqs 4 5 and 8 into eq 1 the expression of the tension at time t can be deduced namely the mathematical model of tensioner 9 f t p h 0 v h 0 n a r v h 0 a r x p n p l 0 v l 0 n a p v l 0 a p x p n ζ ρ x p 3 a r 3 2 x p λ 2 a 2 the mathematical model of tensioner shows that there are three factors affecting tension in the riser recoil process the three factors are the piston displacement relative to hydraulic cylinder the piston velocity relative to hydraulic cylinder and the opening of recoil control valve the opening of recoil control valve is directly controlled by external input during riser recoil process the piston displacement relative to hydraulic cylinder and the piston velocity relative to hydraulic cylinder can be indirectly controlled by changing the opening of recoil control valve according to whether a parameter can be directly controlled through external input the expression of tension shown in eq 9 can be divided into two terms p h 0 v h 0 n a r v h 0 a r x p n p l 0 v l 0 n a p v l 0 a p x p n and ζ ρ x p 3 a r 3 2 x p λ 2 a 2 p h 0 v h 0 n a r v h 0 a r x p n p l 0 v l 0 n a p v l 0 a p x p n is a nonlinear term at x p 0 the nonlinear term is expanded by taylor series and the higher order term is often omitted to realize linearization taking ζ ρ x p 3 a r 3 2 x p λ 2 a 2 as an external input item its value can be controlled by changing the opening of the recoil control valve when x p 0 the value range of the external input item is ζ ρ x p 2 a r 3 2 a 2 when x p 0 the value range of the external input item is ζ ρ x p 2 a r 3 2 a 2 to sum up the linearized tension can be expressed as 10 f t p h 0 a r p l 0 a p n p h 0 a r 2 v h 0 n p l 0 a p 2 v l 0 x p ζ ρ x p 3 a r 3 2 x p λ 2 a 2 let c 1 p h 0 a r p l 0 a p c 2 n p h 0 a r 2 v h 0 n p l 0 a p 2 v l 0 u ζ ρ x p 3 a r 3 2 x p λ 2 a 2 the expression of tension can be denoted as 11 f t c 1 c 2 x p u it can be seen from eqs 9 and 11 that p h 0 v h 0 n a r v h 0 a r x p n p l 0 v l 0 n a p v l 0 a p x p n is equivalent to a linear spring ζ ρ x p 3 a r 3 2 x p λ 2 a 2 is an external input with a range of ζ ρ x p 2 a r 3 2 a 2 or ζ ρ x p 2 a r 3 2 a 2 hence the tensioner can be equivalent to a combination of a linear spring and an external input acting in parallel on the top of the riser system 2 2 riser recoil model a drilling riser system is regarded as a slender annulus pipe structure since its length diameter ratio is great it is often simplified to a one dimensional spring mass damping unit with three degrees of freedom based on finite element method and concentrated mass method liu et al 2020 meng et al 2020 the spring mass damping unit is then integrated with tensioner model to establish the coupling recoil analysis model as shown in fig 3 the top yellow part in fig 3 represents a drilling platform and x represents the heave displacement of the drilling platform at time t the spring and external input u between the drilling platform and mass block m 1 represent the linear spring item and the external input item in tensioner model shown in eqs 9 and 11 respectively m 1 m 2 and m 3 are the equivalent mass blocks of the riser system x 1 x 2 and x 3 represent the displacement of each mass block at time t k 1 and k

1 3 riser system and the mass of outer cylinder of slip joint the mass of block m 2 is the sum of the mass of 1 3 riser system the mass of block m 3 is the sum of the mass of 1 3 riser system and the mass of lmrp the equivalent spring stiffness k of the riser system can be expressed as 12 k e a e l where e is the elastic modulus of risers pa a e is the cross sectional area of risers m2 l is the effective length which is half the length of the riser system the equivalent damping d of the riser system can be expressed as 13 d 2 ξ m k where ξ is the damping ratio of the riser system which is assumed to be 0 01 m is the structural mass for calculation kg k is the equivalent spring stiffness of the riser system n m in order to facilitate the establishment of the riser tensioner mathematical model the following assumptions are made 1 displacement the upward direction is positive 2 force the upward direction is positive 3 the platform mass block m 1 mass block m 2 and mass block m 3 are in different independent coordinate systems the coordinate system s origin of the drilling platform is the position of the drilling platform at the initial moment of riser disconnection the coordinate system s origin of mass block m 1 is the position of mass block m 1 at the initial moment of riser disconnection the coordinate system s origin of mass block m 2 is the position of the spring k 1 before its extension the coordinate system s origin of mass block m 3 is the position of the spring k 2 before its extension 4 the expression of tension is still denoted as f t c 1 c 2 x p u c 1 represents the tension at the initial moment of riser disconnection and other symbols have the same meaning as described in eq 11 5 in order to facilitate calculation the force of drilling mud discharge is evenly divided into three mass blocks during drilling mud discharge the action force of seawater and drilling mud is denoted as f w1 f w2 f w3 f m1 f m2 and f m3 respectively according to aforementioned assumptions the initial boundary conditions of riser tensioner system are written as follows x 0 0 x 1 0 0 x 2 0 c 1 m 1 g f b 1 k 1 x 3 0 c 1 m 1 g m 2 g f b 1 f b 2 k 2 where f b1 f b2 and f b3 are the buoyancy of mass blocks m 1 m 2 and m 3 respectively the coupling riser recoil model is established based on newton s second law which can be expressed as 14 c 1 c 2 x 1 x u m 1 g k 1 x 1 x 2 d 1 x 1 x 2 f w 1 f m 1 f b 1 m 1 x 1 k 1 x 1 x 2 d 1 x 1 x 2 m 2 g k 2 x 2 c 1 m 1 g f b 1 k 1 x 3 d 2 x 2 x 3 f w 2 f m 2 f b 2 m 2 x 2 k 2 x 2 c 1 m 1 g f b 1 k 1 x 3 d 2 x 2 x 3 m 3 g f w 3 f m 3 f b 3 m 3 x 3 the action force of seawater and drilling mud on risers f w1 f w2 f w3 f m1 f m2 and f m3 in eq 14 have not been determined the action force on risers needs to be solved by drilling mud discharge models at present drilling mud discharge models mainly include slug fluid model whole fluid column model computational fluid dynamics cfd model etc grønevik 2013 li et al 2016 the whole fluid column model is selected for the calculation of drilling mud discharge due to its high calculation accuracy and efficiency wang et al 2020 the whole fluid column model is expressed as 15 ρ w g a s i z ρ m g a s l r i z 2 f w a s d ⅇ ρ w v 2 i z 2 f m a s d ⅇ ρ m v 2 l r i z ρ w g a s l r 1 2 ρ m a s v w 2 ρ w a s i z ρ m a s l r i z a l where ρ w is the density of seawater kg m3 i r is the length of seawater section at time t m ρ m is the density of drilling mud kg m3 l r is the length of riser m f w and f m are friction coefficients of sea water and drilling mud respectively the friction coefficients are often taken as constants d e is hydraulic diameter of the riser system m a s is hydraulic area of the riser m2 v is the velocity of fluid relative to risers at time t m s

a transient process the recoil control of the riser system needs to be completed within a short time after an emergency disconnection the riser system is hoped to enter the stable state as quickly and smoothly as possible through the recoil control the following control strategy is proposed to control riser recoil response 1 optimal control theory is used for the riser recoil control during the first phase of riser recoil response 2 the errors between motion state and ideal equilibrium state of mass blocks m 1 m 2 and m 3 are taken as control objective the control objective is to make the

representative optimal control theory lqr control algorithm is introduced to design the recoil controller for the riser system the purpose of lqr control algorithm is to find u 1 in eq 20 to minimize the objective function the objective function can be expressed as 21 j u 1 1 2 0 e τ q 1 t e u 1 τ q 2 t u 1 d t where e is the difference between system state and equilibrium state at the current moment q 1 and q 2 are weight matrix of state variables and weight coefficient of controller input variables respectively q 1 and q 2 are generally set in advance according to experience the values of q 1 and q 2 are shown as follows q 1 1 e 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 e 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 e 8 q 2 0 0000001 in matrix q 1 1e4 in the first row is designed to limit the riser recoil displacement at the equilibrium state 1e6 in the fourth row and 1e8 in the sixth row are set to ensure that the riser system will not be compressed in recoil response according to the optimal control theory control input u 1 can be expressed as 22 u 1 g 1 g 2 g 3 g 4 g 5 g 6 z x 1 z v 1 z x 2 z v 2 z x 3 z v 3 where the gain matrix g is calculated as follows 23 g q 2 1 b t s the matrix s is solved by the riccati equation 24 a t s s a s b q 2 1 b t s q 1 0 once the gain matrix g is calculated based on eqs 23 and 24 the objective function j u 1 shown in eq 21 can be achieved however the opening and pressure drop of recoil control valve are physically limited optimal control input u 1 may not be realized in actual riser recoil control system the following constraints are proposed to ensure that the input can be realized by the recoil control valve u 0 x 1 x 0 u ζ ρ x p 2 a r 3 2 λ 2 a 2 the pressure drop of riser recoil control valve is predominantly positive during the first riser recoil stage the constraints u 0 x 1 x 0 can guarantee the simulation of the ideal input for as long as possible the constraint u ζ ρ x p 2 a r 3 2 λ 2 a 2 can ensure that the opening of recoil control valve port does not exceed the physical limit considering the maximum opening of recoil control valve port is 1 when the constraints are not satisfied the recoil control valve is fully open once the input u is determined the opening of recoil control valve can be derived according to the relationship between valve opening and the input u the general expression of input u can be obtained as u ζ ρ x p 3 a r 3 2 x p λ 2 a 2 correspondingly the general expression of recoil control valve opening can be expressed as λ ζ ρ x p 3 a r 3 2 x p a 2 u to sum up the designed riser recoil controller based on lqr is listed in table 1 4 simulation models a riser recoil simulation model is established in simulink based on the established riser recoil analysis model and riser recoil control model as shown in figs 4 and 5 the riser recoil simulation model mainly includes riser recoil response analysis module drilling mud discharge module and controller module among them the drilling mud discharge module interactively work with the riser recoil response analysis module the riser velocity calculated by riser recoil response analysis module is transferred to drilling mud discharge module for calculating drilling mud discharge the velocity of the drilling mud relative to the riser is used to calculate the friction force of seawater and drilling mud on the riser the force of drilling mud discharge calculated by drilling mud discharge module is then transferred to riser recoil response analysis module for analyzing recoil response the controller module changes the opening of recoil control valve in real time according to the riser recoil response the runge kutta method is chosen for the riser recoil analysis the max step size of simulation is 0 001s the relative tolerance is 1e 5 riser recoil model without controller has been simulated by previous researchers newmark β integral method was often chosen for riser recoil simulation meng et al 2020 in order to the verify the correctness of established simulation model riser recoil response is analyzed by newmark β integral method and runge kutta method and compared with each other as shown in fig 6 it turns out that the riser recoil response by different solving methods is basically the same 5 results and discussions a drilling riser system with a length of 1000m is selected for riser recoil simulation the top tension force of the riser system is 3 53 mn at the initial disconnection moment the heave motion of platform is assumed to be a sinusoidal motion with an amplitude of 0 5m and a period of 5s parameters used to calculate drilling mud discharge are listed in table 2 parameters of the riser system are listed in table 3 there are often six tensioners connecting the riser system with platform table 4 lists parameters of a tensioner the riser tension is equal to 6 times provided tension of a tensioner the controllability of the presented state space expression shown in eq 20 is firstly determined according to the rank of discriminant matrix b ab a 2 b a 3 b a 4 b a 5 b if the rank of the discriminant matrix is equal to six the state space expression is controllable it turns out that the state space expression is controllable based on basic parameters the riser recoil response can be controlled through designed riser recoil controller recoil response of the riser system is then analyzed in the case of no controller and with controller and compared with each other the riser recoil displacement of each equivalent mass block and the opening of the recoil control valve are shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively the elongation of springs k 1 and k 2 shown in fig 3 during riser recoil response with controller is shown in fig 9 fig 7 shows that the riser system disconnects in the bottom at the moment of zero once the riser system is disconnected in the bottom the riser system begins to recoil under the influence of the top tension force the recoil response of three mass blocks is basically consistent as shown in fig 7 a b and 7 c besides the average height of riser recoil vibration increases gradually and then keeps constant the main reason is that the discharge drilling mud applies a large downward force on riser system in the initial disconnection stage seawater enters the riser through the refill valve which is recommended to be fully open the seawater also discharges with drilling mud and applies a downward force on the riser system the downward force then decreases since the drilling mud discharge will gradually complete with the increase of time the average height of riser recoil vibration will gradually increase as the downward force decreases the riser system finally reaches an equilibrium position when the drilling mud discharges completely fig 8 shows that the riser recoil control valve is fully opened in the initial stage the riser recoil control is not activated in this stage since the riser recoil response is little when the riser recoil velocity is faster than platform velocity that is x 1 x 0 the riser recoil control is activated and the opening of the riser recoil control valve begins to decrease as shown in fig 8 the decreasing opening of riser recoil control valve produce an increasing pressure drop to control the recoil response of the riser system the riser recoil response is controlled by a real time adjustment of riser recoil control valve opening in the whole process of riser recoil control the comparison between the riser recoil responses with and without controller is also shown in fig 7 it turns out that the recoil peak of the riser system with recoil controller decreases while the recoil valley increases the peak value of riser recoil response is decreased by about 3 2m which can reduce the risk of exceeding the slip joint stroke during riser recoil process the valley value of riser recoil response is increased by about 2 4m which can avoid the collision between lmrp and bop besides fig 9 shows that elongations of spring k 1 and k 2 are both larger than zero which means that the riser system is not compressed during riser recoil response the set parameters in q 1 shown in eq 21 can effectively avoid riser axial compression during riser recoil response on the whole the riser recoil response with controller is obviously less than that without controller the recoil response of the riser system can be controlled effectively through the designed recoil controller 6 conclusions in this paper a challenge problem has been addressed the recoil control of deepwater drilling riser system a riser recoil model is established considering the coupling effect of platform tensioner riser and discharging drilling mud a riser control method is then proposed based on

theory lqr control algorithm 1 introduction deepwater drilling riser system is key equipment connecting subsea wellhead and drilling platform normally the drilling riser system connects drilling platform with subsea wellhead to form an integrated drilling channel however the connected drilling riser system should disconnect in the bottom to guarantee the safety of the whole drilling riser system under dangerous conditions such as typhoon and the loss of dynamic positioning system liu et al 2013 2016 once the drilling riser is disconnected in the bottom the drilling riser system rapidly moves upward under the influence of tension the rapid riser movement after the disconnection is often called recoil in offshore oil and gas engineering the riser recoil can cause the drilling riser system failure such as the top response of the riser system exceeding the slip joint stroke and the lower marine riser package lmrp colliding with the subsea blowout preventer bop chang et al 2018 nie et al 2019 recoil of deepwater drilling riser system is a problem to be solved in offshore oil and gas engineering the riser recoil research can go back 1990s young et al 1992a b analyzed the causes and potential hazards of riser recoil response and simulated the recoil response of riser using risten program puccio et al 1998 analyzed some of the significant variables affecting the velocity and displacement of the riser string and lmrp during an emergency disconnect sequence stahl et al 2004 conducted riser recoil analysis to determine appropriate tension settings and operating limits the recoil analysis showed that avoiding the collision between lmrp and bop and preventing the relaxation of tensioning rope govern the selection of top tension settings and the maximum sea state in which the riser could remain connected lang et al 2009 developed a disconnect and recoil analysis software tool that for the first time has been integrated with a 3d finite element fe structural model of the drilling riser system grytoyr et al 2009 2010 2011 presented a methodology for the dynamic analysis of marine riser disconnect and recoil using general purpose riser fea programs the methodology was applied to an elastic riser model in the riser analysis software riflex for recoil analysis of drilling completion and workover risers li et al 2012 discussed the effect of mud shedding on riser recoil response based on herschel bulkley rheology model ma et al 2013 conducted riser recoil analysis during and immediately following an emergency disconnect the influence of riser stack up drilling mud density water depths and associated top tensions are studied recently some researchers focused on the effect of mud discharge on riser recoil behavior meng et al 2018 su et al 2018 wang and gao 2019 wang et al 2020 summarized various mud discharge models and determined the application condition of each mud discharge model meng et al 2020 established a fully coupled integrated model between riser and discharge mud for recoil analysis it turned out that the recoil response of the riser can be affected by discharge mud remarkably however previous studies mainly focus on riser recoil analysis there are few researches on riser recoil control he et al 2016 conducted modeling and simulation for recoil control system of deepwater drilling riser a control method of using fuzzy pid controller is proposed to control the vertical displacement of the riser system it is of great significance to further conduct riser recoil control study based on existing riser recoil analysis achievements the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 establishes riser recoil model section 3 designs a controller which can adjust the opening of recoil control valve in real time according to the recoil response of the riser system based on optimal control theory and linear quadratic regulator lqr control algorithm section 4 presents simulation models for riser recoil analysis section 5 conducts riser recoil analysis with controller and without controller and compared with each other section 6 provides the conclusion 2 riser recoil model the emergency disconnection of a drilling riser system is shown in fig 1 in the event of an emergency disconnection the connector between bop and lmrp should be unlocked the drilling mud inside riser then discharges and seawater enters the riser through the refill valve the riser system begins to recoil due to the tension which is applied to the top of the riser to prevent the riser from buckling therefore the recoil response of the riser system is a result of the coupling effect of platform tensioner riser and discharge mud a coupling recoil analysis model needs to be established before designing a recoil controller for the deepwater drilling riser system 2 1 tensioner model tensioners are key components in the recoil analysis and control of a drilling riser system as shown in fig 2 a tensioner is mainly composed of high pressure air vessel high pressure accumulator low pressure nitrogen vessel recoil control valve etc the upper end and lower end of the hydraulic cylinder are connected with low pressure nitrogen vessel and high pressure accumulator respectively the pressure difference between the high pressure side and low pressure side of the hydraulic cylinder provides a tension for the riser system in addition the recoil control valve can produce pressure drop which depends on valve opening liquid flow rate etc in order to control the recoil response of the riser system the opening of the recoil control valve should be changed in real time according to the recoil response of the riser system zhang et al 2013a b chen et al 2019 hydraulic oil is often considered as incompressible fluid the pressure at the rod side of hydraulic cylinder is equal to the difference between the pressure of high pressure accumulator and the pressure drop of recoil control valve the pressure at the rod less side of hydraulic cylinder is equal to the pressure of low pressure nitrogen vessel the tension that a hydraulic cylinder can provide at time t is expressed as guimarães pestana et al 2016 wang et al 2018 1 f t p h p pd a r p l a p where p h is the pressure of high pressure air vessel at time t namely the pressure of high pressure accumulator at time t pa p pd is the pressure drop generated by recoil control valve at time t pa when the piston moves upward relative to the hydraulic cylinder the pressure drop is positive and whereas negative a r is the area of piston at rod side m2 p l is the pressure of low pressure nitrogen vessel at time t namely the pressure on the rod less side of the hydraulic cylinder at time t pa a p is the area of piston at rod less side m2 at time t the pressure of high pressure air vessel can be expressed as 2 p η p η 0 v η 0 n v η n where p h0 is the pressure of the high pressure air vessel at the initial time pa v h0 is the volume of high pressure gas at the initial moment m3 n is a constant relative to the properties of gas and its value ranges from 1 0 to 1 4 usually 1 4 v h is the volume of high pressure gas at time t which can be written as 3 v h v h 0 a r x p where x p is the displacement of piston relative to hydraulic cylinder at time t m by substituting eq 3 into eq 2 the pressure of high pressure air vessel at time t can be written as follows 4 p η p η 0 v η 0 n v η 0 a r x p n in a similar way the pressure of low pressure nitrogen vessel at time t can be expressed as 5 p l p l 0 v l 0 n v l 0 a p x p n where p l0 is the pressure of low pressure nitrogen vessel at the initial time pa v l0 is the volume of low pressure gas at the initial time m3 the hydraulic oil flowing through a recoil control valve is regarded as turbulent state the pressure drop generated by the recoil control valve at time t can be expressed as 6 p pd ζ ρ v a 2 2 where ζ is flow resistance coefficient of the recoil control valve ζ is often regarded as a constant since the change in ζ is small ρ is the density of hydraulic oil kg m3 v a is the average flow rate of hydraulic oil through the recoil control valve port at time t m s the average flow rate of hydraulic oil through the recoil control valve port at time t can be expressed by the motion velocity of piston relative to the hydraulic cylinder 7 v a x p a r λ a where x p is the motion velocity of piston relative to hydraulic cylinder at time t m s λ is the opening of recoil control valve at time t a is the maximum flow area of recoil control valve port m2 by substituting eq 7 into eq 6 the pressure drop of recoil control valve at time t can be expressed as 8 p p ⅆ ζ ρ x p 3 a r 2 2 x p λ 2 a 2 by substituting eqs 4 5 and 8 into eq 1 the expression of the tension at time t can be deduced namely the mathematical model of tensioner 9 f t p h 0 v h 0 n a r v h 0 a r x p n p l 0 v l 0 n a p v l 0 a p x p n ζ ρ x p 3 a r 3 2 x p λ 2 a 2 the mathematical model of tensioner shows that there are three factors affecting tension in the riser recoil process the three factors are the piston displacement relative to hydraulic cylinder the piston velocity relative to hydraulic cylinder and the opening of recoil control valve the opening of recoil control valve is directly controlled by external input during riser recoil process the piston displacement relative to hydraulic cylinder and the piston velocity relative to hydraulic cylinder can be indirectly controlled by changing the opening of recoil control valve according to whether a parameter can be directly controlled through external input the expression of tension shown in eq 9 can be divided into two terms p h 0 v h 0 n a r v h 0 a r x p n p l 0 v l 0 n a p v l 0 a p x p n and ζ ρ x p 3 a r 3 2 x p λ 2 a 2 p h 0 v h 0 n a r v h 0 a r x p n p l 0 v l 0 n a p v l 0 a p x p n is a nonlinear term at x p 0 the nonlinear term is expanded by taylor series and the higher order term is often omitted to realize linearization taking ζ ρ x p 3 a r 3 2 x p λ 2 a 2 as an external input item its value can be controlled by changing the opening of the recoil control valve when x p 0 the value range of the external input item is ζ ρ x p 2 a r 3 2 a 2 when x p 0 the value range of the external input item is ζ ρ x p 2 a r 3 2 a 2 to sum up the linearized tension can be expressed as 10 f t p h 0 a r p l 0 a p n p h 0 a r 2 v h 0 n p l 0 a p 2 v l 0 x p ζ ρ x p 3 a r 3 2 x p λ 2 a 2 let c 1 p h 0 a r p l 0 a p c 2 n p h 0 a r 2 v h 0 n p l 0 a p 2 v l 0 u ζ ρ x p 3 a r 3 2 x p λ 2 a 2 the expression of tension can be denoted as 11 f t c 1 c 2 x p u it can be seen from eqs 9 and 11 that p h 0 v h 0 n a r v h 0 a r x p n p l 0 v l 0 n a p v l 0 a p x p n is equivalent to a linear spring ζ ρ x p 3 a r 3 2 x p λ 2 a 2 is an external input with a range of ζ ρ x p 2 a r 3 2 a 2 or ζ ρ x p 2 a r 3 2 a 2 hence the tensioner can be equivalent to a combination of a linear spring and an external input acting in parallel on the top of the riser system 2 2 riser recoil model a drilling riser system is regarded as a slender annulus pipe structure since its length diameter ratio is great it is often simplified to a one dimensional spring mass damping unit with three degrees of freedom based on finite element method and concentrated mass method liu et al 2020 meng et al 2020 the spring mass damping unit is then integrated with tensioner model to establish the coupling recoil analysis model as shown in fig 3 the top yellow part in fig 3 represents a drilling platform and x represents the heave displacement of the drilling platform at time t the spring and external input u between the drilling platform and mass block m 1 represent the linear spring item and the external input item in tensioner model shown in eqs 9 and 11 respectively m 1 m 2 and m 3 are the equivalent mass blocks of the riser system x 1 x 2 and x 3 represent the displacement of each mass block at time t k 1 and k 2 are equivalent spring stiffness of the riser system while d 1 and d 2 are equivalent damping of the riser system according to concentrated mass method the mass of block m 1 is the sum of the mass of 1 3 riser system and the mass of outer cylinder of slip joint the mass of block m 2 is the sum of the mass of 1 3 riser system the mass of block m 3 is the sum of the mass of 1 3 riser system and the mass of lmrp the equivalent spring stiffness k of the riser system can be expressed as 12 k e a e l where e is the elastic modulus of risers pa a e is the cross sectional area of risers m2 l is the effective length which is half the length of the riser system the equivalent damping d of the riser system can be expressed as 13 d 2 ξ m k where ξ is the damping ratio of the riser system which is assumed to be 0 01 m is the structural mass for calculation kg k is the equivalent spring stiffness of the riser system n m in order to facilitate the establishment of the riser tensioner mathematical model the following assumptions are made 1 displacement the upward direction is positive 2 force the upward direction is positive 3 the platform mass block m 1 mass block m 2 and mass block m 3 are in different independent coordinate systems the coordinate system s origin of the drilling platform is the position of the drilling platform at the initial moment of riser disconnection the coordinate system s origin of mass block m 1 is the position of mass block m 1 at the initial moment of riser disconnection the coordinate system s origin of mass block m 2 is the position of the spring k 1 before its extension the coordinate system s origin of mass block m 3 is the position of the spring k 2 before its extension 4 the expression of tension is still denoted as f t c 1 c 2 x p u c 1 represents the tension at the initial moment of riser disconnection and other symbols have the same meaning as described in eq 11 5 in order to facilitate calculation the force of drilling mud discharge is evenly divided into three mass blocks during drilling mud discharge the action force of seawater and drilling mud is denoted as f w1 f w2 f w3 f m1 f m2 and f m3 respectively according to aforementioned assumptions the initial boundary conditions of riser tensioner system are written as follows x 0 0 x 1 0 0 x 2 0 c 1 m 1 g f b 1 k 1 x 3 0 c 1 m 1 g m 2 g f b 1 f b 2 k 2 where f b1 f b2 and f b3 are the buoyancy of mass blocks m 1 m 2 and m 3 respectively the coupling riser recoil model is established based on newton s second law which can be expressed as 14 c 1 c 2 x 1 x u m 1 g k 1 x 1 x 2 d 1 x 1 x 2 f w 1 f m 1 f b 1 m 1 x 1 k 1 x 1 x 2 d 1 x 1 x 2 m 2 g k 2 x 2 c 1 m 1 g f b 1 k 1 x 3 d 2 x 2 x 3 f w 2 f m 2 f b 2 m 2 x 2 k 2 x 2 c 1 m 1 g f b 1 k 1 x 3 d 2 x 2 x 3 m 3 g f w 3 f m 3 f b 3 m 3 x 3 the action force of seawater and drilling mud on risers f w1 f w2 f w3 f m1 f m2 and f m3 in eq 14 have not been determined the action force on risers needs to be solved by drilling mud discharge models at present drilling mud discharge models mainly include slug fluid model whole fluid column model computational fluid dynamics cfd model etc grønevik 2013 li et al 2016 the whole fluid column model is selected for the calculation of drilling mud discharge due to its high calculation accuracy and efficiency wang et al 2020 the whole fluid column model is expressed as 15 ρ w g a s i z ρ m g a s l r i z 2 f w a s d ⅇ ρ w v 2 i z 2 f m a s d ⅇ ρ m v 2 l r i z ρ w g a s l r 1 2 ρ m a s v w 2 ρ w a s i z ρ m a s l r i z a l where ρ w is the density of seawater kg m3 i r is the length of seawater section at time t m ρ m is the density of drilling mud kg m3 l r is the length of riser m f w and f m are friction coefficients of sea water and drilling mud respectively the friction coefficients are often taken as constants d e is hydraulic diameter of the riser system m a s is hydraulic area of the riser m2 v is the velocity of fluid relative to risers at time t m s v w is the discharge velocity of drilling mud at time t m s a l is the acceleration of fluid at time t m s2 finally the action force of seawater and drilling mud on risers f w1 f w2 f w3 f m1 f m2 and f m3 can be calculated based on the solution of whole fluid column model which are written as 16 f w 1 f w 2 f w 3 1 3 2 f w a e d e ρ w v 2 i z f m 1 f m 2 f m 3 1 3 2 f m a e d e ρ m v 2 l r i z 3

a transient process the recoil control of the riser system needs to be completed within a short time after an emergency disconnection the riser system is hoped to enter the stable state as quickly and smoothly as possible through the recoil control the following control strategy is proposed to control riser recoil response 1 optimal control theory is used for the riser recoil control during the first phase of riser recoil response 2 the errors between motion state and ideal equilibrium state of mass blocks m 1 m 2 and m 3 are taken as control objective the control objective is to make the

representative optimal control theory lqr control algorithm is introduced to design the recoil controller for the riser system the purpose of lqr control algorithm is to find u 1 in eq 20 to minimize the objective function the objective function can be expressed as 21 j u 1 1 2 0 e τ q 1 t e u 1 τ q 2 t u 1 d t where e is the difference between system state and equilibrium state at the current moment q 1 and q 2 are weight matrix of state variables and weight coefficient of controller input variables respectively q 1 and q 2 are generally set in advance according to experience the values of q 1 and q 2 are shown as follows q 1 1 e 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 e 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 e 8 q 2 0 0000001 in matrix q 1 1e4 in the first row is designed to limit the riser recoil displacement at the equilibrium state 1e6 in the fourth row and 1e8 in the sixth row are set to ensure that the riser system will not be compressed in recoil response according to the optimal control theory control input u 1 can be expressed as 22 u 1 g 1 g 2 g 3 g 4 g 5 g 6 z x 1 z v 1 z x 2 z v 2 z x 3 z v 3 where the gain matrix g is calculated as follows 23 g q 2 1 b t s the matrix s is solved by the riccati equation 24 a t s s a s b q 2 1 b t s q 1 0 once the gain matrix g is calculated based on eqs 23 and 24 the objective function j u 1 shown in eq 21 can be achieved however the opening and pressure drop of recoil control valve are physically limited optimal control input u 1 may not be realized in actual riser recoil control system the following constraints are proposed to ensure that the input can be realized by the recoil control valve u 0 x 1 x 0 u ζ ρ x p 2 a r 3 2 λ 2 a 2 the pressure drop of riser recoil control valve is predominantly positive during the first riser recoil stage the constraints u 0 x 1 x 0 can guarantee the simulation of the ideal input for as long as possible the constraint u ζ ρ x p 2 a r 3 2 λ 2 a 2 can ensure that the opening of recoil control valve port does not exceed the physical limit considering the maximum opening of recoil control valve port is 1 when the constraints are not satisfied the recoil control valve is fully open once the input u is determined the opening of recoil control valve can be derived according to the relationship between valve opening and the input u the general expression of input u can be obtained as u ζ ρ x p 3 a r 3 2 x p λ 2 a 2 correspondingly the general expression of recoil control valve opening can be expressed as λ ζ ρ x p 3 a r 3 2 x p a 2 u to sum up the designed riser recoil controller based on lqr is listed in table 1 4 simulation models a riser recoil simulation model is established in simulink based on the established riser recoil analysis model and riser recoil control model as shown in figs 4 and 5 the riser recoil simulation model mainly includes riser recoil response analysis module drilling mud discharge module and controller module among them the drilling mud discharge module interactively work with the riser recoil response analysis module the riser velocity calculated by riser recoil response analysis module is transferred to drilling mud discharge module for calculating drilling mud discharge the velocity of the drilling mud relative to the riser is used to calculate the friction force of seawater and drilling mud on the riser the force of drilling mud discharge calculated by drilling mud discharge module is then transferred to riser recoil response analysis module for analyzing recoil response the controller module changes the opening of recoil control valve in real time according to the riser recoil response the runge kutta method is chosen for the riser recoil analysis the max step size of simulation is 0 001s the relative tolerance is 1e 5 riser recoil model without controller has been simulated by previous researchers newmark β integral method was often chosen for riser recoil simulation meng et al 2020 in order to the verify the correctness of established simulation model riser recoil response is analyzed by newmark β integral method and runge kutta method and compared with each other as shown in fig 6 it turns out that the riser recoil response by different solving methods is basically the same 5 results and discussions a drilling riser system with a length of 1000m is selected for riser recoil simulation the top tension force of the riser system is 3 53 mn at the initial disconnection moment the heave motion of platform is assumed to be a sinusoidal motion with an amplitude of 0 5m and a period of 5s parameters used to calculate drilling mud discharge are listed in table 2 parameters of the riser system are listed in table 3 there are often six tensioners connecting the riser system with platform table 4 lists parameters of a tensioner the riser tension is equal to 6 times provided tension of a tensioner the controllability of the presented state space expression shown in eq 20 is firstly determined according to the rank of discriminant matrix b ab a 2 b a 3 b a 4 b a 5 b if the rank of the discriminant matrix is equal to six the state space expression is controllable it turns out that the state space expression is controllable based on basic parameters the riser recoil response can be controlled through designed riser recoil controller recoil response of the riser system is then analyzed in the case of no controller and with controller and compared with each other the riser recoil displacement of each equivalent mass block and the opening of the recoil control valve are shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively the elongation of springs k 1 and k 2 shown in fig 3 during riser recoil response with controller is shown in fig 9 fig 7 shows that the riser system disconnects in the bottom at the moment of zero once the riser system is disconnected in the bottom the riser system begins to recoil under the influence of the top tension force the recoil response of three mass blocks is basically consistent as shown in fig 7 a b and 7 c besides the average height of riser recoil vibration increases gradually and then keeps constant the main reason is that the discharge drilling mud applies a large downward force on riser system in the initial disconnection stage seawater enters the riser through the refill valve which is recommended to be fully open the seawater also discharges with drilling mud and applies a downward force on the riser system the downward force then decreases since the drilling mud discharge will gradually complete with the increase of time the average height of riser recoil vibration will gradually increase as the downward force decreases the riser system finally reaches an equilibrium position when the drilling mud discharges completely fig 8 shows that the riser recoil control valve is fully opened in the initial stage the riser recoil control is not activated in this stage since the riser recoil response is little when the riser recoil velocity is faster than platform velocity that is x 1 x 0 the riser recoil control is activated and the opening of the riser recoil control valve begins to decrease as shown in fig 8 the decreasing opening of riser recoil control valve produce an increasing pressure drop to control the recoil response of the riser system the riser recoil response is controlled by a real time adjustment of riser recoil control valve opening in the whole process of riser recoil control the comparison between the riser recoil responses with and without controller is also shown in fig 7 it turns out that the recoil peak of the riser system with recoil controller decreases while the recoil valley increases the peak value of riser recoil response is decreased by about 3 2m which can reduce the risk of exceeding the slip joint stroke during riser recoil process the valley value of riser recoil response is increased by about 2 4m which can avoid the collision between lmrp and bop besides fig 9 shows that elongations of spring k 1 and k 2 are both larger than zero which means that the riser system is not compressed during riser recoil response the set parameters in q 1 shown in eq 21 can effectively avoid riser axial compression during riser recoil response on the whole the riser recoil response with controller is obviously less than that without controller the recoil response of the riser system can be controlled effectively through the designed recoil controller 6 conclusions in this paper a challenge problem has been addressed the recoil control of deepwater

21194,environmental conditions along a very large floating bridge are inhomogeneous due to complex topography and hydrography evaluating the inhomogeneity in environment conditions is important for safety design of floating bridges but challenging because of their large size this study addresses the assessment of long term spatial inhomogeneity in wind and wave parameters for environmental conditions in a norwegian fjord for design of floating bridges based on 16 year hindcast data the wind and wave data are numerically simulated by using the weather research and forecasting wrf model and simulating waves nearshore swan model respectively the accuracy of hindcast wave data is validated by comparison against field measurements inhomogeneity in wind and wave parameters are revealed by contour maps by considering two dominant wave directions significant wave height and peak period are fairly close in the south part and decrease gradually towards the north end mean wave direction decreases from south end to north end mean wind speed has a relatively small variation in the south part and a great variation in the north part so do the mean wind direction correlation of wind and wave parameters along a potential bridge route is analyzed wind parameters are less correlated than the wave parameters keywords inhomogeneity wind and wave hindcast data correlation floating bridges 1 introduction a floating bridge is a very large floating structure vlfs constructed for the purpose of providing passage over wide and deep straits and fjords or over waters with very soft seabeds in these waters building a traditional bridge with fixed supports is usually very expensive while a floating bridge is a promising alternative floating bridges feature up to several kilometers long in size and are usually deployed in coastal regions compared to marine and offshore structures that are deployed in the open sea e g offshore oil and gas platform offshore wind turbines and other vlfss such as mobile offshore base mob and megafloats floating bridges have a much larger size and are more flexible with a large number of eigenmodes cheng et al 2018a these eigenmodes can be excited by environmental loads threatening the structural integrity and safety besides since floating bridges are usually located in the coastal region with complex topography and hydrography they suffer more complex environmental conditions these environmental conditions can also vary along the very long bridge route i e environmental conditions are inhomogeneous during the design of marine and offshore structures environmental conditions are usually assumed to be homogeneous in short term to facilitate the design a wave field is homogeneous when the wave spectra and directional spectra at each point are identical and the wave elevations among any two points are coherent i e each frequency component of the wave elevation have a constant phase difference similarly a wind field is homogeneous when the wind spectra and directional spectra at the same height are identical and wind speed among any two points in the space are coherent for marine and offshore structures that are deployed in the open sea and with a relatively small size the assumption of homogeneous environmental conditions is reasonable however for floating bridges that are up to several kilometers long such assumption might lead to great underestimation of structural responses and thus threaten the structural safety cheng et al 2018b investigated the inhomogeneous wave load effects on a 4600 m long curved floating bridge and revealed that inhomogeneous wave conditions can cause much larger structural response especially the weak axis bending moment than the homogeneous wave conditions therefore the inhomogeneity in environmental conditions should be properly evaluated for the structural safety design of very long floating bridges environmental conditions and associated inhomogeneities in straits and fjords can be assessed by carrying out field measurements or numerical simulations field measurements of wave condition e g by wave buoy cheng et al 2019a and wind condition e g by anemometer and lidar cheynet et al 2017 can usually provide local environmental conditions for a several km long floating bridge field measurement of wind and wave conditions requires a large number of measurement devices in order to capture the inhomogeneity in the environmental conditions therefore field measurements are not an economical approach to determine the inhomogeneity alternatively numerical simulations are more promising to simulate environmental conditions in straits and fjords macro scale numerical simulations based on phase averaged approaches are desirable from computational efficiency point of view in coastal regions the swan simulating waves nearshore model booij et al 1999 is usually used to simulate the complex wave transformation caused by the bathymetry wind and other factors this model is based on phase averaged energy balance equation and has been employed to simulate waves in the outer rio de la plata estuary dragani et al 2008 and the bjørnafjord lothe and musch 2015 with respect to the local wind conditions it is usually modelled by the weather research and forecasting wrf model skamarock et al 2008 which is a numerical weather prediction nwp system designed to serve both atmospheric research and operational forecasting needs based on macro scale simulation results mid scale simulations can be conducted to model the wind and wave propagation in details these simulations for waves usually use phase resolved approaches such as nonlinear potential flow based method e g engsig karup et al 2012 navier stokes equation based method e g wang et al 2017 oceanwave3d engsig karup et al 2012 developed by dtu is a potential flow modeling tool which accounts for large scale fully nonlinear and dispersive free surface wave modeling it has been used to simulate wave propagation in coastal regions wang et al 2017 carried out a large scale cfd computational fluid dynamics modeling of wave propagation in sulafjord for the coastal highway e39 project of norway simulation results from swan were used as inputs to the cfd simulations besides various model equations based on vertical averaging of the flow or and perturbation analyses have also been applied to model wave propagation such as e g boussinesq type equations madsen et al 2002 and green naghdi equations green and naghdi 1976 and nonlinear variants of multimodal coupled mode equations however all these phase resolved methods are usually more computational demanding than the phase averaged methods the wind and wave data used in the present study were thus simulated by using phase averaged methods in the short term description of wind and waves normally wind in 10 min and waves in 3 h are considered as stationary when describing the combined wind and wave condition a compromise is usually a duration of 1 h for both wind and waves such compromise is also adopted in the present study in this study the inhomogeneity in the environmental conditions wind and waves in a norwegian fjord i e the bjørnafjord is evaluated based on numerically simulated wind and wave data over about 16 years the long term joint distribution of wind and wave conditions in this fjord has been established by cheng et al 2019b based on simulated data at one location in the fjord the inhomogeneity in wind and wave conditions in this fjord is not studied yet but it is of significant importance to the safety design of floating bridges it should be noted that in general the inhomogeneity of wind and wave conditions in a fjord consists of both long term variation e g distribution of significant wave height of the wind and wave parameters in the fjord and the short term variation e g the wave spectra and the cross spectra for the waves at different locations in the fjord in this paper we only address the long term spatial inhomogeneity of the wind and wave parameters since the phase averaged hindcast data were used 2 data description the fjord considered in this study is the bjørnafjord located at the hordaland county norway it is about 4600 m wide and more than 500 m deep the location and topography of the fjord are shown in fig 1 the local bathymetry of the fjord is illustrated in fig 2 a floating bridge is planned to be built to cross the fjord by the norwegian public roads administration npra to achieve a safe reliable and cost effective design of floating bridge the environmental condition in the fjord should be properly assessed both numerical simulations and field measurements have been carried out to characterize the environmental condition in the fjord these environmental data has been described in detail in cheng et al 2019a and cheng et al 2019b in this section relevant environmental data is briefly described to better illustrate the results in this study 2 1 numerical simulations of wind and wave conditions the wave condition in the fjord is simulated by using the swan simulating waves nearshore model booij et al 1999 a third generation wave model the model is a phase averaged model based on the wave action balance equation and solves the action density balance equation in time geographical and spectral space therefore it can provide wave frequency spectrum and directional spectrum and relevant wave parameters such as significant wave height peak period and mean direction etc the swan model has been widely used to simulate realistic estimates of wave parameters in coastal areas lakes estuaries from given wind bottom and current conditions it can simulate both wind generated waves and swells but in this study only wind generated waves are simulated for the fjord because the swell is very small cheng et al 2019a a total of 296 373 grid points with a spacing of approximately 150 m are equally distributed in the area with latitude ranging from 59 85 to 60 2483 and longitude ranging from 4 8 to 5 797 the wind condition in the fjord is simulated by using the wrf weather research and forecasting model skamarock et al 2008 a next generation mesoscale numerical weather prediction system designed for both atmospheric research and operational forecasting applications the model solves the compressible nonhydrostatic euler equations in time and geographical space and provides the mean wind speed at 10 m height for each grid point in the latitude and longitude directions in this study a total of 138 180 with a spacing of about 500 m are equally distributed for simulating mean wind speed a close up view of the grid points for simulating wind and wave conditions around the potential bridge site is shown in fig 1 numerical simulation of wind and wave conditions are based on hindcast data from january 2002 to june 2017 wind and wave parameters are stored in every hour including significant wave height peak period mean direction and mean wind speed in latitude and longitude directions 2 2 field measurements of wave conditions three datawell waveriders dwrs were deployed to measure the wave conditions in the fjord by recording the heave north and west displacements of the buoy the measurements have been carried out since february 2016 cheng et al 2019a analyzed the measured wave data from february 2016 to october 2017 and revealed that the waves in the fjord are short crested and mainly wind generated waves with a relatively large significant wave height h s 0 3 m are likely to have one dominant direction while small waves are likely to have multiple dominant directions in this study a total of about 33 months from february 2016 to october 2018 of measured raw data is used the measured raw data are recorded and stored in 30 min samples with a frequency of 1 28 hz to make it consistent with simulated wave data the measured raw data are post processed to obtain wave data in every hour 3 validation of simulated data the accuracy of simulated wave data is validated in the section by comparison against field measurements the accuracy of simulated wave data at the location of dwr3 has been validated by cheng et al 2019b by comparing the simulated significant wave height with the measured one however only one location point was considered by cheng et al 2019b since this study aims to investigate the inhomogeneity in environmental conditions in the fjord based on numerically simulated data the accuracy of simulated environmental data at more location points are thus required to be validated in order to demonstrate the accuracy of representing the environmental fields by the simulated one in this study numerically simulated wave data at three points i e dwr1 dwr3 and dwr4 are compared against field measurements the simulated data overlaps with the measured data for about 17 months from february 2016 to june 2017 these overlapping data are used here fig 3 shows the time series of simulated and measured significant wave height at the three dwrs from february 2016 to june 2017 it can be observed that these three dwrs were out of work during certain periods due to out of power or collision with ships passing by etc these missing data are not included in the present analyses as a result the effective data used cover a duration of 9932 11917 and 11502 h for the dwr1 dwr3 and dwr4 respectively a close up view of time series of the simulated and measured significant wave height is presented in fig 4 it is found that at all three dwrs the simulated significant wave height h s s has an overall good agreement with the measured significant wave height h s m a small discrepancy between h s s and h s m also exists the discrepancy and accuracy are thus further quantified by statistical analyses and distribution analyses in the following sections 3 1 statistical analyses a scatter plot of the simulated and measured significant wave height is shown in fig 5 to quantify the discrepancy three statistical parameters are introduced here including the bias the root mean square error rmse and the model uncertainty the bias denotes the correspondence between the mean values of measured and simulated significant wave height the rmse provides a quantitative measure of the difference between time series data points of simulated and measured significant wave heights the bias and rmse are defined as follows 1 r m s e 1 n j 1 n h s s j h s m j 2 2 b i a s 1 n j 1 n h s s j h s m j where n represents the total data point number of measured and simulated h s h s s j and h s m j denote the j t h data point in the time series of simulated and measured significant wave height respectively the calculated bias and rmse between the simulated and measured significant wave height at the three dwrs are given in table 1 the bias at the three dwrs are all very small close to zero implying that the mean values between the time series of simulated and measured significant wave height are very close the rmse at the three dwrs are all approximately 0 1 this indicates the overall good consistency in accuracy with respect to simulated significant wave height at the three dwrs model uncertainty is also studied here to represent the modeling uncertainties in the numerically simulated data the model uncertainty is defined as the ratio of measured h s to simulated h s given by 3 x h s m j h s s j for each data point in the time series a value of x can be estimated accordingly the coefficient of variation cov of model uncertainty x defined as the ratio of the standard deviation σ x to the mean μ x can be estimated by 4 c o v x σ x μ x the mean value and coefficient of variation cov of model uncertainty x are given in table 2 since the waves in this study are fairly small several thresholds are thus introduced together with model uncertainty in order to characterize the model uncertainty at different levels it is found that given a threshold significant wave height h s t h r not only the mean value but also cov of the model uncertainty x are generally close for the simulated significant wave height at the three dwrs for a threshold significant wave height h s t h r larger than 0 6 m the mean value of model uncertainty x are about 0 784 0 767 and 0 775 for the simulated significant wave height at dwr1 dwr3 and dwr4 respectively and the corresponding cov of x are respectively about 0 228 0 228 and 0 241 furthermore as the threshold increases both the mean value and cov of the model uncertainty x decrease this implies that at a higher threshold level the prediction of simulated significant wave height presents a smaller variability 3 2 distribution analyses the marginal distribution of the simulated and measured significant wave height are analyzed and compared in this section fig 6 shows the weibull plot of marginal distribution of simulated and measured significant wave height at the three dwrs from february 2016 to june 2017 similar to cheng et al 2019b it is found here that the simulated significant wave height follows a weibull distribution especially for the upper tail region while the measured significant wave height can be described by a hybrid lognormal and weibull distribution i e the lonowe model developed by haver 1980 from practical design point of view relatively large significant wave height is important it is therefore suitable to fit the raw data of the simulated significant wave height with h s larger than 0 1 m by a weibull distribution the probability density function pdf of a two parameter weibull distribution is given by 5 f h s s h α β h β α 1 exp h β α where α and β denote the shape and scale parameters respectively for the measured significant wave height the raw data in the upper tail follow a weibull distribution while the lower tail part follows a log normal distribution the lonowe model is thus employed to describe the marginal distribution of measured h s the pdf of the lonowe model is written as 6 f h s m h 1 2 π σ h exp 1 2 ln h μ σ 2 if h h 0 α β h β α 1 exp h β α if h h 0 where h 0 is the shifting point from the lognormal distribution to the weibull distribution μ and σ are the mean value and standard deviation of ln h s in the lognormal distribution α and β are the shape and scale parameters in the weibull distribution the method for estimating the parameters in the lonowe model is described by haver 1980 and moan et al 2005 and is not explained in detail here the basic idea is to estimate the weibull parameters α and β by imposing the continuity condition of cumulative distribution function cdf and pdf at the shifting point the parameters involved in the distributions are estimated by fitting the hourly sampled raw data with analytical distributions the fitted distributions for the simulated and measured significant wave height at the three dwrs are also plotted in fig 6 the weibull parameters and extreme significant wave height estimated from raw data and fitted distribution are collected as given in table 3 the 1 year h s estimated from the raw data is very close between the measured and simulated data however the 1 year h s estimated from the fitted distribution differs between the measured and simulated data this is because for all the three dwrs the fitted weibull parameters both α and β based on the measured data differ from those based on the simulated data moreover table 3 presents significant difference in 10 year and 100 year h s estimated from fitted distributions based on the measured and simulated data these differences are due to model uncertainties these 100 year h s are estimated based on about 14 months raw data which of course cause large uncertainty in the predicted 100 year value based on statistical analysis of 37 year hindcast data moan et al 2005 revealed that the 100 year h s predicted based on 1 year raw data exhibits great uncertainty with a ratio of the maximum predicted 100 year h s to the minimum predicted 100 year h s about 2 for the present study the ratio of the predicted 100 year h s based on the simulated and measured raw data is 1 32 1 14 and 1 29 for dwr1 dwr3 and dwr4 respectively besides the relative change of the predicted 100 year h s is also of interest and defined as h s 100 s i m h s 100 m e a h s 100 m e a 100 the relative change of the predicted 100 year h s are 31 9 13 9 and 28 9 for dwr1 dwr3 and dwr4 respectively therefore the discrepancy in the predicted 100 year h s between the measured and simulated data is still in a reasonable range 4 inhomogeneity of environmental conditions for design of floating bridges in this section the inhomogeneity of environmental conditions in the fjord is assessed from a statistical point of view the potential area for deploying the floating bridges is highlighted in fig 7 i e within the purple dash lines environmental conditions in this area is of great interest the wind and wave conditions in this area are thus analyzed in detail there are a total of 29 7 grid points 29 points along the global x direction and 7 points along the global y direction in the potential area these grid points are originally used in the swan model wave parameters at these grid points including significant wave height peak period and mean direction are thus already available from the hindcast data regarding the wind parameters mean wind speed and direction at these grid points they are estimated by linear interpolation of available wind parameters in neighboring grid points as shown in fig 1 to characterize the inhomogeneity the environmental parameters at each grid point are normalized by the corresponding environmental parameters at the reference point in this study the location at dwr3 is chosen as the reference point since it is located in the middle of the fjord and the long term joint distribution of parameters for wind and wave conditions has been established based on hindcast data at dwr3 cheng et al 2019b relevant environmental parameters are normalized as follows 7 h ˆ s h s h s r e f 8 t ˆ p t p t p r e f 9 u ˆ w u w u w r e f 10 θ ˆ w a θ w a θ w a r e f 11 θ ˆ w i θ w i θ w i r e f based on the field measured wave data cheng et al 2019a revealed that the waves in the fjord are mainly wind generated and are mainly from east and northwest waves from southwest are also observed in the measured wave data but they are less frequent than those from east and northwest however the dominant wave directions based on hindcast data differ slightly from those based on the measured data the long term probability distribution of wind and wave directions at dwr3 is shown in fig 8 based on hindcast wind and wave data from 2002 to 2017 it can be found that not only waves from east and northwest but also from southwest are observed the discrepancy in terms of waves from southwest between numerical simulations and field measurements may be due to the difference in hindcast wind directions to make it consistent with the measured wave data only waves from east and northwest are considered and analyzed in this study cheng et al 2019a also revealed that waves with a relatively small significant wave height less than 0 3 m are likely to have multiple dominant directions while waves with a relatively large significant wave height are likely to have one dominant direction in the numerical simulations these multiple dominant directions are not captured therefore this study only considers the inhomogeneity in environmental conditions that consists of waves with a relatively large significant wave height these environmental conditions are also the design driven conditions in the design of floating bridges a threshold significant wave height denoted by h s t h r is thus introduced here it is defined with respect to the significant wave height at the reference point h s r e f the inhomogeneity is estimated when h s r e f is larger than or equal to h s t h r in this section the variation of environmental parameters across the fjord is addressed by considering two dominant wave directions from northwest and from east the variation of wind and wave parameters is demonstrated by using the contour map in which the same contour line represents the same value of the long term statistical parameter i e mean value or standard deviation in this study for the normalized wind and wave parameters considered inhomogeneity in environmental parameters with waves from northwest is studied first 4 1 inhomogeneity in environmental parameters with waves from northwest fig 9 13 present the contour maps of mean values and standard deviations of normalized environmental parameters across the fjord the mean values and standard deviations are estimated based on environmental conditions with waves from northwest and with a significant wave height at the reference point larger than a threshold value two representative threshold values of significant wave height i e 0 3 m and 0 6 m are considered in this section the threshold value of significant wave height of 0 3 m is selected based on previous studies cheng et al 2019a b and was determined as a compromise between avoiding uncertain low sea states having sufficient data for statistical analysis and focusing on waves of interest for practical design of floating bridges the variation of significant wave height across the fjord under two different threshold significant wave heights is demonstrated in fig 9 in general the contour maps of mean values and standard deviations of normalized significant wave height h ˆ s between the two different threshold significant wave heights are fairly similar the mean values of h ˆ s increase gradually from about 0 5 at north x 4000 m to about 1 at south x 0 m in the considered area a rapid increase in the mean value of h ˆ s mainly occurs in the north part of the considered area with x ranging from about 4000 m to about 3000 m this is because waves from northwest are accounted for here and the north side of the fjord provides certain shield effects to reduce the wave height regarding the standard deviation of h ˆ s the largest standard deviation approximately 0 14 is observed in the north end x 4000 m of the considered area while the smallest standard deviation about 0 02 is located in the south part 1000 m x 2000 m the variation of peak period across the fjord under two different threshold significant wave heights is shown in fig 10 under the two different threshold significant wave heights contour maps of mean values and standard deviations of normalized peak period t ˆ p are very similar the mean value of t ˆ p has very small variation for x ranges from 0 m to 3000 m the mean value of t ˆ p is close to 1 when x increases from 3000 m to the north end the mean value decreases gradually and reaches about 0 9 at the north end the standard deviation of t ˆ p is very small close to 0 slightly large standard deviations are observed in the north part of the considered area in general t ˆ p has fairly small variations across the fjord this also agrees with the finding by cheng et al 2019a based on analyzing field measured data by the three wave buoys fig 11 shows the inhomogeneity in terms of normalized wave direction θ ˆ w a across the fjord here waves come from northwest and two threshold values of significant wave heights are considered θ ˆ w a varies with a certain pattern across the fjord the mean value of θ ˆ w a increases gradually from north to south and the variation is approximately 30 the standard deviation of θ ˆ w a in the south part of the fjord 0 m x 3000 m is relatively small less than 2 however the standard deviation of θ ˆ w a in the north part of the fjord is relative larger than those in the south part the standard deviation of θ ˆ w a can reach more than 12 especially under cases with a threshold significant wave height of 0 3 m in addition the mean value and standard deviation of θ ˆ w a between threshold values of significant wave heights of 0 3 m and 0 6 m are fairly similar the mean wind speed has relatively larger variations across the fjord compared to the significant wave height and peak period the contour maps of mean values and standard deviations of normalized mean wind speed u ˆ w across the fjord under two different threshold significant wave heights is shown in fig 12 different from h ˆ s and t ˆ p mean values of u ˆ w that are slightly larger than 1 are observed in the central part of the considered area 1000 m x 3000 m in addition the standard deviations of u ˆ w are generally very large especially in the north part x 2000 m where the standard deviations are larger than 0 4 however the standard deviations of h ˆ s are smaller than 0 15 and those of t ˆ p less than 0 1 this implies that the mean wind speed has more prominent inhomogeneity than the significant wave height and peak period regarding the inhomogeneity in terms of wind direction the mean values and standard deviations of normalized wind direction θ ˆ w i across the fjord are shown in fig 13 under two threshold values of significant wave heights in general the mean values of θ ˆ w i vary within 10 nevertheless the standard deviations of θ ˆ w i vary significantly and can reach about 90 this indicates that the wind direction across the fjord does not present a certain pattern as those of wave direction shown in fig 11 similar as the mean wind speed the wind directions in the south part has a relatively smaller variation than those in the north part 4 2 inhomogeneity in environmental parameters with waves from east in this section the inhomogeneity in environmental conditions with waves from east is analyzed two threshold values of significant wave heights i e 0 3 m and 0 6 m are also utilized here the results are presented in figs 14 18 fig 14 presents the contour maps of mean values and standard deviations of normalized significant wave height h ˆ s across the fjord where only waves coming from east are considered here under the threshold significant wave height of 0 3 m i e h s t h r 0 3 m the mean values of the normalized significant wave height h ˆ s are very close to 1 in the middle of the fjord 1000 m x 3800 m in the north part x 3800 m the mean values of h ˆ s decrease rapidly while in the south part x 1000 m the mean values of h ˆ s decrease relatively slowly from about 0 95 to 085 the standard deviations of h ˆ s have a smallest value of about 0 02 in the middle of the fjord different from the mean values of h ˆ s the standard deviation of h ˆ s increase gradually from the middle of the fjord to both ends the largest value of the standard deviations of h ˆ s are located in the north end about 0 16 the mean values and standard deviations of h ˆ s for the threshold significant wave height of 0 6 m h s t h r 0 6 m have similar trends compared to those with the threshold significant wave height of 0 3 m h s t h r 0 3 m fig 15 shows the contour maps of mean values and standard deviations of normalized peak period t ˆ p across the fjord where only waves coming from east are considered here the mean values of t ˆ p across the fjord are larger than 0 98 while the standard deviations of t ˆ p is smaller than 0 03 in the middle and south part of the fjord x 3000 m in other part of the fjord the standard deviations of t ˆ p are slightly larger but still less than 0 06 the standard deviations of t ˆ p under the threshold significant wave height of 0 6 m h s t h r 0 6 m is smaller than that under the threshold significant wave height of 0 3 m h s t h r 0 3 m therefore the peak period across the fjord are almost identical for waves coming from east and with a significant wave height larger than 0 3 m the wave directions across the fjord also present a pattern for wave coming from east and with a significant wave height larger than 0 3 m as shown in fig 16 fig 16 depicts the contour maps of mean values and standard deviations of normalized wave directions θ ˆ w a across the fjord the mean values of θ ˆ w a increase gradually from about 15 in the south end to 25 in the north end a relatively rapid increase is also found in the area close to the north end x 3800 m the standard deviations of θ ˆ w a increases gradually from the middle of the fjord to both ends and from east to west the values of standard deviations of θ ˆ w a can reach about 6 which is fairly large compared to the corresponding mean values of θ ˆ w a in addition the standard deviation of θ ˆ w a under the threshold significant wave height of 0 6 m are slightly smaller than those under the threshold significant wave height of 0 3 m figs 14 16 present the contour maps of wave parameters h ˆ s t ˆ p θ ˆ w a across the fjord for waves coming from east and with a significant wave height larger than 0 3 m figs 17 and 18 present the contour maps of wind parameters u ˆ w θ ˆ w i compared to the contour maps of mean values and standard deviations of wave parameters the contour maps of mean values and standard deviations of wind parameters present much greater variations across the fjord it can be found in fig 17 that under the threshold significant wave height of 0 3 m h s t h r 0 3 m the mean values of normalized mean wind speed u ˆ w varies from 0 7 to 1 2 across the fjord while the corresponding standard deviations of u ˆ w can reach approximately 0 5 significantly large variations of mean values and standard deviations of u ˆ w are mainly observed in the north part of the fjord x 2000m in the south part these variations are relatively smaller compared to those in the north part the standard deviations of u ˆ w are approximately less than 0 25 similar variations in mean values and standard deviations of u ˆ w are also found under the threshold significant wave height of 0 6 m h s t h r 0 6 m these variations are slightly smaller than those under the threshold significant wave height of 0 3 m the mean values and standard deviations of normalized wind direction θ ˆ w i also demonstrate remarkable variations in the north part of the fjord x 2500m as shown in fig 18 the mean values of θ ˆ w i vary from 30 to 10 and the corresponding standard deviations of θ ˆ w i are larger than 30 and can even reach 100 in the south part the mean values of θ ˆ w i is about 10 while the standard deviation of θ ˆ w i are between 20 to 30 the variations of mean values of standard deviations of θ ˆ w i in the south part are much smaller compared to those in the north part 5 correlation of environmental parameters along a potential road route this section addresses the correlation of environmental parameters based on the hindcast data correlation is usually described by the correlation coefficient which is a statistical measure of linear relationship between two variables a correlation coefficient of 1 means a perfect positive linear relationship between two variables from design of point view of floating bridges the correlation of environmental parameters along the potential routes of floating brides are of great interest for the considered fjord several floating bridge concepts have been proposed and studied included end anchored curved floating bridges and side anchored straight floating bridges in this study the potential route for side anchored floating bridges are considered this route is a straight line with y 0 as shown in figs 1 and 7 environmental parameters at various grid points along the potential route considered are extracted from the hindcast data including significant wave height peak period mean wave direction mean wind speed and mean wind direction the correlation of environmental parameters are studied by considering two dominant wave directions i e from northwest and from east the threshold significant wave height at the reference point is chosen to be 0 3 m the correlation matrix of wave and wind parameters among different grid points along the bridge route are thus estimated 5 1 correlation of environmental parameters with waves from northwest the correlation matrix of environmental parameters along the bridge route is first analyzed for waves from northwest fig 19 presents the correlation matrix of significant wave height peak period and mean wave direction along the bridge route in general very high correlations i e correlation coefficient greater than 0 95 are observed in these wave parameters among different pairs of points along the bridge route except between grid points located in the south part and grid points in the north part the peak period and mean wave direction at grid points in the south part x 3000m have relatively small correlation with those in the north part regarding the peak period only grid points located in the north with x 4000m have a relatively small correlation with the other grid points fig 20 shows the correlation matrix of mean wind speed and mean wind direction among different grid points along the bridge route the correlation matrix of wind parameters differ greatly from those of wave parameters shown in fig 19 high correlations in mean wind speed are only observed between grid points that are close or are both located in the south part x 2500m very low correlation with a correlation coefficient less than 0 1 are found between grid points located in the south part and those located in the north part regarding the mean wind direction relatively high correlation coefficient is only observed between very close grid points while the correlation coefficient among most grid points are close to 0 this implies the mean wind direction along the bridge route has extremely weak correlation 5 2 correlation of environmental parameters with waves from east the correlation matrix of wave and wind parameters along the bridge route is also analyzed considering waves from east as shown in figs 21 and 22 fig 21 shows the correlation matrix of significant wave height peak period and mean wave direction along the bridge route considering waves from east two points along the bridge route with a distance less than about 1500 m have a correlation coefficient larger than 0 95 in significant wave height implying a very high correlation the correlation decreases as the distance increases the combination of point located at the south end and the other point at the north end gives a smallest correlation in significant wave height with a correlation coefficient of about 0 72 similar trends are also observed in the mean wave direction but a high correlation in the south part requires a shorter distance between two points considered the peak period has very high correlation among the whole bridge route which is different from those shown fig 19 b with waves from northwest the correlation matrix of mean wind speed and mean wind direction for waves from east are shown in fig 22 relatively high correlations in mean wind speed are observed in the south part which is similar as those shown in fig 20 a with waves from northwest additionally the correlation coefficients illustrated in fig 22 a are overall larger than those shown in fig 20 a different from the correlation of mean wind direction for waves from north west shown in fig 20 b the correlation of mean wind direction for waves from east are high in the south part 6 discussions this study addresses the evaluation of inhomogeneity in wind and wave conditions in the bjørnafjord based on 16 year hindcast data the wave data significant wave height peak period and mean wave direction were simulated by using the swan model which is developed based on the phase averaged energy balance equation therefore the swan model cannot provide the coherence spectra between any two points theoretically coherence spectra can be calculated by using a phase resolved wave model such as potential flow based method and cfd based method the wave direction distribution is not addressed in this paper however it should be noted that although the swan model cannot provide the coherence spectra it is much more efficient than the phase resolved wave models and is thus suitable for large scale long term simulations besides main features of the wave field at each point e g significant wave height peak period and mean wave direction are captured by the swan model these wave data are very important for uls ultimate limit state design check of floating bridge the wind data mean wind speed and direction were simulated by using the wrf model the wrf model is also a phase averaged flow model that can provides the hourly averaged wind speed at 10 m height while the wind shear turbulence intensity are not accounted for yet besides the coherence spectra of wind speed between two points in the space are not considered either these wind data can be achieved by carrying out a 3d phase resolved simulations e g cfd which is unfortunately extremely time consuming and not suitable for engineering application from point view of uls design check of floating bridges the mean wind speed plays an important role as a whole though the present study does not provide a complete description of inhomogeneous wind and wave conditions in the fjord it highlights the long term spatial inhomogeneity in key wind and wave parameters which are of great significance and useful for assessing the effects inhomogeneous environmental conditions on dynamic responses of floating bridges 7 conclusions long term spatial inhomogeneity in wind and wave parameters for environmental conditions in a norwegian fjord is evaluated in this study for design of floating bridges based on 16 year hindcast wind and wave data the wave conditions are mainly characterized by significant wave height peak period and mean wave direction while the wind conditions are mainly described by mean wind speed and wind direction the wind and wave data are numerically simulated by using the wrf model and swan model respectively the accuracy of simulated wave data is first validated by comparison against field measurements the time series of simulated h s have an overall good agreement with the measured h s at all three wave buoy overall good consistency in the accuracy of simulation h s is also observed for waves with a significant wave height larger than 0 6 m model uncertainty of significant wave height at the three wave buoy are fairly close with a mean value of approximately 0 77 and a cov of about 0 23 inhomogeneity in wind and wave parameters within the potential area for deploying floating bridges are revealed by contour maps of normalized values two threshold value of significant wave height i e 0 3 m and 0 6 m and two dominant wave directions i e waves from northwest and from east are considered when waves come from northwest significant wave height and peak period are fairly close in the south part and decrease gradually towards the north end mean wave direction decreases from south end to north end mean wind speed has a relatively small variation in the south part and a great variation in the north part so do the mean wind direction regarding waves from east similar trends in the wave and wind parameters are observed but with slightly smaller variations compared to those with waves from northwest besides standard deviations of the wind and wave parameters are generally small in the south part and become relatively large in the north part especially for the wind parameters correlation of wind and wave parameters along a potential bridge route is analyzed by considering waves with significant wave height greater than 0 3 m and two dominant wave directions i e waves from northwest and from east it is found that distance between points greatly affects their associated correlations especially when these two points are located in the south part and close to the north end separately for waves from northwest wave parameters in the south part have high correlations while for waves from east distance between points less than 1500 m can lead to high correlations in significant wave height and mean wave direction peak period is highly correlated when waves from east wind parameters are less correlated than the wave parameters mean wind speed is to some extent correlated in the south part to conclude long term spatial inhomogeneity in wind and wave parameters in the fjord is revealed by contour maps in this study together with the long term joint distribution of wind and wave parameters this study provides the environmental basis for evaluating the effects of inhomogeneous environmental conditions on extreme loads for uls and cyclic loads for fls which are important for safety design of floating bridges based on present study inhomogeneous environmental load effects of floating brides will be investigated in the

21194,environmental conditions along a very large floating bridge are inhomogeneous due to complex topography and hydrography evaluating the inhomogeneity in environment conditions is important for safety design of floating bridges but challenging because of their large size this study addresses the assessment of long term spatial inhomogeneity in wind and wave parameters for environmental conditions in a norwegian fjord for design of floating bridges based on 16 year hindcast data the wind and wave data are numerically simulated by using the weather research and forecasting wrf model and simulating waves nearshore swan model respectively the accuracy of hindcast wave data is validated by comparison against field measurements inhomogeneity in wind and wave parameters are revealed by contour maps by considering two dominant wave directions significant wave height and peak period are fairly close in the south part and decrease gradually towards the north end mean wave direction decreases from south end to north end mean wind speed has a relatively small variation in the south part and a great variation in the north part so do the mean wind direction correlation of wind and wave parameters along a potential bridge route is analyzed wind parameters are less correlated than the wave parameters keywords inhomogeneity wind and wave hindcast data correlation floating bridges 1 introduction a floating bridge is a very large floating structure vlfs constructed for the purpose of providing passage over wide and deep straits and fjords or over waters with very soft seabeds in these waters building a traditional bridge with fixed supports is usually very expensive while a floating bridge is a promising alternative floating bridges feature up to several kilometers long in size and are usually deployed in coastal regions compared to marine and offshore structures that are deployed in the open sea e g offshore oil and gas platform offshore wind turbines and other vlfss such as mobile offshore base mob and megafloats floating bridges have a much larger size and are more flexible with a large number of eigenmodes cheng et al 2018a these eigenmodes can be excited by environmental loads threatening the structural integrity and safety besides since floating bridges are usually located in the coastal region with complex topography and hydrography they suffer more complex environmental conditions these environmental conditions can also vary along the very long bridge route i e environmental conditions are inhomogeneous during the design of marine and offshore structures environmental conditions are usually assumed to be homogeneous in short term to facilitate the design a wave field is homogeneous when the wave spectra and directional spectra at each point are identical and the wave elevations among any two points are coherent i e each frequency component of the wave elevation have a constant phase difference similarly a wind field is homogeneous when the wind spectra and directional spectra at the same height are identical and wind speed among any two points in the space are coherent for marine and offshore structures that are deployed in the open sea and with a relatively small size the assumption of homogeneous environmental conditions is reasonable however for floating bridges that are up to several kilometers long such assumption might lead to great underestimation of structural responses and thus threaten the structural safety cheng et al 2018b investigated the inhomogeneous wave load effects on a 4600 m long curved floating bridge and revealed that inhomogeneous wave conditions can cause much larger structural response especially the weak axis bending moment than the homogeneous wave conditions therefore the inhomogeneity in environmental conditions should be properly evaluated for the structural safety design of very long floating bridges environmental conditions and associated inhomogeneities in straits and fjords can be assessed by carrying out field measurements or numerical simulations field measurements of wave condition e g by wave buoy cheng et al 2019a and wind condition e g by anemometer and lidar cheynet et al 2017 can usually provide local environmental conditions for a several km long floating bridge field measurement of wind and wave conditions requires a large number of measurement devices in order to capture the inhomogeneity in the environmental conditions therefore field measurements are not an economical approach to determine the inhomogeneity alternatively numerical simulations are more promising to simulate environmental conditions in straits and fjords macro scale numerical simulations based on phase averaged approaches are desirable from computational efficiency point of view in coastal regions the swan simulating waves nearshore model booij et al 1999 is usually used to simulate the complex wave transformation caused by the bathymetry wind and other factors this model is based on phase averaged energy balance equation and has been employed to simulate waves in the outer rio de la plata estuary dragani et al 2008 and the bjørnafjord lothe and musch 2015 with respect to the local wind conditions it is usually modelled by the weather research and forecasting wrf model skamarock et al 2008 which is a numerical weather prediction nwp system designed to serve both atmospheric research and operational forecasting needs based on macro scale simulation results mid scale simulations can be conducted to model the wind and wave propagation in details these simulations for waves usually use phase resolved approaches such as nonlinear potential flow based method e g engsig karup et al 2012 navier stokes equation based method e g wang et al 2017 oceanwave3d engsig karup et al 2012 developed by dtu is a potential flow modeling tool which accounts for large scale fully nonlinear and dispersive free surface wave modeling it has been used to simulate wave propagation in coastal regions wang et al 2017 carried out a large scale cfd computational fluid dynamics modeling of wave propagation in sulafjord for the coastal highway e39 project of norway simulation results from swan were used as inputs to the cfd simulations besides various model equations based on vertical averaging of the flow or and perturbation analyses have also been applied to model wave propagation such as e g boussinesq type equations madsen et al 2002 and green naghdi equations green and naghdi 1976 and nonlinear variants of multimodal coupled mode equations however all these phase resolved methods are usually more computational demanding than the phase averaged methods the wind and wave data used in the present study were thus simulated by using phase averaged methods in the short term description of wind and waves normally wind in 10 min and waves in 3 h are considered as stationary when describing the combined wind and wave condition a compromise is usually a duration of 1 h for both wind and waves such compromise is also adopted in the present study in this study the inhomogeneity in the environmental conditions wind and waves in a norwegian fjord i e the bjørnafjord is evaluated based on numerically simulated wind and wave data over about 16 years the long term joint distribution of wind and wave conditions in this fjord has been established by cheng et al 2019b based on simulated data at one location in the fjord the inhomogeneity in wind and wave conditions in this fjord is not studied yet but it is of significant importance to the safety design of floating bridges it should be noted that in general the inhomogeneity of wind and wave conditions in a fjord consists of both long term variation e g distribution of significant wave height of the wind and wave parameters in the fjord and the short term variation e g the wave spectra and the cross spectra for the waves at different locations in the fjord in this paper we only address the long term spatial inhomogeneity of the wind and wave parameters since the phase averaged hindcast data were used 2 data description the fjord considered in this study is the bjørnafjord located at the hordaland county norway it is about 4600 m wide and more than 500 m deep the location and topography of the fjord are shown in fig 1 the local bathymetry of the fjord is illustrated in fig 2 a floating bridge is planned to be built to cross the fjord by the norwegian public roads administration npra to achieve a safe reliable and cost effective design of floating bridge the environmental condition in the fjord should be properly assessed both numerical simulations and field measurements have been carried out to characterize the environmental condition in the fjord these environmental data has been described in detail in cheng et al 2019a and cheng et al 2019b in this section relevant environmental data is briefly described to better illustrate the results in this study 2 1 numerical simulations of wind and wave conditions the wave condition in the fjord is simulated by using the swan simulating waves nearshore model booij et al 1999 a third generation wave model the model is a phase averaged model based on the wave action balance equation and solves the action density balance equation in time geographical and spectral space therefore it can provide wave frequency spectrum and directional spectrum and relevant wave parameters such as significant wave height peak period and mean direction etc the swan model has been widely used to simulate realistic estimates of wave parameters in coastal areas lakes estuaries from given wind bottom and current conditions it can simulate both wind generated waves and swells but in this study only wind generated waves are simulated for the fjord because the swell is very small cheng et al 2019a a total of 296 373 grid points with a spacing of approximately 150 m are equally distributed in the area with latitude ranging from 59 85 to 60 2483 and longitude ranging from 4 8 to 5 797 the wind condition in the fjord is simulated by using the wrf weather research and forecasting model skamarock et al 2008 a next generation mesoscale numerical weather prediction system designed for both atmospheric research and operational forecasting applications the model solves the compressible nonhydrostatic euler equations in time and geographical space and provides the mean wind speed at 10 m height for each grid point in the latitude and longitude directions in this study a total of 138 180 with a spacing of about 500 m are equally distributed for simulating mean wind speed a close up view of the grid points for simulating wind and wave conditions around the potential bridge site is shown in fig 1 numerical simulation of wind and wave conditions are based on hindcast data from january 2002 to june 2017 wind and wave parameters are stored in every hour including significant wave height peak period mean direction and mean wind speed in latitude and longitude directions 2 2 field measurements of wave conditions three datawell waveriders dwrs were deployed to measure the wave conditions in the fjord by recording the heave north and west displacements of the buoy the measurements have been carried out since february 2016 cheng et al 2019a analyzed the measured wave data from february 2016 to october 2017 and revealed that the waves in the fjord are short crested and mainly wind generated waves with a relatively large significant wave height h s 0 3 m are likely to have one dominant direction while small waves are likely to have multiple dominant directions in this study a total of about 33 months from february 2016 to october 2018 of measured raw data is used the measured raw data are recorded and stored in 30 min samples with a frequency of 1 28 hz to make it consistent with simulated wave data the measured raw data are post processed to obtain wave data in every hour 3 validation of simulated data the accuracy of simulated wave data is validated in the section by comparison against field measurements the accuracy of simulated wave data at the location of dwr3 has been validated by cheng et al 2019b by comparing the simulated significant wave height with the measured one however only one location point was considered by cheng et al 2019b since this study aims to investigate the inhomogeneity in environmental conditions in the fjord based on numerically simulated data the accuracy of simulated environmental data at more location points are thus required to be validated in order to demonstrate the accuracy of representing the environmental fields by the simulated one in this study numerically simulated wave data at three points i e dwr1 dwr3 and dwr4 are compared against field measurements the simulated data overlaps with the measured data for about 17 months from february 2016 to june 2017 these overlapping data are used here fig 3 shows the time series of simulated and measured significant wave height at the three dwrs from february 2016 to june 2017 it can be observed that these three dwrs were out of work during certain periods due to out of power or collision with ships passing by etc these missing data are not included in the present analyses as a result the effective data used cover a duration of 9932 11917 and 11502 h for the dwr1 dwr3 and dwr4 respectively a close up view of time series of the simulated and measured significant wave height is presented in fig 4 it is found that at all three dwrs the simulated significant wave height h s s has an overall good agreement with the measured significant wave height h s m a small discrepancy between h s s and h s m also exists the discrepancy and accuracy are thus further quantified by statistical analyses and distribution analyses in the following sections 3 1 statistical analyses a scatter plot of the simulated and measured significant wave height is shown in fig 5 to quantify the discrepancy three statistical parameters are introduced here including the bias the root mean square error rmse and the model uncertainty the bias denotes the correspondence between the mean values of measured and simulated significant wave height the rmse provides a quantitative measure of the difference between time series data points of simulated and measured significant wave heights the bias and rmse are defined as follows 1 r m s e 1 n j 1 n h s s j h s m j 2 2 b i a s 1 n j 1 n h s s j h s m j where n represents the total data point number of measured and simulated h s h s s j and h s m j denote the j t h data point in the time series of simulated and measured significant wave height respectively the calculated bias and rmse between the simulated and measured significant wave height at the three dwrs are given in table 1 the bias at the three dwrs are all very small close to zero implying that the mean values between the time series of simulated and measured significant wave height are very close the rmse at the three dwrs are all approximately 0 1 this indicates the overall good consistency in accuracy with respect to simulated significant wave height at the three dwrs model uncertainty is also studied here to represent the modeling uncertainties in the numerically simulated data the model uncertainty is defined as the ratio of measured h s to simulated h s given by 3 x h s m j h s s j for each data point in the time series a value of x can be estimated accordingly the coefficient of variation cov of model uncertainty x defined as the ratio of the standard deviation σ x to the mean μ x can be estimated by 4 c o v x σ x μ x the mean value and coefficient of variation cov of model uncertainty x are given in table 2 since the waves in this study are fairly small several thresholds are thus introduced together with model uncertainty in order to characterize the model uncertainty at different levels it is found that given a threshold significant wave height h s t h r not only the mean value but also cov of the model uncertainty x are generally close for the simulated significant wave height at the three dwrs for a threshold significant wave height h s t h r larger than 0 6 m the mean value of model uncertainty x are about 0 784 0 767 and 0 775 for the simulated significant wave height at dwr1 dwr3 and dwr4 respectively and the corresponding cov of x are respectively about 0 228 0 228 and 0 241 furthermore as the threshold increases both the mean value and cov of the model uncertainty x decrease this implies that at a higher threshold level the prediction of simulated significant wave height presents a smaller variability 3 2 distribution analyses the marginal distribution of the simulated and measured significant wave height are analyzed and compared in this section fig 6 shows the weibull plot of marginal distribution of simulated and measured significant wave height at the three dwrs from february 2016 to june 2017 similar to cheng et al 2019b it is found here that the simulated significant wave height follows a weibull distribution especially for the upper tail region while the measured significant wave height can be described by a hybrid lognormal and weibull distribution i e the lonowe model developed by haver 1980 from practical design point of view relatively large significant wave height is important it is therefore suitable to fit the raw data of the simulated significant wave height with h s larger than 0 1 m by a weibull distribution the probability density function pdf of a two parameter weibull distribution is given by 5 f h s s h α β h β α 1 exp h β α where α and β denote the shape and scale parameters respectively for the measured significant wave height the raw data in the upper tail follow a weibull distribution while the lower tail part follows a log normal distribution the lonowe model is thus employed to describe the marginal distribution of measured h s the pdf of the lonowe model is written as 6 f h s m h 1 2 π σ h exp 1 2 ln h μ σ 2 if h h 0 α β h β α 1 exp h β α if h h 0 where h 0 is the shifting point from the lognormal distribution to the weibull distribution μ and σ are the mean value and standard deviation of ln h s in the lognormal distribution α and β are the shape and scale parameters in the weibull distribution the method for estimating the parameters in the lonowe model is described by haver 1980 and moan et al 2005 and is not explained in detail here the basic idea is to estimate the weibull parameters α and β by imposing the continuity condition of cumulative distribution function cdf and pdf at the shifting point the parameters involved in the distributions are estimated by fitting the hourly sampled raw data with analytical distributions the fitted distributions for the simulated and measured significant wave height at the three dwrs are also plotted in fig 6 the weibull parameters and extreme significant wave height estimated from raw data and fitted distribution are collected as given in table 3 the 1 year h s estimated from the raw data is very close between the measured and simulated data however the 1 year h s estimated from the fitted distribution differs between the measured and simulated data this is because for all the three dwrs the fitted weibull parameters both α and β based on the measured data differ from those based on the simulated data moreover table 3 presents significant difference in 10 year and 100 year h s estimated from fitted distributions based on the measured and simulated data these differences are due to model uncertainties these 100 year h s are estimated based on about 14 months raw data which of course cause large uncertainty in the predicted 100 year value based on statistical analysis of 37 year hindcast data moan et al 2005 revealed that the 100 year h s predicted based on 1 year raw data exhibits great uncertainty with a ratio of the maximum predicted 100 year h s to the minimum predicted 100 year h s about 2 for the present study the ratio of the predicted 100 year h s based on the simulated and measured raw data is 1 32 1 14 and 1 29 for dwr1 dwr3 and dwr4 respectively besides the relative change of the predicted 100 year h s is also of interest and defined as h s 100 s i m h s 100 m e a h s 100 m e a 100 the relative change of the predicted 100 year h s are 31 9 13 9 and 28 9 for dwr1 dwr3 and dwr4 respectively therefore the discrepancy in the predicted 100 year h s between the measured and simulated data is still in a reasonable range 4 inhomogeneity of environmental conditions for design of floating bridges in this section the inhomogeneity of environmental conditions in the fjord is assessed from a statistical point of view the potential area for deploying the floating bridges is highlighted in fig 7 i e within the purple dash lines environmental conditions in this area is of great interest the wind and wave conditions in this area are thus analyzed in detail there are a total of 29 7 grid points 29 points along the global x direction and 7 points along the global y direction in the potential area these grid points are originally used in the swan model wave parameters at these grid points including significant wave height peak period and mean direction are thus already available from the hindcast data regarding the wind parameters mean wind speed and direction at these grid points they are estimated by linear interpolation of available wind parameters in neighboring grid points as shown in fig 1 to characterize the inhomogeneity the environmental parameters at each grid point are normalized by the corresponding environmental parameters at the reference point in this study the location at dwr3 is chosen as the reference point since it is located in the middle of the fjord and the long term joint distribution of parameters for wind and wave conditions has been established based on hindcast data at dwr3 cheng et al 2019b relevant environmental parameters are normalized as follows 7 h ˆ s h s h s r e f 8 t ˆ p t p t p r e f 9 u ˆ w u w u w r e f 10 θ ˆ w a θ w a θ w a r e f 11 θ ˆ w i θ w i θ w i r e f based on the field measured wave data cheng et al 2019a revealed that the waves in the fjord are mainly wind generated and are mainly from east and northwest waves from southwest are also observed in the measured wave data but they are less frequent than those from east and northwest however the dominant wave directions based on hindcast data differ slightly from those based on the measured data the long term probability distribution of wind and wave directions at dwr3 is shown in fig 8 based on hindcast wind and wave data from 2002 to 2017 it can be found that not only waves from east and northwest but also from southwest are observed the discrepancy in terms of waves from southwest between numerical simulations and field measurements may be due to the difference in hindcast wind directions to make it consistent with the measured wave data only waves from east and northwest are considered and analyzed in this study cheng et al 2019a also revealed that waves with a relatively small significant wave height less than 0 3 m are likely to have multiple dominant directions while waves with a relatively large significant wave height are likely to have one dominant direction in the numerical simulations these multiple dominant directions are not captured therefore this study only considers the inhomogeneity in environmental conditions that consists of waves with a relatively large significant wave height these environmental conditions are also the design driven conditions in the design of floating bridges a threshold significant wave height denoted by h s t h r is thus introduced here it is defined with respect to the significant wave height at the reference point h s r e f the inhomogeneity is estimated when h s r e f is larger than or equal to h s t h r in this section the variation of environmental parameters across the fjord is addressed by considering two dominant wave directions from northwest and from east the variation of wind and wave parameters is demonstrated by using the contour map in which the same contour line represents the same value of the long term statistical parameter i e mean value or standard deviation in this study for the normalized wind and wave parameters considered inhomogeneity in environmental parameters with waves from northwest is studied first 4 1 inhomogeneity in environmental parameters with waves from northwest fig 9 13 present the contour maps of mean values and standard deviations of normalized environmental parameters across the fjord the mean values and standard deviations are estimated based on environmental conditions with waves from northwest and with a significant wave height at the reference point larger than a threshold value two representative threshold values of significant wave height i e 0 3 m and 0 6 m are considered in this section the threshold value of significant wave height of 0 3 m is selected based on previous studies cheng et al 2019a b and was determined as a compromise between avoiding uncertain low sea states having sufficient data for statistical analysis and focusing on waves of interest for practical design of floating bridges the variation of significant wave height across the fjord under two different threshold significant wave heights is demonstrated in fig 9 in general the contour maps of mean values and standard deviations of normalized significant wave height h ˆ s between the two different threshold significant wave heights are fairly similar the mean values of h ˆ s increase gradually from about 0 5 at north x 4000 m to about 1 at south x 0 m in the considered area a rapid increase in the mean value of h ˆ s mainly occurs in the north part of the considered area with x ranging from about 4000 m to about 3000 m this is because waves from northwest are accounted for here and the north side of the fjord provides certain shield effects to reduce the wave height regarding the standard deviation of h ˆ s the largest standard deviation approximately 0 14 is observed in the north end x 4000 m of the considered area while the smallest standard deviation about 0 02 is located in the south part 1000 m x 2000 m the variation of peak period across the fjord under two different threshold significant wave heights is shown in fig 10 under the two different threshold significant wave heights contour maps of mean values and standard deviations of normalized peak period t ˆ p are very similar the mean value of t ˆ p has very small variation for x ranges from 0 m to 3000 m the mean value of t ˆ p is close to 1 when x increases from 3000 m to the north end the mean value decreases gradually and reaches about 0 9 at the north end the standard deviation of t ˆ p is very small close to 0 slightly large standard deviations are observed in the north part of the considered area in general t ˆ p has fairly small variations across the fjord this also agrees with the finding by cheng et al 2019a based on analyzing field measured data by the three wave buoys fig 11 shows the inhomogeneity in terms of normalized wave direction θ ˆ w a across the fjord here waves come from northwest and two threshold values of significant wave heights are considered θ ˆ w a varies with a certain pattern across the fjord the mean value of θ ˆ w a increases gradually from north to south and the variation is approximately 30 the standard deviation of θ ˆ w a in the south part of the fjord 0 m x 3000 m is relatively small less than 2 however the standard deviation of θ ˆ w a in the north part of the fjord is relative larger than those in the south part the standard deviation of θ ˆ w a can reach more than 12 especially under cases with a threshold significant wave height of 0 3 m in addition the mean value and standard deviation of θ ˆ w a between threshold values of significant wave heights of 0 3 m and 0 6 m are fairly similar the mean wind speed has relatively larger variations across the fjord compared to the significant wave height and peak period the contour maps of mean values and standard deviations of normalized mean wind speed u ˆ w across the fjord under two different threshold significant wave heights is shown in fig 12 different from h ˆ s and t ˆ p mean values of u ˆ w that are slightly larger than 1 are observed in the central part of the considered area 1000 m x 3000 m in addition the standard deviations of u ˆ w are generally very large especially in the north part x 2000 m where the standard deviations are larger than 0 4 however the standard deviations of h ˆ s are smaller than 0 15 and those of t ˆ p less than 0 1 this implies that the mean wind speed has more prominent inhomogeneity than the significant wave height and peak period regarding the inhomogeneity in terms of wind direction the mean values and standard deviations of normalized wind direction θ ˆ w i across the fjord are shown in fig 13 under two threshold values of significant wave heights in general the mean values of θ ˆ w i vary within 10 nevertheless the standard deviations of θ ˆ w i vary significantly and can reach about 90 this indicates that the wind direction across the fjord does not present a certain pattern as those of wave direction shown in fig 11 similar as the mean wind speed the wind directions in the south part has a relatively smaller variation than those in the north part 4 2 inhomogeneity in environmental parameters with waves from east in this section the inhomogeneity in environmental conditions with waves from east is analyzed two threshold values of significant wave heights i e 0 3 m and 0 6 m are also utilized here the results are presented in figs 14 18 fig 14 presents the contour maps of mean values and standard deviations of normalized significant wave height h ˆ s across the fjord where only waves coming from east are considered here under the threshold significant wave height of 0 3 m i e h s t h r 0 3 m the mean values of the normalized significant wave height h ˆ s are very close to 1 in the middle of the fjord 1000 m x 3800 m in the north part x 3800 m the mean values of h ˆ s decrease rapidly while in the south part x 1000 m the mean values of h ˆ s decrease relatively slowly from about 0 95 to 085 the standard deviations of h ˆ s have a smallest value of about 0 02 in the middle of the fjord different from the mean values of h ˆ s the standard deviation of h ˆ s increase gradually from the middle of the fjord to both ends the largest value of the standard deviations of h ˆ s are located in the north end about 0 16 the mean values and standard deviations of h ˆ s for the threshold significant wave height of 0 6 m h s t h r 0 6 m have similar trends compared to those with the threshold significant wave height of 0 3 m h s t h r 0 3 m fig 15 shows the contour maps of mean values and standard deviations of normalized peak period t ˆ p across the fjord where only waves coming from east are considered here the mean values of t ˆ p across the fjord are larger than 0 98 while the standard deviations of t ˆ p is smaller than 0 03 in the middle and south part of the fjord x 3000 m in other part of the fjord the standard deviations of t ˆ p are slightly larger but still less than 0 06 the standard deviations of t ˆ p under the threshold significant wave height of 0 6 m h s t h r 0 6 m is smaller than that under the threshold significant wave height of 0 3 m h s t h r 0 3 m therefore the peak period across the fjord are almost identical for waves coming from east and with a significant wave height larger than 0 3 m the wave directions across the fjord also present a pattern for wave coming from east and with a significant wave height larger than 0 3 m as shown in fig 16 fig 16 depicts the contour maps of mean values and standard deviations of normalized wave directions θ ˆ w a across the fjord the mean values of θ ˆ w a increase gradually from about 15 in the south end to 25 in the north end a relatively rapid increase is also found in the area close to the north end x 3800 m the standard deviations of θ ˆ w a increases gradually from the middle of the fjord to both ends and from east to west the values of standard deviations of θ ˆ w a can reach about 6 which is fairly large compared to the corresponding mean values of θ ˆ w a in addition the standard deviation of θ ˆ w a under the threshold significant wave height of 0 6 m are slightly smaller than those under the threshold significant wave height of 0 3 m figs 14 16 present the contour maps of wave parameters h ˆ s t ˆ p θ ˆ w a across the fjord for waves coming from east and with a significant wave height larger than 0 3 m figs 17 and 18 present the contour maps of wind parameters u ˆ w θ ˆ w i compared to the contour maps of mean values and standard deviations of wave parameters the contour maps of mean values and standard deviations of wind parameters present much greater variations across the fjord it can be found in fig 17 that under the threshold significant wave height of 0 3 m h s t h r 0 3 m the mean values of normalized mean wind speed u ˆ w varies from 0 7 to 1 2 across the fjord while the corresponding standard deviations of u ˆ w can reach approximately 0 5 significantly large variations of mean values and standard deviations of u ˆ w are mainly observed in the north part of the fjord x 2000m in the south part these variations are relatively smaller compared to those in the north part the standard deviations of u ˆ w are approximately less than 0 25 similar variations in mean values and standard deviations of u ˆ w are also found under the threshold significant wave height of 0 6 m h s t h r 0 6 m these variations are slightly smaller than those under the threshold significant wave height of 0 3 m the mean values and standard deviations of normalized wind direction θ ˆ w i also demonstrate remarkable variations in the north part of the fjord x 2500m as shown in fig 18 the mean values of θ ˆ w i vary from 30 to 10 and the corresponding standard deviations of θ ˆ w i are larger than 30 and can even reach 100 in the south part the mean values of θ ˆ w i is about 10 while the standard deviation of θ ˆ w i are between 20 to 30 the variations of mean values of standard deviations of θ ˆ w i in the south part are much smaller compared to those in the north part 5 correlation of environmental parameters along a potential road route this section addresses the correlation of environmental parameters based on the hindcast data correlation is usually described by the correlation coefficient which is a statistical measure of linear relationship between two variables a correlation coefficient of 1 means a perfect positive linear relationship between two variables from design of point view of floating bridges the correlation of environmental parameters along the potential routes of floating brides are of great interest for the considered fjord several floating bridge concepts have been proposed and studied included end anchored curved floating bridges and side anchored straight floating bridges in this study the potential route for side anchored floating bridges are considered this route is a straight line with y 0 as shown in figs 1 and 7 environmental parameters at various grid points along the potential route considered are extracted from the hindcast data including significant wave height peak period mean wave direction mean wind speed and mean wind direction the correlation of environmental parameters are studied by considering two dominant wave directions i e from northwest and from east the threshold significant wave height at the reference point is chosen to be 0 3 m the correlation matrix of wave and wind parameters among different grid points along the bridge route are thus estimated 5 1 correlation of environmental parameters with waves from northwest the correlation matrix of environmental parameters along the bridge route is first analyzed for waves from northwest fig 19 presents the correlation matrix of significant wave height peak period and mean wave direction along the bridge route in general very high correlations i e correlation coefficient greater than 0 95 are observed in these wave parameters among different pairs of points along the bridge route except between grid points located in the south part and grid points in the north part the peak period and mean wave direction at grid points in the south part x 3000m have relatively small correlation with those in the north part regarding the peak period only grid points located in the north with x 4000m have a relatively small correlation with the other grid points fig 20 shows the correlation matrix of mean wind speed and mean wind direction among different grid points along the bridge route the correlation matrix of wind parameters differ greatly from those of wave parameters shown in fig 19 high correlations in mean wind speed are only observed between grid points that are close or are both located in the south part x 2500m very low correlation with a correlation coefficient less than 0 1 are found between grid points located in the south part and those located in the north part regarding the mean wind direction relatively high correlation coefficient is only observed between very close grid points while the correlation coefficient among most grid points are close to 0 this implies the mean wind direction along the bridge route has extremely weak correlation 5 2 correlation of environmental parameters with waves from east the correlation matrix of wave and wind parameters along the bridge route is also analyzed considering waves from east as shown in figs 21 and 22 fig 21 shows the correlation matrix of significant wave height peak period and mean wave direction along the bridge route considering waves from east two points along the bridge route with a distance less than about 1500 m have a correlation coefficient larger than 0 95 in significant wave height implying a very high correlation the correlation decreases as the distance increases the combination of point located at the south end and the other point at the north end gives a smallest correlation in significant wave height with a correlation coefficient of about 0 72 similar trends are also observed in the mean wave direction but a high correlation in the south part requires a shorter distance between two points considered the peak period has very high correlation among the whole bridge route which is different from those shown fig 19 b with waves from northwest the correlation matrix of mean wind speed and mean wind direction for waves from east are shown in fig 22 relatively high correlations in mean wind speed are observed in the south part which is similar as those shown in fig 20 a with waves from northwest additionally the correlation coefficients illustrated in fig 22 a are overall larger than those shown in fig 20 a different from the correlation of mean wind direction for waves from north west shown in fig 20 b the correlation of mean wind direction for waves from east are high in the south part 6 discussions this study addresses the evaluation of inhomogeneity in wind and wave conditions in the bjørnafjord based on 16 year hindcast data the wave data significant wave height peak period and mean wave direction were simulated by using the swan model which is developed based on the phase averaged energy balance equation therefore the swan model cannot provide the coherence spectra between any two points theoretically coherence spectra can be calculated by using a phase resolved wave model such as potential flow based method and cfd based method the wave direction distribution is not addressed in this paper however it should be noted that although the swan model cannot provide the coherence spectra it is much more efficient than the phase resolved wave models and is thus suitable for large scale long term simulations besides main features of the wave field at each point e g significant wave height peak period and mean wave direction are captured by the swan model these wave data are very important for uls ultimate limit state design check of floating bridge the wind data mean wind speed and direction were simulated by using the wrf model the wrf model is also a phase averaged flow model that can provides the hourly averaged wind speed at 10 m height while the wind shear turbulence intensity are not accounted for yet besides the coherence spectra of wind speed between two points in the space are not considered either these wind data can be achieved by carrying out a 3d phase resolved simulations e g cfd which is unfortunately extremely time consuming and not suitable for engineering application from point view of uls design check of floating bridges the mean wind speed plays an important role as a whole though the present study does not provide a complete description of inhomogeneous wind and wave conditions in the fjord it highlights the long term spatial inhomogeneity in key wind and wave parameters which are of great significance and useful for assessing the effects inhomogeneous environmental conditions on dynamic responses of floating bridges 7 conclusions long term spatial inhomogeneity in wind and wave parameters for environmental conditions in a norwegian fjord is evaluated in this study for design of floating bridges based on 16 year hindcast wind and wave data the wave conditions are mainly characterized by significant wave height peak period and mean wave direction while the wind conditions are mainly described by mean wind speed and wind direction the wind and wave data are numerically simulated by using the wrf model and swan model respectively the accuracy of simulated wave data is first validated by comparison against field measurements the time series of simulated h s have an overall good agreement with the measured h s at all three wave buoy overall good consistency in the accuracy of simulation h s is also observed for waves with a significant wave height larger than 0 6 m model uncertainty of significant wave height at the three wave buoy are fairly close with a mean value of approximately 0 77 and a cov of about 0 23 inhomogeneity in wind and wave parameters within the potential area for deploying floating bridges are revealed by contour maps of normalized values two threshold value of significant wave height i e 0 3 m and 0 6 m and two dominant wave directions i e waves from northwest and from east are considered when waves come from northwest significant wave height and peak period are fairly close in the south part and decrease gradually towards the north end mean wave direction decreases from south end to north end mean wind speed has a relatively small variation in the south part and a great variation in the north part so do the mean wind direction regarding waves from east similar trends in the wave and wind parameters are observed but with slightly smaller variations compared to those with waves from northwest besides standard deviations of the wind and wave parameters are generally small in the south part and become relatively large in the north part especially for the wind parameters correlation of wind and wave parameters along a potential bridge route is analyzed by considering waves with significant wave height greater than 0 3 m and two dominant wave directions i e waves from northwest and from east it is found that distance between points greatly affects their associated correlations especially when these two points are located in the south part and close to the north end separately for waves from northwest wave parameters in the south part have high correlations while for waves from east distance between points less than 1500 m can lead to high correlations in significant wave height and mean wave direction peak period is highly correlated when waves from east wind parameters are less correlated than the wave parameters mean wind speed is to some extent correlated in the south part to conclude long term spatial inhomogeneity in wind and wave parameters in the fjord is revealed by contour maps in this study together with the long term joint distribution of wind and wave parameters this study provides the environmental basis for evaluating the effects of inhomogeneous environmental conditions on extreme loads for uls and cyclic loads for fls which are important for safety design of floating bridges based on present study inhomogeneous environmental load effects of floating brides will be investigated in the
