2730,although evidence of ecosystem productivity to vapor pressure deficit vpd and soil moisture sm is abundant their respective effects remain unclear due to tightly land atmosphere interactions in china the spatial heterogeneity in eco hydrosphere has further impeded our understanding of ecosystem productivity in response to climate change this study aimed to assess ecosystem productivity in china during 2001 to 2016 using solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence sif sif corresponded well with gross primary productivity gpp and was strongly related to vpd and sm the land atmosphere interaction mechanism was more notable near the agro pastoral ecotone which was reflected in the stronger sm vpd coupling effect on vegetation and more significant effect of vpd suppressing sif and sm promoting sif we decoupled sm and vpd by equal width binning of percentiles at a monthly scale sif tended to increase and decrease with increasing vpd in sm bins accounting for 47 59 and 52 41 of the total vegetated area respectively whereas photosynthesis tended to increase and decrease with increasing sm in vpd bins accounting for 62 18 and 37 82 of the total vegetated area respectively during 2001 to 2016 vpd and sm had a dominant effect on sif in 52 31 and 47 69 of china respectively which occurred along a latitudinal gradient however since 2007 which was identified as the point of accelerated vegetation greening in china the dominant factor of vegetation productivity has shifted from vpd to sm in terms of respective contributions and dominated areas our results emphasize an increasingly important role of sm in china though the additive effects of vpd cannot be negligible we conclude that the clarification of the shifting roles of sm and vpd in terrestrial ecosystem allows for more accurate prediction of vegetation productivity at a regional scale and provides greater insights into interactions between vegetation and climate keywords vegetation soil moisture vapor pressure deficit solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence decoupling china data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction vegetation is an indispensable component of terrestrial ecosystems that plays an important role in water and energy cycling as well as information transfer foley et al 2000 seneviratne et al 2010 vegetation dynamics reflect the direct feedback of the environment to global climate change and human activities and in this system regulate the exchange of energy between the atmosphere water and land li et al 2018a li et al 2018b seneviratne et al 2010 several abiotic factors contribute to vegetation dynamics including soil moisture sm vapor pressure deficit vpd precipitation and temperature dang et al 2022 deng et al 2020 liu et al 2020a liu et al 2020b von buttlar et al 2018 zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2021b the interaction between sm and precipitation strongly influences terrestrial water and energy cycles eltahir 2011 holgate et al 2019 meng et al 2014 sehler et al 2019 zheng and eltahir 1998 though sm is potentially a better indicator of water availability liu et al 2013 vpd is a composite indicator that correlates well with temperature and relative humidity castellv√≠ et al 1996 ficklin and novick 2017 jain et al 2022 and is an important factor in vegetation dynamics he et al 2022 thus more attention is given to the roles of sm and vpd in terrestrial ecosystem productivity mitchell et al 2015 song et al 2020 however due to tight coupling through land atmosphere interactions it remains challenging to disentangle the respective effects of vpd and sm rigden et al 2020 zhou et al 2019a and the coincident impacts of photosynthetic processes gonsamo et al 2019 yu et al 2022 yuan et al 2019 used four global climate datasets and two satellite based models to quantify the effects of vpd on global terrestrial primary productivity and concluded that a continued increase in global vpd promotes vegetation degradation liu et al 2020a liu et al 2020b demonstrated that sm was the dominant factor of dryness stress in ecosystem productivity at a global scale by eliminating the coincident impacts of photosynthetically active radiation par and the fraction of par fpar absorbed by plants lu et al 2022 found that vpd had a greater intensity and area of effect than sm in determining productivity compound events such as sm deficits and high vpd are expected to become more frequent and extreme especially in the northern hemisphere where the negative impacts of sm exceed those of vpd zhou et al 2019b it is therefore important that an effective framework to interpret vegetation dynamics at regional scales needs to be developed at the regional scale considerable spatial heterogeneity in the coupled relationship between vpd and sm has been reported the negative effect of a high vpd has been recorded in many regions carnicer et al 2013 restaino et al 2016 however green et al 2020 indicated that a high vpd promoted photosynthesis in equatorial amazonian rainforest areas yu et al 2022 also found that high vpd could promote photosynthesis in communities dominated by grasses and forests among other vegetation types in the dryland areas of central asia dang et al 2022 showed that elevated levels of sm had a negative effect on vegetation at high latitudes in the northern hemisphere in china spatiotemporal variation in topography temperature and precipitation have led to the establishment of a wide range of complex vegetation types zhou et al 2020a zhou et al 2020b zhou et al 2020c covering 15 of the global land area china is a particularly important terrestrial carbon sink thus it is important that we elucidate the respective effects of vpd and sm on vegetation dynamics several vegetation indices vis that make use of the inverse relationship between red and near infrared such as the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and enhanced vegetation index evi can be used to investigate terrestrial ecosystem dynamics and especially vegetation cover however ndvi is limited by its nonlinear and saturated relationships with green biomass and slow response to changes in photosynthesis camps valls et al 2021 evi was developed to compensate for this by using information from other spectral bands but the saturation problem remains huete et al 2002 solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence sif is a recently developed state of the art method for monitoring photosynthesis in terrestrial ecosystems aasen et al 2019 sif is a long wave signal emitted by chlorophyll inside the plant after absorbing solar energy which can accurately characterize the physiological state of the vegetation mohammed et al 2019 sun et al 2018 compared to other vis that estimate the energy reflected from vegetation sif is based on the energy released from vegetation and provides a more direct estimate of physiological processes some studies have shown a strong linear relationship between sif and gross primary productivity gpp which could enhance the accuracy of regional and global estimates li et al 2018a li et al 2018b zhou et al 2020a zhou et al 2020b zhou et al 2020c many studies have used sif as a proxy for gpp to study the dynamic response of vegetation to climate change meanwhile sif can capture seasonal variation in gpp and is much more robust than traditional vis particularly during the early and late growing seasons wagle et al 2016 wang et al 2019 in addition a series of studies have reported the superiority of sif in tracking seasonal changes in photosynthesis across different ecosystems and in identifying drought responses li et al 2020 liu et al 2022 and is considered to be a novel indicator for plant photosynthetic activity zhan et al 2020 in summary accurate representation of terrestrial ecosystem productivity and explicit elucidation of driving factors have been the hotspots in the study of global climate change ecosystem security and the carbon cycle therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 analyze the spatiotemporal variation of vegetation cover using global gridded sif data from 2001 to 2016 2 decouple the respective effects of sm and vpd on sif and 3 identify the dominant factors affecting vegetation dynamics in china 2 materials and methods 2 1 datasets 2 1 1 vegetation indices gross primary productivity

atmospheric contamination from aerosols and clouds moreover sif data from the orbiting carbon observatory 2 oco 2 shows greater potential than traditional vis and light use efficiency models for predicting gpp li et al 2018a li et al 2018b li and xiao 2019 however the application of the oco 2 sif is limited by low spatial and temporal resolutions zhang et al 2018 generated a global spatially continuous all sky condition sif csif by training a neural network with surface reflectance from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and oco 2 sif datasets thus we used the all sky

growing seasons issue we have processed the data by masking the values of csif 0 05 mw m2 nm sr to ensure the presence of vegetation in the study area 2 1 2 climate factors to calculate the vpd from

1 long term trend analysis a least squares linear regression model was used to investigate the trends in vegetation climate factors and sm at the pixel scale from 2001 to 2016 with the following equation 1 slope n i 1 n i a i i 1 n i i 1 n a i n i 1 n i 2 i 1 n i 2 where slope represents a linear trend ai represents the yearly vegetation indices climate factors and sm in year i n is the number of time series vegetation climate factors and sm showed a positive trend if slope 0 and a negative trend if slope 0 2 2 2 z score normalization to minimize the effects of data of different sizes and ranges we applied a z score normalization which does not change the characteristics of the data the data was normalized using the standard deviation for 2001 2016 the standardized anomalies were calculated as follows wang et al 2019 zhao et al 2021 2 z i j t x i j t x i j œÉ i j where z i j t are the normalized anomalies of the sample pixel i j at time t x i j t is the initial value of sample pixel i j at time t x i j is the mean of sample pixel i j and œÉ i j is the standard deviation of sample pixel i j 2 2 3 calculation of vapor pressure deficit monthly vpd hpa was calculated by subtracting the monthly actual water vapor pressure avp from the monthly saturation water vapor pressure svp svp and avp were calculated according to the penman formula and the method recommended by ding et al 2018 respectively 3 v p d s v p a v p 4 s v p 6 11 e 17 27 t 273 3 t 5 a v p shum p r e s 0 622 s h u m where shum represents specific humidity g g 1 pres represents air pressure hpa and t represents air temperature c monthly climate data including air temperature air pressure and specific humidity was derived from the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd 2 2 4 decoupling of vpd and sm in order to decouple the effects of sm and vpd we used equal width binning as described by liu et al 2020 the percentage sm per month was divided into five intervals for each pixel 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 80 100 and the difference between the highest vpd and the lowest vpd corresponding to the sif for each interval was calculated and defined as Œ¥sif vpd sm 6 Œ¥ s i f v p d s m 1 i i 1 i sif i n i m a x sif i n i m i n where i is the number of populated sm bins i is the specific sm bin number and ni max and ni min are the maximum and minimum vpd bin numbers in sm bin i a similar procedure was followed for the calculation of Œ¥sif sm vpd 7 Œ¥ s i f s m v p d 1 j j 1 j sif j m j m a x sif j m j m i n where j is the number of populated vpd bins j is the specific vpd bin number mj max and mj min are the maximum and minimum sm bin numbers in vpd bin j the mean value of the bins was used to quantify the respective effects of sm and vpd on sif to reveal the relationship between sm vpd and sif an equal width binning method was used when investigating the impact of sm on sif vpd was divided into 5 bins according to percentages while sm and sif also changed accordingly we utilized the sif corresponding to the largest sm minus the sif corresponding to the smallest sm in each vpd bin and performed a weighted average of five bins to clarify the relationship between sm and sif this value was defined as Œ¥sif sm vpd if Œ¥sif sm vpd is greater than zero it indicates that high sm promotes vegetation photosynthesis and if it is less than zero it indicates that high sm suppresses vegetation photosynthesis similarly we utilized the sif corresponding to the largest vpd minus the sif corresponding to the smallest vpd in each sm bin and performed a weighted average of five bins to clarify the relationship between vpd and sif the flowchart that illustrates the main ideas of this study including data sources pre processing and methods is shown in fig 1 3 results 3 1 performance evaluation of sif in china to reduce uncertainty due to scale mismatch ndvi sif and gpp were averaged as annual datasets a pearson correlation was performed for ndvi and gpp versus sif and gpp at the pixel scale fig 2 sif and ndvi correlated positively with gpp in 84 77 and 79 73 of the vegetated areas in china the temporal correlation between sif and gpp was also stronger than that between ndvi and gpp p 0 05 0 5 r 0 7 accounted for 28 57 and 17 75 0 7 r 0 9 accounted for 26 10 and 13 38 0 9 r accounted for 2 10 and 0 87 respectively fig 2c in terms of spatial distribution there was a significantly better correlation between sif and gpp than ndvi and gpp especially in southern and southeastern china indicating that sif is more suitable to capture vegetation change fig 2d shows strong associations between r sif gpp and r ndvi gpp with the correlation coefficient concentrated in the range of 0 5 0 8 however the slope of the scatter plot was 1 indicating a higher r sif gpp value at a given level of r ndvi gpp our results indicate that sif performs better at estimating gpp in china than ndvi therefore sif alone was used as the indicator of terrestrial vegetation in the following analyses 3 2 long term variation characteristics of sif vpd and sm in terms of temporal changes the annual mean sif in china increased at a rate of 0 0006 r 0 70 p 0 01 fig 3 ranging from 0 1338 mw m2 nm sr a 1 2003 to 0 1516 mw m2 nm sr a 1 2013 meanwhile the annual mean sm and vpd showed a slight decreasing trend with rates of 0 0005 m3 m3 a 1 and 0 0031 hpa a 1 respectively overall the annual mean sif had a significant positive trend indicating a slow but persistent trend of vegetation greening in china consistent with the findings of zhao et al 2022 during 2001 to 2016 the changes in sm and vpd were inconspicuous but led to a rapid increase in sif sif showed little fluctuation before 2007 p 0 05 the rapid greening increase in sif after 2007 was caused by decreased vpd and increased sm levels see section 3 3 according to a linear regression model the trends of sif sm and vpd from 2001 to 2016 were spatially heterogeneous with northeastern and southern china exhibiting higher multi year average sif values compared to northern and southwestern china fig 4 a b as shown in fig 4b 77 0 of the vegetated areas increased in sif from 2001 to 2016 while the sif in parts of the qinghai tibet plateau and yangtze river basin showed little change and a slight downward trend in some areas the multi year vpd values were higher in the north and northwest compared to the northeast and south fig 4c d overall the vpd in northwestern china and the qinghai tibet plateau region showed an increasing trend from 2001 to 2016 most of the northeastern region showed a decreasing trend in vpd the spatial pattern of sm was similar to that of sif northeastern and southern china exhibited higher sm values compared to northern and southwestern china fig 4e f overall the spatially averaged sm in southeastern and northeastern china increased from 2001 to 2016 most of northern and southeastern china showed a decreasing trend in sm further studies are needed to explain the main causes of vegetation greening and the interaction between sm and vpd in china 3 3 turning point for accelerated vegetation greening in china in the present study we observed that the sif data could be divided into two major periods fig 5 a the first period 2001 2007 showed a slow increase in sif 0 0004 mw m2 nm sr a 1 and the second period 2007 2016 showed an abnormal rate of increase 0 001 mw m2 nm sr a 1 annual mean sif in china showed an increasing trend from 2001 which increased significantly after 2007 p 0 5 indicating a turning point for accelerated vegetation greening furthermore avp showed a decreasing trend before 2007 0 04 hpa a 1 and an increasing rate 0 02 hpa a 1 after however svp showed a slowly increasing trend before 2007 0 029 hpa a 1 and tended to decrease after the turning point 0 031 hpa a 1 atmospheric moisture levels increased since 2007 fig 5d which resulted in an increasing trend in the annual mean vpd before 2007 and a significant decreasing trend after 2007 p 0 01 sm showed a decreasing trend before 2007 fig 5c and an increase after 2007 fig 5b therefore the increase in sif after 2007 may have been caused by the combined effect of the increase in sm and the decrease in vpd 3 4 coupling of sm and vpd confounds attribution of vegetation dynamics vpd measures the difference between svp and avp at air temperature which can be used to indicate the impact of water stress on vegetation growth and is a key determinant of plant photosynthesis eamus et al 2013 sm is a direct source of water for vegetation and determines water availability as shown in fig 6 a 52 83 of the sm area was positively correlated with sif and concentrated to the northwestern region of xinjiang northeastern region of inner mongolia and guangdong guangxi region 47 17 of the sm area was negatively correlated with sif and was concentrated in the central and northeastern regions of china fig 6b shows that 52 05 of the area had a positive correlation between vpd and sif while 47 95 was negative compound events of high sm and low vpd or vice versa occurred simultaneously fig 6c d the negative correlation between sm and vpd accounted for 92 13 of the area among which 75 40 of regions had correlation coefficients of 0 3 meanwhile the effect of vpd suppressing sif and sm promoting sif is stronger and more significant near the agro pastoral ecotone in china most humid southern regions with low multi year average vpd and high multi year average sm sm suppressed sif and vpd promoted sif such as chongqing jiangsu hubei and anhui in arid northern regions this mechanism was in turn such as inner mongolia hebei and shanxi spatial heterogeneity was evident in the correlations between sm vpd and sif in china and the respective effects of sm and vpd on sif were difficult to distinguish which is consistent with the findings of liu et al 2020 3 5 decoupling of vpd and sm in china according to the above results there was a high negative correlation between sm and vpd at the annual scale and the coupling was relatively clear without decoupling the relationship between sm and vpd it was difficult to conclude whether the change in sif was caused by sm vpd or both to elucidate the dominant influences on vegetation dynamics in china it is necessary to decouple the effects of sm and vpd from standardized anomaly data fig 7 shows a decrease in the correlation between sm and vpd from the annual to the monthly scale however when binning the data into five bins according to the percentile of either sm or vpd per pixel the correlation coefficients of sm and vpd in each bin were approximately zero fig 7 spatially the correlation coefficients between sm and vpd mostly decreased from 0 3 to 0 3 in each bin fig 8 which indicates an effective decoupling of effects at a monthly scale in both sm and vpd bins we hypothesize that if the change in vpd plays a dominant role in vegetation greening the sif dynamics would be significant in sm bins but not in vpd bins regardless of changes in sm or vpd the opposite would hold true if sm played the dominant role in addition there would be no significant variation in the sif in different vpd bins compared to sm bins and vice versa the correlation between sm vpd and sif was spatially heterogeneous therefore our hypothesis could be divided into four scenarios fig s1 where scenario one indicates that high vpd suppress sif and high sm promotes sif scenario two indicates that high vpd suppress sif and low sm promotes sif scenario three indicates that high vpd promotes sif and high sm promotes sif and scenario four indicates that high vpd promotes sif and low sm promotes sif in this study several pixels were assessed in the decoupling of sm and vpd pixel 1 40 n 122 e accorded with scenario one fig 9 in the sm bins sif tended to decrease with increasing vpd and high vpd suppressed photosynthesis in the vpd bins the change in sif was non significant and increased slightly with increasing sm this indicates that vpd plays a dominant role in sif for pixel 2 51 n 125 5 e fig s2 where vegetation type was mainly forests sif tended to increase with increasing vpd in sm bins and high vpd promoted photosynthesis probably because high vpd did not reduce stomatal conductance but increased transpiration and co2 uptake at present the research view of vpd suppressing stomatal is relatively uniform but the mechanism of vpd increasing on vegetation transpiration rate is still controversial which may be related to vegetation types grossiord et al 2020 studies have shown that forests increase photosynthesis with increasing vpd suggesting that the impact of vpd on sif differs depending on the vegetation type green et al 2020 yu et al 2022 for pixel 3 22 n 111 e fig s3 the sif fluctuated in a smaller range in the sm bins in contrast sif tended to increase with sm in the vpd bins which dominated the change in sif the dominant effect of vpd and sm in china varied spatially for pixel 1 the vpd effect was stronger Œ¥sif vpd sm 1 78 than the sm effect Œ¥sif sm vpd 0 05 fig 9c the change in sif was obvious along a vpd gradient while it did not change along a sm gradient fig 9d for pixel 2 fig s2c similarly the vpd effect was stronger Œ¥sif vpd sm 1 75 than the sm effect Œ¥sif sm vpd 0 04 however in pixel 3 sm had a stronger effect on sif dynamics fig s2c therefore we focused on the differences in the effects of sm and vpd on the sif in different regions across china 3 6 disentangling the respective effects of vpd and sm to further illustrate this hypothesis we calculated Œ¥sif vpd sm and Œ¥sif sm vpd at the pixel level across china Œ¥sif vpd sm 0 accounted for 47 59 of the total vegetation area in china fig 10 indicating that high vpd promoted sif and Œ¥sif vpd sm 0 accounted for 52 41 of the area indicating that high vpd suppressed sif especially in arable areas in northern and northeast china Œ¥sif sm vpd 0 accounted for 62 18 of the area indicating that high sm promoted sif which is consistent with previous studies d odorico et al 2007 he et al 2021 Œ¥sif sm vpd 0 accounted for 37 82 of the area mainly distributed in the central and northeast regions of china to compare the relative importance of vpd and sm on the sif we calculated the absolute difference for each pixel Œ¥sif was greater less than 0 indicating that the absolute value of Œ¥sif vpd sm was greater less than the absolute value of Œ¥sif sm vpd and that the effect of vpd on sif was greater less than the effect of sm on sif the areas where the intensity of the effect of vpd on sif exceeded the effect of sm Œ¥sif vpd sm 0 were mainly in the southeastern coastal region north china plain and northeastern forest fig 11 accounting for 52 31 of the total vegetation area the areas where the intensity of sm on sif exceeded vpd Œ¥sif vpd sm 0 were mainly in southwest and northwest china accounting for 47 69 of the total vegetation area compared with sm vpd played the dominant role with regard to the area and intensity of the effect Œ¥sif 0 007 mw m2 nm sr therefore in china vpd was more important to vegetation productivity from 2001 to 2016 than sm these results were consistent with a partial correlation analysis fig s6 in addition to eliminate the potential interference caused by par and fpar as observed by lu et al 2022 we used sif yield eq s1 and found that radiation did not affect our previous analysis and that the decoupled effects of vpd and sm were representative of sif changes in china fig s7 according to eqs 6 and 7 we also calculated the values of Œ¥sif vpd sm and Œ¥sif sm vpd before and after the turning point for accelerated vegetation greening respectively and further analyzed the dominant factors of vegetation change by subtracting the absolute values of the two variables that is Œ¥sif bt vpd level Œ¥sif at vpd level Œ¥sif bt sm level and Œ¥sif at sm level if the value is negative that is Œ¥sif bt sm level and Œ¥sif at sm level it represents a stronger role of sm and if it is positive it represents a stronger role of vpd the impact of vpd Œ¥sif bt vpd level 0 038 mw m2 nm sr Œ¥sif at vpd level 0 024 mw m2 nm sr and sm Œ¥sif bt sm level 0 028 mw m2 nm sr Œ¥sif at sm level 0 034 mw m2 nm sr on vegetation productivity decreased and increased respectively after the turning point year 2007 which suggests that strength of sm effects exceeds that of vpd effects and may further increase in future figs 11b c and 12 the rapid increase in sif after 2007 contributed to most of the accelerated greening of vegetation from 2001 to 2016 due to the greater roles played by sm after 2007 the significant increase in the effect of sm on vegetation was reflected in northeastern sichuan province and the southern guangdong guangxi region whereas the slight increase in the effect of vpd on vegetation was observed in northeastern china and the southeastern coastal region the impact of sm on ecosystems exceeds that of vpd at the global scale thus the role of sm remains essential to vegetation dynamics liu et al 2020 our study emphasizes that sm plays an increasingly important role in china furthermore as shown in figs s8 and s9 the result of the ancillary evaluation using gldas indicated the impact of vpd Œ¥sif bt vpd level 0 039 mw m2 nm sr Œ¥sif at vpd level 0 024 mw m2 nm sr and sm Œ¥sif bt sm level 0 020 mw m2 nm sr Œ¥sif at sm level 0 032 mw m2 nm sr on vegetation productivity decreased and increased respectively after the turning point year 2007 similarly as shown in figs s10 and s11 the result of the ancillary evaluation using terraclimate datasets also indicated the impact of vpd Œ¥sif bt vpd level 0 037 mw m2 nm sr Œ¥sif at vpd level 0 024 mw m2 nm sr and sm Œ¥sif bt sm level 0 024 mw m2 nm sr Œ¥sif at sm level 0 037 mw m2 nm sr on vegetation productivity decreased and increased respectively after the turning point year 2007 the result is consistent with our study obtained by the cmfd and era5 land emphasis that impact of sm on vegetation exceeds that of vpd and may further increase in future moreover we used fluxnet observation data including four sites in china to perform a cross validation in our study as shown in fig s12 the results showed that at the cn cha site 42 4025 n 128 0958 e the dominant vegetation type was mixed forests vpd promoted vegetation photosynthesis and sm suppressed vegetation photosynthesis at the cn qia site 26 7414 n 115 0581 e and the cn din site 23 1733 n 112 5361 e the dominant vegetation types were evergreen needleleaf forests and evergreen broadleaf forests respectively vpd promoted vegetation photosynthesis and sm promoted vegetation photosynthesis at the cn ha2 site 37 6086 n 101 3269 e the dominant vegetation type was permanent wetlands vpd promoted vegetation photosynthesis and sm suppressed vegetation photosynthesis these are all consistent with our results obtained by the cmfd and era5 land 4 discussion the land atmosphere interactions are reflected in different research scales whether field scale or global scale baker et al 2021 suni et al 2015 zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2021b in the context of land atmosphere interactions the spatiotemporal variations of vpd and sm significantly affect the terrestrial ecosystem from a worldwide perspective vpd is significantly negatively correlated with terrestrial productivity the global annual mean vpd rapidly increased during the 20th century leading to a slow decrease in the global annual mean ndvi yuan et al 2019 and sm derived most of the world s interannual variations of land carbon absorption green et al 2019 several studies have attempted to reveal the respective impacts of sm and vpd on ecosystems though it remains challenging given the strong coupling of land atmosphere interactions entekhabi et al 1996 foley et al 2000 liu et al 2020a liu et al 2020b seneviratne et al 2010 additionally climate change will intensify further in the future increasing regional average temperature and soil moisture will complicate land atmosphere interactions according to the ipcc composite events such as the sm deficit and high vpd are expected to become more frequent and extreme in the northern hemisphere zhou et al 2019b the coupling relationship between sm and vpd becomes more complex in spatially variable geo climatic environments such as china giving an emphasis on the importance of accurate interpretation of vegetation dynamics at regional scales however our results differed from some global results as for forest systems shown in fig 10a in most of southern china where the vegetation type was mainly forests sif tended to increase with increasing vpd in sm bins indicating that the increasing vpd promoted photosynthesis this was probably due to the lower multi year average vpd in these areas and increased vpd did not reduce stomatal conductance but increased transpiration and co2 uptake yu et al 2022 and on the other hand vegetation roots systems as well as soil moisture affects the regulation of leaf water potential which is closely related to the stomatal activity mart√≠nez vilalta and garcia forner 2017 vegetation in forested areas has more vigorous root systems which can extract deeper soil moisture making them more likely to maintain higher leaf water potential and stomatal openness at higher vpd jiang et al 2020 konings and gentine 2017 meanwhile due to the high impact of subtropical anticyclones with frequent seasonal droughts in the south vpd may exacerbate water stress allowing more isohydric vegetation to improve water use efficiency and promote stomatal openness in deeper soil layers chen et al 2021a chen et al 2021b jiang et al 2020 recent studies have also shown that forest photosynthesis tends to increase with the increasing vpd doughty et al 2019 green et al 2020 yu et al 2022 grassland systems are mainly distributed in semi arid regions of china with low annual precipitation and poor soil water holding capacity which results in often high soil water limitation shallow rooted grasslands are more dependent on shallow soil water which evaporates much faster than deeper water under dry conditions zhang et al 2019 which can severely limit the maintenance of high leaf water potential leading to stomatal closure and thus lower gpp at higher vpd the deficiency of sm under drought conditions further enhances vpd by affecting temperature and moisture leading to a suppressive effect of vpd on gpp which is also reflected near the agro pastoral ecotone in this study furthermore as shown in fig 10b the positive effect of sm on sif was found in most areas in china accounting for 62 18 of the total vegetation areas with an exception of the arable areas in north china and the mountain area in northeast china which was similar to the results conducted by dang et al 2022 in the middle and high latitude of the northern hemisphere as for arable land concentrated in the northern plains crop roots mainly carry out autotrophic respiration and suppress photosynthesis due to the increased sm caused by irrigation huang et al 2018 xu et al 2021 vegetation at high latitudes is generally constrained by thermal conditions such as radiation and temperature therefore more precipitation and soil moisture are usually accompanied by lesss radiation and lower air temperature which thus exerts negative impact on plant growth guo et al 2015 jiao et al 2021 zeng et al 2022 excessive water supply may reduce chlorophyll soluble protein levels and rubisco activity and may increase the potential for photooxidative damage higher sm can indirectly reduce gpp by decreasing temperature chen et al 2021a chen et al 2021b yordanova and popova 2007 light limitation almost certainly reduces gpp considering the possibility of simultaneous wet and cloudy conditions rigden et al 2020 this could to some extent also explain the suppressive effect of sm in china s central and northeastern regions the dominant role of sm and vpd in vegetation greening exhibited significant spatial heterogeneities in china as shown in fig 11a in the greater khingan mountains in northeastern china where the forest was the dominant vegetation type vpd had a greater effect on sif than sm which was attributed to the deeper root system increased vpd provided sufficient energy temperature and solar radiation for photosynthesis in forests yu et al 2022 in arable areas in northern and northeastern china the effect of vpd on sif was greater than that of sm possibly because full irrigation reduced the dependence of crop growth on precipitation and sm several recent studies have shown that the negative effects of vpd on plant photosynthesis were more pronounced in agricultural areas with full irrigation yu et al 2022 in order to validate the feasibility of proposed statistical methods in explaining plant physiology we collaborated with in situ observations at four sites from fluxnet data which have been widely used to investigate vegetation and climate interactions relevant studies have used in situ observations from fluxnet as results validation or as input data for statistical analysis e g multiple linear regression machine learning etc to investigate the evolution of vegetation productivity in response to climate drivers wang et al 2022a wang et al 2022b however due to the few and sparsely distributed fluxnet sites it is expected that more observational networks and field scale experimental datasets will help to understand the physical mechanisms of sm and vpd interactions on long term vegetation dynamics in addition different vegetation types vary in response to climate chen et al 2021a chen et al 2021b guo et al 2020 jain et al 2022 in this study we did not estimate the effects of the different vegetation types in china different vegetation types will affect the temporal and spatial characteristics of sm and then affect vegetation gou and zhu 2021 dang et al 2022 found that the importance of sm and ts varies given different vegetation types liu et al 2020a liu et al 2020b found that sm was the dominant factor of drought stress in semi arid scrub and grassland however some studies have shown that the effect of soil moisture was significantly higher in cropland and forest but lower in shrubland and grassland ecosystems bai et al 2020 studies have shown that vpd has greater effects on grassland and forest compared to soil moisture lansu et al 2020 due to the abundant water in irrigated croplands vpd is the dominant factor limiting photosynthesis rigden et al 2020 however with the extension of water saving measures for irrigation the future full irrigation will decrease so the role of sm will be more important zhou et al 2020a zhou et al 2020b zhou et al 2020c by the end of the 20th century approximately 76 of the global regional vegetation area showed a greening trend with 47 showing significant greening p 0 05 dang et al 2022 as the world s most notably greening country china contributes 25 of the net increase in green leaf area globally during 2000 to 2017 chen et al 2019 piao et al 2015 found that the largest vegetation greening trend in china was generally located in north china as one of the sensitive regions of climate change in china and the area of the grain for green project ggp the loess plateau has contributed to the great vegetation greening and the vegetation of the loess plateau has changed abruptly since 2007 which was also identified as the turning point for accelerated vegetation greening in our study vegetation greening and afforestation in china will have an impact on hydrological feedback excessive vegetation greening will increase evapotranspiration which implies a decrease in runoff and soil moisture under constant precipitation conditions feng et al 2016 li et al 2018a li et al 2018b in some arid areas such as the loess plateau excessive soil moisture consumption by revegetation will limit sustainable water resource development feng et al 2016 the growth and development of vegetation in good hydrothermal conditions will increase the soil moisture consumption of vegetation in the future have a negative impact on vegetation growth and lead to drought zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2021b accelerated vegetation greening in china will influence the global carbon cycle significantly because the enhancement of vegetation growth in china plays an important role in the global carbon cycle piao et al 2009 therefore further research can be carried out accurately quantify the appropriate vegetation greening area and greening rate and make efforts to achieve the goal of carbon neutrality in china in 2060 5 conclusions this study aimed to decouple the effects of vpd and sm on vegetation productivity greening in china we analyzed vegetation dynamics using global reanalysis and satellite remote sensing data compared to the traditional greenness based vis sif performed better at capturing the change in vegetation dynamics using sm vpd and sif data from 2001 to 2016 we analyzed interannual variability and found that the turning point for accelerated vegetation greening in china i e 2007 was caused by a combination of a decrease in vpd and an increase in sm we successfully decoupled the effects of sm and vpd with equal width data binning we found that the relationship between sm and vpd decayed from annual to monthly scales and that vpd played a dominant role in 52 31 of the vegetated area in china during 2001 to 2016 in addition our results were spatially heterogeneous compared to findings at the global scale vpd suppressed photosynthesis in 52 41 of the total area and ecosystem productivity increased in areas where vpd declined mainly in the arable areas of north and northeast china sm promoted sif in 62 18 of the area mainly in central and northeast china in addition the influence of sm on terrestrial ecosystem productivity gradually increased after 2007 and superseded that of vpd as the dominant factor of vegetation productivity we conclude that the incorporation of the co relationship of sm and vpd in terrestrial ecosystem modeling allows for a more accurate prediction of vegetation productivity at a regional scale and provides greater insights into vegetation responses and feedback to climate

2730,although evidence of ecosystem productivity to vapor pressure deficit vpd and soil moisture sm is abundant their respective effects remain unclear due to tightly land atmosphere interactions in china the spatial heterogeneity in eco hydrosphere has further impeded our understanding of ecosystem productivity in response to climate change this study aimed to assess ecosystem productivity in china during 2001 to 2016 using solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence sif sif corresponded well with gross primary productivity gpp and was strongly related to vpd and sm the land atmosphere interaction mechanism was more notable near the agro pastoral ecotone which was reflected in the stronger sm vpd coupling effect on vegetation and more significant effect of vpd suppressing sif and sm promoting sif we decoupled sm and vpd by equal width binning of percentiles at a monthly scale sif tended to increase and decrease with increasing vpd in sm bins accounting for 47 59 and 52 41 of the total vegetated area respectively whereas photosynthesis tended to increase and decrease with increasing sm in vpd bins accounting for 62 18 and 37 82 of the total vegetated area respectively during 2001 to 2016 vpd and sm had a dominant effect on sif in 52 31 and 47 69 of china respectively which occurred along a latitudinal gradient however since 2007 which was identified as the point of accelerated vegetation greening in china the dominant factor of vegetation productivity has shifted from vpd to sm in terms of respective contributions and dominated areas our results emphasize an increasingly important role of sm in china though the additive effects of vpd cannot be negligible we conclude that the clarification of the shifting roles of sm and vpd in terrestrial ecosystem allows for more accurate prediction of vegetation productivity at a regional scale and provides greater insights into interactions between vegetation and climate keywords vegetation soil moisture vapor pressure deficit solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence decoupling china data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction vegetation is an indispensable component of terrestrial ecosystems that plays an important role in water and energy cycling as well as information transfer foley et al 2000 seneviratne et al 2010 vegetation dynamics reflect the direct feedback of the environment to global climate change and human activities and in this system regulate the exchange of energy between the atmosphere water and land li et al 2018a li et al 2018b seneviratne et al 2010 several abiotic factors contribute to vegetation dynamics including soil moisture sm vapor pressure deficit vpd precipitation and temperature dang et al 2022 deng et al 2020 liu et al 2020a liu et al 2020b von buttlar et al 2018 zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2021b the interaction between sm and precipitation strongly influences terrestrial water and energy cycles eltahir 2011 holgate et al 2019 meng et al 2014 sehler et al 2019 zheng and eltahir 1998 though sm is potentially a better indicator of water availability liu et al 2013 vpd is a composite indicator that correlates well with temperature and relative humidity castellv√≠ et al 1996 ficklin and novick 2017 jain et al 2022 and is an important factor in vegetation dynamics he et al 2022 thus more attention is given to the roles of sm and vpd in terrestrial ecosystem productivity mitchell et al 2015 song et al 2020 however due to tight coupling through land atmosphere interactions it remains challenging to disentangle the respective effects of vpd and sm rigden et al 2020 zhou et al 2019a and the coincident impacts of photosynthetic processes gonsamo et al 2019 yu et al 2022 yuan et al 2019 used four global climate datasets and two satellite based models to quantify the effects of vpd on global terrestrial primary productivity and concluded that a continued increase in global vpd promotes vegetation degradation liu et al 2020a liu et al 2020b demonstrated that sm was the dominant factor of dryness stress in ecosystem productivity at a global scale by eliminating the coincident impacts of photosynthetically active radiation par and the fraction of par fpar absorbed by plants lu et al 2022 found that vpd had a greater intensity and area of effect than sm in determining productivity compound events such as sm deficits and high vpd are expected to become more frequent and extreme especially in the northern hemisphere where the negative impacts of sm exceed those of vpd zhou et al 2019b it is therefore important that an effective framework to interpret vegetation dynamics at regional scales needs to be developed at the regional scale considerable spatial heterogeneity in the coupled relationship between vpd and sm has been reported the negative effect of a high vpd has been recorded in many regions carnicer et al 2013 restaino et al 2016 however green et al 2020 indicated that a high vpd promoted photosynthesis in equatorial amazonian rainforest areas yu et al 2022 also found that high vpd could promote photosynthesis in communities dominated by grasses and forests among other vegetation types in the dryland areas of central asia dang et al 2022 showed that elevated levels of sm had a negative effect on vegetation at high latitudes in the northern hemisphere in china spatiotemporal variation in topography temperature and precipitation have led to the establishment of a wide range of complex vegetation types zhou et al 2020a zhou et al 2020b zhou et al 2020c covering 15 of the global land area china is a particularly important terrestrial carbon sink thus it is important that we elucidate the respective effects of vpd and sm on vegetation dynamics several vegetation indices vis that make use of the inverse relationship between red and near infrared such as the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and enhanced vegetation index evi can be used to investigate terrestrial ecosystem dynamics and especially vegetation cover however ndvi is limited by its nonlinear and saturated relationships with green biomass and slow response to changes in photosynthesis camps valls et al 2021 evi was developed to compensate for this by using information from other spectral bands but the saturation problem remains huete et al 2002 solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence sif is a recently developed state of the art method for monitoring photosynthesis in terrestrial ecosystems aasen et al 2019 sif is a long wave signal emitted by chlorophyll inside the plant after absorbing solar energy which can accurately characterize the physiological state of the vegetation mohammed et al 2019 sun et al 2018 compared to other vis that estimate the energy reflected from vegetation sif is based on the energy released from vegetation and provides a more direct estimate of physiological processes some studies have shown a strong linear relationship between sif and gross primary productivity gpp which could enhance the accuracy of regional and global estimates li et al 2018a li et al 2018b zhou et al 2020a zhou et al 2020b zhou et al 2020c many studies have used sif as a proxy for gpp to study the dynamic response of vegetation to climate change meanwhile sif can capture seasonal variation in gpp and is much more robust than traditional vis particularly during the early and late growing seasons wagle et al 2016 wang et al 2019 in addition a series of studies have reported the superiority of sif in tracking seasonal changes in photosynthesis across different ecosystems and in identifying drought responses li et al 2020 liu et al 2022 and is considered to be a novel indicator for plant photosynthetic activity zhan et al 2020 in summary accurate representation of terrestrial ecosystem productivity and explicit elucidation of driving factors have been the hotspots in the study of global climate change ecosystem security and the carbon cycle therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 analyze the spatiotemporal variation of vegetation cover using global gridded sif data from 2001 to 2016 2 decouple the respective effects of sm and vpd on sif and 3 identify the dominant factors affecting vegetation dynamics in china 2 materials and methods 2 1 datasets 2 1 1 vegetation indices gross primary productivity

atmospheric contamination from aerosols and clouds moreover sif data from the orbiting carbon observatory 2 oco 2 shows greater potential than traditional vis and light use efficiency models for predicting gpp li et al 2018a li et al 2018b li and xiao 2019 however the application of the oco 2 sif is limited by low spatial and temporal resolutions zhang et al 2018 generated a global spatially continuous all sky condition sif csif by training a neural network with surface reflectance from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and oco 2 sif datasets thus we used the all sky

1 long term trend analysis a least squares linear regression model was used to investigate the trends in vegetation climate factors and sm at the pixel scale from 2001 to 2016 with the following equation 1 slope n i 1 n i a i i 1 n i i 1 n a i n i 1 n i 2 i 1 n i 2 where slope represents a linear trend ai represents the yearly vegetation indices climate factors and sm in year i n is the number of time series vegetation climate factors and sm showed a positive trend if slope 0 and a negative trend if slope 0 2 2 2 z score normalization to minimize the effects of data of different sizes and ranges we applied a z score normalization which does not change the characteristics of the data the data was normalized using the standard deviation for 2001 2016 the standardized anomalies were calculated as follows wang et al 2019 zhao et al 2021 2 z i j t x i j t x i j œÉ i j where z i j t are the normalized anomalies of the sample pixel i j at time t x i j t is the initial value of sample pixel i j at time t x i j is the mean of sample pixel i j and œÉ i j is the standard deviation of sample pixel i j 2 2 3 calculation of vapor pressure deficit monthly vpd hpa was calculated by subtracting the monthly actual water vapor pressure avp from the monthly saturation water vapor pressure svp svp and avp were calculated according to the penman formula and the method recommended by

represents air temperature c monthly climate data including air temperature air pressure and specific humidity was derived from the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd 2 2 4 decoupling of vpd and sm in order to decouple the effects of sm and vpd we used equal width binning as described by liu et al 2020 the percentage sm per month was divided into five intervals for each pixel 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 80 100 and the difference between the highest vpd and the lowest vpd corresponding to the sif for each interval was calculated and defined as Œ¥sif vpd sm 6 Œ¥ s i f v p d s m 1 i i 1 i sif i n i m a x sif i n i m i n where i is the number of populated sm bins i is the specific sm bin number and ni max and ni min are the maximum and minimum vpd bin numbers in sm bin i a similar procedure was followed for the calculation of Œ¥sif sm vpd 7 Œ¥ s i f s m v p d 1 j j 1 j sif j m j m a x sif j m j m i n where j is the number of populated vpd bins j is the specific vpd bin number mj max and mj min are the maximum and minimum sm bin numbers in vpd bin j the mean value of the bins was used to quantify the respective effects of sm and vpd on sif to reveal the relationship between sm vpd and sif an equal width binning method was used when investigating the impact of sm on sif vpd was divided into 5 bins according to percentages while sm and sif also changed accordingly we utilized the sif corresponding to the largest sm minus the sif corresponding to the smallest sm in each vpd bin and performed a weighted average of five bins to clarify the relationship between sm and sif this value was defined as Œ¥sif sm vpd if Œ¥sif sm vpd is greater than zero it indicates that high sm promotes vegetation photosynthesis and if it is less than zero it indicates that high sm suppresses vegetation photosynthesis similarly we utilized the sif corresponding to the largest vpd minus the sif corresponding to the smallest vpd in each sm bin and performed a weighted average of five bins to clarify the relationship between vpd and sif the flowchart that illustrates the main ideas of this study including data sources pre processing and methods is shown in fig 1 3 results 3 1 performance evaluation of sif in china to reduce uncertainty due to scale mismatch ndvi sif and gpp were averaged as annual datasets a pearson correlation was performed for ndvi and gpp versus sif and gpp at the pixel scale fig 2 sif and ndvi correlated positively with gpp in 84 77 and 79 73 of the vegetated areas in china the temporal correlation between sif and gpp was also stronger than that between ndvi and gpp p 0 05 0 5 r 0 7 accounted for 28 57 and 17 75 0 7 r 0 9 accounted for 26 10 and 13 38 0 9 r accounted for 2 10 and 0 87 respectively fig 2c in terms of spatial distribution there was a significantly better correlation between sif and gpp than ndvi and gpp especially in southern and southeastern china indicating that sif is more suitable to capture vegetation change fig 2d shows strong associations between r sif gpp and r ndvi gpp with the correlation coefficient concentrated in the range of 0 5 0 8 however the slope of the scatter plot was 1 indicating a higher r sif gpp value at a given level of r ndvi gpp our results indicate that sif performs better at estimating gpp in china than ndvi therefore sif alone was used as the indicator of terrestrial vegetation in the following analyses 3 2 long term variation characteristics of sif vpd and sm in terms of temporal changes the annual mean sif in china increased at a rate of 0 0006 r 0 70 p 0 01 fig 3 ranging from 0 1338 mw m2 nm sr a 1 2003 to 0 1516 mw m2 nm sr a 1 2013 meanwhile the annual mean sm and vpd showed a slight decreasing trend with rates of 0 0005 m3 m3 a 1 and 0 0031 hpa a 1 respectively overall the annual mean sif had a significant positive trend indicating a slow but persistent trend of vegetation greening in china consistent with the findings of zhao et al 2022 during 2001 to 2016 the changes in sm and vpd were inconspicuous but led to a rapid increase in sif sif showed little fluctuation before 2007 p 0 05 the rapid greening increase in sif after 2007 was caused by decreased vpd and increased sm levels see section 3 3 according to a linear regression model the trends of sif sm and vpd from 2001 to 2016 were spatially heterogeneous with northeastern and southern china exhibiting higher multi year average sif values compared to northern and southwestern china fig 4 a b as shown in fig 4b 77 0 of the vegetated areas increased in sif from 2001 to 2016 while the sif in parts of the qinghai tibet plateau and yangtze river basin showed little change and a slight downward trend in some areas the multi year vpd values were higher in the north and northwest compared to the northeast and south fig 4c d overall the vpd in northwestern china and the qinghai tibet plateau region showed an increasing trend from 2001 to 2016 most of the northeastern region showed a decreasing trend in vpd the spatial pattern of sm was similar to that of sif northeastern and southern china exhibited higher sm values compared to northern and southwestern china fig 4e f overall the spatially averaged sm in southeastern and northeastern china increased from 2001 to 2016 most of northern and southeastern china showed a decreasing trend in sm further studies are needed to explain the main causes of vegetation greening and the interaction between sm and vpd in china 3 3 turning point for accelerated vegetation greening in china in the present study we observed that the sif data could be divided into two major periods fig 5 a the first period 2001 2007 showed a slow increase in sif 0 0004 mw m2 nm sr a 1 and the second period 2007 2016 showed an abnormal rate of increase 0 001 mw m2 nm sr a 1 annual mean sif in china showed an increasing trend from 2001 which increased significantly after 2007 p 0 5 indicating a turning point for accelerated vegetation greening furthermore avp showed a decreasing trend before 2007 0 04 hpa a 1 and an increasing rate 0 02 hpa a 1 after however svp showed a slowly increasing trend before 2007 0 029 hpa a 1 and tended to decrease after the turning point 0 031 hpa a 1 atmospheric moisture levels increased since 2007 fig 5d which resulted in an increasing trend in the annual mean vpd before 2007 and a significant decreasing trend after 2007 p 0 01 sm showed a decreasing trend before 2007 fig 5c and an increase after 2007 fig 5b therefore the increase in sif after 2007 may have been caused by the combined effect of the increase in sm and the decrease in vpd 3 4 coupling of sm and vpd confounds attribution of vegetation dynamics vpd measures the difference between svp and avp at air temperature which can be used to indicate the impact of water stress on vegetation growth and is a key determinant of plant photosynthesis eamus et al 2013 sm is a direct source of water for vegetation and determines water availability as shown in fig 6 a 52 83 of the sm area was positively correlated with sif and concentrated to the northwestern region of xinjiang northeastern region of inner mongolia and guangdong guangxi region 47 17 of the sm area was negatively correlated with sif and was concentrated in the central and northeastern regions of china fig 6b shows that 52 05 of the area had a positive correlation between vpd and sif while 47 95 was negative compound events of high sm and low vpd or vice versa occurred simultaneously fig 6c d the negative correlation between sm and vpd accounted for 92 13 of the area among which 75 40 of regions had correlation coefficients of 0 3 meanwhile the effect of vpd suppressing sif and sm promoting sif is stronger and more significant near the agro pastoral ecotone in china most humid southern regions with low multi year average vpd and high multi year average sm sm suppressed sif and vpd promoted sif such as chongqing jiangsu hubei and anhui in arid northern regions this mechanism was in turn such as inner mongolia hebei and shanxi spatial heterogeneity was evident in the correlations between sm vpd and sif in china and the respective effects of sm and vpd on sif were difficult to distinguish which is consistent with the findings of liu et al 2020 3 5 decoupling of vpd and sm in china according to the above results there was a high negative correlation between sm and vpd at the annual scale and the coupling was relatively clear without decoupling the relationship between sm and vpd it was difficult to conclude whether the change in sif was caused by sm vpd or both to elucidate the dominant influences on vegetation dynamics in china it is necessary to decouple the effects of sm and vpd from standardized anomaly data fig 7 shows a decrease in the correlation between sm and vpd from the annual to the monthly scale however when binning the data into five bins according to the percentile of either sm or vpd per pixel the correlation coefficients of sm and vpd in each bin were approximately zero fig 7 spatially the correlation coefficients between sm and vpd mostly decreased from 0 3 to 0 3 in each bin fig 8 which indicates an effective decoupling of effects at a monthly scale in both sm and vpd bins we hypothesize that if the change in vpd plays a dominant role in vegetation greening the sif dynamics would be significant in sm bins but not in vpd bins regardless of changes in sm or vpd the opposite would hold true if sm played the dominant role in addition there would be no significant variation in the sif in different vpd bins compared to sm bins and vice versa the correlation between sm vpd and sif was spatially heterogeneous therefore our hypothesis could be divided into four scenarios fig s1 where scenario one indicates that high vpd suppress sif and high sm promotes sif scenario two indicates that high vpd suppress sif and low sm promotes sif scenario three indicates that high vpd promotes sif and high sm promotes sif and scenario four indicates that high vpd promotes sif and low sm promotes sif in this study several pixels were assessed in the decoupling of sm and vpd pixel 1 40 n 122 e accorded with scenario one fig 9 in the sm bins sif tended to decrease with increasing vpd and high vpd suppressed photosynthesis in the vpd bins the change in sif was non significant and increased slightly with increasing sm this indicates that vpd plays a dominant role in sif for pixel 2 51 n 125 5 e fig s2 where vegetation type was mainly forests sif tended to increase with increasing vpd in sm bins and high vpd promoted photosynthesis probably because high vpd did not reduce stomatal conductance but increased transpiration and co2 uptake at present the research view of vpd suppressing stomatal is relatively uniform but the mechanism of vpd increasing on vegetation transpiration rate is still controversial which may be related to vegetation types grossiord et al 2020 studies have shown that forests increase photosynthesis with increasing vpd suggesting that the impact of vpd on sif differs depending on the vegetation type green et al 2020 yu et al 2022 for pixel 3 22 n 111 e fig s3 the sif fluctuated in a smaller range in the sm bins in contrast sif tended to increase with sm in the vpd bins which dominated the change in sif the dominant effect of vpd and sm in china varied spatially for pixel 1 the vpd effect was stronger Œ¥sif vpd sm 1 78 than the sm effect Œ¥sif sm vpd 0 05 fig 9c the change in sif was obvious along a vpd gradient while it did not change along a sm gradient fig 9d for pixel 2 fig s2c similarly the vpd effect was stronger Œ¥sif vpd sm 1 75 than the sm effect Œ¥sif sm vpd 0 04 however in pixel 3 sm had a stronger effect on sif dynamics fig s2c therefore we focused on the differences in the effects of sm and vpd on the sif in different regions across china 3 6 disentangling the respective effects of vpd and sm to further illustrate this hypothesis we calculated Œ¥sif vpd sm and Œ¥sif sm vpd at the pixel level across china Œ¥sif vpd sm 0 accounted for 47 59 of the total vegetation area in china fig 10 indicating that high vpd promoted sif and Œ¥sif vpd sm 0 accounted for 52 41 of the area indicating that high vpd suppressed sif especially in arable areas in northern and northeast china Œ¥sif sm vpd 0 accounted for 62 18 of the area indicating that high sm promoted sif which is consistent with previous studies d odorico et al 2007 he et al 2021 Œ¥sif sm vpd 0 accounted for 37 82 of the area mainly distributed in the central and northeast regions of china to compare the relative importance of vpd and sm on the sif we calculated the absolute difference for each pixel Œ¥sif was greater less than 0 indicating that the absolute value of Œ¥sif vpd sm was greater less than the absolute value of Œ¥sif sm vpd and that the effect of vpd on sif was greater less than the effect of sm on sif the areas where the intensity of the effect of vpd on sif exceeded the effect of sm Œ¥sif vpd sm 0 were mainly in the southeastern coastal region north china plain and northeastern forest fig 11 accounting for 52 31 of the total vegetation area the areas where the intensity of sm on sif exceeded vpd Œ¥sif vpd sm 0 were mainly in southwest and northwest china accounting for 47 69 of the total vegetation area compared with sm vpd played the dominant role with regard to the area and intensity of the effect Œ¥sif 0 007 mw m2 nm sr therefore in china vpd was more important to vegetation productivity from 2001 to 2016 than sm these results were consistent with a partial correlation analysis fig s6 in addition to eliminate the potential interference caused by par and fpar as observed by lu et al 2022 we used sif yield eq s1 and found that radiation did not affect our previous analysis and that the decoupled effects of vpd and sm were representative of sif changes in china fig s7 according to eqs 6 and 7 we also calculated the values of Œ¥sif vpd sm and Œ¥sif sm vpd before and after the turning point for accelerated vegetation greening respectively and further analyzed the dominant factors of vegetation change by subtracting the absolute values of the two variables that is Œ¥sif bt vpd level Œ¥sif at vpd level Œ¥sif bt sm level and Œ¥sif at sm level if the value is negative that is Œ¥sif bt sm level and Œ¥sif at sm level it represents a stronger role of sm and if it is positive it represents a stronger role of vpd the impact of vpd Œ¥sif bt vpd level 0 038 mw m2 nm sr Œ¥sif at vpd level 0 024 mw m2 nm sr and sm Œ¥sif bt sm level 0 028 mw m2 nm sr Œ¥sif at sm level 0 034 mw m2 nm sr on vegetation productivity decreased and increased respectively after the turning point year 2007 which suggests that strength of sm effects exceeds that of vpd effects and may further increase in future figs 11b c and 12 the rapid increase in sif after 2007 contributed to most of the accelerated greening of vegetation from 2001 to 2016 due to the greater roles played by sm after 2007 the significant increase in the effect of sm on vegetation was reflected in northeastern sichuan province and the southern guangdong guangxi region whereas the slight increase in the effect of vpd on vegetation was observed in northeastern china and the southeastern coastal region the impact of sm on ecosystems exceeds that of vpd at the global scale thus the role of sm remains essential to vegetation dynamics liu et al 2020 our study emphasizes that sm plays an increasingly important role in china furthermore as shown in figs s8 and s9 the result of the ancillary evaluation using gldas indicated the impact of vpd Œ¥sif bt vpd level 0 039 mw m2 nm sr Œ¥sif at vpd level 0 024 mw m2 nm sr and sm Œ¥sif bt sm level 0 020 mw m2 nm sr Œ¥sif at sm level 0 032 mw m2 nm sr on vegetation productivity decreased and increased respectively after the turning point year 2007 similarly as shown in figs s10 and s11 the result of the ancillary evaluation using terraclimate datasets also indicated the impact of vpd Œ¥sif bt vpd level 0 037 mw m2 nm sr Œ¥sif at vpd level 0 024 mw m2 nm sr and sm Œ¥sif bt sm level 0 024 mw m2 nm sr Œ¥sif at sm level 0 037 mw m2 nm sr on vegetation productivity decreased and increased respectively after the turning point year 2007 the result is consistent with our study obtained by the cmfd and era5 land emphasis that impact of sm on vegetation exceeds that of vpd and may further increase in future moreover we used fluxnet observation data including four sites in china to perform a cross validation in our study as shown in fig s12 the results showed that at the cn cha site 42 4025 n 128 0958 e the dominant vegetation type was mixed forests vpd promoted vegetation photosynthesis and sm suppressed vegetation photosynthesis at the cn qia site 26 7414 n 115 0581 e and the cn din site 23 1733 n 112 5361 e the dominant vegetation types were evergreen needleleaf forests and evergreen broadleaf forests respectively vpd promoted vegetation photosynthesis and sm promoted vegetation photosynthesis at the cn ha2 site 37 6086 n 101 3269 e the dominant vegetation type was permanent wetlands vpd promoted vegetation photosynthesis and sm suppressed vegetation photosynthesis these are all consistent with our results obtained by the cmfd and era5 land 4 discussion the land atmosphere interactions are reflected in different research scales whether field scale or global scale baker et al 2021 suni et al 2015 zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2021b in the context of land atmosphere interactions the spatiotemporal variations of vpd and sm significantly affect the terrestrial ecosystem from a worldwide perspective vpd is significantly negatively correlated with terrestrial productivity the global annual mean vpd rapidly increased during the 20th century leading to a slow decrease in the global annual mean ndvi yuan et al 2019 and sm derived most of the world s interannual variations of land carbon absorption green et al 2019 several studies have attempted to reveal the respective impacts of sm and vpd on ecosystems though it remains challenging given the strong coupling of land atmosphere interactions entekhabi et al 1996 foley et al 2000 liu et al 2020a liu et al 2020b seneviratne et al 2010 additionally climate change will intensify further in the future increasing regional average temperature and soil moisture will complicate land atmosphere interactions according to the ipcc composite events such as the sm deficit and high vpd are expected to become more frequent and extreme in the northern hemisphere zhou et al 2019b the coupling relationship between sm and vpd becomes more complex in spatially variable geo climatic environments such as china giving an emphasis on the importance of accurate interpretation of vegetation dynamics at regional scales however our results differed from some global results as for forest systems shown in fig 10a in most of southern china where the vegetation type was mainly forests sif tended to increase with increasing vpd in sm bins indicating that the increasing vpd promoted photosynthesis this was probably due to the lower multi year average vpd in these areas and increased vpd did not reduce stomatal conductance but increased transpiration and co2 uptake yu et al 2022 and on the other hand vegetation roots systems as well as soil moisture affects the regulation of leaf water potential which is closely related to the stomatal activity mart√≠nez vilalta and garcia forner 2017 vegetation in forested areas has more vigorous root systems which can extract deeper soil moisture making them more likely to maintain higher leaf water potential and stomatal openness at higher vpd jiang et al 2020 konings and gentine 2017 meanwhile due to the high impact of subtropical anticyclones with frequent seasonal droughts in the south vpd may exacerbate water stress allowing more isohydric vegetation to improve water use efficiency and promote stomatal openness in deeper soil layers chen et al 2021a chen et al 2021b jiang et al 2020 recent studies have also shown that forest photosynthesis tends to increase with the increasing vpd doughty et al 2019 green et al 2020 yu et al 2022 grassland systems are mainly distributed in semi arid regions of china with low annual precipitation and poor soil water holding capacity which results in often high soil water limitation shallow rooted grasslands are more dependent on shallow soil water which evaporates much faster than deeper water under dry conditions zhang et al 2019 which can severely limit the maintenance of high leaf water potential leading to stomatal closure and thus lower gpp at higher vpd the deficiency of sm under drought conditions further enhances vpd by affecting temperature and moisture leading to a suppressive effect of vpd on gpp which is also reflected near the agro pastoral ecotone in this study furthermore as shown in fig 10b the positive effect of sm on sif was found in most areas in china accounting for 62 18 of the total vegetation areas with an exception of the arable areas in north china and the mountain area in northeast china which was similar to the results conducted by dang et al 2022 in the middle and high latitude of the northern hemisphere as for arable land concentrated in the northern plains crop roots mainly carry out autotrophic respiration and suppress photosynthesis due to the increased sm caused by irrigation huang et al 2018 xu et al 2021 vegetation at high latitudes is generally constrained by thermal conditions such as radiation and temperature therefore more precipitation and soil moisture are usually accompanied by lesss radiation and lower air temperature which thus exerts negative impact on plant growth guo et al 2015 jiao et al 2021 zeng et al 2022 excessive water supply may reduce chlorophyll soluble protein levels and rubisco activity and may increase the potential for photooxidative damage higher sm can indirectly reduce gpp by decreasing temperature chen et al 2021a chen et al 2021b yordanova and popova 2007 light limitation almost certainly reduces gpp considering the possibility of simultaneous wet and cloudy conditions rigden et al 2020 this could to some extent also explain the suppressive effect of sm in china s central and northeastern regions the dominant role of sm and vpd in vegetation greening exhibited significant spatial heterogeneities in china as shown in fig 11a in the greater khingan mountains in northeastern china where the forest was the dominant vegetation type vpd had a greater effect on sif than sm which was attributed to the deeper root system increased vpd provided sufficient energy temperature and solar radiation for photosynthesis in forests yu et al 2022 in arable areas in northern and northeastern china the effect of vpd on sif was greater than that of sm possibly because full irrigation reduced the dependence of crop growth on precipitation and sm several recent studies have shown that the negative effects of vpd on plant photosynthesis were more pronounced in agricultural areas with full irrigation yu et al 2022 in order to validate the feasibility of proposed statistical methods in explaining plant physiology we collaborated with in situ observations at four sites from fluxnet data which have been widely used to investigate vegetation and climate interactions relevant studies have used in situ observations from fluxnet as results validation or as input data for statistical analysis e g multiple linear regression machine learning etc to investigate the evolution of vegetation productivity in response to climate drivers wang et al 2022a wang et al 2022b however due to the few and sparsely distributed fluxnet sites it is expected that more observational networks and field scale experimental datasets will help to understand the physical mechanisms of sm and vpd interactions on long term vegetation dynamics in addition different vegetation types vary in response to climate chen et al 2021a chen et al 2021b guo et al 2020 jain et al 2022 in this study we did not estimate the effects of the different vegetation types in china different vegetation types will affect the temporal and spatial characteristics of sm and then affect vegetation gou and zhu 2021 dang et al 2022 found that the importance of sm and ts varies given different vegetation types liu et al 2020a liu et al 2020b found that sm was the dominant factor of drought stress in semi arid scrub and grassland however some studies have shown that the effect of soil moisture was significantly higher in cropland and forest but lower in shrubland and grassland ecosystems bai et al 2020 studies have shown that vpd has greater effects on grassland and forest compared to soil moisture lansu et al 2020 due to the abundant water in irrigated croplands vpd is the dominant factor limiting photosynthesis rigden et al 2020 however with the extension of water saving measures for irrigation the future full irrigation will decrease so the role of sm will be more important zhou et al 2020a zhou et al 2020b zhou et al 2020c by the end of the 20th century approximately 76 of the global regional vegetation area showed a greening trend with 47 showing significant greening p 0 05 dang et al 2022 as the world s most notably greening country china contributes 25 of the net increase in green leaf area globally during 2000 to 2017 chen et al 2019 piao et al 2015 found that the largest vegetation greening trend in china was generally located in north china as one of the sensitive regions of climate change in china and the area of the grain for green project ggp the loess plateau has contributed to the great vegetation greening and the vegetation of the loess plateau has changed abruptly since 2007 which was also identified as the turning point for accelerated vegetation greening in our study vegetation greening and afforestation in china will have an impact on hydrological feedback excessive vegetation greening will increase evapotranspiration which implies a decrease in runoff and soil moisture under constant precipitation conditions feng et al 2016 li et al 2018a li et al 2018b in some arid areas such as the loess plateau excessive soil moisture consumption by revegetation will limit sustainable water resource development feng et al 2016 the growth and development of vegetation in good hydrothermal conditions will increase the soil moisture consumption of vegetation in the future have a negative impact on vegetation growth and lead to drought zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2021b accelerated vegetation greening in china will influence the global carbon cycle significantly because the enhancement of vegetation growth in china plays an important role in the global carbon cycle piao et al 2009 therefore further research can be carried out accurately quantify the appropriate vegetation greening area and greening rate and make efforts to achieve the goal of carbon neutrality in china in 2060 5 conclusions this study aimed to decouple the effects of vpd and sm on vegetation productivity greening in china we analyzed vegetation dynamics using global reanalysis and satellite remote sensing data compared to the traditional greenness based vis sif performed better at capturing the change in vegetation dynamics using sm vpd and sif data from 2001 to 2016 we analyzed interannual variability and found that the turning point for accelerated vegetation greening in china i e 2007 was caused by a combination of a decrease in vpd and an increase in sm we successfully decoupled the effects of sm and vpd with equal width data binning we found that the relationship between sm and vpd decayed from annual to monthly scales and that vpd played a dominant role in 52 31 of the vegetated area in china during 2001 to 2016 in addition our results were spatially heterogeneous compared to findings at the global scale vpd suppressed photosynthesis in 52 41 of the total area and ecosystem productivity increased in areas where vpd declined mainly in the arable areas of north and northeast china sm promoted sif in 62 18 of the area mainly in central and northeast china in addition the influence of sm on terrestrial ecosystem productivity gradually increased after 2007 and superseded that of vpd as the dominant factor of vegetation productivity we conclude that the incorporation of the co relationship of sm and vpd in terrestrial ecosystem modeling allows for a more accurate prediction of vegetation productivity at a regional scale and provides greater insights into vegetation responses and feedback to climate

2731,a robust and generic semi analytical model with the capture of dynamic fracture behaviors under long term pumping rate condition is developed for transient flow analysis in this four zone system to characterize the variations of fracture length the improved pressure dependent dynamic fracture factor is introduced and incorporated into this model the laplace domain with predetermined time discretization and synchronous iteration technique are deployed to obtain the solutions of pressure and pumping rate with the least computational burden meanwhile the stability and convergence of this semi analytical model can be met within the discrete time furthermore the pressure and pumping rate solutions of this model under the static fracture condition are in good agreement with those of the constant length fracture which verifies the reliability of this model the dynamic fracture model with the four zone system develops five flow stages on the dimensionless pressure and its derivative curves fracture bilinear flow dynamic fracture flow inner area linear flow transitional flow and boundary dominated flow the dynamic fracture behavior is mainly reflected in the obviously positive upwards and pressure derivative curve presents a higher than unit slope moreover the significant decrease of flow rate indicates that fracture closure could result in a rapid decline in pumping rate which might be the reason why the pumping rate decrease quickly during the long term pumping period as the shrinkage coefficient increases fractures are closed from abruptly to gradually and typical signatures of fracture closure may be hidden if the shrinkage factor is too small which may be caused by the instantaneous pressure depletion in the fractures with the decrease of retained fracture coefficient there is greater in the positive upward of transient pressure behavior and a lower in pumping rate as a result the flow rate will be seriously overestimated if the fracture closure is not considered especially for the tight formation keywords semi analytical model dynamic fracture transient behavior a four zone system data availability data will be made available on request

fluctuations of tropical oceans the evolution of water level the expansion and recession of fracture in geothermal and aquifer system kitsikoudis et al 2021 ren et al 2018 salimi et al 2016 sheng et al 2020 the fracture closure with the pressure depletion has been observed in recent years and previous studies showed only a fraction of the created fracture lengths contributed to the pumping rate gaddipati et al 2020 swami et al 2017 the degradation of dynamic fracture may evoke model redistribution especially for multi zone fractured systems which will cause parameter configurations to be reassigned and arranged for more accurate characterization of the zonal homogeneity consequently it is necessary to make transient analysis of dynamic fracture behavior especially for water resource systems and fractured rock aquifers it is believed that dynamic fracture behavior has been observed and has a significant impact on production performance during the long term pumping period li et al 2022 sheng et al 2020 yin et al 2015 zhang and sheng 2020 currently some scholars have estimated the variations of dynamic fracture volume during the post flowback and early time production periods using field production data ezulike and dehghanpour 2014 moussa et al 2020 the mechanism of fractures closure can be captured and coupled with the process of underground fluid flow and the variations of stress field liu et al 2018 wang and sharma 2019 the results showed that only 25 of the fracture length took effect during the prolonged pumping process which demonstrated that it is imperative to investigate the dynamic fracture behavior of underground fluid flow gaddipati et al 2020 swami et al 2017 however the existing models of coupled fluid stress fields are hard to adopt for transient behavior analysis due to their expensive and redundant computational burdens triggered with just an iterative step therefore there is a necessity to explore the relationship that quantitatively describes the variation of fracture length for transient behavior analysis so that a trade off can be made between computational cost and accurate description of dynamic fracture behavior due to the wide application of large scale hydraulic fracturing treatments the transient behavior analysis of fractured formation has attracted much attention in recent years ren and guo 2018 zhao et al 2015 the careful division of the model configuration such as three zone five zone seven zone etc accurately characterizes the various types of fractures and stimulated zones stalgorova and mattar 2013 stalgorova and mattar 2012 zhang et al 2016 in general the fractured formations can be divided into the main fracture zone fully stimulated inner zone and the outer zone without treatments bello 2009 stalgorova and mattar 2013 in each region the underground fluid flow is considered as a linear flow perpendicular to the fracture this simplification of flow mechanism and its relatively low computational cost make it have considerable advantages in the transient behavior analysis of underground fluid flow in recent years a large number of models have been developed to accurately describe the complex fractures with arbitrary fracture geometries and boundaries jia et al 2017 zhao et al 2014 zolfaghari et al 2016 and the pressure distribution of the complex fractures can be obtained combining the analytical solutions of the inner zone outer zone and the numerical solutions of the discrete fracture zone chen et al 2018a chen et al 2018b dejam et al 2018 kazemi 1969 xiao et al 2017 also the complex flow mechanisms such as pressure dependent permeability gas adsorption and desorption bounded dual porosity in tight formation can also be included cho et al 2013 dejam et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 zhang and yang 2021 unfortunately the impact of dynamic fracture behavior on transient flow is rarely reported the only few studies on dynamic behavior are limited to outer boundary conditions of threshold pressure and pressure dependent nonlinear terms pressure dependent permeability gas compressibility fracture storage liu et al 2012 wang et al 2015 2019 zhang and ayala 2020 in essence it cannot accurately and realistically characterize the variations of the fracture geometric length therefore the mechanism and the quantitative relationship hidden behind fracture closure problems need to be explored and investigated and the flow models should be developed and extended to entail the dynamic fracture behavior in order to truly capture the dynamic behavior of fracture closure during the long term pumping rate period it is imperative to develop the quantitative relationship of dynamic fracture length with the depletion of pressure and combine it with the fluid flow model in this paper the fracture length shrinkage caused by pressure depletion under prolonged pumping rate was incorporated into the semi analytical model and the solution of transient pressure with variable fracture length under constant rate condition and pumping rate under constant head condition can be obtained by numerical inversion of pressure in laplace domain and synchronous iteration of fracture shrinkage factor in real space the greatest contribution of this dynamic fracture semi analytical model is that the pressure dependent dynamic fracture length is quantitatively characterized and incorporated into this simplified flow model the transient pressure and pumping rate with dynamic fracture behavior can be quickly determined by the synchronous iteration of laplace domain and real space within just a few seconds typical characteristics of dynamic fractures in transient pressure curves can be captured and then the effect of the dynamic fracture coefficient and closed fracture permeability on the transient behavior is analyzed in detail it can assist in identifying signatures of fracture closure from transient pressure behavior and can also be used to explain the decline in flow rate during long term pumping period if possible it can also help engineers to make accurate estimation of fracture properties i e fracture length fracture permeability 2 description of the dynamic fracture model 2 1 physical model in this work the fracture closure behavior of fractured rock aquifers during long term pumping is focused on as the fluid in the fracture is extracted the fracture pressure will gradually decrease and the length of fracture will gradually shrink from the tip to the center of the fracture due to the uneven distribution of proppants lin et al 2017 wang et al 2019 as shown in fig 1 the schematic for a fractured horizontal well with five segments in tight formation is shown in fig 2 due to the treatment of hydraulic fracturing the formation can be divided into primary fracture inner area also known as stimulated area and outer area also known as un stimulated area however the continuous depletion of pressure in the fracture may lead to the gradual closure of the fracture from the tip to the center during the long term pumping period after fracturing therefore in order to analyze the effect of fracture closure behavior on transient pressure and flow rate behavior this paper subdivides dynamic fracture into closed fracture region and open fracture region as shown in fig 1 in other words the aquifer after hydraulic fracturing is divided into closed fracture zone open fracture zone stimulated inner zone and un stimulated outer zone in this work the fracture filled with a large amount of proppants near the wellbore is considered as the open fracture area with the initial fracture permeability kf and the closed fracture area is developed by the shrinkage of fracture length with the retained permeability kfc the assumptions for the dynamic fracture model are made as 1 the fractured rock aquifer is configured with a four zone system open fracture area closed fracture area inner and outer area with the consideration of fracture closure 2 it is assumed that the fracture compressibility and width have not changed 3 the hydraulic fractures with the same physical properties are evenly distributed along the wellbore 4 the subsurface fluid is considered as a single phase fluid with slight compressibility and the fluid viscosity is constant 5 it is assumed that the fluid flows from the outer zone to the inner zone perpendicular to the fractures 6 for simplicity and without loss of generality a fully penetrated two dimensional fracture is adopted to obtain the semi analytical solutions suitable for various boundary conditions to better understand the parameter configuration of the dynamic fracture model proposed in this paper the schematic diagram of fracture permeability and fracture length as the function of time is shown in fig 3 as the fluid is extracted from the fracture the initial propped fracture with yf 0 length gradually becomes a closed fracture with yfc length and an open fracture with yf length the permeability hysteresis effect during the fracture closure is considered in this work it is assumed that the permeability of the closed fracture is kfc kfc kf while the permeability of the open fracture remains the original kf the propped fractures are considered to be incompletely closed due to the support of the proppants and fluids in the fracture which has also been reported in the experimental and numerical studies on fracture closure barree et al 2019 dahi taleghani 2011 in this work it is believed that the open fracture no longer continues to close until the fracture length shrinks to yfr 2 2 pressure dependent dynamic fracture factor the fracture closure process is mainly attributed to the difference between stress and fluid pressure in fracture the pressure drop will increase as underground fluid is extracted as a result the fracture closure is manifested in the shrinkage of the length and height of the fracture barree et al 2019 2019 van den hoek 2003 as shown in fig 4 it is reported that the closure of fracture is particularly obvious near the fracture tip with less proppant supported a large number of experiments and numerical simulations have been carried out to investigate the closure behavior of hydraulic fractures de pater et al 1996 van dam et al 2000 van den hoek 2003 and wang et al 2017 summarized the results of fracture closure and proposed the relationship between the fracture length shrinkage and pressure drop as shown in eq 1 1 l f p wd l f 0 1 p wd p wd 0 delpat where lf lf 0 is the length of dynamic fracture and initial fracture respectively p0 wd is dimensionless pressure where the fracture length starts to shrink and delpat is fracture shrinkage coefficient which can be used to describe the rate of fracture length shrinkage unfortunately the hydraulic fracture will not be completely closed with proppants supported barree et al 2019 dahi taleghani 2011 which will bring a large deviation to the transient pressure and rate analysis if eq 1 is deployed especially for the pronged pumping period in this paper the pressure dependent of fracture length can be revised by the subsection function relation of the retained fracture factor b in eq 2 eq 3 to more accurately describe the shrinkage of fracture length 2 y f p wd y f 0 œÉ 3 œÉ max 1 p wd p wd 0 delpat b where œÉ represents the pressure dependent dynamic fracture factor it measures the ratio of the open fracture length yf pwd to the initial fracture length yf 0 once the fracture is closed delpat is the shrinkage factor which can be used to determine the shrinkage speed of the fracture length b represents the maximum retained coefficient of hydraulic fracture and it means that the conductivity of the propped fracture will no longer decrease as pressure drops which can be determined through laboratory experiments of fracture closure 2 3 mathematical model as mentioned above the formation can be divided into four subareas due to hydraulic fracturing treatments and fracture closure behavior the impact of fracture shrinkage on transient pressure and rate behavior is focused in this paper thus the mathematical models of fluid flows in fracture closed area and open fracture area were described in detail while the mathematical models for the fluid flows in the inner and outer region were given directly in laplace domain the detailed derivation of the fluid flows for inner and outer region can be found in appendix b outer region it is assumed that there are no fluid exchanges between adjacent fractures that is to say the outer boundary condition of the outer area is closed the mathematical model of unsteady fluid flow in the outer area are as follows 4 2 p 2 d x d 2 s Œ∑ 2 d p 2 d 0 p 2 d x 1 d p 1 d x 1 d p 2 d x d x d x 2 d 0 the subscripts 1 and 2 denote inner and outer region respectively and the superscript indicates variable in laplace domain s is a laplacian with respect to time inner region it is worth mentioning that there are transient flows from inner region to the closed fracture area and open fracture area at the same time thus the pressure is continuous at the interface between inner area and fracture area the partial differential equation pde and boundary conditions bcs in the inner area can be given by 5 2 p 1 d x d 2 s p 1 d 0 k 2 Œº p 2 d x d x 1 d k 1 Œº p 1 d x d x 1 d p 1 d w d 2 p fd w d 2 0 y d œÉ p fcd w d 2 œÉ y d 1 where p 1 d p fd p fcd is the pressure of inner area open fracture area and closed fracture area respectively in laplace domain delpat represents the pressure dependent fracture shrinkage factor dimensionless the pressure is continuous at the interface between inner area and fracture area closed fracture and open fracture included in other words the pressure in the open fracture zone p fd w d 2 y d 0 y d œÉ and the closed fracture zone p fcd w d 2 y d œÉ y d 1 at the interface are both equal to the pressure of the inner zone p 1 d w d 2 y d since the fluid flow in the inner zone is considered as a one dimensional linear flow along the x direction the pressure p 1 d in the inner zone is independent of yd thus we can obtain p fcd w d 2 y d p fd w d 2 y d p 1 d w d 2 y d p 1 d w d 2 closed fracture area fc as shown in fig 5 the previous studies showed that there was permeability hysteresis effect after the closure of hydraulic fracture chipperfield et al 2007 mittal et al 2015 in other words the fracture closed zone permeability kfc is lower than the initial fracture permeability kf but still higher than the matrix permeability k 2 which may be the result of incomplete closure of the fracture as a result the closed fracture zone can be regarded as the improved permeability of kfc zone in the fracture closure model moreover there are transient flows from the inner area to the fc area consequently the partial differential equation pde with transient flows from the inner area to the fc area can be describe as follows 6 2 p fc y 2 2 k 1 w f k fc p 1 x x w f 2 y f y d y f 0 1 Œ∑ fc p fc t the tip of the fracture is assumed closed so the boundary conditions can be expressed as 7 p fc y y y f 0 0 at the

although the pressure and flow rate solutions under different production conditions were derived it can be concluded from eq 15 eq 16 that the analytical solutions cannot directly be calculated in laplace space due to the pressure dependent dynamic fracture factor œÉ it can be seen from the eq 2 that the fracture length shrinkage coefficient is the function of the pressure in the real space unfortunately the pressure in real space is also the unknown variable we need to calculate in this paper the synchronous iteration technique between laplace domain and real space is introduced in this paper to quickly obtain the pressure and flow rate solutions in real space the detailed steps for iterative calculation of pressure and flow rate are as follows as shown in fig 6 step 1 based on the parameter configuration of the four zone dynamic fracture model input the physical properties e g fracture half length width permeability porosity and compressibility of each zone pressure dependent dynamic fracture factor maximum retained coefficient of hydraulic fracture step 2 initialize the number of iteration rounds i and iteration step c step 3 calculate the initial value of the dimensionless bottomhole pressure p0 wd under the initial fracture length yf0 and the corresponding dynamic fracture coefficient œÉ 0 can be determined using eq 3 step 4 divide the scheduled time points in the form of powers of 10 step 5 combining eq 15 eq 16 input physical parameters initial values of bottomhole pressure and dynamic fracture coefficients and the numerical inversion is performed in laplace space to obtain the bottomhole pressure and pwd i 1 flow rate qd i 1 values at the next time step step 6 calculate the pressure dependent dynamic fracture coefficients œÉ i 1 for the next time step from eq 2 eq 3 in real space step 7 calculate the relative error of the dimensionless bottomhole pressure at adjacent time steps and determine if the predetermined error limits are met if yes repeat steps 4 7 to start the next iteration of the calculation at the next predetermined time point step 8 if the error in step 7 exceeds the predetermined error limit Œµ a continue to determine if the maximum iteration step cmax has been reached if yes calculate the next time point by the variable time step method and then continue with steps 4 7 for the next iteration step 9 if the number of iterations in step 8 has not reached the determined maximum increase the number of iterations and calculate the next time point and repeat steps 4 7 until the pre determined error limit is met step 10 if iterative computation of all the predetermined time points is completed the pressure and flow rate calculations are finished otherwise continue the iterative process of steps 4 7 it is worth noting that the numerical inversion of the pressure solution in laplace space is in the power form of time while the pressure iteration process in real space often requires a smaller time step to ensure the convergence of the solution in order to settle this problem the concept of variable time step is adopted to make the pressure iteration process converge as quickly as possible in real space while the numerical inversion can be realized in laplace space in addition the iterative calculation is constrained by predetermined error limits of the pressure and maximum number of iterations which can reduce the computational burden caused by convergence problems 3 results 3 1 model validation to the best of the author s knowledge the semi analytical model of transient pressure considering fracture length shrinkage has not been reported therefore the pressure solution of the dynamic fracture model without fracture length variations was compared with stalgorova and mattar 2012 from eq 2 eq 3 it can be seen that the fracture length no longer changes yf yf 0 when the shrinkage factor delpat and maximum retained coefficient b is taken to be infinite and one respectively it means that the dynamic fracture becomes a constant fracture therefore the solutions of transient pressure can be obtained without the shrinkage of fracture length delpat b 1 kf kfc cfcd cfd as shown in eq 19 eq 20 the solutions of transient pressure and flow rate in laplace domain are consistent with the result of stalgorova and mattar 2012 19 p wd œÄ c fd s c 4 s tanh c 4 s 20 q fd c fd œÄ c 4 s tanh c 4 s s moreover the dimensionless pressure and its derivative were calculated by this dynamic fracture model under constant fracture length and compared with the results of stalgorova and mattar 2012 and the parameter configuration for this comparative analysis is shown in table 1 as shown in fig 7 the good agreement of pressure and flow rate curves shows that the dynamic fracture model proposed in this paper is reliable 3 2 transient flow response the shrinkage effect of the fracture length along y direction is focused on in this paper in order to describe the fracture closure behavior more realistically lower porosity and compressibility in the closed fracture zone were used and the model parameter configuration can be shown in table 2 fig 7 shows dimensionless transient pressure of the four zone system under the various fracture length the analysis of fig 7 shows that there may be five periods included in this dynamic fracture system fracture bilinear flow fr1 the flow behavior of fr1 is composed of steady state linear flow in the dynamic fracture and transient linear flow in the adjacent inner area as shown in fig 7 the fracture bilinear flow can be characterized by the one quarter slope straight line from the pressure and its derivative curves however the dynamic behavior of fractures cannot be observed from the curves due to the earliest pumping period it is similar to the results of constant fracture model which can be seen from fig 8 dynamic fracture flow fr2 as the production time increases the characteristics of dynamic fracture known as the hump can be gradually captured which is reflected on the positive upwards and subsequently negative downwards on the pressure derivative curve the duration of evident bend is relatively short as a result of fracture pressure decreases rapidly and fracture length shrinks quickly it is similar to the fracture storage effect reported by wang et al 2019 the start time and end time of fracture shrinkage can be determined by the careful analysis of this typical characteristics as shown by the red arrow in fig 8 moreover the pressure derivative curve presents a higher than unit slope it is worth noting that when the fracture closure effect is significant smaller fracture shrinkage coefficient smaller fracture retained coefficient lower closed fracture permeability the pressure derivative first rises rapidly then drops fast followed by a gentle rise again before the linear flow regime begins the gentle rise before linear flow may be attributed to the fact that the inner fluid cannot rapidly supply the fracture region due to the abrupt and significant closure of the fracture the detailed discussion can be found in section 3 3 3 6 inner zone linear flow fr3 as shown in fig 8 when the fluid flows from the inner area to the dynamic fracture along the perpendicular direction of the fracture surface it can be known as inner zone linear flow meanwhile a straight line with a half slope can be shown on the log log curve of the pressure derivative which is in line with the linear flow characteristics of the formation with infinite conductivity fractures cinco et al 1978 el banbi 1998 transitional flow fr4 as shown in fig 8 the shorter intermediate stage between the inner zone linear flow fr3 and the boundary dominated flow fr5 can be observed which is controlled by the difference between the inner and outer zones in physical properties jiang et al 2020 zhang and yang 2021 boundary dominated flow fr5 eventually a straight line with unit slope can be shown in the transient pressure response for the later period it is worth mentioning that the inner boundary in this work is half of the spacing between two adjacent fractures which is much smaller than the outer boundary of the reservoir therefore the boundary dominant flow phase occurs earlier wattenbarger et al 1998 wei et al 2019 zhang and yang 2021 more specifically there may be a slight deviation after td becomes large than 100 it may be attributed to fluid supply from outer zone in the later period it has been reported that the boundary dominated flow can be subdivided into an inner boundary dominated flow and an outer boundary dominated flow with a straight line slightly deviating from the unit slope between them al rbeawi 2018 zhu et al 2018 the focus of this paper is to emphasize the effect of the dynamic fracture behavior therefore the boundary dominated flow is not further subdivided in this paper the above five flow stages may not occur in the actual cases of a well at the same time which is dependent on the physical properties e g well storage coefficient flow skin factor the permeability of open fracture area closed fracture area and inner zone retained fracture coefficient etc of the formation in other words some flow stages may be missing in the actual cases and the sensitivity analysis of key parameters will be discussed in detail in the next section 3 3 dynamic fracture behavior in order to investigate the effect of dynamic fracture behavior on transient flow curve the transient pressure and rate behaviors under the conditions of dynamic fracture and constant length fracture were discussed in detail the parameter of this comparative analysis can be referred to table 3 and the corresponding results can be shown in fig 9 as shown in fig 8 a compared with the constant length fracture there will be positive upwards in the early stage of the transient pressure curves which will make the straight line with half slope of the inner area linear flow move upwards meanwhile the pressure curve has also been positive upwards which may be accounted for the fracture closure as the decrease of fracture pressure compared with the results of constant length fracture the dimensionless flow rate decreases significantly due to the closure of the fracture as mentioned in eq 17 eq 18 the dynamic fracture behavior with skin factor sc 2 and wellbore storage coefficient cd 0 004 is analyzed in detail and compared with the constant fracture as shown in fig 10 five flow periods can also be observed from the pressure and pressure derivative curves the first stage fr1 is the well storage stage with unit slope the second stage fr2 is the transient flow stage controlled by sc and cd and the subsequent three stages are similar to the dynamic fracture behavior without sc and cd as shown in fig 8 compared with the constant fracture with sc and cd the pressure and pressure derivative show a clear upward characteristic and the dynamic fracture behavior in fr2 exhibits similar storage effect it means the fracture dynamic behavior hidden in transient features can be easily interpreted as larger well storage coefficients therefore the wellbore storage and skin factors are not considered in the sensitivity analysis 3 4 effect of fracture shrinkage factor as can be seen from the eq 2 eq 3 one of the key parameters that affect the dynamic behavior of fractures is the fracture shrinkage factor delpat which can be used to determine the speed of shrinkage of the fracture length the comparative analysis under the various fracture shrinkage factor on transient pressure behavior was discussed in this section fig 11 was amplified in y coordinate to observe the differences of pressure derivative more clearly in log log plot the coefficient of fracture shrinkage delpat mainly affects the dynamic fracture flow fr2 as delpat decreases the positive upwards of dynamic fracture will appear in advance it is noteworthy that when the fracture shrinkage coefficient is 0 1 there is a short period of rise in the pressure derivative before the linear flow this may attribute to rapid closure of fractures while the fluid in the inner zone is not supplemented to the fracture in time even worse the characteristics of fracture closure may be hidden if delpat is too small which may be caused by the instantaneous pressure depletion in the fractures moreover the effect of fracture shrinkage coefficient delpat on fracture closure dynamic fracture coefficient œÉ was further analyzed as shown in fig 12 it indicated that the shrinkage factor affected the speed of fracture closure with the increase of delpat the fractures are closed from abruptly to gradually which could be introduced to simulate the fracture closure with different proppants supported 3 5 effect of the retained fracture coefficient the retained fracture coefficient b is also the key factor that directly affects fracture closure from eq 2 eq 3 it can be seen that the value of b determines the maximum degree of fracture length shrinkage the larger retained factor means less fracture length shrinkage the transient pressure and flow rate behavior under different fracture closure conditions were investigated in this paper the constant fracture condition b 1 is added to better observe the difference in pressure derivative curves and flow behavior between dynamic and constant fracture conditions as shown in fig 13 it can be seen that the upward trend in the pressure derivative and the declining trend in the flow rate of the dynamic fracture are quite obvious compared to the constant fracture with the decrease of retained fracture coefficient the more obvious the fracture length shrinkage and the greater the positive upward of pressure and pressure derivative will be in the log log plot as shown in fig 13 b the effect of retained fracture coefficient on flow rate can be summarized as the smaller the retained fracture factor the lower the dimensionless flow rate which is caused by the closure of the fracture therefore if fracture closure is not considered the flow rate will be seriously overestimated which may be one of the reasons why the flow rate drops rapidly in the later period of production especially for the fractured aquifers 3 6 effect of the closed fracture permeability the effect of closed fracture permeability kfc on pressure and flow rate transient behavior is analyzed when the closed fracture permeability kfc is equal to the open fracture permeability kf kfc kf 1 10 12 m2 it means fracture length shrinkage is not considered as shown in fig 14 fig 15 the closed fracture permeability mainly affects fr3 stage and with the increase of kfc the upward warpage of the pressure curve is smaller and the flow rate will gradually increase in other words the influence of fracture length shrinkage on pressure and flow rate behavior will be compensated by the increase of closed fracture permeability similarly when the closed fracture permeability kf c is 0 1 10 15 m2 the pressure derivative has a gentle rise before the linear flow this may be due to the permeability is too low after fracture closure and the inner zone fluid is not timely supplemented into the fracture 4 dissusion although a semi analytical model considering the dynamic fracture behavior is proposed in this paper it can be used to analyze the effect of fracture shrinkage length on the trasient pressure and pumping rate behaviors however there may be two possible fluid flow models for lower permeability of closed fracture the fluid in region 1 may flow to the open fracture zone when the closed fracture permeability is lower than region 1 as shown in fig 16 a even worse when the closed fracture permeability is close to 0 the fluid in region 1 will no longer flow to the closed fracture area but will flow perpendicular to region 2 with higher permeability these two possible alternatives are suggested for studies in the near future 5 conclusions a dynamic fracture semi analytical model for transient behavior analysis of a four zone system has been proposed in this paper the improved pressure dependent dynamic fracture coefficient is introduced to quantitatively describe the fracture closure during the pronged pumping period the pressure and flow solutions can be obtained immediately by pressure calculation combined with numerical inversion in laplace space and the synchronous numerical iteration in real space this new model without fracture grid division developed by the integration of laplace domain and real time domain makes the model setup easier moreover the following conclusions can be drawn from this semi analytical model of dynamic fracture 1 the dynamic fracture model with the four zone system may develop five flow stages on the dimensionless pressure and pressure derivative curves fracture bilinear flow dynamic fracture flow inner area linear flow transitional flow and boundary dominated flow the dynamic fracture behavior is mainly reflected on the obvious positive upwards in the dynamic fracture flow stage and the inner area linear flow more specifically the pressure derivative curve in the dynamic fracture flow presents a higher than unit slope 2 compared with the constant length fracture it indicates the obvious positive upward in the early stage of the transient pressure curves makes the straight line with half slope of the inner area linear flow move upwards the obvious decrease of pumping rate indicates that fracture closure will result in a rapid decline in flow rate which might be the reason why the production decreases quickly during the long pumping period 3 the fracture shrinkage coefficient affects the speed of fracture closure mainly manifested in the dynamic fracture flow and inner zone linear flow as the shrinkage coefficient increases the fractures are closed from abruptly to gradually and the typical signatures of fracture closure may be hidden if shrinkage factor is too small which may be caused by the instantaneous pressure depletion in the fractures 4 with the decrease of retained fracture coefficient there is greater positive upward of transient pressure behavior and a lower flow rate in the log log plot which may be caused by the closure of the fracture and thus the flow rate will be seriously overestimated if fracture closure is not considered especially for the tight formation in addition the influence of fracture length shrinkage on pressure and flow rate behavior will be compensated by the increase of closed fracture

2731,a robust and generic semi analytical model with the capture of dynamic fracture behaviors under long term pumping rate condition is developed for transient flow analysis in this four zone system to characterize the variations of fracture length the improved pressure dependent dynamic fracture factor is introduced and incorporated into this model the laplace domain with predetermined time discretization and synchronous iteration technique are deployed to obtain the solutions of pressure and pumping rate with the least computational burden meanwhile the stability and convergence of this semi analytical model can be met within the discrete time furthermore the pressure and pumping rate solutions of this model under the static fracture condition are in good agreement with those of the constant length fracture which verifies the reliability of this model the dynamic fracture model with the four zone system develops five flow stages on the dimensionless pressure and its derivative curves fracture bilinear flow dynamic fracture flow inner area linear flow transitional flow and boundary dominated flow the dynamic fracture behavior is mainly reflected in the obviously positive upwards and pressure derivative curve presents a higher than unit slope moreover the significant decrease of flow rate indicates that fracture closure could result in a rapid decline in pumping rate which might be the reason why the pumping rate decrease quickly during the long term pumping period as the shrinkage coefficient increases fractures are closed from abruptly to gradually and typical signatures of fracture closure may be hidden if the shrinkage factor is too small which may be caused by the instantaneous pressure depletion in the fractures with the decrease of retained fracture coefficient there is greater in the positive upward of transient pressure behavior and a lower in pumping rate as a result the flow rate will be seriously overestimated if the fracture closure is not

al 2020 the fracture closure with the pressure depletion has been observed in recent years and previous studies showed only a fraction of the created fracture lengths contributed to the pumping rate gaddipati et al 2020 swami et al 2017 the degradation of dynamic fracture may evoke model redistribution especially for multi zone fractured systems which will cause parameter configurations to be reassigned and arranged for more accurate characterization of the zonal homogeneity consequently it is necessary to make transient analysis of dynamic fracture behavior especially for water resource systems and fractured rock aquifers it is believed that dynamic fracture behavior has been observed and has a significant impact on production performance during the long term pumping period li et al 2022 sheng et al 2020 yin et al 2015 zhang and sheng 2020 currently some scholars have estimated the variations of dynamic fracture volume during the post flowback and early time production periods using field production data ezulike and dehghanpour 2014 moussa et al 2020 the mechanism of fractures closure can be captured and coupled with the process of underground fluid flow and the variations of stress field liu et al 2018 wang and sharma 2019 the results showed that only 25 of the fracture length took effect during the prolonged pumping process which demonstrated that it is imperative to investigate the dynamic fracture behavior of underground fluid flow gaddipati et al 2020 swami et al 2017 however the existing models of coupled fluid stress fields are hard to adopt for transient behavior analysis due to their expensive and redundant computational burdens triggered with just an iterative step therefore there is a necessity to explore the relationship that quantitatively describes the variation of fracture length for transient behavior analysis so that a trade off can be made between computational cost and accurate description of dynamic fracture behavior due to the wide application of large scale hydraulic fracturing treatments the transient behavior analysis of fractured formation has attracted much attention in recent years ren and guo 2018 zhao et al 2015 the careful division of the model configuration such as three zone five zone seven zone etc accurately characterizes the various types of fractures and stimulated zones stalgorova and mattar 2013 stalgorova and mattar 2012 zhang et al 2016 in general the fractured formations can be divided into the main fracture zone fully stimulated inner zone and the outer zone without treatments bello 2009 stalgorova and mattar 2013 in each region the underground fluid flow is considered as a linear flow perpendicular to the fracture this simplification of flow mechanism and its relatively low computational cost make it have considerable advantages in the transient behavior analysis of underground fluid flow in recent years a large number of models have been developed to accurately describe the complex fractures with arbitrary fracture geometries and boundaries jia et al 2017 zhao et al 2014 zolfaghari et al 2016 and the pressure distribution of the complex fractures can be obtained combining the analytical solutions of the inner zone outer zone and the numerical solutions of the discrete fracture zone chen et al 2018a chen et al 2018b dejam et al 2018 kazemi 1969 xiao et al 2017 also the complex flow mechanisms such as pressure dependent permeability gas adsorption and desorption bounded dual porosity in tight formation can also be included cho et al 2013 dejam et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 zhang and yang 2021 unfortunately the impact of dynamic fracture behavior on transient flow is rarely reported the only few studies on dynamic behavior are limited to outer boundary conditions of threshold pressure and pressure dependent nonlinear terms pressure dependent permeability gas compressibility fracture storage liu et al 2012 wang et al 2015 2019 zhang and ayala 2020 in essence it cannot accurately and realistically characterize the variations of the fracture geometric length therefore the mechanism and the quantitative relationship hidden behind fracture closure problems need to be explored and investigated and the flow models should be developed and extended to entail the dynamic fracture behavior in order to truly capture the dynamic behavior of fracture closure during the long term pumping rate period it is imperative to develop the quantitative relationship of dynamic fracture length with the depletion of pressure and combine it with the fluid flow model in this paper the fracture length shrinkage caused by pressure depletion under prolonged pumping rate was incorporated into the semi analytical model and the solution of transient pressure with variable fracture length under constant rate condition and pumping rate under constant head condition can be obtained by numerical inversion of pressure in laplace domain and synchronous iteration of fracture shrinkage factor in real space the greatest contribution of this dynamic fracture semi analytical model is that the pressure dependent dynamic fracture length is quantitatively characterized and incorporated into this simplified flow model the transient pressure and pumping rate with dynamic fracture behavior can be quickly determined by the synchronous iteration of laplace domain and real space within just a few seconds typical characteristics of dynamic fractures in transient pressure curves can be captured and then the effect of the dynamic fracture coefficient and closed fracture permeability on the transient behavior is analyzed in detail it can assist in identifying signatures of fracture closure from transient pressure behavior and can also be used to explain the decline in flow rate during long term pumping period if possible it can also help engineers to make accurate estimation of fracture properties i e fracture length fracture permeability 2 description of the dynamic fracture model 2 1 physical model in this work the fracture closure behavior of fractured rock aquifers during long term pumping is focused on as the fluid in the fracture is extracted the fracture pressure will gradually decrease and the length of fracture will gradually shrink from the tip to the center of the fracture due to the uneven distribution of proppants lin et al 2017 wang et al 2019 as shown in fig 1 the schematic for a fractured horizontal well with five segments in tight formation is shown in fig 2 due to the treatment of hydraulic fracturing the formation can be divided into primary fracture inner area also known as stimulated area and outer area also known as un stimulated area however the continuous depletion of pressure in the fracture may lead to the gradual closure of the fracture from the tip to the center during the long term pumping period after fracturing therefore in order to analyze the effect of fracture closure behavior on transient pressure and flow rate behavior this paper subdivides dynamic fracture into closed fracture region and open fracture region as shown in fig 1 in other words the aquifer after hydraulic fracturing is divided into closed fracture zone open fracture zone stimulated inner zone and un stimulated outer zone in this work the fracture filled with a large amount of proppants near the wellbore is considered as the open fracture area with the initial fracture permeability kf and the closed fracture area is developed by the shrinkage of fracture length with the retained permeability kfc the assumptions for the dynamic fracture model are made as 1 the fractured rock aquifer is configured with a four zone system open fracture area closed fracture area inner and outer area with the consideration of fracture closure 2 it is assumed that the fracture compressibility and width have not changed 3 the hydraulic fractures with the same physical properties are evenly distributed along the wellbore 4 the subsurface fluid is considered as a single phase fluid with slight compressibility and the fluid viscosity is constant 5 it is assumed that the fluid flows from the outer zone to the inner zone perpendicular to the fractures 6 for simplicity and without loss of generality a fully penetrated two dimensional fracture is adopted to obtain the semi analytical solutions suitable for various boundary conditions to better understand the parameter configuration of the dynamic fracture model proposed in this paper the schematic diagram of fracture permeability and fracture length as the function of time is shown in fig 3 as the fluid is extracted from the fracture the initial propped fracture with yf 0 length gradually becomes a closed fracture with yfc length and an open fracture with yf length the permeability hysteresis effect during the fracture closure is considered in this work it is assumed that the permeability of the closed fracture is kfc kfc kf while the permeability of the open fracture remains the original kf the propped fractures are considered to be incompletely closed due to the support of the proppants and fluids in the fracture which has also been reported in the experimental and numerical studies on fracture closure barree et al 2019 dahi taleghani 2011 in this work it is believed that the open fracture no longer continues to close until the fracture length shrinks to yfr 2 2 pressure dependent dynamic fracture factor the fracture closure process is mainly attributed to the difference between stress and fluid pressure in fracture the pressure drop will increase as underground fluid is extracted as a result the fracture closure is manifested in the shrinkage of the length and height of the fracture barree et al 2019 2019 van den hoek 2003 as shown in fig 4 it is reported that the closure of fracture is particularly obvious near the fracture tip with less proppant supported a large number of experiments and numerical simulations have been carried out to investigate the closure behavior of hydraulic fractures de pater et al 1996 van dam et al 2000 van den hoek 2003 and wang et al 2017 summarized the results of fracture closure and proposed the relationship between the fracture length shrinkage and pressure drop as shown in eq 1 1 l f p wd l f 0 1 p wd p wd 0 delpat where lf lf 0 is the length of dynamic fracture and initial fracture respectively p0 wd is dimensionless pressure where the fracture length starts to shrink and delpat is fracture shrinkage coefficient which can be used to describe the rate of fracture length shrinkage unfortunately the hydraulic fracture will not be completely closed with proppants supported barree et al 2019 dahi taleghani 2011 which will bring a large deviation to the transient pressure and rate analysis if eq 1 is deployed especially for the pronged pumping period in this paper the pressure dependent of fracture length can be revised by the subsection function relation of the retained fracture factor b in eq 2 eq 3 to more accurately describe the shrinkage of fracture length 2 y f p wd y f 0 œÉ 3 œÉ max 1 p wd p wd 0 delpat b where œÉ represents the pressure dependent dynamic fracture factor it measures the ratio of the open fracture length yf pwd to the initial fracture length yf 0 once the fracture is closed delpat is the shrinkage factor which can be used to determine the shrinkage speed of the fracture length b represents the maximum retained coefficient of hydraulic fracture and it means that the conductivity of the propped fracture will no longer decrease as pressure drops which can be determined through laboratory experiments of fracture closure 2 3 mathematical model as mentioned above the formation can be divided into four subareas due to hydraulic fracturing treatments and fracture closure behavior the impact of fracture shrinkage on transient pressure and rate behavior is focused in this paper thus the mathematical models of fluid flows in fracture closed area and open fracture area were described in detail while the mathematical models for the fluid flows in the inner and outer region were given directly in laplace domain the detailed derivation of the fluid flows for inner and outer region can be found in appendix b outer region it is assumed that there are no fluid exchanges between adjacent fractures that is to say the outer boundary condition of the outer area is closed the mathematical model of unsteady fluid flow in the outer area are as follows 4 2 p 2 d x d 2 s Œ∑ 2 d p 2 d 0 p 2 d x 1 d p 1 d x 1 d p 2 d x d x d x 2 d 0 the subscripts 1 and 2 denote inner and outer region respectively and the superscript indicates variable in laplace domain s is a laplacian with respect to time inner region it is worth mentioning that there are transient flows from inner region to the closed fracture area and open fracture area at the same time thus the pressure is continuous at the interface between inner area and fracture area the partial differential equation pde and boundary conditions bcs in the inner area can be given by 5 2 p 1 d x d 2 s p 1 d 0 k 2 Œº p 2 d x d x 1 d k 1 Œº p 1 d x d x 1 d p 1 d w d 2 p fd w d 2 0 y d œÉ p fcd w d 2 œÉ y d 1 where p 1 d p fd p fcd is the pressure of inner area open fracture area and closed fracture area respectively in laplace domain delpat represents the pressure dependent fracture shrinkage factor dimensionless the pressure is continuous at the interface between inner area and fracture area closed fracture and open fracture included in other words the pressure in the open fracture zone p fd w d 2 y d 0 y d œÉ and the closed fracture zone p fcd w d 2 y d œÉ y d 1 at the interface are both equal to the pressure of the inner zone p 1 d w d 2 y d since the fluid flow in the inner zone is considered as a one dimensional linear flow along the x direction the pressure p 1 d in the inner zone is independent of yd thus we can obtain p fcd w d 2 y d p fd w d 2 y d p 1 d w d 2 y d p 1 d w d 2 closed fracture area fc as shown in fig 5 the previous studies showed that there was permeability hysteresis effect after the closure of hydraulic fracture chipperfield et al 2007 mittal et al 2015 in other words the fracture closed zone permeability kfc is lower than the initial fracture permeability kf but still higher than the matrix permeability k 2 which may be the result of incomplete closure of the fracture as a result the closed fracture zone can be regarded as the improved permeability of kfc zone in the fracture closure model moreover there are transient flows from the inner area to the fc area consequently the partial differential equation pde with transient flows from the inner area to the fc area can be describe as follows 6 2 p fc y 2 2 k 1 w f k fc p 1 x x w f 2 y f y d y f 0 1 Œ∑ fc p fc t the tip of the fracture is assumed closed so the boundary conditions can be expressed as 7 p fc y y y f 0 0 at the

given by 8 p fc y y f p f y y f 9 k f p f y y y f k fc p fc y y y f in eq 6 the second term on the left side represents the transient flow from the inner area using the dimensionless definition in appendix a the fluid flow in the fracture closure area can be expressed as 10 2 p fcd y d 2 2 k 1 w f k fc p 1 d x d x d w d 2 œÉ y d 1 1 Œ∑ fcd p fcd t d p fcd y d œÉ p fd y d œÉ p fcd y d y d 1 0 where œÉ is defined in eq 2 eq 3 open fracture area f similar to the closed fracture zone the pde of transient fluid flow in the open fracture zone can be given by 11 2 p f y 2 2 k 1 w f k f p 1 x x w f 2 0 y y f 1 Œ∑ f p f t the second item in the left of eq 11 is the fluid flow from the inner area to the open fracture area the constant rate condition crc and constant pressure condition cpc are as

1949 the flow skin factor and wellbore storage effect can be incorporated in the pressure solution as shown in eq 18 18 p wd shin storage s p wd s c s c d s 2 s p wd s c 2 5 computing implementation although the pressure and flow rate solutions under different production conditions were derived it can be concluded from eq 15 eq 16 that the analytical solutions cannot directly be calculated in laplace space due to the pressure dependent dynamic fracture factor œÉ it can be seen from the eq 2 that the fracture length shrinkage coefficient is the function of the pressure in the real space unfortunately the pressure in real space is also the unknown variable we need to calculate in this paper the synchronous iteration technique between laplace domain and real space is introduced in this paper to quickly obtain the pressure and flow rate solutions in real space the detailed steps for iterative calculation of pressure and flow rate are as follows as shown in fig 6 step 1 based on the parameter configuration of the four zone dynamic fracture model input the physical properties e g fracture half length width permeability porosity and compressibility of each zone pressure dependent dynamic fracture factor maximum retained coefficient of hydraulic fracture step 2 initialize the number of iteration rounds i and iteration step c step 3 calculate the initial value of the dimensionless bottomhole pressure p0 wd under the initial fracture length yf0 and the corresponding dynamic fracture coefficient œÉ 0 can be determined using eq 3 step 4 divide the scheduled time points in the form of powers of 10 step 5 combining eq 15 eq 16 input physical parameters initial values of bottomhole pressure and dynamic fracture coefficients and the numerical inversion is performed in laplace space to obtain the bottomhole pressure and pwd i 1 flow rate qd i 1 values at the next time step step 6 calculate the pressure dependent dynamic fracture coefficients œÉ i 1 for the next time step from eq 2 eq 3 in real space step 7 calculate the relative error of the dimensionless bottomhole pressure at adjacent time steps and determine if the predetermined error limits are met if yes repeat steps 4 7 to start the next iteration of the calculation at the next predetermined time point step 8 if the error in step 7 exceeds the predetermined error limit Œµ a continue to determine if the maximum iteration step cmax has been reached if yes calculate the next time point by the variable time step method and then continue with steps 4 7 for the next iteration step 9 if the number of iterations in step 8 has not reached the determined maximum increase the number of iterations and calculate the next time point and repeat steps 4 7 until the pre determined error limit is met step 10 if iterative computation of all the predetermined time points is completed the pressure and flow rate calculations are finished otherwise continue the iterative process of steps 4 7 it is worth noting that the numerical inversion of the pressure solution in laplace space is in the power form of time while the pressure iteration process in real space often requires a smaller time step to ensure the convergence of the solution in order to settle this problem the concept of variable time step is adopted to make the pressure iteration process converge as quickly as possible in real space while the numerical inversion can be realized in laplace space in addition the iterative calculation is constrained by predetermined error limits of the pressure and maximum number of iterations which can reduce the computational burden caused by convergence problems 3 results 3 1 model validation to the best of the author s knowledge the semi analytical model of transient pressure considering fracture length shrinkage has not been reported therefore the pressure solution of the dynamic fracture model without fracture length variations was compared with stalgorova and mattar 2012 from eq 2 eq 3 it can be seen that the fracture length no longer changes yf yf 0 when the shrinkage factor delpat and maximum retained coefficient b is taken to be infinite and one respectively it means that the dynamic fracture becomes a constant fracture therefore the solutions of transient pressure can be obtained without the shrinkage of fracture length delpat b 1 kf kfc cfcd cfd as shown in eq 19 eq 20 the solutions of transient pressure and flow rate in laplace domain are consistent with the result of stalgorova and mattar 2012 19 p wd œÄ c fd s c 4 s tanh c 4 s 20 q fd c fd œÄ c 4 s tanh c 4 s s moreover the dimensionless pressure and its derivative were calculated by this dynamic fracture model under constant fracture length and compared with the results of stalgorova and mattar 2012 and the parameter configuration for this comparative analysis is shown in table 1 as shown in fig 7 the good agreement of pressure and flow rate curves shows that the dynamic fracture model proposed in this paper is reliable 3 2 transient flow response the shrinkage effect of the fracture length along y direction is focused on in this paper in order to describe the fracture closure behavior more realistically lower porosity and compressibility in the closed fracture zone were used and the model parameter configuration can be shown in table 2 fig 7 shows dimensionless transient pressure of the four zone system under the various fracture length the analysis of fig 7 shows that there may be five periods included in this dynamic fracture system fracture bilinear flow fr1 the flow behavior of fr1 is composed of steady state linear flow in the dynamic fracture and transient linear flow in the adjacent inner area as shown in fig 7 the fracture bilinear flow can be characterized by the one quarter slope straight line from the pressure and its derivative curves however the dynamic behavior of fractures cannot be observed from the curves due to the earliest pumping period it is similar to the results of constant fracture model which can be seen from fig 8 dynamic fracture flow fr2 as the production time increases the characteristics of dynamic fracture known as the hump can be gradually captured which is reflected on the positive upwards and subsequently negative downwards on the pressure derivative curve the duration of evident bend is relatively short as a result of fracture pressure decreases rapidly and fracture length shrinks quickly it is similar to the fracture storage effect reported by wang et al 2019 the start time and end time of fracture shrinkage can be determined by the careful analysis of this typical characteristics as shown by the red arrow in fig 8 moreover the pressure derivative curve presents a higher than unit slope it is worth noting that when the fracture closure effect is significant smaller fracture shrinkage coefficient smaller fracture retained coefficient lower closed fracture permeability the pressure derivative first rises rapidly then drops fast followed by a gentle rise again before the linear flow regime begins the gentle rise before linear flow may be attributed to the fact that the inner fluid cannot rapidly supply the fracture region due to the abrupt and significant closure of the fracture the detailed discussion can be found in section 3 3 3 6 inner zone linear flow fr3 as shown in fig 8 when the fluid flows from the inner area to the dynamic fracture along the perpendicular direction of the fracture surface it can be known as inner zone linear flow meanwhile a straight line with a half slope can be shown on the log log curve of the pressure derivative which is in line with the linear flow characteristics of the formation with infinite conductivity fractures cinco et al 1978 el banbi 1998 transitional flow fr4 as shown in fig 8 the shorter intermediate stage between the inner zone linear flow fr3 and the boundary dominated flow fr5 can be observed which is controlled by the difference between the inner and outer zones in physical properties jiang et al 2020 zhang and yang 2021 boundary dominated flow fr5 eventually a straight line with unit slope can be shown in the transient pressure response for the later period it is worth mentioning that the inner boundary in this work is half of the spacing between two adjacent fractures which is much smaller than the outer boundary of the reservoir therefore the boundary dominant flow phase occurs earlier wattenbarger et al 1998 wei et al 2019 zhang and yang 2021 more specifically there may be a slight deviation after td becomes large than 100 it may be attributed to fluid supply from outer zone in the later period it has been reported that the boundary dominated flow can be subdivided into an inner boundary dominated flow and an outer boundary dominated flow with a straight line slightly deviating from the unit slope between them al rbeawi 2018 zhu et al 2018 the focus of this paper is to emphasize the effect of the dynamic fracture behavior therefore the boundary dominated flow is not further subdivided in this paper the above five flow stages may not occur in the actual cases of a well at the same time which is dependent on the physical properties e g well storage coefficient flow skin factor the permeability of open fracture area closed fracture area and inner zone retained fracture coefficient etc of the formation in other words some flow stages may be missing in the actual cases and the sensitivity analysis of key parameters will be discussed in detail in the next section 3 3 dynamic fracture behavior in order to investigate the effect of dynamic fracture behavior on transient flow curve the transient pressure and rate behaviors under the conditions of dynamic fracture and constant length fracture were discussed in detail the parameter of this comparative analysis can be referred to table 3 and the corresponding results can be shown in fig 9 as shown in fig 8 a compared with the constant length fracture there will be positive upwards in the early stage of the transient pressure curves which will make the straight line with half slope of the inner area linear flow move upwards meanwhile the pressure curve has also been positive upwards which may be accounted for the fracture closure as the decrease of fracture pressure compared with the results of constant length fracture the dimensionless flow rate decreases significantly due to the closure of the fracture as mentioned in eq 17 eq 18 the dynamic fracture behavior with skin factor sc 2 and wellbore storage coefficient cd 0 004 is analyzed in detail and compared with the constant fracture as shown in fig 10 five flow periods can also be observed from the pressure and pressure derivative curves the first stage fr1 is the well storage stage with unit slope the second stage fr2 is the transient flow stage controlled by sc and cd and the subsequent three stages are similar to the dynamic fracture behavior without sc and cd as shown in fig 8 compared with the constant fracture with sc and cd the pressure and pressure derivative show a clear upward characteristic and the dynamic fracture behavior in fr2 exhibits similar storage effect it means the fracture dynamic behavior hidden in transient features can be easily interpreted as larger well storage coefficients therefore the wellbore storage and skin factors are not considered in the sensitivity analysis 3 4 effect of fracture shrinkage factor as can be seen from the eq 2 eq 3 one of the key parameters that affect the dynamic behavior of fractures is the fracture shrinkage factor delpat which can be used to determine the speed of shrinkage of the fracture length the comparative analysis under the various fracture shrinkage factor on transient pressure behavior was discussed in this section fig 11 was amplified in y coordinate to observe the differences of pressure derivative more clearly in log log plot the coefficient of fracture shrinkage delpat mainly affects the dynamic fracture flow fr2 as delpat decreases the positive upwards of dynamic fracture will appear in advance it is noteworthy that when the fracture shrinkage coefficient is 0 1 there is a short period of rise in the pressure derivative before the linear flow this may attribute to rapid closure of fractures while the fluid in the inner zone is not supplemented to the fracture in time even worse the characteristics of fracture closure may be hidden if delpat is too small which may be caused by the instantaneous pressure depletion in the fractures moreover the effect of fracture shrinkage coefficient delpat on fracture closure dynamic fracture coefficient œÉ was further analyzed as shown in fig 12 it indicated that the shrinkage factor affected the speed of fracture closure with the increase of delpat the fractures are closed from abruptly to gradually which could be introduced to simulate the fracture closure with different proppants supported 3 5 effect of the retained fracture coefficient the retained fracture coefficient b is also the key factor that directly affects fracture closure from eq 2 eq 3 it can be seen that the value of b determines the maximum degree of fracture length shrinkage the larger retained factor means less fracture length shrinkage the transient pressure and flow rate behavior under different fracture closure conditions were investigated in this paper the constant fracture condition b 1 is added to better observe the difference in pressure derivative curves and flow behavior between dynamic and constant fracture conditions as shown in fig 13 it can be seen that the upward trend in the pressure derivative and the declining trend in the flow rate of the dynamic fracture are quite obvious compared to the constant fracture with the decrease of retained fracture coefficient the more obvious the fracture length shrinkage and the greater the positive upward of pressure and pressure derivative will be in the log log plot as shown in fig 13 b the effect of retained fracture coefficient on flow rate can be summarized as the smaller the retained fracture factor the lower the dimensionless flow rate which is caused by the closure of the fracture therefore if fracture closure is not considered the flow rate will be seriously overestimated which may be one of the reasons why the flow rate drops rapidly in the later period of production especially for the fractured aquifers 3 6 effect of the closed fracture permeability the effect of closed fracture permeability kfc on pressure and flow rate transient behavior is analyzed when the closed fracture permeability kfc is equal to the open fracture permeability kf kfc kf 1 10 12 m2 it means fracture length shrinkage is not considered as shown in fig 14 fig 15 the closed fracture permeability mainly affects fr3 stage and with the increase of kfc the upward warpage of the pressure curve is smaller and the flow rate will gradually increase in other words the influence of fracture length shrinkage on pressure and flow rate behavior will be compensated by the increase of closed fracture permeability similarly when the closed fracture permeability kf c is 0 1 10 15 m2 the pressure derivative has a gentle rise before the linear flow this may be due to the permeability is too low after fracture closure and the inner zone fluid is not timely supplemented into the fracture 4 dissusion although a semi analytical model considering the dynamic fracture behavior is proposed in this paper it can be used to analyze the effect of fracture shrinkage length on the trasient pressure and pumping rate behaviors however there may be two possible fluid flow models for lower permeability of closed fracture the fluid in region 1 may flow to the open fracture zone when the closed fracture permeability is lower than region 1 as shown in fig 16 a even worse when the closed fracture permeability is close to 0 the fluid in region 1 will no longer flow to the closed fracture area but will flow perpendicular to region 2 with higher permeability these two possible alternatives are suggested for studies in the near future 5 conclusions a dynamic fracture semi analytical model for transient behavior analysis of a four zone system has been proposed in this paper the improved pressure dependent dynamic fracture coefficient is introduced to quantitatively describe the fracture closure during the pronged pumping period the pressure and flow solutions can be obtained immediately by pressure calculation combined with numerical inversion in laplace space and the synchronous numerical iteration in real space this new model without fracture grid division developed by the integration of laplace domain and real time domain makes the model setup easier moreover the following conclusions can be drawn from this semi analytical model of dynamic fracture 1 the dynamic fracture model with the four zone system may develop five flow stages on the dimensionless pressure and pressure derivative curves fracture bilinear flow dynamic fracture flow inner area linear flow transitional flow and boundary dominated flow the dynamic fracture behavior is mainly reflected on the obvious positive upwards in the dynamic fracture flow stage and the inner area linear flow more specifically the pressure derivative curve in the dynamic fracture flow presents a higher than unit slope 2 compared with the constant length fracture it indicates the obvious positive upward in the early stage of the transient pressure curves makes the straight line with half slope of the inner area linear flow move upwards the obvious decrease of pumping rate indicates that fracture closure will result in a rapid decline in flow rate which might be the reason why the production decreases quickly during the long pumping period 3 the fracture shrinkage coefficient affects the speed of fracture closure mainly manifested in the dynamic fracture flow and inner zone linear flow as the shrinkage coefficient increases the fractures are closed from abruptly to gradually and the typical signatures of fracture closure may be hidden if shrinkage factor is too small which may be caused by the instantaneous pressure depletion in the fractures 4 with the decrease of retained fracture coefficient there is greater positive upward of transient pressure behavior and a lower flow rate in the log log plot which may be caused by the closure of the fracture and thus the flow rate will be seriously overestimated if fracture closure is not considered especially for the tight formation in addition the influence of fracture length shrinkage on pressure and flow rate behavior will be compensated by the increase of closed fracture

2732,the use of plantations and natural restoration enhance vegetation coverage and contribute significantly to the hydrologic functions of degraded terrestrial ecosystems researchers have investigated the development and use of plantations however few studies looked at naturally restored vegetation especially for early successional areas we applied a series of treatments and their impacts on water status and the dominant woody species were monitored our goal is to enhance the hydrologic functions of naturally restored karst vegetation that stagnated as early successional shrubby grassland our results show that vegetation on both the upper and lower slopes intercepted approximately 50 of the rainfall because of the dense community structure with more than 60 of the community level root biomass concentrated in the upper 20 cm soil depth shallow soil water content sswc decreased continuously even when there was scattered light rain events on the lower slopes competition reducing oriented removal of non woody species significantly reduced canopy interception of water which contributed to the increase of sswc and water availability for the remaining dominant woody species moreover dominant woody species in the treated plot exhibited more negative leaf carbon isotope values than the same species in the control plot indicating released water limitation on plant growth because of the treatment on the contrary this treatment exhibited negligible effects on sswc on the upper slope environmental water status could only be improved by improving soil water storage capacity our results highlight strong competition on sswc for naturally restored vegetation on karst hillslopes that stagnated during the early successional stages in lower slope position where soil is relatively deep competition reducing oriented treatment alone can release water limitations on plant growth and provide opportunities for the settlement of species with different hydrologic niches thus providing a path for enhancing hydrologic functions of naturally restored karst vegetation keywords karst ecosystems natural restoration soil water stress selective removal throughfall data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction satellite imagery shows an increase in vegetation greenness in the northern hemisphere since the 1980s which was subsequently observed across the globe piao et al 2020 although co2 fertilization was believed to be the main driver of greening on the global scale other factors such as ecological engineering played important roles especially in china chen et al 2019 almost two decades after the initiation of large scale ecological restoration projects in china both vegetation coverage and above ground biomass as well as the associated ecosystem function of carbon sequestration have increased considerably ouyang et al 2016 currently other ecosystem functions such as hydrologic function in relationship to vegetation greenness are the focus of research research is in early stages of development especially in karst regions that involve fast hydrologic processes as one of the largest exposed carbonate rock areas in the world yuan et al 1994 with sufficient heat and precipitation the subtropical karst region of southwestern china is an extremely fragile ecological environment with shallow soil layer and a well developed epikarst zone liu et al 2012 human disturbance has caused the destruction of vegetation and intense rocky desertification liu et al 2021 due to a number of ecological engineering and restoration projects the area has become a hot spot of global greening brandt et al 2018 tong et al 2018 2020 the use of natural restoration and plantations has led to vegetation restoration in the region chen et al 2011 piao et al 2015 forzieri et al 2020 liu et al 2021 compared with homogeneous plantations vegetation on karst hillslopes exhibits a fragmented distribution pattern and disparate successional stages under natural restoration even between adjacent slopes there were differences in vegetation communities from secondary forests to shrub tussock communities liu et al 2012 jiang et al 2014 yang et al 2016a zhang et al 2017 since ecosystem functions and services are normally enhanced with succession especially hydrologic functions huxman et al 2005 yuan et al 2013 hua et al 2022 the question of how to promote the settlement of species with different hydrologic niches in naturally restored karst vegetation deserves exploration the fragmentation characteristics of naturally restored vegetation in karst regions are closely related to the spatial heterogeneity of habitats cao et al 2004 for instance secondary forests dominated by late successional trees species grow on rocky outcrops while dense early successional shrub grasslands are in adjacent habitats with relatively continuous soil with limited hydrologic functions jiang et al 2014 yang et al 2016a lusk and laughlin 2017 nie et al 2019 the presence of fractures and fissures in the outcrop bedrock result in late successional species holscher et al 2002 relatively sparse vegetation occur in exposed bedrock habitats with rock fissures furthermore the presence of the natural barriers formed by rock fractures reduce the resource competition among interspecies of vegetation communities sckenk 2006 schwinning 2010 2013 in continuous shallow soil habitats shallow rooted species tend to grow easily and grow rapidly into dense communities due to the absence of rock fissures and the accessibility of shallow soil resources matthes and larson 2006 nie et al 2019 moreover canopy interception by the dense communities reduces rainfall availability especially during light rain events grunicke et al 2020 sun et al 2018 2022 as a consequence there will be probably strong competition for water among species within a community hence it is worth trying to weaken the intra community water competition to create favorable conditions for the colonization and growth of late successional species on karst slopes with vegetation communities stuck in an early successional growth stage researchers have found positive impacts of thinning on the growth performance of the remaining trees and water availability by reducing competition for light water and nutrients sohn et al 2013 sohn et al 2016 cabon et al 2018 park et al 2018 navarro cerrillo et al 2019 to be specific thinning changed the spectral environment in the forest which improves the plant diversity and the biomass of herbs in a short period of time moore and owens 2006 forest cover reduction increased the replenishment of soil water through increasing throughfall chirino et al 2006 molina and del campo 2012 del campo et al 2018 del campo et al 2019a del campo et al 2019b furthermore thinning enhances tree growth by decreasing the competition for water and nutrients increasing the photosynthetic rates and improving water use and carbon uptake in some plantations breda et al 2006 mcdowell 2011 lechuga et al 2017 however at sites where water rather than light is limiting thinning also enhances soil evaporation and may not be beneficial giuggiola et al 2016 in recently thinned stands higher wind speeds and greater penetration of solar radiation can lead to greater transpiration and evaporative water loss compared to unthinned stands lagergren et al 2008 brooks and mitchell 2011 this may compensate or even reverse the previously described positive effects of thinning on water availability the contrasting results among the studies reported above are likely related to dissimilar site conditions tree species and thinning regime sohn et al 2016 moreover the studies mentioned above all were aimed at mature forest communities or plantations the response of the remaining species in the early successional stage shrub grassland has not been studied at length thinning is often used in arid or semi arid areas to reduce the drought stress of the remaining plants in the community however little research has been done on thinning in the humid karst areas in southwest china and further research needs to be performed on the specific effect on remaining species and plant water relations here based on the above analysis of species distribution in two different habitats a more predictable path for the settlement of species with different hydrologic niches in vegetation communities stagnated in an early successional stage may be through weakening the inter species competition for soil water the thinning method selected to reduce soil water competition between non woody and woody species included the removal of all herbs including non woody vines leaving only the woody species the water dynamics of this community structure optimization method was evaluated by monitoring the throughfall shallow soil water content 0 20 cm sswc as an indicator of rainfall replenishment and indexes that reflect the response of the woody species to their habitat were measured we hypothesized that 1 our removal of non woody species could effectively improve the replenishment of soil water through increasing throughfall especially under the light and moderate rain events and that 2 under the comprehensive effect of the thinning treatment the remaining woody species can have an improved shallow soil water status and grow better 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in a small catchment with an area of 146 1 ha in the huanjiang observation and research station for karst ecosystems fig 1 administrated by the chinese academy of sciences located in guangxi province southwest china 24 43 58 9 24 44 48 8 n 108 18 56 9 108 19 58 4 e this typical karst catchment has bedrock dominated by dolomite and the elevation ranges from 272 0 to 647 2 m asl hillslopes are characterized by steep slopes 62 25 and fragmented habitats nie et al 2019 more than half the hillslopes have shallow soils 10 30 cm on average underlain by weakly weathered or consolidated bedrock and loose rock soil usually a thin layer of coarse gravel underlain by a thick layer of soil and rock fragments with more gravelly soil layers on upper slopes nie et al 2014a yang et al 2016a the downslope soil depth is relatively thick and has stronger water storage capacity than that of the upper slope and the soil viscosity is stronger with an increase in soil depth which results in lower saturated hydraulic conductivity zhang et al 2013 yang et al 2019 a subtropical mountainous monsoon climate dominates the study area with a mean annual temperature of 18 5 c and a mean annual rainfall of 1389 mm which lasts 170 180 days in the rainy season i e from late april to the end of september and the rainfall accounts for more than 80 of the annual rainfall yang et al 2012 the dry season is mainly concentrated in october current year to march next year often causing a seasonal drought moreover the study area has experienced more frequent precipitation and drought extremes in the past 50 years liu et al 2015 in this region the primeval forest was a mixed evergreen and deciduous broad leaf forest the forest experienced severe deforestation from the 1950s through the mid 1980s due to human disturbances these primeval forests now exist only in natural reserve and fengshui forests huang et al 2009 du et al 2017 which are remote places with little human activity and a worship place that are located downslope from the village either along a stream or along a path exiting the village with the belief that they hold in the village s wealth and prevent it from flowing away with the water or wind zhou et al 2022 under the large scale implementation of china s policy of grain for green our test area has been under natural restoration for almost 30 years chen et al 2011 yang et al 2016a while the vegetation on the karst hillslopes exhibits a fragmented distribution pattern in disparate successional stages which is related to the heterogeneity of the habitats under natural restoration currently tussock and sparse shrublands are the most common vegetation types on slopes with continuous naturally restored soil generally the number of shrubs and trees increases gradually from uphill to downhill but in general the non woody species a large number of thatch and non woody vines flourish and occupy lots of area in early successional vegetative communities with a few woody pioneer species such as mallotus barbatus pittosporum tonkinense rhus chinensis vitex negundo broussonetia papyifera there are some secondary forests with many late successional species on adjacent rock outcrop slopes ma et al 2020 2 2 experimental design and instrumentation 2 2 1 sample plots and treatment design the plant communities on karst slopes are quite heterogenous studies in this small catchment show that the resources within a habitat vary within the same vegetation type when far away or with varying slopes fu et al 2015 to reduce the impact of the variation within a specific habitat type the distance between control and treated plots was kept as short as possible in this study for example a control and treated plot were both located on a naturally restored southeast facing slope moreover to avoid marginal effects we selected an intermediate area on a naturally restored slope for our sample plots and set specific intervals between each plot to eliminate interactions due to the large difference between the rock and the soil environments found on the slope yang et al 2019 the area was divided into upper and lower slopes forming 4 plots ck l plot ck u plot t l plot and t u plot with the size of 65 m 20 m each to verify the similarity between control and treated plots we surveyed the soil and vegetation within each plot before our experiment we found apparent differences in soil and vegetation between the upper and lower slope positions while the control and treated plots on the same slope position were without obvious differences table s1 the soil depth clay content and bulk density of the plots on lower slopes were evidently higher than those of the plots on upper slopes and vice versa for the rock content vegetation on lower slopes grew better than that on upper slopes and the coverage of non woody species on upper slopes was obviously higher than on lower slope position by more than 10 and to minimize the heterogeneity of the rock and soil environments found in each plot four subplots with a size of 10 m 20 m were created along the slope from the bottom of each plot with an interval of 5 m between each subplot along the slope fig 1 on the lower slope we eliminated the herbs and non woody vines leaving only woody plants to optimize the community structure in t l plot while maintaining the original community structure in ck l plot fig 1 the closeness was reduced from nearly 100 in ck l plot to 63 in t l plot by a thinning treatment figure s1 the proportion of non woody plants on the upper slope is much higher than on the lower slope we used the same thinning intensity to optimize the community structure where the closeness of t u plot was approximately 60 after thinning due to the existence of overly dense non woody plants on the upper slope coverage of approximately 50 after thinning each subplot contained strips of open space that were approximately 1 m i e the completely bare area on upper slope was our t1 u plot figure s2 since the upper slope had extremely shallow gravelly soil the rock content was approximately 50 which resulted in low soil water storage capacity and rapid hydrologic infiltration we added two treatments to the strips to slow down the lateral runoff from the soil bedrock interface we added a dam board at a depth of 20 cm to the rock soil interface in the strip area named t2 u plot on this basis to enhance the soil water holding capacity we used a soil auger to obtain soil mixed a water retaining agent into the soil and then backfill the soil into t3 u plot the experiment began on march 20 2019 and the thinning process began in mid april 2019 the experiment ended at the end of may 2020 the plot thinning treatment was carried out once or twice a month during the experimental period while the dam board and water retaining agent were one time exploratory measures 2 2 2 the determination of throughfall and the sswc throughfall was determined through the collection device made of pvc pipes and plastic drums a 100 cm long pvc pipe was fixed to four 20 cm high iron bars on a random area on the ground of each subplot the height of most non woody species in our plots was greater than 20 cm both ends of the pvc pipe were sealed and one end of the pipe was connected with a slender rubber pipe to a 50l plastic drum for collecting throughfall moreover more accurately collect throughfall a fine iron sand mesh was spread over the pvc pipe to prevent other impurities from entering the plastic drum figure s2 after each rainfall no rainwater accumulated on the ground and no obvious dripping occurred on the leaf surface the throughfall and rainfall in the subplots were determined by a measuring cylinder sswc volumetric water content was manually measured with time domain reflectometry tdr probes it was manually monitored and recorded every 3 5 days during the dry season during the rainy season with frequent rainfall sswc was monitored within 12 h of each rainfall with a frequency of once per day the shallow soil water environment in each subplot was measured nearly half a month before the thinning process the collection device and tdr probes in each subplot were arranged parallel to the slope 3 times for each subplot fig 1 in each plot the average value calculated from four and twelve measured points from the lower boundary to the upper boundary was used as the final value of the throughfall and sswc respectively then the increasing proportion of sswc in our treated plots were calculated by the following formula 1 Œ¥ s s w c ssw c t m e a n s s w c ck m e a n s s w c ck m e a n 100 where sswct mean and sswcck mean are the mean values of sswc in treatment plots and control plots respectively 2 2 3 the water absorption characteristics of the vegetation communities and the response of remaining woody species to thinning treatment on the lower slope to obtain a qualitive understanding of the water absorption characteristics of the vegetative communities on the restored slopes we determined the spatial distribution of the fine roots of the plants in the plots before exploring the effect of our treatment on the remaining species first we randomly excavated a 3 m trench parallel to the slope direction on ck u and ck l plots respectively at the place where the dominant tree species are concentrated fig 1 the depth of the trench was 70 cm with no visible root system three 20 cm 20 cm sections were selected at equal intervals in the excavated trenches and every 10 cm of soil was excavated from each section then all samples were transferred into plastic bags and transported to the laboratory fine root samples 2 mm were washed to free them of adhering soil and organic matter and separated manually into living roots and dead roots based on visual inspection furthermore to have a better understanding of the water absorption strategy of the dominant woody species in the plant communities we picked branches of the co dominant species on the lower slope in may 2020 after a continuous month of drought to measure the isotope values to avoid the influence of individual differences on our results the co dominant species v negundo m barbatus and p tonkinense with similar growth patterns all mature plants were selected table s2 in each plot 3 or 5 individuals of each species were selected as replicates and their diameter at breast height dbh height and crown width were measured then the samples were extracted with a cryogenic vacuum extraction system ehleringer et al 2000 and their hydrogen and oxygen isotope values of the extracted water were measured with an isotope ratio infrared 201 spectroscopy iris dlt 100 los gatos research mountain view ca usa at the key laboratory of agroecological processes in subtropical region chinese academy of sciences the formula for calculating the isotope values mentioned above is as follows 2 Œ¥ d 18 o r sample r s tan d a r d 1 1000 where rsample and rstandard are the ratio d h or 18o 16o of a measured sample and a standard sample respectively the standard deviation for repeat measurements was 1 for Œ¥d and 0 2 for Œ¥18o due to the calcium magnesium and clay content of karst soil the isotope values of the soil extraction water deviated from the true value and impacted the degree of match with the plant stem water isotope values meiŒ≤ner et al 2014 jiang et al 2022 to overcome this problem we chose the lc excess values as an index that only requires measurement of the stem water isotope values to determine the water source of plants this index can distinguish the utilization of water sources subject to different evaporation intensities the closer the calculated lc excess values are to 0 the less the plant water source is affected by evaporation i e the plant water source comes from a relatively stable underground reservoir ding et al 2021 then we calculated lc excess values of the main woody species in communities combined with local s meteoric water line lmwl based on the stem water isotope values to evaluate the water source of the main woody species in this study the formula for calculating the isotope values mentioned above is as follows 3 lc e x c e s s Œ¥ d a Œ¥ 18 o b where a and b represent the slope and y intercept of the lmwl in this region zhang et al 2022a zhang et al 2022b on the lower slope where a shallow soil water environment is most likely to be improved we determined the effect of the thinning treatment on the water environment of our selected woody species by measuring the water potential and the carbon isotopes of leaves Œ¥13c their predawn and midday water potential dynamics were monitored once or twice a month to analyze their water use strategies and the changes in their soil water environment liu et al 2012 to understand the impact of our thinning treatment on the shallow soil water environment in the dry season the key period of plant growth we determined the water potential from september to december and the Œ¥13c values reflecting the water use efficiency of plants were collected and measured in may 2020 navarro cerrillo et al 2019 the formula for calculating the isotope values mentioned above is as follows 4 Œ¥ 13 c r sample r s tan d a r d 1 1000 where rsample and rstandard are the ratio 13c 12c of a measured sample and a standard sample respectively the standard deviation for repeat measurements was 0 2 for Œ¥ 13c 2 3 statistical analysis the rainfall collected in the experiment was classified as light rain 0 9 9 mm moderate rain 10 24 9 mm heavy rain 25 49 9 mm and rainstorm 50 99 9 mm according to the classification standard of the china meteorological administration based on the accumulated rainfall over 24 h then we used a one way anova spss software version 22 0 to test for significant difference p 05 between treatment selective removal of non woody species and control plots on the lower slope of the throughfall proportion under different amounts of rainfall we also used this method to determine the effects on Œ¥13c values of the co dominant species by treatment finally the pearson correlation was used to conduct the correlation analysis between throughfall proportion and rainfall all figures were plotted with origin software version 9 0 3 results 3 1 the water absorption characteristics of vegetative communities in naturally restored slopes in the control plots our findings showed that the fine root biomass was concentrated in the shallow soil layers and decreased sharply with soil depth fig 2 specifically the biomass in 0 20 cm soil layer accounted for more than 65 of the total biomass in all soil layers moreover the values of the lc excess of the dominant woody species in ck l and ck u plots were approximately 20 table s2 indicating that they used the shallow soil water strongly impacted by evaporation 3 2 the effect of thinning treatment on shallow soil water environment the throughfall proportion in control plots was relatively low 60 on the upper and lower slopes due to the high canopy interception in our control plots fig 3 our thinning treatment improved throughfall proportion by increasing the throughfall proportion of the treated plots which was greater than control plots eventually stability was reached and throughfall ceased to increase under heavy rain events this lifting effect was especially evident on the lower slope fig 3a 3c specifically under moderate and light rain events 25 mm when rainfall was infrequent the throughfall proportion of the treated plot was 10 greater than the control plot fig 3c which effectively increased the replenishment of soil water the sswc fluctuates greatly in the control plot during the experiment with a range of 15 4 34 3 on the lower slope fig 4 a the obviously positive effect of thinning appeared when only occasional moderate and light rain events occurred resulting in a relatively low sswc about 20 fig 4a the impact of treatment on sswc remained at about 10 compared with ck l plot fig 4b when there was relatively high sswc in plots about 30 during frequent rainfall and some heavy rain events our treatment had no obvious impact on enhancing the sswc fig 4b the variation trend of sswc in control plot on upper slope was similar to that on lower slope with the range of 9 6 22 3 fig 5 a however the same thinning treatment alone t1 u plot had no obvious impact on improving sswc on the upper slope fig 5b on the basis of additional measures to slow down lateral runoff t2 u plot water retaining agent was added t3 u plot to enhance soil water holding capacity sswc increased at the early stage of our experimental period from april to august while during the later stages of our experimental period there was no difference in sswc between all treated and control plots fig 5 3 3 response of the remaining woody species to thinning treatment the remaining species exhibited a clear response to our treatment which was related to the improved sswc during scarce rain periods on the lower slope by the selective removal of non woody species specifically except for the m barbatus data of the water potential not shown the selected species of t l plot had an obviously positive response to our treatment fig 6 specifically the predawn and midday water potential of the treated plot was obviously more positive than that of control plot when the rainfall was infrequent with relatively low antecedent sswc fig 6b 6d they were similar in two plots when the antecedent sswc was relatively high after the occurrence of heavy rain events fig 6a 6c furthermore due to long term adaptation the Œ¥13c values of the remaining woody species evidently decreased after almost half a year of thinning treatment to reduce competition in the water environment of plant root zone fig 7 especially for v negundo and p tonkinense the Œ¥13c values in t l plot were significantly more negative than that in ck l plot 4 discussion the vegetative restoration of karst regions in southwest china has contributed greatly to global greening but patches of dense shrub grasslands in the early stage of succession still existed in the highly heterogeneous habitats of karst slopes under natural restoration we conducted community structure optimization measures to improve the shallow soil water environment and decrease the water limitations on the remaining woody species in this habitat thus providing an opportunity for the settlement of species with different hydrologic niches which could provide a path for enhancing hydrologic functions that improve plants in regulating water cycle of vegetative communities stagnated in early successional stages we observed these impacts through measuring the throughfall proportion sswc water potential Œ¥13c Œ¥18o values of leaves of the dominant woody species the spatial distribution of fine roots within communities and water isotope values of plant branches as our expected we found that sswc increased obviously after the selective removal of non woody species the water environment of the plant root zone and growth of the remaining woody plants were improved in view of the above results we discussed the competition for shallow soil water within plant communities and the obvious improvement in sswc thus benefiting the growth of the remaining woody species 4 1 the shallow soil water competition among species within communities on naturally restored karst hillslopes we found that a large amount of fine root biomass was concentrated in the shallow soil layer on hillslopes fig 2 the same result was found in the research on the vertical distribution of fine root biomass in the vegetation restoration area du et al 2019 moreover our data unexpectedly showed that the values of the lc excess of the dominant woody species which probably employed deep root systems to utilize deep water sources in control plots were around 20 table s2 indicating that they used the shallow soil water strongly impacted by evaporation hence the above results were combined to illustrate that there was strong competition for shallow soil water in naturally restored shrub grasslands this maybe be closely related to the climate of the humid karst region in such an area the species with shallow roots can obtain the readily accessible shallow water to sustain growth due to the abundant precipitation in wet seasons huang et al 2011 nie et al 2019 and species tend to survive through falling leaves during the dry season delzon 2015 hence they don t need deep roots to obtain deep water through the dry season moreover after a series of human disturbances the soil conditions have been completely altered under the context of natural restoration annual herbs and non woody lianas easily settle in this area due to their rapid growth rate and an investment in the accumulation of aboveground parts caused by the continuous soil layer wright et al 2004 resco et al 2011 yang et al 2013 craine and dybzinski 2013 they quickly occupy favorable ecological niches and form dense communities if other woody species with deep roots want to settle and survive in this dense community they must be able to compete with these non woody species for shallow soil water ma et al 2020 unlike the habitat with a continuous soil layer the presence of fissures on outcrop bedrock water separation requires deep rooted species to invest large amounts of resources in root structure rather than in aboveground biomass accumulation nie et al 2017 in short mutual interactions of various environmental factors such as climate and geotechnical structure and inherent plant adaptation have resulted in the current shallow rooted vegetation composition outcome in communities stagnated in early successional stages due to the heterogeneity of the soil and rock environment zhang et al 2022 the composition of shallow rooted vegetation on the upper and lower slopes is not the same for the vegetative communities on the upper slope the trenches on the upper slope contained visibly higher rock fragment content than that on lower slope fig 1 which is consistent with the soil profiles excavated by yang et al 2019 in this small catchment they also showed that the soil depth on the upper slope was lower than on the lower slope result in difficulty in root penetration into deeper layers moreover shallow soil resulting from weak weathering of dolomite on the upslope also make woody plants as strongly dependent on shallow soil water as herbaceous plants within the community schwinning et al 2002 2005 zhang et al 2021 with greater soil depth on the lower slope the readily accessible water for plants was still concentrated in the shallow soil due to the fact that the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity ks of the surface soil was significantly higher than that of other soil horizons in the shrub grassland fu et al 2015 our team found that with the increase in soil depth on the karst slope greater clay content in the soil led to higher soil bulk density and finally made ks in the deep soil low or at 0 chen et al 2011 hwang et al 2012 yang et al 2016b under these circumstances plant roots are more likely to concentrate in the shallow soil layer and have an increase in lateral development roots have limited growth in deep soil and tend to extend radially to obtain water resources ma et al 2020 nie et al 2014b wang et al 2018 liu et al 2021 however there were no late successional species with deep roots within communities even if they were not endemic to the rocky outcrop environment bartlett et al 2012 nie et al 2019 it s very likely that the existing water limited environment in habitats with shallow continuous soil hindered the colonization and growth of these late successional species hence it needs an improved shallow soil water environment for the settlement of deep rooted species through competition reducing oriented treatment on karst slopes with continuous soil 4 2 selective removal of non woody species improved sswc and growth of dominant woody species on naturally restored karst slopes it was found that selective removal of non woody species alone on the lower slope clearly improved sswc during the critical periods when rainfall was infrequent and sswc was relatively low as in low biomass forests in spain thinning enhanced the sswc of treated plot by increasing net precipitation within the vegetation community del campo et al 2019b similarly the research in the shortgrass steppe of northeastern colorado showed that selective removal of the herbaceous understory main grasses immediately increased water storage in the top 60 cm of the soil dodd et al 1998 however the enhancement of sswc by thinning treatment alone in this study relates to our experimental period fig 4 the main reason for the difference was closely related to the distribution of rainfall and antecedent sswc hence the enhancement of sswc gradually occurred when sswc remained below 20 for the later period of our experiment as the rainfall frequency decreased and the rainfall events were mostly light and moderate rain during this period our selective thinning treatment which decreased the proximity of the vegetative communities by 30 from 90 to 62 significantly improving throughfall proportion especially under light and moderate rain events fig 3c figure s1 which greatly increasing the effective replenishment of sswc del campo et al 2014 ilstedt et al 2016 del campo et al 2018 belmonte et al 2022 while shrub grassland which with no non woody species is especially prone to suffer from observed projected trends in precipitation temperature and evapotranspiration lindner et al 2014 at the early stage of our experimental period with intermittent and uneven rainfall and rising temperatures increased net precipitation in a cleared structure could be counterbalanced by higher wet evaporation dunkerley 2000 therefore our thinning treatment alone had negligible effect on the sswc the obvious increase of sswc during the critical dry periods in the treated plot is the final result of the superposition effect of various and extremely complex hydrologic processes on the one hand the net rainfall enters the soil in the form of throughfall and stemflow and our selective thinning treatment also decreased the stemflow at the plot scale the stemflow flows along the stem of the plant crockford and richardson 2000 its partitioning in herbaceous vegetation is altered by thickness height and angle of stems together with rain intensity demir et al 2022 although the non woody species in our plots were very dense and tall their stem size is small due to the large amounts of resources invested in the accumulation of aboveground biomass such as leaves which is far less than the stem size of shrubs therefore compared with shrubs in our plots in the area occupied by non woody species the stemflow was small moreover we conducted a stemflow study on different vegetative communities in this small catchment the results showed that in the dense shrub grasslands the number of shrubs in the community was greatly reduced due to the dense non woody species occupying a large number of ecological niches and the stemflow rate within a community was 3 the stemflow rate of the shrublands reached nearly 17 data unpublished the stemflow of shrubs was much greater than that of non woody species in our plots which resulted in the increase in throughfall because our selective thinning treatment was larger than the effect of reduced stemflow the increased sswc was related to the above mentioned throughfall and stemflow and also related to reduced vegetation transpiration lagergren et al 2008 we didn t monitor vegetation transpiration due to the difficulty of working on karst slopes and the scattered distribution of shrubs in our plots although the contribution of reduced vegetation transpiration and increased throughfall to the increased sswc could not be completely clarified our selective thinning treatment could effectively weaken the inter species competition of sswc and improved the shallow soil water environment within a community even though the quantification of hydrologic processes stemflow and transpiration were not in this study it does not impact the results of our study further research on hydrologic processes will be beneficial the re closure of the canopy of the remaining woody species in treated plot occurred after selective removal of non woody species figure s3 and it effectively released dry season water stress which resulted in the decrease of the Œ¥13c values fig 7 the results suggest that our thinning treatment improved the shallow soil water environment which resulted in better growth of remaining woody species within the community matsushima et al 2012 zhao et al 2013 giuggiola et al 2016 li et al 2020 however the thinning treatment also supposed to change other environmental factors that affect plant growth including light and nutrients martin benito et al 2010 lechuga et al 2017 navarro cerrillo et al 2019 in terms of light less light reached the ground in control plot than in treated plot which may have an effect on photosynthesis in the growth of the infant seedlings martin benito et al 2010 yang et al 2013 but in this study the growth of the remaining woody species in the canopy class was observed to reflect the effect of the treatment on plant growth therefore the effect of the thinning treatment on light in the plot was not an important factor affecting plant growth zhang and wang 2009 suggested that plant growth in karst region is affected by mineral nutrients and zhang et al 2015 further found that the grassland in the karst region of southwest china is n limited that the secondary and primary forests are p limited and that the shrubland is constrained by n and p together or by other nutrients hence the plant growth also limited by soil nutrients in our test area our thinning treatment also supposed to change the nutrients within the treated plot and it may change the competition pattern for nutrients among the remaining woody species within the community navarro cerrillo et al 2019 wang et al 2019 the effects of soil water and nutrients on plant growth is uncertain to clarify the influence on plant growth results of further simulative experiments with nutrient addition will be needed to supplement the evidence from karst slopes where water and nutrients are the two most important factors on plants growth similarly whether the improved sswc environment will result in the preferred vegetation composition on slopes requires further exploration with the subsequent colonization of the late successional species in control and treated plots long term observation and comparison of survival rate and growth would be important on the upper slope position selective removal of non woody species has negligible effect on sswc throughout the whole experimental period fig 5 this might relate to the extremely low shallow soil water storage capacity with abundant rock fragment content on the upper slopes the rainwater immediately infiltrates into the deeper layers fu et al 2015 2016 wang et al 2018 wang et al 2020 yang et al 2019 found that mean soil water contents were close to the permanent wilting point on upper slope positions in our small catchment which suggested relatively poor water retention as the number of non woody species on upslope was much larger than that on downslope the same thinning intensity as downslope did not significantly increase the throughfall proportion in t u plot fig 2 but even the throughfall in the stripe areas was maximized the stripe areas contained open space sswc only increased at the early stage of our experimental period from april to august in t3 u plot with the water retaining agent while there was no obvious difference in sswc between treated plots and control plot at the later stages of our experimental period fig 5 the timeliness of the water retaining agent may be relatively short fortunately biochar produced from various organic materials has attracted much attention in agricultural applications sun et al 2020 many studies have found that it can effectively improve soil water holding capacity by improving soil structure and could be biodegradable with no pollution to the environment karhu et al 2011 zhang et al 2012 hardie et al 2014 obia et al 2016 the most important thing is that its efficacy lasts for a long time unlike the artificial water retaining agent in this study t3 u plot which lost its efficacy in the process of repeated water absorption leading to the inefficiency of improving sswc in the later stages of our experimental period moreover biochar application to soil not only improves water retention but also makes the soil more fertile kammann et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 have shown that nutrient deficiency always became an important factor limiting plant growth in shrub grassland on karst slopes therefore suitable local biochar should be selected as a water retaining agent for long term application to improve soil water storage capacity in subsequent forest management yi et al 2020 hussain and ravi 2021 5 conclusions in this study to pave the path for enhancing hydrologic functions of naturally restored karst vegetation that stagnated in shrub grassland we provide an example of the advantages provided by selective removal of non woody species generally our results indicated that the growth of plants on the sloping land in this study area is extremely dense and strongly dependent on the shallow soil water on the lower slope position our treatment significantly increased throughfall proportion under the light and moderate rain events which contributed to the increase of shallow soil water content sswc and water status of the remaining dominant woody species during the dry period in the treated plot moreover it also released water limitation on plant growth in contrast this treatment alone exhibited negligible effect on sswc on the upper slope position where soil water storage capacity is the key limiting factor for plant growth additional treatments indicated that environmental water status could only be improved from the aspect of improving soil water storage capacity therefore in lower slope position where soil is relatively deep competition reducing oriented treatment alone can improve the shallow soil water environment and release water limitation on plant growth in the context of global climate change our study is particularly meaningful in providing opportunity for the settlement of species with different hydrologic niches thus providing a path for enhancing hydrologic functions of naturally restored karst vegetation funding this study has been funded by the national key research and development program of china 2022yff1300703 national natural science foundation of

2732,the use of plantations and natural restoration enhance vegetation coverage and contribute significantly to the hydrologic functions of degraded terrestrial ecosystems researchers have investigated the development and use of plantations however few studies looked at naturally restored vegetation especially for early successional areas we applied a series of treatments and their impacts on water status and the dominant woody species were monitored our goal is to enhance the hydrologic functions of naturally restored karst vegetation that stagnated as early successional shrubby grassland our results show that vegetation on both the upper and lower slopes intercepted approximately 50 of the rainfall because of the dense community structure with more than 60 of the community level root biomass concentrated in the upper 20 cm soil depth shallow soil water content sswc decreased continuously even when there was scattered light rain events on the lower slopes competition reducing oriented removal of non woody species significantly reduced canopy interception of water which contributed to the increase of sswc and water availability for the remaining dominant woody species moreover dominant woody species in the treated plot exhibited more negative leaf carbon isotope values than the same species in the control plot indicating released water limitation on plant growth because of the treatment on the contrary this treatment exhibited negligible effects on sswc on the upper slope environmental water status could only be improved by improving soil water storage capacity our results highlight strong competition on sswc for naturally restored vegetation on karst hillslopes that stagnated during the early successional stages in lower slope position where soil is relatively deep competition reducing oriented treatment alone can release water limitations on plant growth and provide opportunities for the settlement of species with different hydrologic niches thus providing a path for enhancing hydrologic functions of naturally restored karst vegetation keywords karst ecosystems natural restoration soil water stress selective removal throughfall data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction satellite imagery shows an increase in vegetation greenness in the northern hemisphere since the 1980s which was subsequently observed across the globe piao et al 2020 although co2 fertilization was believed to be the main driver of greening on the global scale other factors such as ecological engineering played important roles especially in china chen et al 2019 almost two decades after the initiation of large scale ecological restoration projects in china both vegetation coverage and above ground biomass as well as the associated ecosystem function of carbon sequestration have increased considerably ouyang et al 2016 currently other ecosystem functions such as hydrologic function in relationship to vegetation greenness are the focus of research research is in early stages of development especially in karst regions that involve fast hydrologic processes as one of the largest exposed carbonate rock areas in the world yuan et al 1994 with sufficient heat and precipitation the subtropical karst region of southwestern china is an extremely fragile ecological environment with shallow soil layer and a well developed epikarst zone liu et al 2012 human disturbance has caused the destruction of vegetation and intense rocky desertification liu et al 2021 due to a number of ecological engineering and restoration projects the area has become a hot spot of global greening brandt et al 2018 tong et al 2018 2020 the use of natural restoration and plantations has led to vegetation restoration in the region chen et al 2011 piao et al 2015 forzieri et al 2020 liu et al 2021 compared with homogeneous plantations vegetation on karst hillslopes exhibits a fragmented distribution pattern and disparate successional stages under natural restoration even between adjacent slopes there were differences in vegetation communities from secondary forests to shrub tussock communities liu et al 2012 jiang et al 2014 yang et al 2016a zhang et al 2017 since ecosystem functions and services are normally enhanced with succession especially hydrologic functions huxman et al 2005 yuan et al 2013 hua et al 2022 the question of how to promote the settlement of species with different hydrologic niches in naturally restored karst vegetation deserves exploration the fragmentation characteristics of naturally restored vegetation in karst regions are closely related to the spatial heterogeneity of habitats cao et al 2004 for instance secondary forests dominated by late successional trees species grow on rocky outcrops while dense early successional shrub grasslands are in adjacent habitats with relatively continuous soil with limited hydrologic functions jiang et al 2014 yang et al 2016a lusk and laughlin 2017 nie et al 2019 the presence of fractures and fissures in the outcrop bedrock result in late successional species holscher et al 2002 relatively sparse vegetation occur in exposed bedrock habitats with rock fissures furthermore the presence of the natural barriers formed by rock fractures reduce the resource competition among interspecies of vegetation communities sckenk 2006 schwinning 2010 2013 in continuous shallow soil habitats shallow rooted species tend to grow easily and grow rapidly into dense communities due to the absence of rock fissures and the accessibility of shallow soil resources matthes and larson 2006 nie et al 2019 moreover canopy interception by the dense communities reduces rainfall availability especially during light rain events grunicke et al 2020 sun et al 2018 2022 as a consequence there will be probably strong competition for water among species within a community hence it is worth trying to weaken the intra community water competition to create favorable conditions for the colonization and growth of late successional species on karst slopes with vegetation communities stuck in an early successional growth stage researchers have found positive impacts of thinning on the growth performance of the remaining trees and water availability by reducing competition for light water and nutrients sohn et al 2013 sohn et al 2016 cabon et al 2018 park et al 2018 navarro cerrillo et al 2019 to be specific thinning changed the spectral environment in the forest which improves the plant diversity and the biomass of herbs in a short period of time moore and owens 2006 forest cover reduction increased the replenishment of soil water through increasing throughfall chirino et al 2006 molina and del campo 2012 del campo et al 2018 del campo et al 2019a del campo et al 2019b furthermore thinning enhances tree growth by decreasing the competition for water and nutrients increasing the photosynthetic rates and improving water use and carbon uptake in some plantations breda et al 2006 mcdowell 2011 lechuga et al 2017 however at sites where water rather than light is limiting thinning also enhances soil evaporation and may not be beneficial giuggiola et al 2016 in recently thinned stands higher wind speeds and greater penetration of solar radiation can lead to greater transpiration and evaporative water loss compared to unthinned stands lagergren et al 2008 brooks and mitchell 2011 this may compensate or even reverse the previously described positive effects of thinning on water availability the contrasting results among the studies reported above are likely related to dissimilar site conditions tree species and thinning regime sohn et al 2016 moreover the studies mentioned above all were aimed at mature forest communities or plantations the response of the remaining species in the early successional stage shrub grassland has not been studied at length thinning is often used in arid or semi arid areas to reduce the drought stress of the remaining plants in the community however little research has been done on thinning in the humid karst areas in southwest china and further research needs to be performed on the specific effect on remaining species and plant water relations here based on the above analysis of species distribution in two different habitats a more predictable path for the settlement of species with different hydrologic niches in vegetation communities stagnated in an early successional stage may be through weakening the inter species competition for soil water the thinning method selected to reduce soil water competition between non woody and woody species included the removal of all herbs including non woody vines leaving only the woody species the water dynamics of this community structure optimization method was evaluated by monitoring the throughfall shallow soil water content 0 20 cm sswc as an indicator of rainfall replenishment and indexes that reflect the response of the woody species to their habitat were measured we hypothesized that 1 our removal of non woody species could effectively improve the replenishment of soil water through increasing throughfall especially under the light and moderate rain events and that 2 under the comprehensive effect of the thinning treatment the remaining woody species can have an improved shallow soil water status and grow better 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in a small catchment with an area of 146 1 ha in the huanjiang observation and research station for karst ecosystems fig 1 administrated by the chinese academy of sciences located in guangxi province southwest china 24 43 58 9 24 44 48 8 n 108 18 56 9 108 19 58 4 e this typical karst catchment has bedrock dominated by dolomite and the elevation ranges from 272 0 to 647 2 m asl hillslopes are characterized by steep slopes 62 25 and fragmented habitats nie et al 2019 more than half the hillslopes have shallow soils 10 30 cm on average underlain by weakly weathered or consolidated bedrock and loose rock soil usually a thin layer of coarse gravel underlain by a thick layer of soil and rock fragments with more gravelly soil layers on upper slopes nie et al 2014a yang et al 2016a the downslope soil depth is relatively thick and has stronger water storage capacity than that of the upper slope and the soil viscosity is stronger with an increase in soil depth which results in lower saturated hydraulic conductivity zhang et al 2013 yang et al 2019 a subtropical mountainous monsoon climate dominates the study area with a mean annual temperature of 18 5 c and a mean annual rainfall of 1389 mm which lasts 170 180 days in the rainy season i e from late april to the end of september and the rainfall accounts for more than 80 of the annual rainfall yang et al 2012 the dry season is mainly concentrated in october current year to march next year often causing a seasonal drought moreover the study area has experienced more frequent precipitation and drought extremes in the past 50 years liu et al 2015 in this region the primeval forest was a mixed evergreen and deciduous broad leaf forest the forest experienced severe deforestation from the 1950s through the mid 1980s due to human disturbances these primeval forests now exist only in natural reserve and fengshui forests huang et al 2009 du et al 2017 which are remote places with little human activity and a worship place that are located downslope from the village either along a stream or along a path exiting the village with the belief that they hold in the village s wealth and prevent it from flowing away with the water or wind zhou et al 2022 under the large scale implementation of china s policy of grain for green our test area has been under natural restoration for almost 30 years chen et al 2011 yang et al 2016a while the vegetation on the karst hillslopes exhibits a fragmented distribution pattern in disparate successional stages which is related to the heterogeneity of the habitats under natural restoration currently tussock and sparse shrublands are the most common vegetation types on slopes with continuous naturally restored soil generally the number of shrubs and trees increases gradually from uphill to downhill but in general the non woody species a large number of thatch and non woody vines flourish and occupy lots of area in early successional vegetative communities with a few woody pioneer species such as mallotus barbatus pittosporum tonkinense rhus chinensis vitex negundo broussonetia papyifera there are some secondary forests with many late successional species on adjacent rock outcrop slopes ma et al 2020 2 2 experimental design and instrumentation 2 2 1 sample plots and treatment design the plant communities on karst slopes are quite heterogenous studies in this small catchment show that the resources within a habitat vary within the same vegetation type when far away or with varying slopes fu et al 2015 to reduce the impact of the variation within a specific habitat type the distance between control and treated plots was kept as short as possible in this study for example a control and treated plot were both located on a naturally restored southeast facing slope moreover to avoid marginal effects we selected an intermediate area on a naturally restored slope for our sample plots and set specific intervals between each plot to eliminate interactions due to the large difference between the rock and the soil environments found on the slope yang et al 2019 the area was divided into upper and lower slopes forming 4 plots ck l plot ck u plot t l plot and t u plot with the size of 65 m 20 m each to verify the similarity between control and treated plots we surveyed the soil and vegetation within each plot before our experiment we found apparent differences in soil and vegetation between the upper and lower slope positions while the control and treated plots on the same slope position were without obvious differences table s1 the soil depth clay content and bulk density of the plots on lower slopes were evidently higher than those of the plots on upper slopes and vice versa for the rock content vegetation on lower slopes grew better than that on upper slopes and the coverage of non woody species on upper slopes was obviously higher than on lower slope position by more than 10 and to minimize the heterogeneity of the rock and soil environments found in each plot four subplots with a size of 10 m 20 m were created along the slope from the bottom of each plot with an interval of 5 m between each subplot along the slope fig 1 on the lower slope we eliminated the herbs and non woody vines leaving only woody plants to optimize the community structure in t l plot while maintaining the original community structure in ck l plot fig 1 the closeness was reduced from nearly 100 in ck l plot to 63 in t l plot by a thinning treatment figure s1 the proportion of non woody plants on the upper slope is much higher than on the lower slope we used the same thinning intensity to optimize the community structure where the closeness of t u plot was approximately 60 after thinning due to the existence of overly dense non woody plants on the upper slope coverage of approximately 50 after thinning each subplot contained strips of open space that were approximately 1 m i e the completely bare area on upper slope was our t1 u plot figure s2 since the upper slope had extremely shallow gravelly soil the rock content was approximately 50 which resulted in low soil water storage capacity and rapid hydrologic infiltration we added two treatments to the strips to slow down the lateral runoff from the soil bedrock interface we added a dam board at a depth of 20 cm to the rock soil interface in the strip area named t2 u plot on this basis to enhance the soil water holding capacity we used a soil auger to obtain soil mixed a water retaining agent into the soil and then backfill the soil into t3 u plot the experiment began on march 20 2019 and the thinning process began in mid april 2019 the experiment ended at the end of may 2020 the plot thinning treatment was carried out once or twice a month during the experimental period while the dam board and water retaining agent were one time exploratory measures 2 2 2 the determination of throughfall and the sswc throughfall was determined through the collection device made of pvc pipes and plastic drums a 100 cm long pvc pipe was fixed to four 20 cm high iron bars on a random area on the ground of each subplot the height of most non woody species in our plots was greater than 20 cm both ends of the pvc pipe were sealed and one end of the pipe was connected with a slender rubber pipe to a 50l plastic drum for collecting throughfall moreover more accurately collect throughfall a fine iron sand mesh was spread over the pvc pipe to prevent other impurities from entering the plastic drum figure s2 after each rainfall no rainwater accumulated on the ground and no obvious dripping occurred on the leaf surface the throughfall and rainfall in the subplots were determined by a measuring cylinder sswc volumetric water content was manually measured with time domain reflectometry tdr probes it was manually monitored and recorded every 3 5 days during the dry season during the rainy season with frequent rainfall sswc was monitored within 12 h of each rainfall with a frequency of once per day the shallow soil water environment in each subplot was measured nearly half a month before the thinning process the collection device and tdr probes in each subplot were arranged parallel to the slope 3 times for each subplot fig 1 in each plot the average value calculated from four and twelve measured points from the lower boundary to the upper boundary was used as the final value of the throughfall and sswc respectively then the increasing proportion of sswc in our treated plots were calculated by the following formula 1 Œ¥ s s w c ssw c t m e a n s s w c ck m e a n s s w c ck m e a n 100 where sswct mean and sswcck mean are the mean values of sswc in treatment plots and control plots respectively 2 2 3 the water absorption characteristics of the vegetation communities and the response of remaining woody species to thinning treatment on the lower slope to obtain a qualitive understanding of the water absorption characteristics of the vegetative communities on the restored slopes we determined the spatial distribution of the fine roots of the plants in the plots before exploring the effect of our treatment on the remaining species first we randomly excavated a 3 m trench parallel to the slope direction on ck u and ck l plots respectively at the place where the dominant tree species are concentrated fig 1 the depth of the trench was 70 cm with no visible root system three 20 cm 20 cm sections were selected at equal intervals in the excavated trenches and every 10 cm of soil was excavated from each section then all samples were transferred into plastic bags and transported to the laboratory fine root samples 2 mm were washed to free them of adhering soil and organic matter and separated manually into living roots and dead roots based on visual inspection furthermore to have a better understanding of the water absorption strategy of the dominant woody species in the plant communities we picked branches of the co dominant species on the lower slope in may 2020 after a continuous month of drought to measure the isotope values to avoid the influence of individual differences on our results the co dominant species v negundo m barbatus and p tonkinense with similar growth patterns all mature plants were selected table s2 in each plot 3 or 5 individuals of each species were selected as replicates and their diameter at breast height dbh height and crown width were measured then the samples were extracted with a cryogenic vacuum extraction system ehleringer et al 2000 and their hydrogen and oxygen isotope values of the extracted water were measured with an isotope ratio infrared 201 spectroscopy iris dlt 100 los gatos research mountain view ca usa at the key laboratory of agroecological processes in subtropical region chinese academy of sciences the formula for calculating the isotope values mentioned above is as follows 2 Œ¥ d 18 o r sample r s tan d a r d 1 1000 where rsample and rstandard are the ratio d h or 18o 16o of a measured sample and a standard sample respectively the standard deviation for repeat measurements was 1 for Œ¥d and 0 2 for Œ¥18o due to the calcium magnesium and clay content of karst soil the isotope values of the soil extraction water deviated from the true value and impacted the degree of match with the plant stem water isotope values meiŒ≤ner et al 2014 jiang et al 2022 to overcome this problem we chose the lc excess values as an index that only requires measurement of the stem water isotope values to determine the water source of plants this index can distinguish the utilization of water sources subject to different evaporation intensities the closer the calculated lc excess values are to 0 the less the plant water source is affected by evaporation i e the plant water source comes from a relatively stable underground reservoir ding et al 2021 then we calculated lc excess values of the main woody species in communities combined with local s meteoric water line lmwl based on the stem water isotope values to evaluate the water source of the main woody species in this study the formula for calculating the isotope values mentioned above is as follows 3 lc e x c e s s Œ¥ d a Œ¥ 18 o b where a and b represent the slope and y intercept of the lmwl in this region zhang et al 2022a zhang et al 2022b on the lower slope where a shallow soil water environment is most likely to be improved we determined the effect of the thinning treatment on the water environment of our selected woody species by measuring the water potential and the carbon isotopes of leaves Œ¥13c their predawn and midday water potential dynamics were monitored once or twice a month to analyze their water use strategies and the changes in their soil water environment liu et al 2012 to understand the impact of our thinning treatment on the shallow soil water environment in the dry season the key period of plant growth we determined the water potential from september to december and the Œ¥13c values reflecting the water use efficiency of plants were collected and measured in may 2020 navarro cerrillo et al 2019 the formula for calculating the isotope values mentioned above is as follows 4 Œ¥ 13 c r sample r s tan d a r d 1 1000 where rsample and rstandard are the ratio 13c 12c of a measured sample and a standard sample respectively the standard deviation for repeat measurements was 0 2 for Œ¥ 13c 2 3 statistical analysis the rainfall collected in the experiment was classified as light rain 0 9 9 mm moderate rain 10 24 9 mm heavy rain 25 49 9 mm and rainstorm 50 99 9 mm according to the classification standard of the china meteorological administration based on the accumulated rainfall over 24 h then we used a one way anova spss software version 22 0 to test for significant difference p 05 between treatment selective removal of non woody species and control plots on the lower slope of the throughfall proportion under different amounts of rainfall we also used this method to determine the effects on Œ¥13c values of the co dominant species by treatment finally the pearson correlation was used to conduct the correlation analysis between throughfall proportion and rainfall all figures were plotted with origin software version 9 0 3 results 3 1 the water absorption characteristics of vegetative communities in naturally restored slopes in the control plots our findings showed that the fine root biomass was concentrated in the shallow soil layers and decreased sharply with soil depth fig 2 specifically the biomass in 0 20 cm soil layer accounted for more than 65 of the total biomass in all soil layers moreover the values of the lc excess of the dominant woody species in ck l and ck u plots were approximately 20 table s2 indicating that they used the shallow soil water strongly impacted by evaporation 3 2 the effect of thinning treatment on shallow soil water environment the throughfall proportion in control plots was relatively low 60 on the upper and lower slopes due to the high canopy interception in our control plots fig 3 our thinning treatment improved throughfall proportion by increasing the throughfall proportion of the treated plots which was greater than control plots eventually stability was reached and throughfall ceased to increase under heavy rain events this lifting effect was especially evident on the lower slope fig 3a 3c specifically under moderate and light rain events 25 mm when rainfall was infrequent the throughfall proportion of the treated plot was 10 greater than the control plot fig 3c which effectively increased the replenishment of soil water the sswc fluctuates greatly in the control plot during the experiment with a range of 15 4 34 3 on the lower slope fig 4 a the obviously positive effect of thinning appeared when only occasional moderate and light rain events occurred resulting in a relatively low sswc about 20 fig 4a the impact of treatment on sswc remained at about 10 compared with ck l plot fig 4b when there was relatively high sswc in plots about 30 during frequent rainfall and some heavy rain events our treatment had no obvious impact on enhancing the sswc fig 4b the variation trend of sswc in control plot on upper slope was similar to that on lower slope with the range of 9 6 22 3 fig 5 a however the same thinning treatment alone t1 u plot had no obvious impact on improving sswc on the upper slope fig 5b on the basis of additional measures to slow down lateral runoff t2 u plot water retaining agent was added t3 u plot to enhance soil water holding capacity sswc increased at the early stage of our experimental period from april to august while during the later stages of our experimental period there was no difference in sswc between all treated and control plots fig 5 3 3 response of the remaining woody species to thinning treatment the remaining species exhibited a clear response to our treatment which was related to the improved sswc during scarce rain periods on the lower slope by the selective removal of non woody species specifically except for the m barbatus data of the water potential not shown the selected species of t l plot had an obviously positive response to our treatment fig 6 specifically the predawn and midday water potential of the treated plot was obviously more positive than that of control plot when the rainfall was infrequent with relatively low antecedent sswc fig 6b 6d they were similar in two plots when the antecedent sswc was relatively high after the occurrence of heavy rain events fig 6a 6c furthermore due to long term adaptation the Œ¥13c values of the remaining woody species evidently decreased after almost half a year of thinning treatment to reduce competition in the water environment of plant root zone fig 7 especially for v negundo and p tonkinense the Œ¥13c values in t l plot were significantly more negative than that in ck l plot 4 discussion the vegetative restoration of karst regions in southwest china has contributed greatly to global greening but patches of dense shrub grasslands in the early stage of succession still existed in the highly heterogeneous habitats of karst slopes under natural restoration we conducted community structure optimization measures to improve the shallow soil water environment and decrease the water limitations on the remaining woody species in this habitat thus providing an opportunity for the settlement of species with different hydrologic niches which could provide a path for enhancing hydrologic functions that improve plants in regulating water cycle of vegetative communities stagnated in early successional stages we observed these impacts through measuring the throughfall proportion sswc water potential Œ¥13c Œ¥18o values of leaves of the dominant woody species the spatial distribution of fine roots within communities and water isotope values of plant branches as our expected we found that sswc increased obviously after the selective removal of non woody species the water environment of the plant root zone and growth of the remaining woody plants were improved in view of the above results we discussed the competition for shallow soil water within plant communities and the obvious improvement in sswc thus benefiting the growth of the remaining woody species 4 1 the shallow soil water competition among species within communities on naturally restored karst hillslopes we found that a large amount of fine root biomass was concentrated in the shallow soil layer on hillslopes fig 2 the same result was found in the research on the vertical distribution of fine root biomass in the vegetation restoration area du et al 2019 moreover our data unexpectedly showed that the values of the lc excess of the dominant woody species which probably employed deep root systems to utilize deep water sources in control plots were around 20 table s2 indicating that they used the shallow soil water strongly impacted by evaporation hence the above results were combined to illustrate that there was strong competition for shallow soil water in naturally restored shrub grasslands this maybe be closely related to the climate of the humid karst region in such an area the species with shallow roots can obtain the readily accessible shallow water to sustain growth due to the abundant precipitation in wet seasons huang et al 2011 nie et al 2019 and species tend to survive through falling leaves during the dry season delzon 2015 hence they don t need deep roots to obtain deep water through the dry season moreover after a series of human disturbances the soil conditions have been completely altered under the context of natural restoration annual herbs and non woody lianas easily settle in this area due to their rapid growth rate and an investment in the accumulation of aboveground parts caused by the continuous soil layer wright et al 2004 resco et al 2011 yang et al 2013 craine and dybzinski 2013 they quickly occupy favorable ecological niches and form dense communities if other woody species with deep roots want to settle and survive in this dense community they must be able to compete with these non woody species for shallow soil water ma et al 2020 unlike the habitat with a continuous soil layer the presence of fissures on outcrop bedrock water separation requires deep rooted species to invest large amounts of resources in root structure rather than in aboveground biomass accumulation nie et al 2017 in short mutual interactions of various environmental factors such as climate and geotechnical structure and inherent plant adaptation have resulted in the current shallow rooted vegetation composition outcome in communities stagnated in early successional stages due to the heterogeneity of the soil and rock environment zhang et al 2022 the composition of shallow rooted vegetation on the upper and lower slopes is not the same for the vegetative communities on the upper slope the trenches on the upper slope contained visibly higher rock fragment content than that on lower slope fig 1 which is consistent with the soil profiles excavated by yang et al 2019 in this small catchment they also showed that the soil depth on the upper slope was lower than on the lower slope result in difficulty in root penetration into deeper layers moreover shallow soil resulting from weak weathering of dolomite on the upslope also make woody plants as strongly dependent on shallow soil water as herbaceous plants within the community schwinning et al 2002 2005 zhang et al 2021 with greater soil depth on the lower slope the readily accessible water for plants was still concentrated in the shallow soil due to the fact that the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity ks of the surface soil was significantly higher than that of other soil horizons in the shrub grassland fu et al 2015 our team found that with the increase in soil depth on the karst slope greater clay content in the soil led to higher soil bulk density and finally made ks in the deep soil low or at 0 chen et al 2011 hwang et al 2012 yang et al 2016b under these circumstances plant roots are more likely to concentrate in the shallow soil layer and have an increase in lateral development roots have limited growth in deep soil and tend to extend radially to obtain water resources ma et al 2020 nie et al 2014b wang et al 2018 liu et al 2021 however there were no late successional species with deep roots within communities even if they were not endemic to the rocky outcrop environment bartlett et al 2012 nie et al 2019 it s very likely that the existing water limited environment in habitats with shallow continuous soil hindered the colonization and growth of these late successional species hence it needs an improved shallow soil water environment for the settlement of deep rooted species through competition reducing oriented treatment on karst slopes with continuous soil 4 2 selective removal of non woody species improved sswc and growth of dominant woody species on naturally restored karst slopes it was found that selective removal of non woody species alone on the lower slope clearly improved sswc during the critical periods when rainfall was infrequent and sswc was relatively low as in low biomass forests in spain thinning enhanced the sswc of treated plot by increasing net precipitation within the vegetation community del campo et al 2019b similarly the research in the shortgrass steppe of northeastern colorado showed that selective removal of the herbaceous understory main grasses immediately increased water storage in the top 60 cm of the soil dodd et al 1998 however the enhancement of sswc by thinning treatment alone in this study relates to our experimental period fig 4 the main reason for the difference was closely related to the distribution of rainfall and antecedent sswc hence the enhancement of sswc gradually occurred when sswc remained below 20 for the later period of our experiment as the rainfall frequency decreased and the rainfall events were mostly light and moderate rain during this period our selective thinning treatment which decreased the proximity of the vegetative communities by 30 from 90 to 62 significantly improving throughfall proportion especially under light and moderate rain events fig 3c figure s1 which greatly increasing the effective replenishment of sswc del campo et al 2014 ilstedt et al 2016 del campo et al 2018 belmonte et al 2022 while shrub grassland which with no non woody species is especially prone to suffer from observed projected trends in precipitation temperature and evapotranspiration lindner et al 2014 at the early stage of our experimental period with intermittent and uneven rainfall and rising temperatures increased net precipitation in a cleared structure could be counterbalanced by higher wet evaporation dunkerley 2000 therefore our thinning treatment alone had negligible effect on the sswc the obvious increase of sswc during the critical dry periods in the treated plot is the final result of the superposition effect of various and extremely complex hydrologic processes on the one hand the net rainfall enters the soil in the form of throughfall and stemflow and our selective thinning treatment also decreased the stemflow at the plot scale the stemflow flows along the stem of the plant crockford and richardson 2000 its partitioning in herbaceous vegetation is altered by thickness height and angle of stems together with rain intensity demir et al 2022 although the non woody species in our plots were very dense and tall their stem size is small due to the large amounts of resources invested in the accumulation of aboveground biomass such as leaves which is far less than the stem size of shrubs therefore compared with shrubs in our plots in the area occupied by non woody species the stemflow was small moreover we conducted a stemflow study on different vegetative communities in this small catchment the results showed that in the dense shrub grasslands the number of shrubs in the community was greatly reduced due to the dense non woody species occupying a large number of ecological niches and the stemflow rate within a community was 3 the stemflow rate of the shrublands reached nearly 17 data unpublished the stemflow of shrubs was much greater than that of non woody species in our plots which resulted in the increase in throughfall because our selective thinning treatment was larger than the effect of reduced stemflow the increased sswc was related to the above mentioned throughfall and stemflow and also related to reduced vegetation transpiration lagergren et al 2008 we didn t monitor vegetation transpiration due to the difficulty of working on karst slopes and the scattered distribution of shrubs in our plots although the contribution of reduced vegetation transpiration and increased throughfall to the increased sswc could not be completely clarified our selective thinning treatment could effectively weaken the inter species competition of sswc and improved the shallow soil water environment within a community even though the quantification of hydrologic processes stemflow and transpiration were not in this study it does not impact the results of our study further research on hydrologic processes will be beneficial the re closure of the canopy of the remaining woody species in treated plot occurred after selective removal of non woody species figure s3 and it effectively released dry season water stress which resulted in the decrease of the Œ¥13c values fig 7 the results suggest that our thinning treatment improved the shallow soil water environment which resulted in better growth of remaining woody species within the community matsushima et al 2012 zhao et al 2013 giuggiola et al 2016 li et al 2020 however the thinning treatment also supposed to change other environmental factors that affect plant growth including light and nutrients martin benito et al 2010 lechuga et al 2017 navarro cerrillo et al 2019 in terms of light less light reached the ground in control plot than in treated plot which may have an effect on photosynthesis in the growth of the infant seedlings martin benito et al 2010 yang et al 2013 but in this study the growth of the remaining woody species in the canopy class was observed to reflect the effect of the treatment on plant growth therefore the effect of the thinning treatment on light in the plot was not an important factor affecting plant growth zhang and wang 2009 suggested that plant growth in karst region is affected by mineral nutrients and zhang et al 2015 further found that the grassland in the karst region of southwest china is n limited that the secondary and primary forests are p limited and that the shrubland is constrained by n and p together or by other nutrients hence the plant growth also limited by soil nutrients in our test area our thinning treatment also supposed to change the nutrients within the treated plot and it may change the competition pattern for nutrients among the remaining woody species within the community navarro cerrillo et al 2019 wang et al 2019 the effects of soil water and nutrients on plant growth is uncertain to clarify the influence on plant growth results of further simulative experiments with nutrient addition will be needed to supplement the evidence from karst slopes where water and nutrients are the two most important factors on plants growth similarly whether the improved sswc environment will result in the preferred vegetation composition on slopes requires further exploration with the subsequent colonization of the late successional species in control and treated plots long term observation and comparison of survival rate and growth would be important on the upper slope position selective removal of non woody species has negligible effect on sswc throughout the whole experimental period fig 5 this might relate to the extremely low shallow soil water storage capacity with abundant rock fragment content on the upper slopes the rainwater immediately infiltrates into the deeper layers fu et al 2015 2016 wang et al 2018 wang et al 2020 yang et al 2019 found that mean soil water contents were close to the permanent wilting point on upper slope positions in our small catchment which suggested relatively poor water retention as the number of non woody species on upslope was much larger than that on downslope the same thinning intensity as downslope did not significantly increase the throughfall proportion in t u plot fig 2 but even the throughfall in the stripe areas was maximized the stripe areas contained open space sswc only increased at the early stage of our experimental period from april to august in t3 u plot with the water retaining agent while there was no obvious difference in sswc between treated plots and control plot at the later stages of our experimental period fig 5 the timeliness of the water retaining agent may be relatively short fortunately biochar produced from various organic materials has attracted much attention in agricultural applications sun et al 2020 many studies have found that it can effectively improve soil water holding capacity by improving soil structure and could be biodegradable with no pollution to the environment karhu et al 2011 zhang et al 2012 hardie et al 2014 obia et al 2016 the most important thing is that its efficacy lasts for a long time unlike the artificial water retaining agent in this study t3 u plot which lost its efficacy in the process of repeated water absorption leading to the inefficiency of improving sswc in the later stages of our experimental period moreover biochar application to soil not only improves water retention but also makes the soil more fertile kammann et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 have shown that nutrient deficiency always became an important factor limiting plant growth in shrub grassland on karst slopes therefore suitable local biochar should be selected as a water retaining agent for long term application to improve soil water storage capacity in subsequent forest management yi et al 2020 hussain and ravi 2021 5 conclusions in this study to pave the path for enhancing hydrologic functions of naturally restored karst vegetation that stagnated in shrub grassland we provide an example of the advantages provided by selective removal of non woody species generally our results indicated that the growth of plants on the sloping land in this study area is extremely dense and strongly dependent on the shallow soil water on the lower slope position our treatment significantly increased throughfall proportion under the light and moderate rain events which contributed to the increase of shallow soil water content sswc and water status of the remaining dominant woody species during the dry period in the treated plot moreover it also released water limitation on plant growth in contrast this treatment alone exhibited negligible effect on sswc on the upper slope position where soil water storage capacity is the key limiting factor for plant growth additional treatments indicated that environmental water status could only be improved from the aspect of improving soil water storage capacity therefore in lower slope position where soil is relatively deep competition reducing oriented treatment alone can improve the shallow soil water environment and release water limitation on plant growth in the context of global climate change our study is particularly meaningful in providing opportunity for the settlement of species with different hydrologic niches thus providing a path for enhancing hydrologic functions of naturally restored karst vegetation funding this study has been funded by the national key research and development program of china 2022yff1300703 national natural science foundation of

2733,understanding moisture sources and transport mechanisms during extreme precipitation events epes is imperative for sustainable development here potential moisture sources contributions and transport pathways were evaluated during epes over tibet plateau tp between 1951 and 2015 employing three back trajectory approaches including hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory hysplit potential source contribution function pscf and concentration weighted trajectory cwt results showed that all twenty three selected epes occurred within the tp s southern foothill back trajectories from the epes target are then clustered into five and analysis revealed that moisture sources and pathways showed a similar pattern generally moisture largely originates from three sources including airflow trajectories from the arabian sea bay of bengal and tropical subtropical area of the indian landmass besides local moisture transport within tp also has key influences for instance analysis from the first epes target showed southwesterly cluster 1 12 cluster 2 20 cluster 3 22 and southeasterly cluster 4 30 cluster 5 16 moisture paths originating from the arabian sea and northern india respectively moisture transport ivt path analysis for this target showed that all ivt clusters in descending order were 3 4 2 5 1 with a mean of 243 kg m s conversely above average ivt clusters ranged from 305 to 345 kg m s and had a mean of 334 kg m s while cluster 2 had the highest contribution of 37 moisture transport source regions obtained utilizing pscf and cwt methods naturally share comparable features proving the credibility and accuracy of the results based on the epes and back trajectory analysis in this study we demonstrated unique moisture sources and dominant moisture pathways for each epes target this is important in modeling simulating and predicting extremes in space and time and consequently for resource management this may also aid in mitigating numerous natural disasters arising from epes and provide significant scientific references for coordinated atmospheric research keywords extreme precipitation events moisture transport precipitation conversion rate back trajectory clustering potential source contribution concentration weighted trajectory tibetan plateau data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction extreme precipitation events epes have exhibited a highly increasing tendency in recent decades many studies have proven that these events result from excessive moisture in the atmospheric column and atmospheric moisture transport concerning different atmospheric systems and topographical characteristics ma et al 2018 chen et al 2019 feng et al 2020 moisture for precipitation across a specific region comes from three significant origins local evaporation accounts for only a small portion while moisture already present in the atmosphere and those transported into the area by atmospheric advection are dominant long term contributors brubaker et al 2001 trenberth et al 2003 zhang et al 2017 xu et al 2020 during epes associated weather systems can collect moisture from around 3 5 times the entire radius of the rainy region trenberth et al 2003 zhang et al 2019a feng et al 2020 even though questions of moisture sources at a location are especially intriguing moisture advection and the resulting rainfall are complicated phenomena there are varieties of moisture tracking models aimed at determining the source regions of precipitation i e the land or ocean area from which moisture available for rainfall originally evaporates bracken et al 2015 tuinenburg and staal 2020 keune et al 2022 the lagrangian models have recently gained popularity as a tool for examining global and regional moisture transportation and recycling due to their ability to define atmospheric trajectories in space and time the models could calculate backward and forward trajectories over a given area detect moisture sources trace moisture transportation patterns and variations in physical variables along those paths stohl and james 2004 2005 dirmeyer et al 2009 bracken et al 2015 tuinenburg and staal 2020 keune et al 2022 for areas with relatively complex terrain three dimensional lagrangian models are most suitable because they describe atmospheric moisture transport better under substantial vertical variability in horizontal moisture transport tuinenburg and staal 2020 recently brubaker et al 2001 and diem and brown 2006 investigated moisture origins of rainfall in the mississippi river basin and the southwest u s while gimeno et al 2010 revealed the contributions of moisture from the global ocean for each continent in various seasons studies have also shown that the mediterranean sea provides significant moisture for precipitation in southern europe botty√°n et al 2014 others studies include those over europe gustafsson et al 2010 izquierdo et al 2013 the americas brimelow and reuter 2005 drumond et al 2008 africa salih et al 2015 and the mediterranean drumond et al 2011a g√≥mez hern√°ndez et al 2013 in china sun and wang 2014 2015 and sun et al 2016 discovered moisture sources in east china and semiarid grassland revealing that moisture for rainfall over northern china and in the yangtze huaihe river basin comes predominantly from the west pacific ocean and local evaporation further chen et al 2019 discovered that moisture comes primarily from the south china sea and the bay of bengal bob throughout the summer drumond et al 2011b found that eastern china gets its moisture primarily from the eastern china sea while southern parts of china get it from the bob and the arabian sea according to li et al 2016 southwesterly moisture vapour transportation delivers moisture from the western pacific the bob and the tibetan plateau tp to south china during rainy seasons in the yangtze river basin moisture comes mainly from the east african coast the southern indian ocean and the arabian sea during the mei yu season mys jiang et al 2017 northern china s rainfall is primarily influenced by moisture from the bob middle latitude westerlies and the southern china sea western pacific ocean jiang et al 2017 it s critical to identify moisture sources across large regions like the tp which has varied rain frequency and intensity in a companion study ayantobo et al 2022 studied rain categorization and the contribution of rainfall intensities to overall rainfall variation over the tp after categorization into different intensities and frequencies from light to extreme precipitation a non parametric statistical approach was used to find trends li et al 2011 ayantobo et al 2022 finally the relative contributions of rainfall at varying intensities to overall rainfall change were investigated utilizing a multiple linear regression model and relative weights although the study showed precise information about categorized precipitation distributions it only focused on spatiotemporal change patterns with little knowledge of probable moisture origin and transport pathways hence given the importance and complexity of atmospheric water vapor transport over the tp we plan to investigate the mechanisms that underpin the epes category by studying four questions 1 what is the efficiency of precipitation conversion during epes 2 how does integrated moisture transport ivt vary and what does above average ivt mean for the epes targets 3 what are the primary moisture sources and transport pathways during epes 4 what are the contributions from the identified moisture sources during epes several trajectory analysis methodologies have been employed to evaluate the analysis via mutual verification to authenticate the reliability of the results approaches like the back trajectory model clustering analysis potential source contribution function pscf and contribution weighted trajectory cwt have become widely used methods because they provide continuous temporal simulation results that are relatively accurate hao et al 2019 following a detailed introduction the study region and datasets are described in section 2 the hysplit model and trajectory analysis methodology are explained in section 3 results of the airflow trajectory and potential moisture source contributions are presented in section 4 and a concluding remark in section 5 this study is of importance in modeling simulating and predicting extremes in space and time and consequently for resource management 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area the tp region is located in southwest china with coordinates spanning from 26 00 n to 39 46 n and 73 18 e to 104 46 e fig 1 it covers 2 5 million square kilometers of land and has a mean height of over 4 000 m making it the roof of the world qiu 2008 chen et al 2015 the region is known as the asian water tower because of the numerous rivers that originate from the southeastern side of the tp such as the yellow yangtze and lancang rivers the climate in tp is typical of the alpine region the southeast is relatively warm and humid while the northwestern areas are chilly and dry ding et al 2018 precipitation distribution is erratic most of the time for instance the annual precipitation in the southeastern motuo and northwestern lenghu zones could probably be 4000 mm and 17 6 mm respectively due to the influence of the westerlies and especially the tp landscape the mean annual temperature is around 3 1 to 4 4 c the wind speed being 3 0 m s 1 and gale weather has a wind speed of 17 m s occurring on 50 days year li et al 2016 the tp significantly impacts regional and global climates because of its unique large scale terrain and geographical location

various atmospheric variables from meteorological stations satellites weather radars balloons and reports from aircraft incorporated into a three dimensional grid point this current investigation utilizes datasets in a 1 by 1 horizontal resolution and is generally obtainable in binary form and used as input data for the hysplit model 3 methods 3 1 categorization of extreme precipitation events in epes determination previous studies have generally utilized percentile based thresholds for instance by following ayantobo et al 2022 rainfall intensity r e below 0 1 mm day is excluded to derive wet rain intensity wri r e 0 1 mm day knowing that drizzle can typically contribute a small amount to rainfall observations later the 99th percentile of the entire rainfall record from 1950 to 2015 is first calculated and depicted as the threshold value for epes li et al 2011 ayantobo et al 2022 sun et al 2021 then epes are obtained when wri exceeds the 99th percentile value at each grid point 3 2 estimation of precipitation conversion efficiency the pw is defined as the overall atmospheric water vapour in a specified air column or depth of the quantity of water that could be received if all of the water vapour within the air column condenses pw is an essential metric for determining atmospheric water supplies and the degree of climate wetness and dryness only a portion of the pw in a local air column can often be converted into actual p which varies widely the precipitable water conversion rate pwcr which is the ratio of p to pw can be used to measure the efficiency of transformation over time zhou et al 2016 ayantobo et al 2021 1 pwcr p pw 100 where pwcr shows the precipitation conversion efficiency while p is overall precipitation mm day over time within an area the pw can be estimated as zhai and eskridge 1997 2 pw 1 g p t p s q d p where pt is 300 hpa ps is 1000 hpa q is specific humidity kg kg and g is an acceleration of gravity m s2 the higher the pwcr the more significant the prospect of atmospheric water resources is especially if the air water vapour content is invariant fan et al 2016 ayantobo et al 2021 3 3 quantification of integrated moisture transport at eight isobaric surfaces the distribution and movement of atmospheric water vapour are quantified using ivt kg m s which is derived from water vapor mixing ratios such as zonal winds u m s meridional winds v m s and specific humidity q kg kg ma et al 2018 individual grid components are then summed vertically from the surface to roughly 300 hpa and then consolidated into a horizontal

observed epes target for a set time in the analysis to discover and understand probable sources of moisture that provided intense moisture during epes over the tp jiang et al 2017 for trajectories computed from wind fields 20 of the distance traveled errors are expected bracken et al 2015 given this uncertainty and the limit on moisture retention the backward trajectory of airflow is simulated hourly for 10 days i e globally averaged maximum lifetime of atmospheric moisture trenberth et al 2011 preceding the extreme event 240 h trajectories were initialized for each event every 6 h during the event period and at 500 m vertical intervals from 0 m to 5000 m above ground level 3 5 back trajectory clustering analysis the trajectory data is separated into several clusters using trajectory clustering estimation a multi variate statistical estimation approach trajstat a meteoinfo plugin that can view query and cluster airflow paths using two different cluster algorithms including the angle and euclidean distances has been frequently used in this study the angle distance clustering approach is used to group airflow paths to determine where the air masses are coming from the angle distance which spans from 0 to œÄ is commonly employed to specify the average angle between the two airflow paths wang et al 2009 study have more information on the angle distance technique data from the same cluster are comparable whereas data from other clusters differ more significantly yang et al 2019 3 6 potential source contribution function the potential source contribution function pscf model uses a conditional probability field to link higher concentrations or intensities with the residence time in the upwind regions yang et al 2019 this model can identify moisture sources by analyzing airflow trajectories at different thresholds wang et al 2009 it can be calculated as follows 4 pscf ij n ij n ij where n ij is the total amount of endpoints of airflow paths within the grid ij th and n ij is the total amount of airflow paths in the same grid for which ivt intensity exceeds a particular threshold wang et al 2009 here the average ivt intensity at each target was chosen as a threshold and the paths were estimated every hour when n ij is extremely small studies have shown that the analyzed result is uncertain when the total amount of endpoints within a specific grid cell is fewer than three times the mean amount of endpoints for every grid cell an arbitrary weight function w ij is used to eliminate this uncertainty as follows zhang et al 2019b 5 w pscf ij w ij pscf ij 6 w ij 1 00 n ij 80 0 70 20 n ij 80 0 42 10 n ij 20 0 05 0 n ij 10 3 7 concentration weighted trajectory the weighted concentrations of trajectories are computed first and afterward weighted concentrations of all grid cells are obtained using the concentration weighted trajectory cwt method the cwt technique s calculation formula is as follows zhang et al 2019b 7 cwt ij k 1 n c k œÑ ijk k 1 n œÑ ijk where cwt ij is the grid ij s weighted average concentration n is the amount of airflow trajectory where a pathway is denoted by k ck is the ivt pathway k when it crosses the ij grid cell which is estimated with the hysplit model and œÑ ijk is the length of time that trajectory k remains in grid ij stohl 1996 further the weighted coefficient wij is estimated to reduce the inherent uncertainties as follows 8 w cwt ij w ij cwt ij the distinction between cwt and pscf is that the pscf evaluates potential moisture sources using a concentration threshold if sample intensities are slightly or substantially greater than the criterion they may have the same pscf value hence it may be unable to distinguish between moderate and robust moisture origins the pscf constraint can be solved in the cwt approach by assigning a weighted intensity by averaging the sample intensities with related airflow pathways that traverse each grid cell 4 results and discussion 4 1 qualitative analysis of epes intensity and frequency many previous studies have analyzed rain intensity and frequency categorization because they are significant for rainfall variation research ding et al 2018 ayantobo et al 2022 fig 2 shows the distributions of mean daily epes across different time slides over the tp between 1951 and 2015 the spatial distribution in fig 2 a e showed that the mean annual and seasonal values varied from 3 4 to 62 6 mm day with the southern regions having the greatest intensity generally epes occurred more in the south and eastern regions than in the northwestern tp the multiyear epes ranged between 13 mm day 1953 and 18 mm day 2007 and showed a slightly decreasing trend a sharp decrease in 1953 was also observed in 2012 when 13 5 mm day was observed fig 2f the mean values reported in march and april were around 18 5 mm day and 17 5 mm day respectively which were much higher than in other months of the year fig 2g the 1970 s had the highest mean of about 16 mm day while generally the inter decadal values had averages of approximately 15 mm day and showed a slight decreasing trend fig 2h this graph showed not just precipitation occurrences in each decade but also represented the impacts of the combined and competing contributions of the westerlies and the monsoons consistent with previous studies ma et al 2018 fig 3 shows the historical frequency days distributions of daily epes across different time slides over the tp between 1951 and 2015 the annual spatial distribution showed that the frequency ranged from 24 to 175 days with the highest over the southeastern tp fig 3a the seasonal pattern in fig 3 b e showed that summer had the highest frequency and it ranged from 10 to 34 days fig 3c the multiyear epes frequency ranged from 70 days 1993 to 120 days 2009 and showed a slight decreasing trend fig 3f summer precipitation accounts for over 70 percent of yearly rainfall in the central region from the arabian sea to the northeastern part of the tp and also the majority of the southeastern tp according to previous research ma et al 2018 4 2 climatological analysis of atmospheric moisture transport during epes studies have shown that ivt is the most active component of the atmospheric water cycle and its changes may significantly impact epes ayantobo et al 2021 fig 4 shows the distributions of average daily ivts across different time slides over the tp between 1951 and 2015 the spatial distributions in fig 4 a e showed that the mean annual and seasonal ivt s decreased from south to north with values between 50 and 700 kg m s this high moisture transport intensity could be responsible for the frequent occurrence of epes in the southern region the multiyear ivts were observed to range from 250 to 500 kg m s and showed a decreasing trend fig 4f the distribution by months showed that the mean ivt increased from 200 kg m s in january to about 400 kg m s in july after which a decline was observed this showed that moisture transport occurred more over the tp during the summer months fig 4g previous studies have also demonstrated that the intensity of moisture transport was high during the summer months which could be responsible for the increased occurrences of summer precipitation events ayantobo et al 2021 generally moisture transport in the 1950 s and 60 s was higher and decreased slightly across recent decades fig 4h elevated ivt affects the magnitude frequency and severity of extreme weather phenomena tan et al 2019 ayantobo et al 2022 4 3 analysis of precipitation conversion efficiency during epes pwcr shows the rate at which pw is converted to precipitation hence pwcr was estimated during epes across different time slides over the tp from 1951 to 2015 fig 5 the mean annual and seasonal water vapor transformation varied between 5 and 165 with a higher rate in the northeastern southeastern and southwestern regions fig 5a e which could be related to the corresponding increase of epes in those regions the multiyear mean pwcr ranged between 15 and 42 and showed no clear trend fig 5f the distribution by months showed that mean pwcr decreased from 70 in january to about 20 in july and august after which it increased to about 54 in december showing that pwcr was higher during the winter months fig 4e g generally the interdecadal mean was around 35 fig 5h previous studies recorded maximum values ranging from 45 and 200 over some tp regions during winter gong et al 2017 ayantobo et al 2021 the pwcr around the tianshan mountain in summer ranged from 100 to 200 with a maximum of 355 while in winter the pwcr was much lower than in summer wu et al 2010 fan et al 2016 this probably could explain why this study s pwcr observed over the tp was so high during winter the high winter pwcr could be ascribed to sufficient summer water vapor which saturated the atmosphere 4 4 ranking epes occurrence over the tp next the daily epes are aggregated monthly over the tp and ranked to select the most extreme events and determine sources and pathways of moisture contributing to those events fig 6 shows the monthly time series of mean and maximum epes over the tp from 1951 to 2015 according to the figure the epes were ranked and the events whose maximum epes exceeded an arbitrary value of 200 mm month were selected and used as case studies to characterize the potential sources and transport pathways of intense moisture during epes over the tp accordingly 23 epes were selected based on the maximum precipitation values exceeding the threshold for that month for instance case study 1 recorded about 420 mm month of precipitation in july 1986 while case study 23 had an accumulation of about 200 mm month in february 1959 table s1 interestingly the examination of the spatial distributions of the 23 epes points revealed that all the events occurred within the southern tp region fig 7 the topographic map of china in fig 1 showed that the southern tp houses the great himalayan range which is an extensive 2 400 km arc shaped stretch of many lofty mountains that goes from east to west straddling china pakistan nepal india and bhutan kulkarni et al 2018 the himalayan range consists of many parallel mountains arranged from south to north of the tp with an average altitude of about 6 000 m and around 200 to 300 km wide according to the spatial distributions of the 23 epes locations in fig 7 we observed that cases 1 8 9 16 18 20 and 23 are located in the western himalayas which is about 550 km in length further cases 5 7 12 14 and 19 occurred within the central himalayas which is about 1200 km long while cases 2 3 4 6 10 11 13 15 17 21 and 22 events occurred within the eastern himalayas which is about 650 km in length previous studies have shown that climate varies significantly in these regions kulkarni et al 2018 4 5 back trajectory of moisture sources during epes previous studies have shown that moisture source and transport pathways can change rapidly during precipitation events li et al 2015 hence essential to determine moisture sources the back trajectories identify all parcels over an area of interest prior epes and follow these parcels backward in time to estimate their moisture origins fig 8 shows ten days back trajectories of airflow from each epes point we observed that moisture originating from the adjoining ocean and inland areas contributes to the epes where southerly and southeasterly winds generally dominate these trajectories air mass contributing moisture during cases 1 14 16 18 and 23 originated from the arabian sea these airflow trajectories are longer and cross through the indian landmass to the target region impacted by the ocean s warm and humid air mass besides the arabian sea cold air masses from the bob contributed to the moisture during events 2 3 4 6 7 17 21 and 22 where airflow trajectories travel northwards over the eastern ghats of india and bangladesh to the targets the airflow paths originating from the interior areas of eastern pakistan central and northeastern india nepal northern bangladesh and bhutan in the southern regions as well as local moisture across mount everest in the southeast northwestern tp and eastern china were identified as significant moisture sources during events 5 8 9 10 11 12 13 15 19 and 20 because the exact quantity of airflow trajectories from various directions cannot be determined we chose to classify the monthly back trajectories into clusters based on the consistency of the spatial distributions of different airflow trajectory types 4 6 clustering and relative moisture contributions during epes fig 9 shows the clustering and relative contribution rates of moisture sources over the tp in the western himalayas during july 1986 southwesterly cluster 1 12 cluster 2 20 cluster 3 22 and southeasterly cluster 4 30 cluster 5 16 paths originating from the arabian sea and northern india respectively contributed to the 420 mm of epes in july 1988 southwesterly clusters 1 2 and 4 southeasterly cluster 3 and northeasterly cluster 5 paths originating within the arabian sea the bob and northern china respectively combine to contribute 23 20 14 41 and 2 to the 215 mm of epes besides southwesterly clusters 1 and 4 southeasterly cluster 2 and 5 and northwesterly cluster 3 paths originating from the arabian sea northern india and pakistan respectively contributed 41 7 38 4 and 11 to the 206 mm of epes on september 2010 in the central himalayas during july 1955 air mass from southwesterly clusters 2 3 4 and 5 and southeasterly cluster 1 originating from the arabian sea and northern india contributed 20 45 24 7 and 3 to the 275 mm of epes similarly air mass from southwesterly clusters 3 4 and 5 and southeasterly cluster 1 and 2 starting in the bob vicinity traversing northwards through india and nepal jointly contributed 24 5 10 54 and 6 to the 227 56 mm of epes on october 1968 also westerly clusters 2 southwesterly cluster 4 southeasterly cluster 1 and 3 and easterly paths mainly originating from northern india bob and nepal added 31 14 23 13 and 19 to the 212 mm of epes on october 1973 in the eastern himalayas during july 1969 southerly moisture paths clusters 1 2 3 4 and 5 originating from the bob jointly contributed 45 16 15 19 and 4 to the 380 mm of epes in october 1979 northwesterly clusters 2 and 5 westerly cluster 4 and southerly clusters 1 and 3 paths originating from inland areas of pakistan within southern tp and bhutan and northeastern india contributed 6 7 15 29 and 42 to the 227 mm of epes the 203 mm of epes in may 1998 originated from northwesterly clusters 2 and 5 and southwesterly clusters 1 3 and 4 contributing 2 19 39 28 and 11 respectively suggesting that the inland areas of pakistan western tp northern india bob and northeastern india are essential moisture sources 4 7 statistics of moisture transport trajectories during epes this section analyzed moisture transport paths by combining back trajectories with ivt intensities the total and above average ivt are clustered and the statistics are presented in table 1 in the western himalayas all ivt trajectory clusters on july 1986 july 1988 and september 2010 in descending order are clusters 3 4 2 5 1 clusters 3 1 2 4 5 and clusters 1 2 3 4 5 with mean value of 243 244 and 161 kg m s respectively meanwhile the above average ivt trajectory clusters ranged from 305 to 345 kg m s 316 400 kg m s and 184 277 kg m s with mean values of 334 377 and 246 kg m s respectively in july 1986 cluster 2 had the highest above average ivt contribution of about 37 while in july 1988 and september 2010 clusters 3 and 2 accounted for about 51 and 49 respectively in the central himalayas all ivt trajectory clusters in july 1955 october 1968 and october 1973 in descending order are clusters 3 4 2 5 1 clusters 1 3 5 2 4 and clusters 2 1 5 4 3 with mean value of 362 163 and 206 kg m s respectively meanwhile the above average ivt trajectory clusters ranged from 440 to 571 kg m s 206 282 kg m s and 281 285 kg m s with mean values of 480 257 and 279 kg m s respectively in july 1955 cluster 3 had the highest above average ivt path of about 37 while in october 1968 and october 1973 clusters 1 and 2 accounted for 60 and 55 respectively in the eastern himalayas all ivt trajectory clusters in july 1969 october 1979 and may 1998 in descending order are clusters 1 4 2 3 5 clusters 3 1 4 5 2 and clusters 4 2 5 3 1 with mean value of 522 148 and 184 kg m s respectively conversely the above average ivt trajectory clusters ranged from 553 to 670 151 322 and 217 379 kg m s with mean values of 628 227 and 268 kg m s respectively in july 1969 cluster 1 had the highest above average ivt path of 60 while in october 1979 and may 1998 clusters 3 and 5 accounted for 42 and 36 respectively this showed that moisture sources and their transport intensity influenced the occurrence of epes from the targets 4 8 potential source contribution function pscf during epes we further employed the pscf to examine possible moisture transport pathways before epes occurrence various ivt intensities were first added to the back airflow paths and regions covering all airflow paths were divided uniformly into 0 5 0 5 grids then each grid s wpscf ivt value is calculated and the spatial distribution of potential sources is presented in fig 10 the colors show the contribution level of potential source areas where red and purple are associated with high and low ivt intensities respectively a relatively high pscf number represents a possible source region the higher the wpscf number the greater the moisture transport from the potential source to the targets provided that other variables remain stable according to fig 10 wpscf had distinct spatial variations with relatively high pscf values found along the trajectories starting from within the arabian sea and transiting through the westward ghats of india extending northwards towards the target southwestern ward i e 1 16 high values were also found along paths from the bob traveling through the eastern ghats of india and extending northwards to the targets i e 2 3 4 17 additionally inland areas of pakistan india nepal bangladesh and myanmar have vital influences on the moisture transport to the targets i e 12 15 19 moreover local ivt within tp also substantially affects some targets especially those from northern and northwestern china pscf values are often lower for some targets indicating that ivt from the surrounding locations less influences the targets however if the backtracking days increased a high pscf value could be observed at those targets overall the comparisons demonstrated that the patterns of high pscf in various eras coincide well with the significant trajectory clusters from previous sections implying that pscf s estimate was accurate and comparable 4 9 concentration weighted trajectory cwt during epes the weighted concentrations of airflow trajectories emanating from several probable sources were calculated using the cwt method by averaging ivt intensities with related trajectories that traverse the grid cell the cwt value symbolizes a weighted specific intensity value under the assumption that other parameters remain roughly constant a relatively high cwt number indicates a possible source area and the higher the cwt number the greater the grid cell s contribution to the ivt reaching the targets fig 11 depicts the cwt spatial distribution of moisture transport pathways estimated using back airflow trajectories and ivt intensities red and purple represent high and low ivt intensities respectively the colors symbolize the level of contributions of the likely source regions in line with the distinct spatial distributions of wpscf discussed in the previous section wcwt showed much better ivt pathways distributions this could be because the cwt approach considers all intensities whereas the pscf method only considers a selection of high intensities higher wcwt intensities were observed around the targets from the eastern southwestern and southeastern parts of the targets this was possible because southerly wind dominates the southern parts of the tp for instance fig 10 i e 2 3 4 7 14 17 22 showed very high ivt intensities observed around the targets with mean daily ivt intensities exceeding 500 kg m s furthermore relatively substantial ivt intensity contributions ranging from an average of 150 500 kg m s were also observed in localized areas farther from the targets which could get to the targets within days to a great extent the pscf and cwt techniques can adequately pinpoint the source paths and contributions of moisture to the targets during epes given that all other elements remain constant 4 9 1 occurrences of epes in the southern tp region the majority of the southern regions of the tp are vulnerable to epes with the highest concentrations occurring along the himalayan southern foothills and less in the north and west this finding was in line with prior research on precipitation distributions over the tp which found that epes are more common and vary significantly in the eastern and southeastern parts but not so much in the north and west maussion et al 2014 sun et al 2021 li et al 2021 ayantobo et al 2022 in general tp rainfall declines from the southeastern to northwestern region with mean annual rainfall ranging from 300 to 1000 mm year in the eastern and southeastern ranges ma et al 2018 fan et al 2016 which might be ten times less within the northern ranges li et al 2021 furthermore li et al 2021 found that the water vapor and rainfall declined sharply northwestwards with rainfall ranging between 100 and 300 mm year these results revealed that topography impacts precipitation distribution hinting that topography may contribute substantially to the spatial pattern of precipitation precipitation change in the southern tp is however more complicated chen et al 2019 found that significant differences exist in the sub seasonal moisture source evolution between the southeastern tp and the southwestern tp which suggests internal differences within the southern tp 4 9 2 distributions of moisture sources of extreme precipitation events moisture origin over the tp is not spatially homogeneous moisture for epes primarily originated from the arabian sea these trajectories cross the indian peninsula pass over the western ghats of india landmass extending northwards and then uplifting on the southern himalayas besides the arabian sea trajectories from the bob reach northwards into india s and bangladesh s the eastern ghats and moves along the brahmaputra valley to the southern and interior tp impacting precipitation patterns tian et al 2001 maussion et al 2014 airflow pathways from the tropical subtropical belt of the indian subcontinent towards the southern hemisphere also contributed moisture to the tp dong et al 2016 other trajectories originating from eastern pakistan nepal northern bangladesh and bhutan landmass were observed these remote moisture trajectories are driven by large scale atmospheric circulations which influence the variability of precipitation over the tp wang et al 2017 besides the remote sources local moisture inside the tp usually re enters the atmospheric water cycle and flows within it significantly boosting epes at the targets the local moisture recycling could provide higher atmospheric water vapor needed for the precipitation than outside of the tp wu et al 2010 curio et al 2015 consistent with our study tian et al 2001 demonstrated that the atmospheric moisture trajectories originated from the arabian sea to the indian continent then to the bob and finally arrived at the tp chen et al 2019 identified the northwestern part of the tp and the bob as moisture origin contributing to the tp the moisture from the bob played a significant role in the precipitation characteristics in southeastern tp at the same time the southwest was more influenced by the moisture from the northern indian subcontinent dong et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 analyzed moisture sources and revealed that the wetting trends over the central and western tp during 1979 2013 were attributable to increased moisture from the indian ocean and intensification of local moisture supply 5 summary and conclusions this study describes in detail the variations in probable sources of moisture and moisture transport pathways resulting in epes using different trajectory analysis methods from 1951 to 2015 over the tp region initially epes were extracted using the 99th percentile threshold after which moisture transport and precipitation conversion efficiency variabilities during epes were analyzed across different time slides finally potential sources and transport pathways of moisture during epes were performed by back trajectory analyses using hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory hysplit potential source contribution function pscf and concentration weighted trajectory cwt models the following are the main findings the southern foothill of the tp where the himalayan range is located is very critical to epes out of the 23 epes above the 200 mm month arbitrary threshold 5 events were found in the western himalayas 8 events were located in the central himalayas while 10 events were located in the eastern himalayas respectively the back trajectories calculated are clustered and the moisture sources for the epes show a similar pattern originating from the adjoining ocean and inland areas contributing to the moisture at the targets southerly and southeasterly winds generally dominate these trajectories the airflow paths from the arabian sea provided the majority of the moisture for precipitation these airflow trajectories are lengthier and went over the western ghats of india landmass continuing northwards towards the target southwestern ward impacted by warm and humid air mass from the sea the airflow pathways from the bob extend northwards over the eastern ghats of india and bangladesh and travels through the brahmaputra groove influencing precipitation characteristics in the south eastern tp the airflow trajectories originating from landmass areas of eastern pakistan central and northeastern india nepal northern bangladesh and bhutan have critical influences on the moisture transport to the targets some targets are also substantially affected by moisture transport within tp especially those from northern northwestern china and eastern china the findings show that the moisture transport source areas produced by pscf and cwt methods shared similar characteristics and patterns indicating the validity and correctness of the analysis of the result both approaches can efficiently reflect probable moisture source areas to the targets further we could not address the reliability and uncertainty inherent in the models used in this study which could be helpful in a more detailed analysis we aim to advance this study in the future by assessing the uncertainty and reliability of the emerging moisture tracking algorithms keune et al 2022 tuinenburg and staal 2020 and also determining the synergetic effects between sources and transport of moisture and various external forcing factors finally given the projected global warming atmospheric water vapor holding capacity is expected to increase with elevated temperature potentially causing changes in moisture sources pathways and precipitation patterns xu et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 therefore further investigation with more sampling sites is required to determine future sources and pathways of moisture and investigate the climatic conditions in moisture source regions that favor epes propagation bracken et al 2015 tan et al 2019 using the cmip6 datasets overall based on the epes and back trajectory analysis in this study we demonstrated unique moisture sources and dominant moisture pathways for each epes target this is of importance in modeling simulating and predicting extremes in space and time and consequently for resource management this may also aid in mitigating numerous natural disasters arising from epes credit authorship contribution statement olusola o ayantobo conceptualization

2733,understanding moisture sources and transport mechanisms during extreme precipitation events epes is imperative for sustainable development here potential moisture sources contributions and transport pathways were evaluated during epes over tibet plateau tp between 1951 and 2015 employing three back trajectory approaches including hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory hysplit potential source contribution function pscf and concentration weighted trajectory cwt results showed that all twenty three selected epes occurred within the tp s southern foothill back trajectories from the epes target are then clustered into five and analysis revealed that moisture sources and pathways showed a similar pattern generally moisture largely originates from three sources including airflow trajectories from the arabian sea bay of bengal and tropical subtropical area of the indian landmass besides local moisture transport within tp also has key influences for instance analysis from the first epes target showed southwesterly cluster 1 12 cluster 2 20 cluster 3 22 and southeasterly cluster 4 30 cluster 5 16 moisture paths originating from the arabian sea and northern india respectively moisture transport ivt path analysis for this target showed that all ivt clusters in descending order were 3 4 2 5 1 with a mean of 243 kg m s conversely above average ivt clusters ranged from 305 to 345 kg m s and had a mean of 334 kg m s while cluster 2 had the highest contribution of 37 moisture transport source regions obtained utilizing pscf and cwt methods naturally share comparable features proving the credibility and accuracy of the results based on the epes and back trajectory analysis in this study we demonstrated unique moisture sources and dominant moisture pathways for each epes target this is important in modeling simulating and predicting extremes in space and time and consequently for resource management this may also aid in mitigating numerous natural disasters arising from epes and provide significant scientific references for coordinated atmospheric research keywords extreme precipitation events moisture transport precipitation conversion rate back trajectory clustering potential source contribution concentration weighted trajectory tibetan plateau data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction extreme precipitation events epes have exhibited a highly increasing tendency in recent decades many studies have proven that these events result from excessive moisture in the atmospheric column and atmospheric moisture transport concerning different atmospheric systems and topographical characteristics ma et al 2018 chen et al 2019 feng et al 2020 moisture for precipitation across a specific region comes from three significant origins local evaporation accounts for only a small portion while moisture already present in the atmosphere and those transported into the area by atmospheric advection are dominant long term contributors brubaker et al 2001 trenberth et al 2003 zhang et al 2017 xu et al 2020 during epes associated weather systems can collect moisture from around 3 5 times the entire radius of the rainy region trenberth et al 2003 zhang et al 2019a feng et al 2020 even though questions of moisture sources at a location are especially intriguing moisture advection and the resulting rainfall are complicated phenomena there are varieties of moisture tracking models aimed at determining the source regions of precipitation i e the land or ocean area from which moisture available for rainfall originally evaporates bracken et al 2015 tuinenburg and staal 2020 keune et al 2022 the lagrangian models have recently gained popularity as a tool for examining global and regional moisture transportation and recycling due to their ability to define atmospheric trajectories in space and time the models could calculate backward and forward trajectories over a given area detect moisture sources trace moisture transportation patterns and variations in physical variables along those paths stohl and james 2004 2005 dirmeyer et al 2009 bracken et al 2015 tuinenburg and staal 2020 keune et al 2022 for areas with relatively complex terrain three dimensional lagrangian models are most suitable because they describe atmospheric moisture transport better under substantial vertical variability in horizontal moisture transport tuinenburg and staal 2020 recently brubaker et al 2001 and diem and brown 2006 investigated moisture origins of rainfall in the mississippi river basin and the southwest u s while gimeno et al 2010 revealed the contributions of moisture from the global ocean for each continent in various seasons studies have also shown that the mediterranean sea provides significant moisture for precipitation in southern europe botty√°n et al 2014 others studies include those over europe gustafsson et al 2010 izquierdo et al 2013 the americas brimelow and reuter 2005 drumond et al 2008 africa salih et al 2015 and the mediterranean drumond et al 2011a g√≥mez hern√°ndez et al 2013 in china sun and wang 2014 2015 and sun et al 2016 discovered moisture sources in east china and semiarid grassland revealing that moisture for rainfall over northern china and in the yangtze huaihe river basin comes predominantly from the west pacific ocean and local evaporation further chen et al 2019 discovered that moisture comes primarily from the south china sea and the bay of bengal bob throughout the summer drumond et al 2011b found that eastern china gets its moisture primarily from the eastern china sea while southern parts of china get it from the bob and the arabian sea according to li et al 2016 southwesterly moisture vapour transportation delivers moisture from the western pacific the bob and the tibetan plateau tp to south china during rainy seasons in the yangtze river basin moisture comes mainly from the east african coast the southern indian ocean and the arabian sea during the mei yu season mys jiang et al 2017 northern china s rainfall is primarily influenced by moisture from the bob middle latitude westerlies and the southern china sea western pacific ocean jiang et al 2017 it s critical to identify moisture sources across large regions like the tp which has varied rain frequency and intensity in a companion study ayantobo et al 2022 studied rain categorization and the contribution of rainfall intensities to overall rainfall variation over the tp after categorization into different intensities and frequencies from light to extreme precipitation a non parametric statistical approach was used to find trends li et al 2011 ayantobo et al 2022 finally the relative contributions of rainfall at varying intensities to overall rainfall change were investigated utilizing a multiple linear regression model and relative weights although the study showed precise information about categorized precipitation distributions it only focused on spatiotemporal change patterns with little knowledge of probable moisture origin and transport pathways hence given the importance and complexity of atmospheric water vapor transport over the tp we plan to investigate the mechanisms that underpin the epes category by studying four questions 1 what is the efficiency of precipitation conversion during epes 2 how does integrated moisture transport ivt vary and what does above average ivt mean for the epes targets 3 what are the primary moisture sources and transport pathways during epes 4 what are the contributions from the identified moisture sources during epes several trajectory analysis methodologies have been employed to evaluate the analysis via mutual verification to authenticate the reliability of the results approaches like the back trajectory model clustering analysis potential source contribution function pscf and contribution weighted trajectory cwt have become widely used methods because they provide continuous temporal simulation results that are relatively accurate hao et al 2019 following a detailed introduction the study region and datasets are described in section 2 the hysplit model and trajectory analysis methodology are explained in section 3 results of the airflow trajectory and potential moisture source contributions are presented in section 4 and a concluding remark in section 5 this study is of importance in modeling simulating and predicting extremes in space and time and consequently for resource management 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area the tp region is located in southwest china with coordinates spanning from 26 00 n to 39 46 n and 73 18 e to 104 46 e fig 1 it covers 2 5 million square kilometers of land and has a mean height of over 4 000 m making it the roof of the world qiu 2008 chen et al 2015 the region is known as the asian water tower because of the numerous rivers that originate from the southeastern side of the tp such as the yellow yangtze and lancang rivers the climate in tp is typical of the alpine region the southeast is relatively warm and humid while the northwestern areas are chilly and dry ding et al 2018 precipitation distribution is erratic most of the time for instance the annual precipitation in the southeastern motuo and northwestern lenghu zones could probably be 4000 mm and 17 6 mm respectively due to the influence of the westerlies and especially the tp landscape the mean annual temperature is around 3 1 to 4 4 c the wind speed being 3 0 m s 1 and gale weather has a wind speed of 17 m s occurring on 50 days year li et al 2016 the tp significantly impacts regional and global climates because of its unique large scale terrain and geographical location feng et al 2020 2 2 datasets processing to estimate epes over the tp region between 1950 and 2015 this study uses the daily grid precipitation data acquired from the asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration towards evaluation of water resources https www aphrodite st hirosaki u ac jp popularly known as aphrodite tan et al 2020 suggested using the aphrodite dataset because of its excellent precision and extensive representation of precipitation patterns the national centre for environmental prediction ncep in conjunction with the national centre for atmospheric research ncar released the ncep ncr reanalysis 1 https rda ucar edu which combined the climate data simulator cds with a frozen analysis forecast models these data are open source and can be accessed from 1948 to the present having a spatial resolution of 2 5 by 2 5 and 28 levels at 6 hr intervals we obtained the data from the earth system research laboratory esrl of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa https www esrl noaa gov psd data gridded data ncep reanalysis html in calculating precipitable water pw and ivt zonal winds meridional winds and specific humidity are extracted from 8 isobaric surfaces from 1000 300 hpa and later superposed reanalysis datasets give variable estimation four times a day 0000 0600 1200 and 1800 utc hence the variables are computed by averaging the sub daily values for back trajectory analysis of air mass meteorological datasets from the global data assimilation system gdas from ncep are employed the data includes observations of various atmospheric variables from meteorological stations satellites weather radars balloons and reports from aircraft incorporated into a three dimensional grid point this current investigation utilizes datasets in a 1 by 1 horizontal resolution and is generally obtainable in binary form and used as input data for the hysplit model 3 methods 3 1 categorization of extreme precipitation events in epes determination previous studies have generally utilized percentile based thresholds for instance by following ayantobo et al 2022 rainfall intensity r e below 0 1 mm day is excluded to derive wet rain intensity wri r e 0 1 mm day knowing that drizzle can typically contribute a small amount to rainfall observations later the 99th percentile of the entire rainfall record from 1950 to 2015 is first calculated and depicted as the threshold value for epes li et al 2011 ayantobo et al 2022 sun et al 2021 then epes are obtained when wri exceeds the 99th percentile value at each grid point 3 2 estimation of precipitation conversion efficiency the pw is defined as the overall atmospheric water vapour in a specified air column or depth of the quantity of water that could be received if all of the water vapour within the air column condenses pw is an essential metric for determining atmospheric water supplies and the degree of climate wetness and dryness only a portion of the pw in a local air column can often be converted into actual p which varies widely the precipitable water conversion rate pwcr which is the ratio of p to pw can be used to measure the efficiency of transformation over time zhou et al 2016 ayantobo et al 2021 1 pwcr p pw 100 where pwcr shows the precipitation conversion efficiency while p is overall precipitation mm day over time within an area the pw can be estimated as zhai and eskridge 1997 2 pw 1 g p t p s q d p where pt is 300 hpa ps is 1000 hpa q is specific humidity kg kg and g is an acceleration of gravity m s2 the higher the pwcr the more significant the prospect of atmospheric water resources is especially if the air water vapour content is invariant fan et al 2016 ayantobo et al 2021 3 3 quantification of integrated moisture transport at eight isobaric surfaces the distribution and movement of atmospheric water vapour are quantified using ivt kg m s which is derived from water vapor mixing ratios such as zonal winds u m s meridional winds v m s and specific humidity q kg kg ma et al 2018 individual grid components are then summed vertically from the surface to roughly 300 hpa and then consolidated into a horizontal moisture transport vector with kg m s units zhu and newell 1998 ma et al 2018 3 ivt 1 g 1000 300 q u d p 2 1 g 1000 300 q v d p 2 a thorough review and analysis of this methodology could be found in zhu and newell 1998 3 4 hysplit model the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s noaa air resources laboratory arl https www ready noaa gov hysplit php hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory hysplit model is used to determine moisture sources of epes across the tp region draxler and hess 1998 sahu et al 2019 noaa arl 2011 tuinenburg and staal 2020 keune et al 2022 the hysplit model has various modes of estimating trajectories which include normal trajectory trajectory matrix trajectory ensemble and trajectory frequency air parcels are tracked backward from an observed epes target for a set time in the analysis to discover and understand probable sources of moisture that provided intense moisture during epes over the tp jiang et al 2017 for trajectories computed from wind fields 20 of the distance traveled errors are expected bracken et al 2015 given this uncertainty and the limit on moisture retention the backward trajectory of airflow is simulated hourly for 10 days i e globally averaged maximum lifetime of atmospheric moisture trenberth et al 2011 preceding the extreme event 240 h trajectories were initialized for each event every 6 h during the event period and at 500 m vertical intervals from 0 m to 5000 m above ground level 3 5 back trajectory clustering analysis the trajectory data is separated into several clusters using trajectory clustering estimation a multi variate statistical estimation approach trajstat a meteoinfo plugin that can view query and cluster airflow paths using two different cluster algorithms including the angle and euclidean distances has been frequently used in this study the angle distance clustering approach is used to group airflow paths to determine where the air masses are coming from the angle distance which spans from 0 to œÄ is commonly employed to specify the average angle between the two airflow paths wang et al 2009 study have more information on the angle distance technique data from the same cluster are comparable whereas data from other clusters differ more significantly yang et al 2019 3 6 potential source contribution function the potential source contribution function pscf model uses a conditional probability field to link higher concentrations or intensities with the residence time in the upwind regions yang et al 2019 this model can identify moisture sources by analyzing airflow trajectories at different thresholds wang et al 2009 it can be calculated as follows 4 pscf ij n ij n ij where n ij is the total amount of endpoints of airflow paths within the grid ij th and n ij is the total amount of airflow paths in the same grid for which ivt intensity exceeds a particular threshold wang et al 2009 here the average ivt intensity at each target was chosen as a threshold and the paths were estimated every hour when n ij is extremely small studies have shown that the analyzed result is uncertain when the total amount of endpoints within a specific grid cell is fewer than three times the mean amount of endpoints for every grid cell an arbitrary weight function w ij is used to eliminate this uncertainty as follows zhang et al 2019b 5 w pscf ij w ij pscf ij 6 w ij 1 00 n ij 80 0 70 20 n ij 80 0 42 10 n ij 20 0 05 0 n ij 10 3 7 concentration weighted trajectory the weighted concentrations of trajectories are computed first and afterward weighted concentrations of all grid cells are obtained using the concentration weighted trajectory cwt method the cwt technique s calculation formula is as follows zhang et al 2019b 7 cwt ij k 1 n c k œÑ ijk k 1 n œÑ ijk where cwt ij is the grid ij s weighted average concentration n is the amount of airflow trajectory where a pathway is denoted by k ck is the ivt pathway k when it crosses the ij grid cell which is estimated with the hysplit model and œÑ ijk is the length of time that trajectory k remains in grid ij stohl 1996 further the weighted coefficient wij is estimated to reduce the inherent uncertainties as follows 8 w cwt ij w ij cwt ij the distinction between cwt and pscf is that the pscf evaluates potential moisture sources using a concentration threshold if sample intensities are slightly or substantially greater than the criterion they may have the same pscf value hence it may be unable to distinguish between moderate and robust moisture origins the pscf constraint can be solved in the cwt approach by assigning a weighted intensity by averaging the sample intensities with related airflow pathways that traverse each grid cell 4 results and discussion 4 1 qualitative analysis of epes intensity and frequency many previous studies have analyzed rain intensity and frequency categorization because they are significant for rainfall variation research ding et al 2018 ayantobo et al 2022 fig 2 shows the distributions of mean daily epes across different time slides over the tp between 1951 and 2015 the spatial distribution in fig 2 a e showed that the mean annual and seasonal values varied from 3 4 to 62 6 mm day with the southern regions having the greatest intensity generally epes occurred more in the south and eastern regions than in the northwestern tp the multiyear epes ranged between 13 mm day 1953 and 18 mm day 2007 and showed a slightly decreasing trend a sharp decrease in 1953 was also observed in 2012 when 13 5 mm day was observed fig 2f the mean values reported in march and april were around 18 5 mm day and 17 5 mm day respectively which were much higher than in other months of the year fig 2g the 1970 s had the highest mean of about 16 mm day while generally the inter decadal values had averages of approximately 15 mm day and showed a slight decreasing trend fig 2h this graph showed not just precipitation occurrences in each decade but also represented the impacts of the combined and competing contributions of the westerlies and the monsoons consistent with previous studies ma et al 2018 fig 3 shows the historical frequency days distributions of daily epes across different time slides over the tp between 1951 and 2015 the annual spatial distribution showed that the frequency ranged from 24 to 175 days with the highest over the southeastern tp fig 3a the seasonal pattern in fig 3 b e showed that summer had the highest frequency and it ranged from 10 to 34 days fig 3c the multiyear epes frequency ranged from 70 days 1993 to 120 days 2009 and showed a slight decreasing trend fig 3f summer precipitation accounts for over 70 percent of yearly rainfall in the central region from the arabian sea to the northeastern part of the tp and also the majority of the southeastern tp according to previous research ma et al 2018 4 2 climatological analysis of atmospheric moisture transport during epes studies have shown that ivt is the most active component of the atmospheric water cycle and its changes may significantly impact epes ayantobo et al 2021 fig 4 shows the distributions of average daily ivts across different time slides over the tp between 1951 and 2015 the spatial distributions in fig 4 a e showed that the mean annual and seasonal ivt s decreased from south to north with values between 50 and 700 kg m s this high moisture transport intensity could be responsible for the frequent occurrence of epes in the southern region the multiyear ivts were observed to range from 250 to 500 kg m s and showed a decreasing trend fig 4f the distribution by months showed that the mean ivt increased from 200 kg m s in january to about 400 kg m s in july after which a decline was observed this showed that moisture transport occurred more over the tp during the summer months fig 4g previous studies have also demonstrated that the intensity of moisture transport was high during the summer months which could be responsible for the increased occurrences of summer precipitation events ayantobo et al 2021 generally moisture transport in the 1950 s and 60 s was higher and decreased slightly across recent decades fig 4h elevated ivt affects the magnitude frequency and severity of extreme weather phenomena tan et al 2019 ayantobo et al 2022 4 3 analysis of precipitation conversion efficiency during epes pwcr shows the rate at which pw is converted to precipitation hence pwcr was estimated during epes across different time slides over the tp from 1951 to 2015 fig 5 the mean annual and seasonal water vapor transformation varied between 5 and 165 with a higher rate in the northeastern southeastern and southwestern regions fig 5a e which could be related to the corresponding increase of epes in those regions the multiyear mean pwcr ranged between 15 and 42 and showed no clear trend fig 5f the distribution by months showed that mean pwcr decreased from 70 in january to about 20 in july and august after which it increased to about 54 in december showing that pwcr was higher during the winter months fig 4e g generally the interdecadal mean was around 35 fig 5h previous studies recorded maximum values ranging from 45 and 200 over some tp regions during winter gong et al 2017 ayantobo et al 2021 the pwcr around the tianshan mountain in summer ranged from 100 to 200 with a maximum of 355 while in winter the pwcr was much lower than in summer wu et al 2010 fan et al 2016 this probably could explain why this study s pwcr observed over the tp was so high during winter the high winter pwcr could be ascribed to sufficient summer water vapor which saturated the atmosphere 4 4 ranking epes occurrence over the tp next the daily epes are aggregated monthly over the tp and ranked to select the most extreme events and determine sources and pathways of moisture contributing to those events fig 6 shows the monthly time series of mean and maximum epes over the tp from 1951 to 2015 according to the figure the epes were ranked and the events whose maximum epes exceeded an arbitrary value of 200 mm month were selected and used as case studies to characterize the potential sources and transport pathways of intense moisture during epes over the tp accordingly 23 epes were selected based on the maximum precipitation values exceeding the threshold for that month for instance case study 1 recorded about 420 mm month of precipitation in july 1986 while case study 23 had an accumulation of about 200 mm month in february 1959 table s1 interestingly the examination of the spatial distributions of the 23 epes points revealed that all the events occurred within the southern tp region fig 7 the topographic map of china in fig 1 showed that the southern tp houses the great himalayan range which is an extensive 2 400 km arc shaped stretch of many lofty mountains that goes from east to west straddling china pakistan nepal india and bhutan kulkarni et al 2018 the himalayan range consists of many parallel mountains arranged from south to north of the tp with an average altitude of about 6 000 m and around 200 to 300 km wide according to the spatial distributions of the 23 epes locations in fig 7 we observed that cases 1 8 9 16 18 20 and 23 are located in the western himalayas which is about 550 km in length further cases 5 7 12 14 and 19 occurred within the central himalayas which is about 1200 km long while cases 2 3 4 6 10 11 13 15 17 21 and 22 events occurred within the eastern himalayas which is about 650 km in length previous studies have shown that climate varies significantly in these regions kulkarni et al 2018 4 5 back trajectory of moisture sources during epes previous studies have shown that moisture source and transport pathways can change rapidly during precipitation events li et al 2015 hence essential to determine moisture sources the back trajectories identify all parcels over an area of interest prior epes and follow these parcels backward in time to estimate their moisture origins fig 8 shows ten days back trajectories of airflow from each epes point we observed that moisture originating from the adjoining ocean and inland areas contributes to the epes where southerly and southeasterly winds generally dominate these trajectories air mass contributing moisture during cases 1 14 16 18 and 23 originated from the arabian sea these airflow trajectories are longer and cross through the indian landmass to the target region impacted by the ocean s warm and humid air mass besides the arabian sea cold air masses from the bob contributed to the moisture during events 2 3 4 6 7 17 21 and 22 where airflow trajectories travel northwards over the eastern ghats of india and bangladesh to the targets the airflow paths originating from the interior areas of eastern pakistan central and northeastern india nepal northern bangladesh and bhutan in the southern regions as well as local moisture across mount everest in the southeast northwestern tp and eastern china were identified as significant moisture sources during events 5 8 9 10 11 12 13 15 19 and 20 because the exact quantity of airflow trajectories from various directions cannot be determined we chose to classify the monthly back trajectories into clusters based on the consistency of the spatial distributions of different airflow trajectory types 4 6 clustering and relative moisture contributions during epes fig 9 shows the clustering and relative contribution rates of moisture sources over the tp in the western himalayas during july 1986 southwesterly cluster 1 12 cluster 2 20 cluster 3 22 and southeasterly cluster 4 30 cluster 5 16 paths originating from the arabian sea and northern india respectively contributed to the 420 mm of epes in july 1988 southwesterly clusters 1 2 and 4 southeasterly cluster 3 and northeasterly cluster 5 paths originating within the arabian sea the bob and northern china respectively combine to contribute 23 20 14 41 and 2 to the 215 mm of epes besides southwesterly clusters 1 and 4 southeasterly cluster 2 and 5 and northwesterly cluster 3 paths originating from the arabian sea northern india and pakistan respectively contributed 41 7 38 4 and 11 to the 206 mm of epes on september 2010 in the central himalayas during july 1955 air mass from southwesterly clusters 2 3 4 and 5 and southeasterly cluster 1 originating from the arabian sea and northern india contributed 20 45 24 7 and 3 to the 275 mm of epes similarly air mass from southwesterly clusters 3 4 and 5 and southeasterly cluster 1 and 2 starting in the bob vicinity traversing northwards through india and nepal jointly contributed 24 5 10 54 and 6 to the 227 56 mm of epes on october 1968 also westerly clusters 2 southwesterly cluster 4 southeasterly cluster 1 and 3 and easterly paths mainly originating from northern india bob and nepal added 31 14 23 13 and 19 to the 212 mm of epes on october 1973 in the eastern himalayas during july 1969 southerly moisture paths clusters 1 2 3 4 and 5 originating from the bob jointly contributed 45 16 15 19 and 4 to the 380 mm of epes in october 1979 northwesterly clusters 2 and 5 westerly cluster 4 and southerly clusters 1 and 3 paths originating from inland areas of pakistan within southern tp and bhutan and northeastern india contributed 6 7 15 29 and 42 to the 227 mm of epes the 203 mm of epes in may 1998 originated from northwesterly clusters 2 and 5 and southwesterly clusters 1 3 and 4 contributing 2 19 39 28 and 11 respectively suggesting that the inland areas of pakistan western tp northern india bob and northeastern india are essential moisture sources 4 7 statistics of moisture transport trajectories during epes this section analyzed moisture transport paths by combining back trajectories with ivt intensities the total and above average ivt are clustered and the statistics are presented in table 1 in the western himalayas all ivt trajectory clusters on july 1986 july 1988 and september 2010 in descending order are clusters 3 4 2 5 1 clusters 3 1 2 4 5 and clusters 1 2 3 4 5 with mean value of 243 244 and 161 kg m s respectively meanwhile the above average ivt trajectory clusters ranged from 305 to 345 kg m s 316 400 kg m s and 184 277 kg m s with mean values of 334 377 and 246 kg m s respectively in july 1986 cluster 2 had the highest above average ivt contribution of about 37 while in july 1988 and september 2010 clusters 3 and 2 accounted for about 51 and 49 respectively in the central himalayas all ivt trajectory clusters in july 1955 october 1968 and october 1973 in descending order are clusters 3 4 2 5 1 clusters 1 3 5 2 4 and clusters 2 1 5 4 3 with mean value of 362 163 and 206 kg m s respectively meanwhile the above average ivt trajectory clusters ranged from 440 to 571 kg m s 206 282 kg m s and 281 285 kg m s with mean values of 480 257 and 279 kg m s respectively in july 1955 cluster 3 had the highest above average ivt path of about 37 while in october 1968 and october 1973 clusters 1 and 2 accounted for 60 and 55 respectively in the eastern himalayas all ivt trajectory clusters in july 1969 october 1979 and may 1998 in descending order are clusters 1 4 2 3 5 clusters 3 1 4 5 2 and clusters 4 2 5 3 1 with mean value of 522 148 and 184 kg m s respectively conversely the above average ivt trajectory clusters ranged from 553 to 670 151 322 and 217 379 kg m s with mean values of 628 227 and 268 kg m s respectively in july 1969 cluster 1 had the highest above average ivt path of 60 while in october 1979 and may 1998 clusters 3 and 5 accounted for 42 and 36 respectively this showed that moisture sources and their transport intensity influenced the occurrence of epes from the targets 4 8 potential source contribution function pscf during epes we further employed the pscf to examine possible moisture transport pathways before epes occurrence various ivt intensities were first added to the back airflow paths and regions covering all airflow paths were divided uniformly into 0 5 0 5 grids then each grid s wpscf ivt value is calculated and the spatial distribution of potential sources is presented in fig 10 the colors show the contribution level of potential source areas where red and purple are associated with high and low ivt intensities respectively a relatively high pscf number represents a possible source region the higher the wpscf number the greater the moisture transport from the potential source to the targets provided that other variables remain stable according to fig 10 wpscf had distinct spatial variations with relatively high pscf values found along the trajectories starting from within the arabian sea and transiting through the westward ghats of india extending northwards towards the target southwestern ward i e 1 16 high values were also found along paths from the bob traveling through the eastern ghats of india and extending northwards to the targets i e 2 3 4 17 additionally inland areas of pakistan india nepal bangladesh and myanmar have vital influences on the moisture transport to the targets i e 12 15 19 moreover local ivt within tp also substantially affects some targets especially those from northern and northwestern china pscf values are often lower for some targets indicating that ivt from the surrounding locations less influences the targets however if the backtracking days increased a high pscf value could be observed at those targets overall the comparisons demonstrated that the patterns of high pscf in various eras coincide well with the significant trajectory clusters from previous sections implying that pscf s estimate was accurate and comparable 4 9 concentration weighted trajectory cwt during epes the weighted concentrations of airflow trajectories emanating from several probable sources were calculated using the cwt method by averaging ivt intensities with related trajectories that traverse the grid cell the cwt value symbolizes a weighted specific intensity value under the assumption that other parameters remain roughly constant a relatively high cwt number indicates a possible source area and the higher the cwt number the greater the grid cell s contribution to the ivt reaching the targets fig 11 depicts the cwt spatial distribution of moisture transport pathways estimated using back airflow trajectories and ivt intensities red and purple represent high and low ivt intensities respectively the colors symbolize the level of contributions of the likely source regions in line with the distinct spatial distributions of wpscf discussed in the previous section wcwt showed much better ivt pathways distributions this could be because the cwt approach considers all intensities whereas the pscf method only considers a selection of high intensities higher wcwt intensities were observed around the targets from the eastern southwestern and southeastern parts of the targets this was possible because southerly wind dominates the southern parts of the tp for instance fig 10 i e 2 3 4 7 14 17 22 showed very high ivt intensities observed around the targets with mean daily ivt intensities exceeding 500 kg m s furthermore relatively substantial ivt intensity contributions ranging from an average of 150 500 kg m s were also observed in localized areas farther from the targets which could get to the targets within days to a great extent the pscf and cwt techniques can adequately pinpoint the source paths and contributions of moisture to the targets during epes given that all other elements remain constant 4 9 1 occurrences of epes in the southern tp region the majority of the southern regions of the tp are vulnerable to epes with the highest concentrations occurring along the himalayan southern foothills and less in the north and west this finding was in line with prior research on precipitation distributions over the tp which found that epes are more common and vary significantly in the eastern and southeastern parts but not so much in the north and west maussion et al 2014 sun et al 2021 li et al 2021 ayantobo et al 2022 in general tp rainfall declines from the southeastern to northwestern region with mean annual rainfall ranging from 300 to 1000 mm year in the eastern and southeastern ranges ma et al 2018 fan et al 2016 which might be ten times less within the northern ranges li et al 2021 furthermore li et al 2021 found that the water vapor and rainfall declined sharply northwestwards with rainfall ranging between 100 and 300 mm year these results revealed that topography impacts precipitation distribution hinting that topography may contribute substantially to the spatial pattern of precipitation precipitation change in the southern tp is however more complicated chen et al 2019 found that significant differences exist in the sub seasonal moisture source evolution between the southeastern tp and the southwestern tp which suggests internal differences within the southern tp 4 9 2 distributions of moisture sources of extreme precipitation events moisture origin over the tp is not spatially homogeneous moisture for epes primarily originated from the arabian sea these trajectories cross the indian peninsula pass over the western ghats of india landmass extending northwards and then uplifting on the southern himalayas besides the arabian sea trajectories from the bob reach northwards into india s and bangladesh s the eastern ghats and moves along the brahmaputra valley to the southern and interior tp impacting precipitation patterns tian et al 2001 maussion et al 2014 airflow pathways from the tropical subtropical belt of the indian subcontinent towards the southern hemisphere also contributed moisture to the tp dong et al 2016 other trajectories originating from eastern pakistan nepal northern bangladesh and bhutan landmass were observed these remote moisture trajectories are driven by large scale atmospheric circulations which influence the variability of precipitation over the tp wang et al 2017 besides the remote sources local moisture inside the tp usually re enters the atmospheric water cycle and flows within it significantly boosting epes at the targets the local moisture recycling could provide higher atmospheric water vapor needed for the precipitation than outside of the tp wu et al 2010 curio et al 2015 consistent with our study tian et al 2001 demonstrated that the atmospheric moisture trajectories originated from the arabian sea to the indian continent then to the bob and finally arrived at the tp chen et al 2019 identified the northwestern part of the tp and the bob as moisture origin contributing to the tp the moisture from the bob played a significant role in the precipitation characteristics in southeastern tp at the same time the southwest was more influenced by the moisture from the northern indian subcontinent dong et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 analyzed moisture sources and revealed that the wetting trends over the central and western tp during 1979 2013 were attributable to increased moisture from the indian ocean and intensification of local moisture supply 5 summary and conclusions this study describes in detail the variations in probable sources of moisture and moisture transport pathways resulting in epes using different trajectory analysis methods from 1951 to 2015 over the tp region initially epes were extracted using the 99th percentile threshold after which moisture transport and precipitation conversion efficiency variabilities during epes were analyzed across different time slides finally potential sources and transport pathways of moisture during epes were performed by back trajectory analyses using hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory hysplit potential source contribution function pscf and concentration weighted trajectory cwt models the following are the main findings the southern foothill of the tp where the himalayan range is located is very critical to epes out of the 23 epes above the 200 mm month arbitrary threshold 5 events were found in the western himalayas 8 events were located in the central himalayas while 10 events were located in the eastern himalayas respectively the back trajectories calculated are clustered and the moisture sources for the epes show a similar pattern originating from the adjoining ocean and inland areas contributing to the moisture at the targets southerly and southeasterly winds generally dominate these trajectories the airflow paths from the arabian sea provided the majority of the moisture for precipitation these airflow trajectories are lengthier and went over the western ghats of india landmass continuing northwards towards the target southwestern ward impacted by warm and humid air mass from the sea the airflow pathways from the bob extend northwards over the eastern ghats of india and bangladesh and travels through the brahmaputra groove influencing precipitation characteristics in the south eastern tp the airflow trajectories originating from landmass areas of eastern pakistan central and northeastern india nepal northern bangladesh and bhutan have critical influences on the moisture transport to the targets some targets are also substantially affected by moisture transport within tp especially those from northern northwestern china and eastern china the findings show that the moisture transport source areas produced by pscf and cwt methods shared similar characteristics and patterns indicating the validity and correctness of the analysis of the result both approaches can efficiently reflect probable moisture source areas to the targets further we could not address the reliability and uncertainty inherent in the models used in this study which could be helpful in a more detailed analysis we aim to advance this study in the future by assessing the uncertainty and reliability of the emerging moisture tracking algorithms keune et al 2022 tuinenburg and staal 2020 and also determining the synergetic effects between sources and transport of moisture and various external forcing factors finally given the projected global warming atmospheric water vapor holding capacity is expected to increase with elevated temperature potentially causing changes in moisture sources pathways and precipitation patterns xu et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 therefore further investigation with more sampling sites is required to determine future sources and pathways of moisture and investigate the climatic conditions in moisture source regions that favor epes propagation bracken et al 2015 tan et al 2019 using the cmip6 datasets overall based on the epes and back trajectory analysis in this study we demonstrated unique moisture sources and dominant moisture pathways for each epes target this is of importance in modeling simulating and predicting extremes in space and time and consequently for resource management this may also aid in mitigating numerous natural disasters arising from epes credit authorship contribution statement olusola o ayantobo conceptualization

2734,groundwater is the main source of drinking and irrigation on earth because of its large quantity and worldly distribution albeit unequally however it is presently being threatened by over consumption and contamination groundwater vulnerability gv is to assess the aquifer sustainability under a contaminant load for an area which plays a significant part in sustainable groundwater management in practice in the last several decades the studies of gv have increased exponentially over the entire globe and there is currently no statistical review in gv by using bibliometric analysis with the increasing publications in this review a global bibliometric analysis was conducted to analyze and visualize the current status and determine future challenges of gv research by considering a total of 949 articles based on web of science core collection database nine different aspects including trend related disciplines journals author productivity countries or regions institutions citations keywords and practical implementation were visualized and analyzed by citespace 5 8 r3 microsoft s excel and tableau by in depth analysis this review clearly showed the major contribution members and the evolutionary process of gv as well as identified four research frontiers model development modification and optimization climate change impacts human activity impacts and sustainable groundwater management and four future challenges unequal research development insufficient cooperation response to climate change and human activities and sdgs in groundwater management finally the corresponding suggestions for overcoming the challenges were proposed to achieve sustainable groundwater management keywords groundwater vulnerability bibliometric analysis sustainable development goals sustainable groundwater management insights and challenges data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater is the main source of drinking and irrigation on earth because of its large quantity and worldly distribution albeit unequally mosavi et al 2020 gleeson et al 2015 khosravi et al 2018 according to unesco 2022 groundwater accounts for nearly 99 of the earth s available liquid freshwater and contributes one quarter of all water consumption for human activities this important resource enables support many aspects of economic social and environmental development all over the world such as healthy living industrial development agricultural irrigation maintenance of ecosystem and sustainable development aslam et al 2018 omotola et al 2020 however groundwater quantity and quality are presently being threatened by over consumption and pollution barzegar et al 2021 singha et al 2019 because of rapid urbanization wakode et al 2018 unequal distributions collins and bolin 2007 extensive abstraction chang et al 2017 wastewater disposal awawdeh et al 2015 mismanagement busico et al 2021 human activities jia et al 2019a and climate changes mendieta mendoza et al 2021 given that on the one hand groundwater resources are final receivers of pollutants in the process of water cycle and on the other hand they are very difficult to restore after being polluted the issue of groundwater quality deterioration may lead to significant and possibly irreversible impacts on human health and ecological services agossou and yang 2021 siarkos et al 2021 shrestha et al 2017 li et al 2021 additionally groundwater pollution significantly reduces the amount of groundwater exploitable resources thus leading to severe water scarcity siarkos et al 2021 abunada et al 2021 therefore there is an urgent need to effectively decrease groundwater threats by means of groundwater pollution elimination groundwater resilience improvement and sustainable groundwater management at a global scale taghavi et al 2022 the terminology of groundwater vulnerability gv was first coined in the late 1960s margat 1968 and further gained development in the field of hydrogeology during the 1980s haertle 1983 however the definition of gv is still expressed in different ways and there is no universally accepted definition although the research of gv has been in development for over half a century taghavi et al 2022 armengol et al 2014 despite the differences some key words are frequently mentioned in the various definitions including susceptibility contamination pollution anthropogenic activity groundwater quality and aquifer system machiwal et al 2018 today a consensus is that gv is used to assess the aquifer sustainability under a contaminant load for an area which measures the capacity of resisting pollutants into groundwater system by natural site characteristics foster et al 2013 thapa et al 2018 busico et al 2017 the types of gv can be distinguished into intrinsic vulnerability and specific vulnerability ayed et al 2017 nrc 1993 qiu et al 2021 stigter et al 2006 hu et al 2018 intrinsic vulnerability refers to the vulnerability by consideration of physical characteristics of the aquifer such as geology hydrology and hydrogeology in response to the pollutants without involving the specific pollutants vrba and zaporozec 1994 specific vulnerability is to assess the particular groups of contaminant properties including attenuation process transport properties and interrelations with intrinsic vulnerability gogu and dassargues 2000 the two types of vulnerability can be assessed respectively or holistically in an area groundwater vulnerability assessment gva can be considered as an efficient management tool to protect groundwater resources from being polluted neshat et al 2014a neshat et al 2014b machiwal et al 2018 salman et al 2019 it is able to identify the approximate areas where there is a high probability of pollutants that diffuse or percolate from surface to groundwater system machiwal et al 2018 and it is also the first step and priority for detailed hydrogeological investigation and future sustainable groundwater management foster et al 2013 kang et al 2017 asfaw and mengistu 2020 a vast literature has identified the contributions and essentials of gva to sustainable groundwater management in practice mainly involving sustainable groundwater abstraction siarkos et al 2021 groundwater pollution mitigation umar et al 2022 hu et al 2018 groundwater resource allocation machiwal et al 2018 groundwater functional zonation ma et al 2020 guo et al 2019 land use planning and development boj√≥rquez tapia et al 2009 collin and melloul 2003 and groundwater strategy adjustment nrc 1993 presently many methods have been proposed for gva and they can be grouped into index based methods process based methods and statistical methods neshat et al 2014a neshat et al 2014b neshat and pradhan 2015 agossou and yang 2021 the intrinsic gv is often assessed by index based methods and statistical methods while the process based methods normally assess the specific vulnerability of groundwater machiwal et al 2018 additionally taghavi et al 2022 defined hybrid methods as a new group of methods and they reported that any method that combined the aforementioned three methods is classified as hybrid method recently a large number of hybrid methods have been demonstrated to have great potential in model efficiency improvement bordbar et al 2019a torkashvand et al 2021b busico et al 2020 khosravi et al 2021 meanwhile with the development of remote sensing rs geographic information system gis and information and communication technologies icts data acquisition becomes easier and the gv influence factors and layers can be more cost effectively and accurately integrated to assist vulnerability mapping and zonation tilahun and merkel 2010 sinkevich et al 2005 rama et al 2022 bibliometric analysis is one of the statistical methods for analyzing and visualizing the impact of research outputs from literature garfield 2009 this method has been widely used in the various fields and disciplines such as soil health liu et al 2020 seawater intrusion cao et al 2021 urban rainfall runoff pollution control technologies wang et al 2021 groundwater research niu et al 2014 groundwater remediation zhang et al 2017 and sustainable development hassan et al 2014 compared with conventional literature review bibliometric analysis enables scholars quickly and clearly understand the discipline s history basic knowledge current status evolutionary process opportunities and challenges from a statistical perspective cao et al 2021 a large amount of software is able to help in achieving bibliometric analysis such as bibexcel vosviewer citespace and bibliometrix of which citespace is a commonly used literature statistic and visualization tool based on the java platform moral mu√±oz et al 2020 it comprises many types of analysis including but not limited to article numbers countries interdisciplinary institutions journals co authors co citation co words keywords and clustering analysis in the selected literature database chen 2016 also citespace integrates well with many literature databases including web of science scopus ads cnki and derwent chen 2017 at present there have been many outstanding conventional literature reviews with regards to gv for example machiwal et al 2018 proposed a comprehensive literature review that involved gv concept types assessment models development history current research trend opportunities and challenges taghavi et al 2022 reviewed the advantages and disadvantages of different gva methods involving the critical discussions of hybrid methods aslam et al 2018 highlighted the limitations and knowledge gaps in gv to climate change and provided a new integrated approach to address these limitations under the climate change conditions shirazi et al 2012 and kumar et al 2015 respectively reviewed gis based drastic models and index based gv models and they all provided the detailed comparisons of various models these conventional literature reviews are important in summarizing the pervious papers and detecting the research gaps for the development of gv research however on the one hand the quality of these conventional reviews often depends on the understanding of scholars on gv and such reviews inevitably remain lots of subjectivity and personal preference in analysis on the other hand these gv reviews often focus on one specific aspect and summarize the existing literature with limited attention to the evolutionary process and research frontiers in the last several decades the studies of gv have increased exponentially over the entire globe and there is currently no statistical review of gv using bibliometric analysis with the increasing publications to fill the gap in gv research from the statistical perspective obtain a robust and holistic insight of gv and clarify the research frontiers and challenges of gv in the future a bibliometric analysis was conducted by selecting 949 articles based on the web of science core collection woscc database aiming to provide a systematic quantitative and intuitive visualization result of the literature database specifically the objectives of this review include i describe and visualize the gv literature database information including trend related disciplines journals author productivity countries or regions institutions citations keywords and practical implementation ii provide the information of the evolutionary process and current research frontiers in gv iii provide the insights and future challenges with regards to gv development iv propose the corresponding suggestions in overcoming the challenges 2 methodology the procedures of bibliometric analysis used in this study include literature database construction parameter determination analysis process research frontiers determination and insights challenges and suggestions determination fig 1 2 1 literature database construction the literature database is constructed by searching the keywords of groundwater vulnerability ground water vulnerability vulnerability of groundwater and vulnerability of ground water in title abstract and keywords based on woscc database in particular quotation marks are included in the keyword research we acknowledge that there may be other gv related terminology e g aquifer vulnerability and confined water vulnerability but on the one hand the gv research with groundwater as the core keyword has retrieved the vast majority of publications that can be used for bibliometric analysis and on the other hand many relative gvas retrieved by other gv related terminology are included in the literature database by searching above four keywords additionally excessive keyword selection may have marginal relations to gv research thus affecting the results of bibliometric analysis niu et al 2014 chen et al 2019 woscc database is a very commonly used bibliometric analysis database and it is reliable because all the articles published on woscc have to undergo a peer review in this study only the article publication type was selected and we did not consider reviews technical notes letters project reports conference proceedings and dissertations the retrieval period for this study was from 1990 to 2021 the literature data were last updated on 31st december 2021 additionally the data cleaning procedure removed the retracted articles and non english articles from the literature database to ensure that all the articles are closely relative to gv we manually read the titles and abstracts of the articles as well as the main body of some articles finally a total of 949 valid articles were selected for the construction of the literature database 2 2 parameter determination in citespace software a series of selection criteria was set to visualize the co occurrence results aesthetically and reasonably table 1 the meanings of parameters can be found in the manuals of citespace chen 2016 as shown in table 1 we iteratively adjusted the parameters and determined the optimal parameters so that the co occurrence images are displayed in the clearest and most aesthetic ways it should be noted that the records in tables are selected by only considering the article numbers while the co occurrence analysis created by citespace is based on different model selection algorithms namely g index and topn algorithms compared to normal statistical methods by numbers both g index and topn algorithms are able to select the important publications specifically top n is to select the highly cited articles within a given period by a proportion and top100 means that all the articles are selected for the co occurrence analysis g index is a concept introduced to compensate for the inability of the h index to reflect highly cited papers which can be defined as the scientist s highest natural number of publications in terms of cumulative citations of at least g2 or more citations egghe 2006 compared with the h index the g index puts a more weight on the sum of citations and has the advantage that it can be selected accordingly to the number of citations or frequency of occurrence per year egghe 2006 formally the modified g index applying in citespace will be derived as shown 1 g 2 k i g c i k z where c i is the citation numbers of the i th publication in a list ranked in decreasing order of citations k is the scale factor which determines the node density 2 3 analysis process three software citespace microsoft s excel and tableau are included in this bibliometric analysis for data visualization microsoft s excel and tableau are used to the creation of statistical graphs and tables including trends related disciplines journal analysis and practical implementation the co occurrence analysis visualized by citespace 5 8 r3 includes author productivity countries or regions institutions citations and keywords in keyword analysis we manually removed groundwater and vulnerability in the keyword list because they are the split results of keyword searching which may interfere with the frequency statistics and clustering results herein we uniformly explain the meanings of the co occurrence analysis figure created by citespace software the node size represents the number of articles for an object and the thickness of connection lines between nodes refers to the co occurrence frequency the colors represent the time scales and the darker colors refer to the older articles for one node the inner slices of the nodes refer to the old articles while the outer slices indicate the newer articles the thickness of a ring in a node is proportional to the number of articles in a given time slice the purple circle outside the node is the betweenness centrality which represents more connection lines focused on this node 2 4 research frontiers insights challenges and suggestions after the analysis process the research frontiers insights challenges and corresponding suggestions can be further identified specifically the research frontiers are identified by analyzing and comparing the keywords visualization results in different periods 1990 2015 and 2016 2021 skimming the whole literature database and combining our understandings and experiences of current gv development the insights and challenges of gv are determined by the in depth interpretation and comparison of the analysis process results finally according to the identified challenges the corresponding suggestions are proposed in a targeted manner for the future development of gv research 3 results and discussions 3 1 temporal trend analysis as shown in fig 2 a the number of articles increased exponentially from 1990 to 2021 over the entire globe numbers of articles in a year 2 066e0 1245x x 1 32 r2 0 9345 from 1990 to 2002 the average number of publications regarding gv per year was approximately 6 3 while this average value reached 24 1 from 2003 to 2014 during the last 7 years 2015 2021 the number of articles has experienced the explosive growth with an average of 82 6 and reaching 115 in 2021 the articles published from 2015 to 2021 accounted for 60 9 of the total literature database for the number of citations fig 2b there was also a significant increase during the last 3 decades and the highest number of citations appeared in the year 2017 1536 citations the significant increase can be interpretated as the severe conditions of groundwater challenges and the development of new technologies and methods specifically on the one hand the increasing publications of gv is a response to the groundwater quantity and quality threats that illustrated in the introduction on the other hand with the development of technology e g rs gis and icts and inter disciplines data acquisition becomes easier and the factor layers can be integrated to assist vulnerability zonation and mapping cost effectively and accurately 3 2 related disciplines gv related studies contained a wide range of disciplines with a large number of interdisciplinarities 949 articles in the literature database belong to 66 different related disciplines and we showed the top 18 related disciplines in terms of article numbers in fig 3 in these related disciplines some disciplines such as remote sensing geology and geography contribute to the development of gv gva also supports the development of many disciplines that are shown in fig 3 e g engineering civil agronomy ecology and public environmental occupational health environmental science water resources and geosciences multidisciplinary are the top 3 disciplines for gv which account for 74 2 of the total disciplines in the literature database it should be noted that almost half articles 404 out of 949 belong to the discipline of geosciences multidisciplinary and a large number of interdisciplinarities are also included in fig 3 including geography physical geochemistry geophysics green sustainable science technology and public environmental occupational health which reflects the close interdisciplinary relationship between gv and other disciplines these interdisciplinarities are able to represent current trends and possible future development in gv which provides a clear guide in discipline to achieve sdgs globally currently encouraging the development of interdisciplinary is a global trend and a significant approach for the promotion of a certain field likewise the research of gv will be further developed with the trend of interdisciplinarities and the framework of sdgs 3 3 journal contribution fig 4 shows the top 18 journals out of 257 journals in the database with the corresponding average citations per article the number of articles decreases from top to bottom in this figure horizontal bars with colors represent the number of articles in a journal and the thickness of the bars is the average number of citations per article a total of 496 articles were included in the 18 journals accounting for 52 27 of the total articles in the literature database top 6 journals including environmental earth science 95 articles 10 01 arabian journal of geosciences 48 articles 5 06 hydrogeology journal 44 articles 4 64 science of total environmental science 42 articles 4 43 environmental geology 39 articles 4 11 and journal of hydrology 31 articles 3 27 account for approximately 31 51 of the whole articles in the literature database it should be noted that although environmental earth science and arabian journal of geosciences occupied the top two positions in terms of article numbers the average citations per article is relatively low therefore the latter four journals are more recommended for scholars who want to know about gv meanwhile the journal of ground water has the highest average citations per article 42 85 in spite of low article numbers followed by science of total environment 38 02 environmental geology 37 56 journal of contaminant hydrology 36 71 hydrogeology journal 36 23 and journal of environmental management 35 33 which also reflects the significance of these journals on the development of gv 3 4 author productivity a total of 2853 authors participated in the contributions of gv on a global scale in the database we herein listed the top 10 authors in terms of article numbers in table 2 by g index h index and average citations k loague 14 nerantzis kazakis 13 salem bouri 12 and aminerza neshat 12 are the top four authors among them nerantzis kazakis 37 31 and aminerza neshat 38 67 also obtained high average citations which reflects great contributions to gv development biswajeet pradhan is the highest citation scholar with 54 27 average citations and barnali dixon 47 67 and ata allah nadiri 42 22 also obtained a considerable number of citations per article fig 5 shows the key authors and co authorships selected by the g index algorithm it is found that the nodes are distributed dispersedly with very few connections this is because the cooperation between the authors is not sufficient meanwhile the color of k loague in fig 5 is darker than other authors which represents the older articles published by k loague salem bouri saman javadi and marco masetti are not shown in fig 5 although they published some important articles in the literature database this is because the g index algorithm removed the publications with less importance relatively low citations we manually checked the removed articles by the g index algorithm which are indeed articles with fewer citations it represents the important role of the g index algorithm in the article selection in fact the g index is a compromise approach that increases the contributions and weights of highly cited articles in the selection process compared to the h index while compared to average citations it decreases the sensitivity to the articles with very high or low citations therefore the g index is an effective way to reflect the author or other aspects contributions to a field in this study by comparing the three indicators g index h index and average citations as shown in table 2 the contributions can be better reflected 3 5 country and institution distribution the top ten countries or regions and institutions with topn algorithm are listed in table 3 top100 algorithm and table 4 top10 algorithm respectively according to table 3 the united states contributed the most 12 to the development of gv with the highest h index and considerable average citations 25 88 per article followed by india 7 89 china 7 12 iran 5 65 and italy 4 88 in terms of article numbers however although the researchers in india china and italy have published many articles the average citations for the three countries are less than other top countries 17 13 17 93 and 16 48 respectively for the institutions india institute of technology contributed the most 28 and also rank first after the filtering of top10 algorithm united states geological survey also contributed a lot to the development of gv because it was not only the second rank in the number of articles but also had a high average citation per article 35 50 and a high h index 17 it should be noted that universiti putra malaysia had a very high average citations 50 36 which also reflects great contributions to this field development fig 6 and fig 7 show the distribution and cooperation of countries or regions and institutions respectively with topn algorithm as selection criteria and we highlighted the top ten in citespace as shown in fig 6 the united states india and china have a very large node size which represents the highest contributions to the field also the united states england and germany started earlier than other countries or regions due to the darker color in the central node for the top three countries the betweenness centrality us 0 09 india 0 china 0 and the connection lines between them are almost invisible which indicates the insufficient and passive cooperation in the three countries conversely canada 0 53 germany 0 4 england 0 34 and spain 0 27 show high betweenness centrality albeit low article publications it represents a high level of leadership role in research promotion and cooperation for the institutions although india institute of technology china university of geoscience and national institute of technology published many articles in the field of gv the citation numbers are less than the average citations in the top 10 institutions 12 79 16 90 and 10 38 respectively top10 algorithm selects the articles with top 10 citations within a year and unimportant articles were removed we also manually checked the removed articles and found that some important articles were removed by top10 algorithm for example the united states geological survey made significant contributions in the early stages of this field dark color while other institutions were not involved in this period top10 algorithm still filtered out some important articles prepared by united states geological survey in this period the article numbers calculated by accumulating each country or region 1292 and institution 1892 are greater than real article numbers 949 this is mainly because of the cooperative relationships in different countries and institutions as shown in fig 6 and fig 7 the distribution of networks that connect the nodes can be seen clearly albeit at low density which reflects the cooperation results in various countries and institutions it should be noted that a large number of international agencies such as who paho world health organization pan american health organization unesco ihp united nations educational scientific and cultural organization international hydrological programme igrac international groundwater resources assessment centre iah international association of hydrology un water united nations water and world bank contributed a lot to the gv development they often act as pioneers and leaders facilitating the participation of more countries and institutions in the cooperation of gv research and promoting the gv research development through initial research data sharing report preparation funding support public engagement strategy adjustment as well as sustainable groundwater management for example the initial publications with regards to gvas were prepared by these international agencies e g foster and hirata 1988 foster and skinner 1995 foster 1992 foster et al 2002 and some gv publications e g holding et al 2016 biondiƒá et al 2021 anim gyampo et al 2019 in the literature database are funded and data supported by them igrac is working close with unesco ihp wmo world meteorological organization iah commissions as well as more than 100 partners donors and facilitates the international sharing of world wide availability of relevant groundwater data and knowledge igrac 2022 however the low density network in fig 6 and fig 7 means that the current international and institutional cooperation are not sufficient as one of the leading authorities of groundwater pollution control cherry 2022 in the recent publication reported that the groundwater has not become the central issue of climate change adaptation agricultural management environmental protection and land management in many water management organizations therefore we strongly recommend that the countries and institutions to actively coordinate and support the groundwater programs launched by the international agencies so as to achieve sustainable groundwater management by means of more international cooperation 3 6 citations fig 8 shows the co citation results with top 12 authors selected by g index algorithm fig 8a and top 10 clusters selected by llr algorithm fig 8b some of the highly cited scholars publications have significantly contributed to the development of gv and obtained the widely recognition in the field we summarized the representative publication of each highly cited scholar with regards to gv in table 5 these publications involved fundamental concepts initial models guidebook review groundwater protection strategy and model modification which can be considered as the foundational works on gv development additionally we went through the profiles of these scholars and found that they are affiliated with national or international agencies such as nwwa national water well association iah harc houston advanced research center brgm bureau de recherches g√©ologiques et mini√®res and saskatchewan research council which further represents the contributions of agencies to gv development as shown in fig 8b the cited articles can be clustered into 10 groups which represents the popular topics issues areas or some contents that are closely related to gv in fig 8b statistical method 0 and indexing method 9 are very popular ways to assess gv and normally susceptibility index 8 is the result of indexing method for the further vulnerability mapping and zonation burkart et al 1999 huan et al 2012 machiwal et al 2018 karst 1 is a kind of special landform which is a different system in the gva so many models for evaluating gv in karst areas have been developed such as cop model kavi model and core model daly et al 2002 v√≠as et al 2006 van beynen et al 2012 pavlis and cummins 2014 pesticides 2 are significant pollutants 4 in agricultural regions which significantly impacts the groundwater quality in an area and attracts the attention of many scholars very early banton and villeneuve 1989 villeneuve et al 1990 teso et al 1996 saha and alam 2014 goghat 3 india and yucatan 7 mexico are two typical areas that suffer from severe water scarcity and groundwater pollution respectively much research has been devoted to addressing groundwater issues in goghat das and pal 2020a das and pal 2020b yadav and salui 2021 and yucatan delgado et al 2010 moreno g√≥mez et al 2018 rodr√≠guez et al 2018 monitoring 5 is an important step to determine the level of pollution in an area for gv mapping nistor 2019 and it is the follow up works after the gva particularly in high vulnerability areas mar√≠n et al 2021 yousefi et al 2021 modified galdit 6 is a group of index based methods based on galdit model which have been widely used in the gva with the consideration of seawater intrusion bordbar et al 2019b bordbar et al 2020 pisciotta et al 2022 3 7 keywords 1870 keywords are included in the literature database with the total frequency of 3761 and table 6 summarized the top 15 keywords by the frequency in the literature database groundwater vulnerability drastic and gis have the highest total frequency and some pollution related keywords e g nitrate contamination pollution have a relatively high keyword frequency notably excluding groundwater vulnerability drastic gis drastic model climate change and sensitivity analysis obtained a relatively high annual frequency in keywords which represents the recent popularity of these keywords after looking through the total keyword list some recent keywords also obtained a relatively high annual frequency including land use 1 5 nitrate pollution 1 5 hierarchical fuzzy 2 machine learning 2 hexavalent chromium 2 groundwater resources management 2 longitudinal conductance 2 thematic layer 2 seawater intrusion 1 57 random forest 1 5 and urban expansion 1 5 these present high frequency keywords also indicate the development status of gv research fig 9 a to fig 9d show the keyword co occurrence analysis top100 algorithm and clustering analysis llr algorithm in different periods 1990 2015 and 2016 2021 fig 9e is the keyword clustering analysis results with time slide by top10 algorithm and llr algorithm by comparing the five figures gis drastic and pollution related issues always appeared in different periods whether keyword co occurrence analysis or clustering results which indicates that most gv research used gis as the core analytical tool drastic or modified drastic as the dominant method with the main purpose of groundwater pollution reduction meanwhile nitrate is a major human related pollutant in agricultural areas and land use is a cluster in two periods 9 in fig 9b and 12 in fig 9d which shows that the impacts of human activities on groundwater have always been a concern in gv climate change sensitivity analysis and groundwater quality have been involved in the recent keyword co occurrence fig 9c and climate change has been clustered as a new group in fig 9d 7 and fig 9e 1 that is the issue of climate change as well as corresponding impacts in gv field has rapidly become the popular issue in recent years additionally groundwater management 2 and sustainability 6 are two new clusters in fig 9d which means that some gv research has turned towards sustainable groundwater management rather than just addressing pollution issues at a regional scale 3 8 practical implementations a total of 214 out of 1870 keywords involved the specific models methods and theories of gva with 569 keyword frequency table 7 shows the manually merged gva methods keyword frequency 5 and corresponding typical cases it is found that the drastic and modified drastic methods 283 have absolute dominance which accounts for almost half of the keyword frequency of methods 49 74 the modifications and optimizations of drastic model normally include the replacement and addition of parameters and the revision of weighting systems by means of parameter replacement and addition a large number of new models were proposed on the basis of drastic model in the literature database including dramic wang et al 2007 drastica singh et al 2015 drastic lu kumar and krishna 2020 drastic le liang et al 2019 cad drastic salek et al 2018 drastic p massone et al 2010 drastic draia vaezihir and tabarmayeh 2015 drastic cdhpi haque et al 2018 drastic sg hern√°ndez espri√∫ et al 2014 drasticu safa et al 2020 dracilm he et al 2018 drarch guo et al 2007 dranthvp jia et al 2019b drasticai albuquerque et al 2021 drastic aglu cc persaud and levison 2021 drasli que li et al 2021 drastic pan kazakis and voudouris 2015 drtilsq wu et al 2016 these new models are able to effectively adapt to different site characteristics e g pollution types human activities and groundwater features in gva and obtained more accurate assessment results than basic drastic model an important finding is that land use type is included in the majority of modified drastic models because it is a key factor affecting the transport of pollutant loads and should be fully considered in groundwater resources management tasdighi et al 2017 the replacement and addition of parameters also occurred in the modification and optimization of other index based methods such as the sintacs galdit and cop but their numbers were less than drastic model analytic hierarchy process ahp 38 fuzzy theory 37 entropy based model 10 and multi criteria analysis 10 are frequently used methods for the revision of weighting systems on the basis of drastic model or other index based methods also some machine learning algorithms such as neural network 7 logistic regression 6 support vector machine and random forest can also be used for weight revisions e g elzain et al 2021 barzegar et al 2018 nadiri et al 2019 generally these methods are able to significantly improve the model performance by subjectively or objectively revising the weights of parameters arezoomand omidi langrudi et al 2016 hu et al 2018 yu et al 2012 however the use of ahp and fuzzy theory are significantly more than others for weight revisions and the methods with machine learning algorithms have not been widely implemented in gvas machiwal et al 2018 as shown in table 7 the numbers of index based methods are significantly greater than process based methods and statistical methods this is mainly because of the early development simple calculation and satisfactory compatibility with gis platforms of index based methods machiwal et al 2018 however the statistical and process based methods are few in table 7 and even transport modelling is the only process based method type with 12 keyword frequency according to machiwal et al 2018 and taghavi et al 2022 the applications of statistical techniques e g artificial intelligence regression techniques in gv have been mainly limited to the difficulty in model interpretation model selection as well as accredited rules in optimization and the development of process based methods is presently facing many limitations including extensive field data acquisition software compatibility and the size of the study area 3 9 research frontiers in this section we identified the four research frontiers in the field of gv including model development modification and optimization climate change impacts human activity impacts and sustainable groundwater management 3 9 1 model development modification and optimization as table 6 and table 7 show the index based methods are the dominant and mainstream methods in gva in the past decades while the development of process based and statistical methods are both limited to a certain extent but in fact the two types of methods have great potential in gva and enable effectively make up for the weaknesses of index based methods therefore it should be a research frontier to develop more process based and statistical methods in the future as well as related techniques such as data acquisition software updates and algorithm optimization meanwhile after looking through the recent articles in the literature database it is a trend that the index based models have been continuously modified and optimized by parameter replacement busico et al 2017 jia et al 2019b and incorporating with ahp hu et al 2018 qiu et al 2021 variable weight theory qiang et al 2016 fuzzy set theory iqbal et al 2015 sresto et al 2021 entropy theory wei et al 2021b wang et al 2020 as well las machine learning and deep learning algorithm torkashvand et al 2021a bordbar et al 2020 wei et al 2021a norouzi et al 2021 it is also a research frontier to achieve a more accurate gv prediction by modifying and optimizing the existing models 3 9 2 climate change impacts climate change is a significant keyword with a 2 56 annual keyword frequency and was clustered in a new group in fig 9d and fig 9e presently many scholars are trying to analyze the climate impacts on gv by incorporating climate prediction models into the classical gv models for example huang et al 2017 predicted the future net recharge change under climate change and replaced the net recharge r in drastic model in china luoma et al 2017 combined the changes of recharge and sea level rise on groundwater in sintacs and galdit methods by an overlay function seeboonruang 2016 used an overlay technique by incorporating drastic model project precipitation and drought degree to assess the climate change impacts on gv to drought nistor 2020 simulated the future water availability by precipitation and temperature in the whole of europe and constructed a model of nistor gwv index to integrate the intrinsic vulnerability and climate changes today when climate change has become a global concern its impacts on gv should be a research frontier that deserves public attention and it is still a very complicated and challenging issue with insufficient research at this stage machiwal et al 2018 aslam et al 2018 3 9 3 human activity impacts many important keywords and cluster results can be explained by human activity impacts such as land use urban expansion nitrate denitrification hexavalent chromium arsenic and groundwater pollution contamination current scholars normally utilized the human related indicators such as land use land cover urbanization index and exploitation rate refer to the intensity of human activities e g berhe zenebe et al 2020 jesiya and gopinath 2019 singh et al 2015 liang et al 2019 however human activity intensity is a complex and dynamic variable that is difficult to quantify particularly in developing countries al hanbali and kondoh 2008 which means the many index based methods and statistical methods are not suitable for assessing the impacts of human activities meanwhile the intensive human activities such as groundwater extraction urban expansion and agricultural irrigation will continue for many years which may also constantly threaten the quality and quantity of groundwater therefore it is also a research frontier to conduct gva by consideration of human activities 3 9 4 sustainable groundwater management sustainable groundwater management is the ultimate objective of gva saidi et al 2011 collin and melloul 2003 and gva has been proven to play a significant role in achieving sustainable groundwater management in practice in the recent keyword clustering analysis groundwater management 2 and sustainability 6 have become the new clusters fig 9d which represents a trend of transformation from regional pollution reduction towards sustainable groundwater management for gv research given that foster et al 2013 reported that gva is the first step to identify the approximate areas for further hydrogeological investigation and groundwater management strategy improvement there is still a long way to go in sustainable groundwater management under the framework of un sdgs therefore how to efficiently achieve sustainable groundwater management will be a frontier issue in the next few years for groundwater managers 3 10 insights challenges and suggestions 3 10 1 unequal research development unequal research development refers to the area with higher abstraction or contamination but low research articles with regards to gv although the past 30 years witnessed the rapid development of gv all over the world there is a significant unequal gv research development with different indicators including groundwater abstraction and groundwater quality fig 10 fig 10a shows the gv research distributions in the literature database and fig 10b to fig 10f show the distribution of abstraction as a percentage of mean annual recharge nitrate concentration salinization areas arsenic contamination and fluoride contamination respectively by comparing the differences of fig 10a and other five figures the unequal research development areas and specific countries can be highlighted by dashed lines in fig 10 and summarized in table 8 which represent the main suggesting study areas for the future gv research it is found that some countries appeared multiple times in different indicators including argentina libya algeria azerbaijan oman iraq niger and turkmenistan therefore we strongly suggest that these countries or regions particularly in the countries that facing different aspects of groundwater stresses and risks should make more efforts on the development of gv research on a global scale the groundwater conditions in these countries should receive international attentions and assistance by this way the unequal gv research development on the global scale can be further eliminated 3 10 2 insufficient cooperation the co occurrence analysis of countries or regions authors and institutions are shown in the aforementioned sections it is found that the connections between the nodes are few particularly in the authorships and institutions fig 5 and fig 7 in the two figures the authors and institutions with major contributions are almost distributed dispersedly with almost invisible betweenness centrality for countries regions the connections between nodes are also insufficient fig 6 and high betweenness centrality countries are canada germany england and spain instead of top countries usa china and india these findings reflect a lack of cooperation in gv research including countries institutions and authors international cooperation assistance and communication are important approaches to promote the development of a field especially under the framework of the global sdgs therefore we strongly suggest strengthening the international cooperation and communication to promote the global development of the field by different ways e g policy adjustment strategy improvement technology support and education program as well as encouraging more countries and institutions participating in the international groundwater programs launched by international agencies so as to achieve the sustainable groundwater management in today s increasingly serious groundwater issues 3 10 3 response to climate change and human activities according to taylor et al 2013 and unesco 2022 climate change directly impacts the earth s water balance by precipitation extremes evapotranspiration increase floods droughts sea level rise and meltwater regimes and further influences the global freshwater quantity quality supply demand and management for example the intensive pumped abstraction in groundwater fed irrigation areas e g northwest india and north china plains may be highly threatened by the recharge reduction caused by climate change glazer and likens 2012 aslam et al 2018 pointed out the influence of climate change on groundwater is very significant but very few studies considered it in gv research currently there is still a large research gap in gv studies that take into account climate change machiwal et al 2018 an alternative solution is to integrate the climate change models into gva for dynamic vulnerability prediction as the pioneering articles shown in the section 3 8 2 but limited by data availability coarse spatial scale and the capture of some physical processes e g el ni√±o holding et al 2016 therefore with the increasing impact of climate change on the water environment we suggest 1 researchers are supposed to take climate change impacts into account in gva and integrate them in models more rationally 2 it is necessary to learn the lessons from other fields with regards to addressing climate change issues meanwhile as shown in section 3 8 3 although some scholars have utilized a series of indexes to refer to the intensity of human activities assessing human activity impacts on gv is also a challenge because these impacts are very complex and time dependent presently there is currently a lack of frameworks and recognized models for assessing gv with the consideration of dynamic human impacts therefore it is also suggested using complex parameters and more appropriate weighting systems to simulate the process of human activities currently many parameters have been identified by scholars to represent human activities including land use land cover kumar and krishna 2020 jesiya and gopinath 2019 urbanization index singh et al 2015 density of population vaezihir and tabarmayeh 2015 abstraction index ojeda olivares et al 2020 exploitation rate li and hou 2020 and social marginalization level ojeda olivares et al 2020 in gva these studies are good attempts to simulate human activities in gva herein we provide two typical examples in response to dynamic human activities in gva jia et al 2019b applied a projection pursuit dynamic clustering ppdc model to determine the weights of parameters and replaced the parameters of drastic with human activity factors e g groundwater velocity nitrate attenuation intensity and pollutant input intensity for more accurate assessment results ojeda olivares et al 2020 used the abstraction index the pollution index and the social marginalization level as the parameters and ahp weighting system to address the impacts of dynamic human activities in gva 3 10 4 sdgs in groundwater management sustainable groundwater management is an ultimate goal of gvas on a global scale and has become the new clusters in recent keyword analysis fig 9d more than 50 specific targets in sdgs have been interlinked to groundwater particularly in sdg 6 sdg 12 and sdg 13 undp 2022 these goals not only focus on the water related properties such as water quantity and quality but also involve many economic social and environmental targets for example in sdg 6 clean water and sanitation it not only involved the water aspects such as pollution reduction and water use efficiency but also mentioned equity health safety international cooperation water use policy and technical support however current articles related to gv mainly focused on the water itself and rarely mentioned other aspects of the sdgs in fact gva is only a preliminary stage of sustainable groundwater management not a final word foster et al 2013 based on gv mapping and zonation there are many subsequent works in groundwater management to achieve the sdgs including but not limited to detailed hydrological surveys reasonable land planning appropriate and equitable water allocation and use water pollution control and monitoring health risk assessment etc given that there is a considerable research gap between gvas and sdgs in groundwater management we propose to integrate gv more closely with the sdgs to show how groundwater sustainability can be more effectively achieved in future research 4 limitations this study adopted a recognized methodology of bibliometric analysis and provided reliable outputs like previous studies e g giupponi and biscaro 2015 shi et al 2019 zyoud and fuchs hanusch 2017 however some limitations are still included in this research first it is very difficult to consider all the important related publications in gv but it is a common limitation in bibliometric analysis for all the filed on the one hand although selecting article as the publication type is a commonly used method in bibliometric analysis it may ignore some important publications from technical notes letters project reports conference proceedings and dissertations at this stage these grey publications have not been well compatible with bibliometric software and manual database construction cannot ensure the quality of publications currently considering article as the only publication type is a relative effective way to remove low quality publications in bibliometric analysis on the other hand although some data cleaning methods and algorithms have been used for the literature database construction and important article selection it is difficult to ensure all the important articles are included in the literature database second the ambiguity in keyword identification can affect the results of bibliometric analysis this study involved a manual cleaning to make sure the correct combinations with duplicate entries but cannot ensure all the entries are processed by manual check for example the indian institute of technology which has published extensively in the field of gv has been recorded as a single institution by manual consolidation however these authors may have come from different campuses but recorded ambiguously in woscc platform meanwhile as the limitations of the options available at the time of journal submission and the shortcomings of citespace in running modules some related disciplines may appear separately in fragmented forms with almost identical names which would also require considerable time to do additional de duplication or merging we also manually merged the similar related disciplines but cannot ensure all the entries were checked despite all the limitations this study provides a holistic and representative picture of gv research productivity on a global scale 5 conclusion this study presents a bibliometric analysis with regards to gv by selecting 949 articles in the woscc database the unique aspect of this review is the consideration of gv development by a statistical approach eliminating the subjectivity and personal preference of conventional literature review nine aspects including trends related disciplines journals author productivity countries or regions institutions citations keywords and practical implementations were visualized and analyzed by citespace 5 8 r3 microsoft s excel and tableau which intuitively indicates the development process of gv research in the past and present the development of gva in the last decades showed significant growth in articles citations inter disciplines and new keywords and a large number of countries or regions global scholars institutions and international agencies participated in the contributions of gv research development the significant growth can be interpreted as a response to the groundwater quantity and quality threats the supports of technology development e g rs gis and icts and the development of inter disciplines also the international agencies such as who paho unesco ihp igrac iah un water and world bank contributed a lot to the gv development by means of initial research data sharing report preparation funding support public engagement strategy adjustment as well as sustainable groundwater management the index based methods especially for drastic and modified drastic are the dominant and mainstream methods in the practical implementation of gva over the past few years the drastic model has been modified and optimized in the vast literature by replacing parameters and revising parameter weights which resulted in the appearance of many new models and weighting methods land use type is included in the majority of modified drastic models because it is a key factor affecting the transport of pollutant loads and should be fully considered in groundwater resources management however the development of both process based and statistical methods is limited to a certain extent the process based methods are presently facing many limitations including extensive field data acquisition software compatibility and the size of the study area and the statistical methods are mainly limited by the difficulty in model interpretation model selection as well as accredited rules in optimization today model development modification and optimization are the research frontiers in gv research and the process based and statistical methods have great potential in gva the two types of methods may effectively make up for the weaknesses of index based methods in the future climate change and human activity impacts are not only research frontiers but also challenges for gv research although some articles have made great contributions to the climate change and human activity impacts on gv these impacts are very complex and dynamic with considerable research gaps for these issues this review suggests integrating the indicators of climate change and human activity impacts into gva by a more reasonable way and exploring the lessons about how other fields address the impacts of climate change and human activity impacts additionally gv is also facing the challenges of unequal research development and insufficient cooperation some countries including argentina libya algeria azerbaijan oman iraq niger and turkmenistan even suffered from different aspects of groundwater stresses and risks these countries should make more efforts on the development of gv research and are supposed to receive more international attentions and assistance in fact international cooperation assistance and communication are important approaches to promote the development of a field especially under the framework of the global sdgs it is also suggested that the international cooperation and communication should be encouraged to promote the global development of gv by different ways e g policy adjustment strategy improvement technology support and education program gva has been proven to play a significant role in achieving sustainable groundwater management in practice however current articles related to gv mainly focused on the water itself and rarely mentioned other aspects of the sdgs it should be noted that gva is the first step for sustainable groundwater management instead of final word the following works involving detailed hydrogeological investigation groundwater management strategy improvement as well as economic social and environmental targets under the sdg framework are required a large number of efforts and investments therefore we propose to integrate gv more closely with the sdgs to show how groundwater sustainability can be more effectively achieved in future research although we presently have some years to achieve the sustainable groundwater management by 2030 the challenges and follow up tasks should be immediately become the focus of different countries and be effectively completed in a well organized cooperating and sustainable way declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
2734,groundwater is the main source of drinking and irrigation on earth because of its large quantity and worldly distribution albeit unequally however it is presently being threatened by over consumption and contamination groundwater vulnerability gv is to assess the aquifer sustainability under a contaminant load for an area which plays a significant part in sustainable groundwater management in practice in the last several decades the studies of gv have increased exponentially over the entire globe and there is currently no statistical review in gv by using bibliometric analysis with the increasing publications in this review a global bibliometric analysis was conducted to analyze and visualize the current status and determine future challenges of gv research by considering a total of 949 articles based on web of science core collection database nine different aspects including trend related disciplines journals author productivity countries or regions institutions citations keywords and practical implementation were visualized and analyzed by citespace 5 8 r3 microsoft s excel and tableau by in depth analysis this review clearly showed the major contribution members and the evolutionary process of gv as well as identified four research frontiers model development modification and optimization climate change impacts human activity impacts and sustainable groundwater management and four future challenges unequal research development insufficient cooperation response to climate change and human activities and sdgs in groundwater management finally the corresponding suggestions for overcoming the challenges were proposed to achieve sustainable groundwater management keywords groundwater vulnerability bibliometric analysis sustainable development goals sustainable groundwater management insights and challenges data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater is the main source of drinking and irrigation on earth because of its large quantity and worldly distribution albeit unequally mosavi et al 2020 gleeson et al 2015 khosravi et al 2018 according to unesco 2022 groundwater accounts for nearly 99 of the earth s available liquid freshwater and contributes one quarter of all water consumption for human activities this important resource enables support many aspects of economic social and environmental development all over the world such as healthy living industrial development agricultural irrigation maintenance of ecosystem and sustainable development aslam et al 2018 omotola et al 2020 however groundwater quantity and quality are presently being threatened by over consumption and pollution barzegar et al 2021 singha et al 2019 because of rapid urbanization wakode et al 2018 unequal distributions collins and bolin 2007 extensive abstraction chang et al 2017 wastewater disposal awawdeh et al 2015 mismanagement busico et al 2021 human activities jia et al 2019a and climate changes mendieta mendoza et al 2021 given that on the one hand groundwater resources are final receivers of pollutants in the process of water cycle and on the other hand they are very difficult to restore after being polluted the issue of groundwater quality deterioration may lead to significant and possibly irreversible impacts on human health and ecological services agossou and yang 2021 siarkos et al 2021 shrestha et al 2017 li et al 2021 additionally groundwater pollution significantly reduces the amount of groundwater exploitable resources thus leading to severe water scarcity siarkos et al 2021 abunada et al 2021 therefore there is an urgent need to effectively decrease groundwater threats by means of groundwater pollution elimination groundwater resilience improvement and sustainable groundwater management at a global scale taghavi et al 2022 the terminology of groundwater vulnerability gv was first coined in the late 1960s margat 1968 and further gained development in the field of hydrogeology during the 1980s haertle 1983 however the definition of gv is still expressed in different ways and there is no universally accepted definition although the research of gv has been in development for over half a century taghavi et al 2022 armengol et al 2014 despite the differences some key words are frequently mentioned in the various definitions including susceptibility contamination pollution anthropogenic activity groundwater quality and aquifer system machiwal et al 2018 today a consensus is that gv is used to assess the aquifer sustainability under a contaminant load for an area which measures the capacity of resisting pollutants into groundwater system by natural site characteristics foster et al 2013 thapa et al 2018 busico et al 2017 the types of gv can be distinguished into intrinsic vulnerability and specific vulnerability ayed et al 2017 nrc 1993 qiu et al 2021 stigter et al 2006 hu et al 2018 intrinsic vulnerability refers to the vulnerability by consideration of physical characteristics of the aquifer such as geology hydrology and hydrogeology in response to the pollutants without involving the specific pollutants vrba and zaporozec 1994 specific vulnerability is to assess the particular groups of contaminant properties including attenuation process transport properties and interrelations with intrinsic vulnerability gogu and dassargues 2000 the two types of vulnerability can be assessed respectively or holistically in an area groundwater vulnerability assessment gva can be considered as an efficient management tool to protect groundwater resources from being polluted neshat et al 2014a neshat et al 2014b machiwal et al 2018 salman et al 2019 it is able to identify the approximate areas where there is a high probability of pollutants that diffuse or percolate from surface to groundwater system machiwal et al 2018 and it is also the first step and priority for detailed hydrogeological investigation and future sustainable groundwater management foster et al 2013 kang et al 2017 asfaw and mengistu 2020 a vast literature has identified the contributions and essentials of gva to sustainable groundwater management in practice mainly involving sustainable groundwater abstraction siarkos et al 2021 groundwater pollution mitigation umar et al 2022 hu et al 2018 groundwater resource allocation machiwal et al 2018 groundwater functional zonation ma et al 2020 guo et al 2019 land use planning and development boj√≥rquez tapia et al 2009 collin and melloul 2003 and groundwater strategy adjustment nrc 1993 presently many methods have been proposed for gva and they can be grouped into index based methods process based methods and statistical methods neshat et al 2014a neshat et al 2014b neshat and pradhan 2015 agossou and yang 2021 the intrinsic gv is often assessed by index based methods and statistical methods while the process based methods normally assess the specific vulnerability of groundwater machiwal et al 2018 additionally taghavi et al 2022 defined hybrid methods as a new group of methods and they reported that any method that combined the aforementioned three methods is classified as hybrid method recently a large number of hybrid methods have been demonstrated to have great potential in model efficiency improvement bordbar et al 2019a torkashvand et al 2021b busico et al 2020 khosravi et al 2021 meanwhile with the development of remote sensing rs geographic information system gis and information and communication technologies icts data acquisition becomes easier and the gv influence factors and layers can be more cost effectively and accurately integrated to assist vulnerability mapping and zonation tilahun and merkel 2010 sinkevich et al 2005 rama et al 2022 bibliometric analysis is one of the statistical methods for analyzing and visualizing the impact of research outputs from literature garfield 2009 this method has been widely used in the various fields and disciplines such as soil health liu et al 2020 seawater intrusion cao et al 2021 urban rainfall runoff pollution control technologies wang et al 2021 groundwater research niu et al 2014 groundwater remediation zhang et al 2017 and sustainable development hassan et al 2014 compared with conventional literature review bibliometric analysis enables scholars quickly and clearly understand the discipline s history basic knowledge current status evolutionary process opportunities and challenges from a statistical perspective cao et al 2021 a large amount of software is able to help in achieving bibliometric analysis such as bibexcel vosviewer citespace and bibliometrix of which citespace is a commonly used literature statistic and visualization tool based on the java platform moral mu√±oz et al 2020 it comprises many types of analysis including but not limited to article numbers countries interdisciplinary institutions journals co authors co citation co words keywords and clustering analysis in the selected literature database chen 2016 also citespace integrates well with many literature databases including web of science scopus ads cnki and derwent chen 2017 at present there have been many outstanding conventional literature reviews with regards to gv for example machiwal et al 2018 proposed a comprehensive literature review that involved gv concept types assessment models development history current research trend opportunities and challenges taghavi et al 2022 reviewed the advantages and disadvantages of different gva methods involving the critical discussions of hybrid methods aslam et al 2018 highlighted the limitations and knowledge gaps in gv to climate change and provided a new integrated approach to address these limitations under the climate change conditions shirazi et al 2012 and kumar et al 2015 respectively reviewed gis based drastic models and index based gv models and they all provided the detailed comparisons of various models these conventional literature reviews are important in summarizing the pervious papers and detecting the research gaps for the development of gv research however on the one hand the quality of these conventional reviews often depends on the understanding of scholars on gv and such reviews inevitably remain lots of subjectivity and personal preference in analysis on the other hand these gv reviews often focus on one specific aspect and summarize the existing literature with limited attention to the evolutionary process and research frontiers in the last several decades the studies of gv have increased exponentially over the entire globe and there is currently no statistical review of gv using bibliometric analysis with the increasing publications to fill the gap in gv research from the statistical perspective obtain a robust and holistic insight of gv and clarify the research frontiers and challenges of gv in the future a bibliometric analysis was conducted by selecting 949 articles based on the web of science core collection woscc database aiming to provide a systematic quantitative and intuitive visualization result of the literature database specifically the objectives of this review include i describe and visualize the gv literature database information including trend related disciplines journals author productivity countries or regions institutions citations keywords and practical implementation ii provide the information of the evolutionary process and current research frontiers in gv iii provide the insights and future challenges with regards to gv development iv propose the corresponding suggestions in overcoming the challenges 2 methodology the procedures of bibliometric analysis used in this study include literature database construction parameter determination analysis process research frontiers determination and insights challenges and suggestions determination fig 1 2 1 literature database construction the literature database is constructed by searching the keywords of groundwater vulnerability ground water vulnerability vulnerability of groundwater and vulnerability of ground water in title abstract and keywords based on woscc database in particular quotation marks are included in the keyword research we acknowledge that there may be other gv related terminology e g aquifer vulnerability and confined water vulnerability but on the one hand the gv research with groundwater as the core keyword has retrieved the vast majority of publications that can be used for bibliometric analysis and on the other hand many relative gvas retrieved by other gv related terminology are included in the literature database by searching above four keywords additionally excessive keyword selection may have marginal relations to gv research thus affecting the results of bibliometric analysis niu et al 2014 chen et al 2019 woscc database is a very commonly used bibliometric analysis database and it is reliable because all the articles published on woscc have to undergo a peer review in this study only the article publication type was selected and we did not consider reviews technical notes letters project reports conference proceedings and dissertations the retrieval period for this study was from 1990 to 2021 the literature data were last updated on 31st december 2021 additionally the data cleaning procedure removed the retracted articles and non english articles from the literature database to ensure that all the articles are closely relative to gv we manually read the titles and abstracts of the articles as well as the main body of some articles finally a total of 949 valid articles were selected for the construction of the literature database 2 2 parameter determination in citespace software a series of selection criteria was set to visualize the co occurrence results aesthetically and reasonably table 1 the meanings of parameters can be found in the manuals of citespace chen 2016 as shown in table 1 we iteratively adjusted the parameters and determined the optimal parameters so that the co occurrence images are displayed in the clearest and most aesthetic ways it should be noted that the records in tables are selected by only considering the article numbers while the co occurrence analysis created by citespace is based on different model selection algorithms namely g index and topn algorithms compared to normal statistical methods by numbers both g index and topn algorithms are able to select the important publications specifically top n is to select the highly cited articles within a given period by a proportion and top100 means that all the articles are selected for the co occurrence analysis g index is a concept introduced to compensate for the inability of the h index to reflect highly cited papers which can be defined as the scientist s highest natural number of publications in terms of cumulative citations of at least g2 or more citations egghe 2006 compared with the h index the g index puts a more weight on the sum of citations and has the advantage that it can be selected accordingly to the number of citations or frequency of occurrence per year egghe 2006 formally the modified g index applying in citespace will be derived as shown 1 g 2 k i g c i k z where c i is the citation numbers of the i th publication in a list ranked in decreasing order of citations k is the scale factor which determines the node density 2 3 analysis process three software citespace microsoft s excel and tableau are included in this bibliometric analysis for data visualization microsoft s excel and tableau are used to the creation of statistical graphs and tables including trends related disciplines journal analysis and practical implementation the co occurrence analysis visualized by citespace 5 8 r3 includes author productivity countries or regions institutions citations and keywords in keyword analysis we manually removed groundwater and vulnerability in the keyword list because they are the split results of keyword searching which may interfere with the frequency statistics and clustering results herein we uniformly explain the meanings of the co occurrence analysis figure created by citespace software the node size represents the number of articles for an object and the thickness of connection lines between nodes refers to the co occurrence frequency the colors represent the time scales and the darker colors refer to the older articles for one node the inner slices of the nodes refer to the old articles while the outer slices indicate the newer articles the thickness of a ring in a node is proportional to the number of articles in a given time slice the purple circle outside the node is the betweenness centrality which represents more connection lines focused on this node 2 4 research frontiers insights challenges and suggestions after the analysis process the research frontiers insights challenges and corresponding suggestions can be further identified specifically the research frontiers are identified by analyzing and comparing the keywords visualization results in different periods 1990 2015 and 2016 2021 skimming the whole literature database and combining our understandings and experiences of current gv development the insights and challenges of gv are determined by the in depth interpretation and comparison of the analysis process results finally according to the identified challenges the corresponding suggestions are proposed in a targeted manner for the future development of gv research 3 results and discussions 3 1 temporal trend analysis as shown in fig 2 a the number of articles increased exponentially from 1990 to 2021 over the entire globe numbers of articles in a year 2 066e0 1245x x 1 32 r2 0 9345 from 1990 to 2002 the average number of publications regarding gv per year was approximately 6 3 while this average value reached 24 1 from 2003 to 2014 during the last 7 years 2015 2021 the number of articles has experienced the explosive growth with an average of 82 6 and reaching 115 in 2021 the articles published from 2015 to 2021 accounted for 60 9 of the total literature database for the number of citations fig 2b there was also a significant increase during the last 3 decades and the highest number of citations appeared in the year 2017 1536 citations the significant increase can be interpretated as the severe conditions of groundwater challenges and the development of new technologies and methods specifically on the one hand the increasing publications of gv is a response to the groundwater quantity and quality threats that illustrated in the introduction on the other hand with the development of technology e g rs gis and icts and inter disciplines data acquisition becomes easier and the factor layers can be integrated to assist vulnerability zonation and mapping cost effectively and accurately 3 2 related disciplines gv related studies contained a wide range of disciplines with a large number of interdisciplinarities 949 articles in the literature database belong to 66 different related disciplines and we showed the top 18 related disciplines in terms of article numbers in fig 3 in these related disciplines some disciplines such as remote sensing geology and geography contribute to the development of gv gva also supports the development of many disciplines that are shown in fig 3 e g engineering civil agronomy ecology and public environmental occupational health environmental science water resources and geosciences multidisciplinary are the top 3 disciplines for gv which account for 74 2 of the total disciplines in the literature database it should be noted that almost half articles 404 out of 949 belong to the discipline of geosciences multidisciplinary and a large number of interdisciplinarities are also included in fig 3 including geography physical geochemistry geophysics green sustainable science technology and public environmental occupational health which reflects the close interdisciplinary relationship between gv and other disciplines these interdisciplinarities are able to represent current trends and possible future development in gv which provides a clear guide in discipline to achieve sdgs globally currently encouraging the development of interdisciplinary is a global trend and a significant approach for the promotion of a certain field likewise the research of gv will be further developed with the trend of interdisciplinarities and the framework of sdgs 3 3 journal contribution fig 4 shows the top 18 journals out of 257 journals in the database with the corresponding average citations per article the number of articles decreases from top to bottom in this figure horizontal bars with colors represent the number of articles in a journal and the thickness of the bars is the average number of citations per article a total of 496 articles were included in the 18 journals accounting for 52 27 of the total articles in the literature database top 6 journals including environmental earth science 95 articles 10 01 arabian journal of geosciences 48 articles 5 06 hydrogeology journal 44 articles 4 64 science of total environmental science 42 articles 4 43 environmental geology 39 articles 4 11 and journal of hydrology 31 articles 3 27 account for approximately 31 51 of the whole articles in the literature database it should be noted that although environmental earth science and arabian journal of geosciences occupied the top two positions in terms of article numbers the average citations per article is relatively low therefore the latter four journals are more recommended for scholars who want to know about gv meanwhile the journal of ground water has the highest average citations per article 42 85 in spite of low article numbers followed by science of total environment 38 02 environmental geology 37 56 journal of contaminant hydrology 36 71 hydrogeology journal 36 23 and journal of environmental management 35 33 which also reflects the significance of these journals on the development of gv 3 4 author productivity a total of 2853 authors participated in the contributions of gv on a global scale in the database we herein listed the top 10 authors in terms of article numbers in table 2 by g index h index and average citations k loague 14 nerantzis kazakis 13 salem bouri 12 and aminerza neshat 12 are the top four authors among them nerantzis kazakis 37 31 and aminerza neshat 38 67 also obtained high average citations which reflects great contributions to gv development biswajeet pradhan is the highest citation scholar with 54 27 average citations and barnali dixon 47 67 and ata allah nadiri 42 22 also obtained a considerable number of citations per article fig 5 shows the key authors and co authorships selected by the g index algorithm it is found that the nodes are distributed dispersedly with very few connections this is because the cooperation between the authors is not sufficient meanwhile the color of k loague in fig 5 is darker than other authors which represents the older articles published by k loague salem bouri saman javadi and marco masetti are not shown in fig 5 although they published some important articles in the literature database this is because the g index algorithm removed the publications with less importance relatively low citations we manually checked the removed articles by the g index algorithm which are indeed articles with fewer citations it represents the important role of the g index algorithm in the article selection in fact the g index is a compromise approach that increases the contributions and weights of highly cited articles in the selection process compared to the h index while compared to average citations it decreases the sensitivity to the articles with very high or low citations therefore the g index is an effective way to reflect the author or other aspects contributions to a field in this study by comparing the three indicators g index h index and average citations as shown in table 2 the contributions can be better reflected 3 5 country and institution distribution the top ten countries or regions and institutions with topn algorithm are listed in table 3 top100 algorithm and table 4 top10 algorithm respectively according to table 3 the united states contributed the most 12 to the development of gv with the highest h index and considerable average citations 25 88 per article followed by india 7 89 china 7 12 iran 5 65 and italy 4 88 in terms of article numbers however although the researchers in india china and italy have published many articles the average citations for the three countries are less than other top countries 17 13 17 93 and 16 48 respectively for the institutions india institute of technology contributed the most 28 and also rank first after the filtering of top10 algorithm united states geological survey also contributed a lot to the development of gv because it was not only the second rank in the number of articles but also had a high average citation per article 35 50 and a high h index 17 it should be noted that universiti putra malaysia had a very high average citations 50 36 which also reflects great contributions to this field development fig 6 and fig 7 show the distribution and cooperation of countries or regions and institutions respectively with topn algorithm as selection criteria and we highlighted the top ten in citespace as shown in fig 6 the united states india and china have a very large node size which represents the highest contributions to the field also the united states england and germany started earlier than other countries or regions due to the darker color in the central node for the top three countries the betweenness centrality us 0 09 india 0 china 0 and the connection lines between them are almost invisible which indicates the insufficient and passive cooperation in the three countries conversely canada 0 53 germany 0 4 england 0 34 and spain 0 27 show high betweenness centrality albeit low article publications it represents a high level of leadership role in research promotion and cooperation for the institutions although india institute of technology china university of geoscience and national institute of technology published many articles in the field of gv the citation numbers are less than the average citations in the top 10 institutions 12 79 16 90 and 10 38 respectively top10 algorithm selects the articles with top 10 citations within a year and unimportant articles were removed we also manually checked the removed articles and found that some important articles were removed by top10 algorithm for example the united states geological survey made significant contributions in the early stages of this field dark color while other institutions were not involved in this period top10 algorithm still filtered out some important articles prepared by united states geological survey in this period the article numbers calculated by accumulating each country or region 1292 and institution 1892 are greater than real article numbers 949 this is mainly because of the cooperative relationships in different countries and institutions as shown in fig 6 and fig 7 the distribution of networks that connect the nodes can be seen clearly albeit at low density which reflects the cooperation results in various countries and institutions it should be noted that a large number of international agencies such as who paho world health organization pan american health organization unesco ihp united nations educational scientific and cultural organization international hydrological programme igrac international groundwater resources assessment centre iah international association of hydrology un water united nations water and world bank contributed a lot to the gv development they often act as pioneers and leaders facilitating the participation of more countries and institutions in the cooperation of gv research and promoting the gv research development through initial research data sharing report preparation funding support public engagement strategy adjustment as well as sustainable groundwater management for example the initial publications with regards to gvas were prepared by these international agencies e g foster and hirata 1988 foster and skinner 1995 foster 1992 foster et al 2002 and some gv publications e g holding et al 2016 biondiƒá et al 2021 anim gyampo et al 2019 in the literature database are funded and data supported by them igrac is working close with unesco ihp wmo world meteorological organization iah commissions as well as more than 100 partners donors and facilitates the international sharing of world wide availability of relevant groundwater data and knowledge igrac 2022 however the low density network in fig 6 and fig 7 means that the current international and institutional cooperation are not sufficient as one of the leading authorities of groundwater pollution control cherry 2022 in the recent publication reported that the groundwater has not become the central issue of climate change adaptation agricultural management environmental protection and land management in many water management organizations therefore we strongly recommend that the countries and institutions to actively coordinate and support the groundwater programs launched by the international agencies so as to achieve sustainable groundwater management by means of more international cooperation 3 6 citations fig 8 shows the co citation results with top 12 authors selected by g index algorithm fig 8a and top 10 clusters selected by llr algorithm fig 8b some of the highly cited scholars publications have significantly contributed to the development of gv and obtained the widely recognition in the field we summarized the representative publication of each highly cited scholar with regards to gv in table 5 these publications involved fundamental concepts initial models guidebook review groundwater protection strategy and model modification which can be considered as the foundational works on gv development additionally we went through the profiles of these scholars and found that they are affiliated with national or international agencies such as nwwa national water well association iah harc houston advanced research center brgm bureau de recherches g√©ologiques et mini√®res and saskatchewan research council which further represents the contributions of agencies to gv development as shown in fig 8b the cited articles can be clustered into 10 groups which represents the popular topics issues areas or some contents that are closely related to gv in fig 8b statistical method 0 and indexing method 9 are very popular ways to assess gv and normally susceptibility index 8 is the result of indexing method for the further vulnerability mapping and zonation burkart et al 1999 huan et al 2012 machiwal et al 2018 karst 1 is a kind of special landform which is a different system in the gva so many models for evaluating gv in karst areas have been developed such as cop model kavi model and core model daly et al 2002 v√≠as et al 2006 van beynen et al 2012 pavlis and cummins 2014 pesticides 2 are significant pollutants 4 in agricultural regions which significantly impacts the groundwater quality in an area and attracts the attention of many scholars very early banton and villeneuve 1989 villeneuve et al 1990 teso et al 1996 saha and alam 2014 goghat 3 india and yucatan 7 mexico are two typical areas that suffer from severe water scarcity and groundwater pollution respectively much research has been devoted to addressing groundwater issues in goghat das and pal 2020a das and pal 2020b yadav and salui 2021 and yucatan delgado et al 2010 moreno g√≥mez et al 2018 rodr√≠guez et al 2018 monitoring 5 is an important step to determine the level of pollution in an area for gv mapping nistor 2019 and it is the follow up works after the gva particularly in high vulnerability areas mar√≠n et al 2021 yousefi et al 2021 modified galdit 6 is a group of index based methods based on galdit model which have been widely used in the gva with the consideration of seawater intrusion bordbar et al 2019b bordbar et al 2020 pisciotta et al 2022 3 7 keywords 1870 keywords are included in the literature database with the total frequency of 3761 and table 6 summarized the top 15 keywords by the frequency in the literature database groundwater vulnerability drastic and gis have the highest total frequency and some pollution related keywords e g nitrate contamination pollution have a relatively high keyword frequency notably excluding groundwater vulnerability drastic gis drastic model climate change and sensitivity analysis obtained a relatively high annual frequency in keywords which represents the recent popularity of these keywords after looking through the total keyword list some recent keywords also obtained a relatively high annual frequency including land use 1 5 nitrate pollution 1 5 hierarchical fuzzy 2 machine learning 2 hexavalent chromium 2 groundwater resources management 2 longitudinal conductance 2 thematic layer 2 seawater intrusion 1 57 random forest 1 5 and urban expansion 1 5 these present high frequency keywords also indicate the development status of gv research fig 9 a to fig 9d show the keyword co occurrence analysis top100 algorithm and clustering analysis llr algorithm in different periods 1990 2015 and 2016 2021 fig 9e is the keyword clustering analysis results with time slide by top10 algorithm and llr algorithm by comparing the five figures gis drastic and pollution related issues always appeared in different periods whether keyword co occurrence analysis or clustering results which indicates that most gv research used gis as the core analytical tool drastic or modified drastic as the dominant method with the main purpose of groundwater pollution reduction meanwhile nitrate is a major human related pollutant in agricultural areas and land use is a cluster in two periods 9 in fig 9b and 12 in fig 9d which shows that the impacts of human activities on groundwater have always been a concern in gv climate change sensitivity analysis and groundwater quality have been involved in the recent keyword co occurrence fig 9c and climate change has been clustered as a new group in fig 9d 7 and fig 9e 1 that is the issue of climate change as well as corresponding impacts in gv field has rapidly become the popular issue in recent years additionally groundwater management 2 and sustainability 6 are two new clusters in fig 9d which means that some gv research has turned towards sustainable groundwater management rather than just addressing pollution issues at a regional scale 3 8 practical implementations a total of 214 out of 1870 keywords involved the specific models methods and theories of gva with 569 keyword frequency table 7 shows the manually merged gva methods keyword frequency 5 and corresponding typical cases it is found that the drastic and modified drastic methods 283 have absolute dominance which accounts for almost half of the keyword frequency of methods 49 74 the modifications and optimizations of drastic model normally include the replacement and addition of parameters and the revision of weighting systems by means of parameter replacement and addition a large number of new models were proposed on the basis of drastic model in the literature database including dramic wang et al 2007 drastica singh et al 2015 drastic lu kumar and krishna 2020 drastic le liang et al 2019 cad drastic salek et al 2018 drastic p massone et al 2010 drastic draia vaezihir and tabarmayeh 2015 drastic cdhpi haque et al 2018 drastic sg hern√°ndez espri√∫ et al 2014 drasticu safa et al 2020 dracilm he et al 2018 drarch guo et al 2007 dranthvp jia et al 2019b drasticai albuquerque et al 2021 drastic aglu cc persaud and levison 2021 drasli que li et al 2021 drastic pan kazakis and voudouris 2015 drtilsq wu et al 2016 these new models are able to effectively adapt to different site characteristics e g pollution types human activities and groundwater features in gva and obtained more accurate assessment results than basic drastic model an important finding is that land use type is included in the majority of modified drastic models because it is a key factor affecting the transport of pollutant loads and should be fully considered in groundwater resources management tasdighi et al 2017 the replacement and addition of parameters also occurred in the modification and optimization of other index based methods such as the sintacs galdit and cop but their numbers were less than drastic model analytic hierarchy process ahp 38 fuzzy theory 37 entropy based model 10 and multi criteria analysis 10 are frequently used methods for the revision of weighting systems on the basis of drastic model or other index based methods also some machine learning algorithms such as neural network 7 logistic regression 6 support vector machine and random forest can also be used for weight revisions e g elzain et al 2021 barzegar et al 2018 nadiri et al 2019 generally these methods are able to significantly improve the model performance by subjectively or objectively revising the weights of parameters arezoomand omidi langrudi et al 2016 hu et al 2018 yu et al 2012 however the use of ahp and fuzzy theory are significantly more than others for weight revisions and the methods with machine learning algorithms have not been widely implemented in gvas machiwal et al 2018 as shown in table 7 the numbers of index based methods are significantly greater than process based methods and statistical methods this is mainly because of the early development simple calculation and satisfactory compatibility with gis platforms of index based methods machiwal et al 2018 however the statistical and process based methods are few in table 7 and even transport modelling is the only process based method type with 12 keyword frequency according to machiwal et al 2018 and taghavi et al 2022 the applications of statistical techniques e g artificial intelligence regression techniques in gv have been mainly limited to the difficulty in model interpretation model selection as well as accredited rules in optimization and the development of process based methods is presently facing many limitations including extensive field data acquisition software compatibility and the size of the study area 3 9 research frontiers in this section we identified the four research frontiers in the field of gv including model development modification and optimization climate change impacts human activity impacts and sustainable groundwater management 3 9 1 model development modification and optimization as table 6 and table 7 show the index based methods are the dominant and mainstream methods in gva in the past decades while the development of process based and statistical methods are both limited to a certain extent but in fact the two types of methods have great potential in gva and enable effectively make up for the weaknesses of index based methods therefore it should be a research frontier to develop more process based and statistical methods in the future as well as related techniques such as data acquisition software updates and algorithm optimization meanwhile after looking through the recent articles in the literature database it is a trend that the index based models have been continuously modified and optimized by parameter replacement busico et al 2017 jia et al 2019b and incorporating with ahp hu et al 2018 qiu et al 2021 variable weight theory qiang et al 2016 fuzzy set theory iqbal et al 2015 sresto et al 2021 entropy theory wei et al 2021b wang et al 2020 as well las machine learning and deep learning algorithm torkashvand et al 2021a bordbar et al 2020 wei et al 2021a norouzi et al 2021 it is also a research frontier to achieve a more accurate gv prediction by modifying and optimizing the existing models 3 9 2 climate change impacts climate change is a significant keyword with a 2 56 annual keyword frequency and was clustered in a new group in fig 9d and fig 9e presently many scholars are trying to analyze the climate impacts on gv by incorporating climate prediction models into the classical gv models for example huang et al 2017 predicted the future net recharge change under climate change and replaced the net recharge r in drastic model in china luoma et al 2017 combined the changes of recharge and sea level rise on groundwater in sintacs and galdit methods by an overlay function seeboonruang 2016 used an overlay technique by incorporating drastic model project precipitation and drought degree to assess the climate change impacts on gv to drought nistor 2020 simulated the future water availability by precipitation and temperature in the whole of europe and constructed a model of nistor gwv index to integrate the intrinsic vulnerability and climate changes today when climate change has become a global concern its impacts on gv should be a research frontier that deserves public attention and it is still a very complicated and challenging issue with insufficient research at this stage machiwal et al 2018 aslam et al 2018 3 9 3 human activity impacts many important keywords and cluster results can be explained by human activity impacts such as land use urban expansion nitrate denitrification hexavalent chromium arsenic and groundwater pollution contamination current scholars normally utilized the human related indicators such as land use land cover urbanization index and exploitation rate refer to the intensity of human activities e g berhe zenebe et al 2020 jesiya and gopinath 2019 singh et al 2015 liang et al 2019 however human activity intensity is a complex and dynamic variable that is difficult to quantify particularly in developing countries al hanbali and kondoh 2008 which means the many index based methods and statistical methods are not suitable for assessing the impacts of human activities meanwhile the intensive human activities such as groundwater extraction urban expansion and agricultural irrigation will continue for many years which may also constantly threaten the quality and quantity of groundwater therefore it is also a research frontier to conduct gva by consideration of human activities 3 9 4 sustainable groundwater management sustainable groundwater management is the ultimate objective of gva saidi et al 2011 collin and melloul 2003 and gva has been proven to play a significant role in achieving sustainable groundwater management in practice in the recent keyword clustering analysis groundwater management 2 and sustainability 6 have become the new clusters fig 9d which represents a trend of transformation from regional pollution reduction towards sustainable groundwater management for gv research given that foster et al 2013 reported that gva is the first step to identify the approximate areas for further hydrogeological investigation and groundwater management strategy improvement there is still a long way to go in sustainable groundwater management under the framework of un sdgs therefore how to efficiently achieve sustainable groundwater management will be a frontier issue in the next few years for groundwater managers 3 10 insights challenges and suggestions 3 10 1 unequal research development unequal research development refers to the area with higher abstraction or contamination but low research articles with regards to gv although the past 30 years witnessed the rapid development of gv all over the world there is a significant unequal gv research development with different indicators including groundwater abstraction and groundwater quality fig 10 fig 10a shows the gv research distributions in the literature database and fig 10b to fig 10f show the distribution of abstraction as a percentage of mean annual recharge nitrate concentration salinization areas arsenic contamination and fluoride contamination respectively by comparing the differences of fig 10a and other five figures the unequal research development areas and specific countries can be highlighted by dashed lines in fig 10 and summarized in table 8 which represent the main suggesting study areas for the future gv research it is found that some countries appeared multiple times in different indicators including argentina libya algeria azerbaijan oman iraq niger and turkmenistan therefore we strongly suggest that these countries or regions particularly in the countries that facing different aspects of groundwater stresses and risks should make more efforts on the development of gv research on a global scale the groundwater conditions in these countries should receive international attentions and assistance by this way the unequal gv research development on the global scale can be further eliminated 3 10 2 insufficient cooperation the co occurrence analysis of countries or regions authors and institutions are shown in the aforementioned sections it is found that the connections between the nodes are few particularly in the authorships and institutions fig 5 and fig 7 in the two figures the authors and institutions with major contributions are almost distributed dispersedly with almost invisible betweenness centrality for countries regions the connections between nodes are also insufficient fig 6 and high betweenness centrality countries are canada germany england and spain instead of top countries usa china and india these findings reflect a lack of cooperation in gv research including countries institutions and authors international cooperation assistance and communication are important approaches to promote the development of a field especially under the framework of the global sdgs therefore we strongly suggest strengthening the international cooperation and communication to promote the global development of the field by different ways e g policy adjustment strategy improvement technology support and education program as well as encouraging more countries and institutions participating in the international groundwater programs launched by international agencies so as to achieve the sustainable groundwater management in today s increasingly serious groundwater issues 3 10 3 response to climate change and human activities according to taylor et al 2013 and unesco 2022 climate change directly impacts the earth s water balance by precipitation extremes evapotranspiration increase floods droughts sea level rise and meltwater regimes and further influences the global freshwater quantity quality supply demand and management for example the intensive pumped abstraction in groundwater fed irrigation areas e g northwest india and north china plains may be highly threatened by the recharge reduction caused by climate change glazer and likens 2012 aslam et al 2018 pointed out the influence of climate change on groundwater is very significant but very few studies considered it in gv research currently there is still a large research gap in gv studies that take into account climate change machiwal et al 2018 an alternative solution is to integrate the climate change models into gva for dynamic vulnerability prediction as the pioneering articles shown in the section 3 8 2 but limited by data availability coarse spatial scale and the capture of some physical processes e g el ni√±o holding et al 2016 therefore with the increasing impact of climate change on the water environment we suggest 1 researchers are supposed to take climate change impacts into account in gva and integrate them in models more rationally 2 it is necessary to learn the lessons from other fields with regards to addressing climate change issues meanwhile as shown in section 3 8 3 although some scholars have utilized a series of indexes to refer to the intensity of human activities assessing human activity impacts on gv is also a challenge because these impacts are very complex and time dependent presently there is currently a lack of frameworks and recognized models for assessing gv with the consideration of dynamic human impacts therefore it is also suggested using complex parameters and more appropriate weighting systems to simulate the process of human activities currently many parameters have been identified by scholars to represent human activities including land use land cover kumar and krishna 2020 jesiya and gopinath 2019 urbanization index singh et al 2015 density of population vaezihir and tabarmayeh 2015 abstraction index ojeda olivares et al 2020 exploitation rate li and hou 2020 and social marginalization level ojeda olivares et al 2020 in gva these studies are good attempts to simulate human activities in gva herein we provide two typical examples in response to dynamic human activities in gva jia et al 2019b applied a projection pursuit dynamic clustering ppdc model to determine the weights of parameters and replaced the parameters of drastic with human activity factors e g groundwater velocity nitrate attenuation intensity and pollutant input intensity for more accurate assessment results ojeda olivares et al 2020 used the abstraction index the pollution index and the social marginalization level as the parameters and ahp weighting system to address the impacts of dynamic human activities in gva 3 10 4 sdgs in groundwater management sustainable groundwater management is an ultimate goal of gvas on a global scale and has become the new clusters in recent keyword analysis fig 9d more than 50 specific targets in sdgs have been interlinked to groundwater particularly in sdg 6 sdg 12 and sdg 13 undp 2022 these goals not only focus on the water related properties such as water quantity and quality but also involve many economic social and environmental targets for example in sdg 6 clean water and sanitation it not only involved the water aspects such as pollution reduction and water use efficiency but also mentioned equity health safety international cooperation water use policy and technical support however current articles related to gv mainly focused on the water itself and rarely mentioned other aspects of the sdgs in fact gva is only a preliminary stage of sustainable groundwater management not a final word foster et al 2013 based on gv mapping and zonation there are many subsequent works in groundwater management to achieve the sdgs including but not limited to detailed hydrological surveys reasonable land planning appropriate and equitable water allocation and use water pollution control and monitoring health risk assessment etc given that there is a considerable research gap between gvas and sdgs in groundwater management we propose to integrate gv more closely with the sdgs to show how groundwater sustainability can be more effectively achieved in future research 4 limitations this study adopted a recognized methodology of bibliometric analysis and provided reliable outputs like previous studies e g giupponi and biscaro 2015 shi et al 2019 zyoud and fuchs hanusch 2017 however some limitations are still included in this research first it is very difficult to consider all the important related publications in gv but it is a common limitation in bibliometric analysis for all the filed on the one hand although selecting article as the publication type is a commonly used method in bibliometric analysis it may ignore some important publications from technical notes letters project reports conference proceedings and dissertations at this stage these grey publications have not been well compatible with bibliometric software and manual database construction cannot ensure the quality of publications currently considering article as the only publication type is a relative effective way to remove low quality publications in bibliometric analysis on the other hand although some data cleaning methods and algorithms have been used for the literature database construction and important article selection it is difficult to ensure all the important articles are included in the literature database second the ambiguity in keyword identification can affect the results of bibliometric analysis this study involved a manual cleaning to make sure the correct combinations with duplicate entries but cannot ensure all the entries are processed by manual check for example the indian institute of technology which has published extensively in the field of gv has been recorded as a single institution by manual consolidation however these authors may have come from different campuses but recorded ambiguously in woscc platform meanwhile as the limitations of the options available at the time of journal submission and the shortcomings of citespace in running modules some related disciplines may appear separately in fragmented forms with almost identical names which would also require considerable time to do additional de duplication or merging we also manually merged the similar related disciplines but cannot ensure all the entries were checked despite all the limitations this study provides a holistic and representative picture of gv research productivity on a global scale 5 conclusion this study presents a bibliometric analysis with regards to gv by selecting 949 articles in the woscc database the unique aspect of this review is the consideration of gv development by a statistical approach eliminating the subjectivity and personal preference of conventional literature review nine aspects including trends related disciplines journals author productivity countries or regions institutions citations keywords and practical implementations were visualized and analyzed by citespace 5 8 r3 microsoft s excel and tableau which intuitively indicates the development process of gv research in the past and present the development of gva in the last decades showed significant growth in articles citations inter disciplines and new keywords and a large number of countries or regions global scholars institutions and international agencies participated in the contributions of gv research development the significant growth can be interpreted as a response to the groundwater quantity and quality threats the supports of technology development e g rs gis and icts and the development of inter disciplines also the international agencies such as who paho unesco ihp igrac iah un water and world bank contributed a lot to the gv development by means of initial research data sharing report preparation funding support public engagement strategy adjustment as well as sustainable groundwater management the index based methods especially for drastic and modified drastic are the dominant and mainstream methods in the practical implementation of gva over the past few years the drastic model has been modified and optimized in the vast literature by replacing parameters and revising parameter weights which resulted in the appearance of many new models and weighting methods land use type is included in the majority of modified drastic models because it is a key factor affecting the transport of pollutant loads and should be fully considered in groundwater resources management however the development of both process based and statistical methods is limited to a certain extent the process based methods are presently facing many limitations including extensive field data acquisition software compatibility and the size of the study area and the statistical methods are mainly limited by the difficulty in model interpretation model selection as well as accredited rules in optimization today model development modification and optimization are the research frontiers in gv research and the process based and statistical methods have great potential in gva the two types of methods may effectively make up for the weaknesses of index based methods in the future climate change and human activity impacts are not only research frontiers but also challenges for gv research although some articles have made great contributions to the climate change and human activity impacts on gv these impacts are very complex and dynamic with considerable research gaps for these issues this review suggests integrating the indicators of climate change and human activity impacts into gva by a more reasonable way and exploring the lessons about how other fields address the impacts of climate change and human activity impacts additionally gv is also facing the challenges of unequal research development and insufficient cooperation some countries including argentina libya algeria azerbaijan oman iraq niger and turkmenistan even suffered from different aspects of groundwater stresses and risks these countries should make more efforts on the development of gv research and are supposed to receive more international attentions and assistance in fact international cooperation assistance and communication are important approaches to promote the development of a field especially under the framework of the global sdgs it is also suggested that the international cooperation and communication should be encouraged to promote the global development of gv by different ways e g policy adjustment strategy improvement technology support and education program gva has been proven to play a significant role in achieving sustainable groundwater management in practice however current articles related to gv mainly focused on the water itself and rarely mentioned other aspects of the sdgs it should be noted that gva is the first step for sustainable groundwater management instead of final word the following works involving detailed hydrogeological investigation groundwater management strategy improvement as well as economic social and environmental targets under the sdg framework are required a large number of efforts and investments therefore we propose to integrate gv more closely with the sdgs to show how groundwater sustainability can be more effectively achieved in future research although we presently have some years to achieve the sustainable groundwater management by 2030 the challenges and follow up tasks should be immediately become the focus of different countries and be effectively completed in a well organized cooperating and sustainable way declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper
