2605,water temperature is a fundamental property of river habitats and aquatic ecosystems in some cases assessing water temperature changes is restrained by the availability of historical observation this study proposed a framework to address the water temperature data scarcity in thermal regime assessment by incorporating the long short term memory lstm network and the time series technologies the factors affecting water temperature included air temperature evaporation and streamflow driven by the historical observation of these factors the lstm network produced long term water temperature series the time series technologies unraveled the temporal dynamics of the reconstructed water temperature the trend periodicity and complexity were investigated using linear regression trend free pre whitening mann kendall test sen s slope wavelet transform and moving sample entropy the framework was applied in the dongting lake basin china which drains four tributaries xiangjiang zishui yuanjiang and lishui rivers the lstm network reconstructed the monthly water temperature series from 1960 to 2020 which was good surrogate data for thermal regime evaluation the annual water temperature of the four tributaries increased significantly with an average warming rate of 0 15 per decade heterogeneity of tendency and changing rates existed across sub basins and months and the warming water temperature dominated the variation a significant oscillation of a one year period across six decades was identified in the dongting lake basin the water temperature complexity decreased significantly in the xiangjiang zishui and yuanjiang rivers while it increased significantly in the lishui river the case study indicated that the framework was practicable and flexible with explicit structure it could be applied in other basins to address water temperature data scarcity and support the comprehensive riverine thermal regime assessment keywords riverine thermal regime framework deep learning

affecting water quality biogeochemistry metabolism and aquatic organisms and ecosystems bonacina et al 2022 the riverine thermal regime alterations can have essential effects on biological communities and the overall health of ecosystems tao et al 2021 aquatic organisms usually have a specific range of temperatures to survive and variations in the river water temperature directly affect their growth rates behavior and distributions caissie 2006 in a changing climate typically characterized by a warming trend in air temperature river water temperature increases due to heat exchange with the atmosphere kedra and wiejaczka 2018 there is compelling evidence that river water temperature is increasing globally under climate change which is exacerbated by increased abstractions to satisfy human water requirements ouellet et al 2020 given that the anomalies in riverine thermal regimes may have significant consequences for the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems the foremost step is to unravel the long term temporal dynamics of river water temperature chen et al 2016 investigating the characteristics of water temperature changes is the premise of evaluating the environmental and ecological effects of thermal regime alterations understanding the long term thermal dynamics in terms of trend periodicity and complexity is vital to developing new environmental management and ecological protection strategies with an adaptation to climate change in an anthropogenic driven era bonacina et al 2022 extensive efforts have investigated the river water temperature

rehana and mujumdar 2011 wagner et al 2017 these studies employed long term water temperature measurements which provided an essential foundation for riverine thermal regime assessment for example little evidence of seasonal changes was suggested in the river water temperatures of the basins in the eastern us while more evidence of warming for river sites in the western us particularly during the fall and winter seasons was found wagner et al 2017 historical evidence suggested that the uk river water temperature increased in the latter part of the 20th century hannah and garner 2015 in the yongan watershed in eastern china over the 1980 2012 period river water temperature increased between 0 29 and 0 46 10a partially due to the 0 50 10a increase in air temperature chen et al 2016 observed water temperature data have been used in previous studies to shed light on the variations in river water temperature however knowledge gaps still exist in understanding how river water temperature changes in those basins where the water temperature measurement just started in recent years and long term historical observation was lacking although continuous and regular water temperature monitoring is essential for assessing riverine thermal alterations these data are rarely available in many basins pohle et al 2019 water temperature models prove a helpful tool for reconstructing river water temperature over a long period thereby providing valuable information to assess thermal regime alterations deweber and wagner 2014 water temperature models are generally classified into physically based deterministic and stochastically data driven models deterministic models employ an energy budget approach to predict river water temperature whereas stochastical models typically rely on air to water temperature relationships caissie 2006 deterministic models are generally based on the heat exchange dynamics between the water body and the surrounding environments they require a myriad of inputs including fluvial topography a complete set of meteorological variables and the hydraulic properties of the river piccolroaz et al 2016 due to the intrinsic complexity of heat equations that require a lot of data inputs the deterministic models applicability in the case of data scarcity is limited tao et al 2021 flexible statistical models particularly artificial intelligence algorithms are promising alternatives qiu et al 2020 zhu and piotrowski 2020 deep learning a new generation of artificial neural network research is especially suited for information extraction from sequential data it serves functionalities to build models with more accurate simulation far greater processing capability and reduced requirements for human involvement and expertise shen 2018 long short term memory lstm network is a type of deep machine learning method previous studies have demonstrated that the lstm network has a satisfying potential to simulate river water temperature and quantify temporal oscillations in thermal regimes induced by climate change and anthropogenic activities feigl et al 2021 qiu et al 2021 considering the abundance of hydrometeorological data and recent developments in artificial intelligence deep learning this study proposed a framework to help bridge the knowledge gap for assessing riverine thermal alterations in water temperature data scarce basins the proposed framework employs the lstm network to reconstruct and extend the river water temperature series and examines the long term dynamics in terms of trend periodicity and complexity the framework was applied in the dongting lake basin a sub basin of the yangtze river basin in china the dongting lake basin was a representative basin where water temperature monitoring was initiated recently and lacked historical observation data resulting in knowledge gaps in the long term dynamics of riverine thermal regimes the water temperature was monitored from 2007 to 2020 lacking long term records for evaluating thermal variations the streamflow and meteorological observation continued from 1960 to 2020 providing the inputs for the lstm network to extend the water temperature series this case study illustrated the framework s execution processes and practicality and provided implications for other basins suffering from data scarcity for local interests this application s results provided vital information for managers and policymakers to systematically assess the riverine thermal regime alteration and develop strategies to deal with this change in the dongting lake basin for worldwide interests the framework proposed by this study provided the basins lacking historical water temperature observations with an effective tool for water temperature reconstruction and assessment which is a vital component of fishery management and watershed preservation policy initiatives 2 case study site and data 2 1 study area yangtze river is the longest river in china and the third longest river in the world it originates in the qinghai tibet plateau and flows 6300 km into the east china sea draining an area of 1 8 million km2 fig 1 a the basin lies in the monsoon region of east asia s subtropical zone and has mean annual precipitation of 1090 mm jiang et al 2006 generally spring lasts from march to may summer lasts from june to august autumn lasts from september to november and winter lasts from december to february the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river have thousands of freshwater lakes among them poyang lake and dongting lake are the two largest lakes and have excellent value for socio economic development and environmental conservation dongting lake is the second largest freshwater lake in china and is located on the south bank of the middle yangtze river fig 1b four large tributaries feed dongting lake namely xiangjiang river zishui river yuanjiang river and lishui river the published literature has provided a detailed introduction to the geography meteorology hydrology and ecology of the yangtze river basin and its dongting lake sub basin liang et al 2021 yang et al 2020 yu et al 2018 zhao et al 2017 2 2 hydrological and meteorological data monthly averaged water temperature and streamflow m3 s data were collected from four hydrometric stations xiangtan taojiang taoyuan and shimen these hydrometric stations are located at the lower reaches of the tributaries discharging into dongting lake fig 1b xiangtan taojiang taoyuan and shimen stations monitor the streamflow processes of xiangjiang zishui yuanjiang and lishui rivers respectively monthly average water temperature data spanned from 2007 to 2020 and monthly average streamflow data spanned from 1960 to 2020 the hydrological data were provided by the changjiang water resources commission and the hydrological bureau of hunan province they have checked and firmly controlled the homogeneity and reliability of the hydrological data monthly mean air temperature and monthly accumulated evaporation mm data were obtained from twenty meteorological stations scattered over the dongting lake basin fig 1b these data were provided by the china meteorological data service centre https data cma cn en the meteorological records spanned from 1960 to 2020 covering sixty one years each sub basin s spatial mean air temperature and evaporation values were calculated by averaging the available data from meteorological stations in xiangjiang zishui yuanjiang and lishui river basins 3 methods 3 1 methodological framework fig 2 illustrates the methodological framework used to simulate the long term water temperature and investigate its variations data collection and pre processing e g air temperature evaporation streamflow and water temperature provide the information basis for constructing the water temperature model extending the water temperature series and evaluating the thermal alterations the original datasets are standardized and segmented for model construction and water temperature simulation lstm network is suggested to reconstruct long term water temperature from its affecting factors e g air temperature evaporation and streamflow over the same period as river water temperature data are available the linkage between water temperature and its affecting factors is depicted using the lstm network the lstm network can be constructed optimized trained and tested using keras a deep learning application programming interface written in python running on the machine learning platform tensorflow https keras io the validated water temperature model driven by the long term observed hydrometeorological data i e air temperature evaporation and streamflow produces long term water temperature investigating the trend periodicity and complexity of the reconstructed water temperature series helps in understanding the temporal dynamics of the riverine thermal regimes 3 2 lstm model for modeling river water temperature lstm network is a special kind of recurrent neural network the unit of which is composed of a cell an input gate an output gate and a forget gate hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 the lstm architecture consists of a set of recurrently connected sub networks known as memory blocks these blocks maintain their states over time and regulate the information flow the output of the block is recurrently connected back to the block input and all of the gates van houdt et al 2020 one reason for the lstm network s success lies in its ability to handle the exploding and vanishing gradient problem which stands as a difficult issue to be circumvented when training recurrent or very deep neural networks van houdt et al 2020 previous studies have proved the practicability and effectiveness of the lstm network to simulate sea river and lake surface water temperatures kim et al 2020 qiu et al 2021 rahmani et al 2021 read et al 2019 given the satisfying performance of the lstm network with a simple structure an lstm network encompassing an input layer two lstm layers one fully connected layer and an output layer was used to model the river water temperature in the dongting lake basin the lstm formulation for modeling the river water temperature with a monthly scale is expressed by 1 t w t f t a t e t q t where t w t is the river water temperature at the current month t unit t a t is the spatially averaged air temperature of a sub basin at the current month t unit e t is the spatially averaged evaporation of a sub basin at the current month t unit mm and q t is the tributary streamflow at the current month t unit m3 s all computations were conducted using python 3 8 10 software the keras running on tensorflow was used to program the lstm network the input layer received air temperature evaporation and streamflow it transferred the inputting information to the lstm and fully connected layers for processing and the output layer produced the water temperature simulation results the lstm layers used the hyperbolic tangent function as the activation function and the fully connected layer used the linear function as the activation function the key to the lstm network is the hidden neurons in the lstm layer called memory cells which receive information from the input layer and perceive the information at the previous moment the number of hidden neurons was set using the keras tuner function suggesting 30 memory cells for each lstm layer to model water temperature the adaptive moment estimation was used to optimize the network during the learning process and the early stopping method was applied to prevent over fitting when constructing the water temperature models for the xiangjiang zishui yuanjiang and lishui rivers the observed data from 2011 to 2020 were used to train the lstm networks the observed data from 2007 to 2010 were used to test the models because the differences in absolute values of air temperature evaporation streamflow and water temperature negatively affect the model s learning ability the hydrological and meteorological data were standardized using the z score method the model performance was evaluated using root mean square error rmse correlation coefficient r and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse which are commonly used performance evaluators huang et al 2021a huang et al 2021b qiu et al 2021 given air temperature evaporation and streamflow data spanned from 1960 to 2020 water temperature data were reconstructed from 1960 to 2020 using the validated lstm network 3 3 trend periodicity and complexity analysis 3 3 1 trend detection the trend embedded in the water temperature series was identified by the linear regression analysis combined with the trend free pre whitening mann kendall tfpw mk and sen s slope algorithms linear regression analysis illustrated the trend and the tfpw mk test ascertained whether the variation was significant sen s slope s quantified the magnitude of increasing or decreasing tendency in the water temperature series the tfpw mk test addresses serial autocorrelation issues by detrending the series before pre whitening and provides a more accurate assessment of the trend s significance the diagram of the tfpw mk test is illustrated in fig 3 yue et al 2002b the published literature provided detailed information on the algorithms of the tfpw mk test and sen s slope sen 1968 yue et al 2002a yue et al 2002b the python package pymannkendall https pypi org project pymannkendall supported trend detection and the significance level p was set as 0 05 hussain and mahmud 2019 3 3 2 periodicity identification the periodicity embedded in the water temperature series was analyzed using wavelet transform a standard tool for detecting localized power variations within a time series torrence and compo 1998 wavelet transform uses generalized local base functions named wavelets that can be stretched and translated with a flexible resolution in frequency and time the flexible windows are adaptive to the entire time frequency domain known as the wavelet domain which narrows while focusing on high frequency signals and widens while searching the low frequency background lau and weng 1995 the wavelet analysis results interpret the dominant modes of variability and how those modes vary in time the diagram of the wavelet transform is illustrated in fig 4 and a detailed introduction to the algorithms can be found in the literature lau and weng 1995 torrence and compo 1998 the wavelet analysis was conducted using the python package pycwt https pypi org project pycwt the complex morlet wavelet method was used because of its reliability in detecting signal periodicity liang et al 2013 detrending is necessary to remove the impact of tendency on periodicity detection the detrending was performed by fitting a one degree polynomial function and subtracting it from the original series before the wavelet analysis the detrended water temperature series was standardized using the z score method 3 3 3 complexity investigation water temperature complexity analyzed in this study could be defined as the degree of uncertainty or the rate of information production of water temperature series sivakumar and singh 2012 in light of the sample entropy s effectiveness and reliability it was used to quantify the water temperature complexity huang et al 2021b the sample entropy was an unbiased estimator of the conditional probability that two similar sequences of m consecutive data points m was the template length would remain similar when one more consecutive point was included a detailed description of the sample entropy algorithms can be found in the literature huang et al 2011 wu et al 2013 the moving sample entropy was calculated to unravel how the water temperature complexity changed over six decades a ten year long window moved with a one year step divided the 1960 2020 series into fifty two subseries 1960 1969 1961 1970 1962 1971 2009 2018 2010 2019 and 2011 2020 calculating sample entropy for each subseries produced a sample entropy series covering 1960 to 2011 the linear regression and tfpw mk test were employed to identify the trend in the sample entropy series the computation of water temperature complexity used python programming when calculating sample entropy previous studies have suggested setting the template length at m 2 and the tolerance criterion at r 0 15 δ where δ denotes the standard deviation of the original water temperature series li and zhang 2008 wu et al 2013 4 results and discussion 4 1 long term river water temperature simulation fig 5 illustrates the performance of the lstm network to simulate the river water temperature in the dongting lake basin during the model training and testing the scatters of water temperature were distributed alongside the 1 1 line the simulated water temperature matched well with the observed one with satisfactory goodness of fit statistics of the lstm model performance table 1 for training the model the evaluator rmse ranged from 1 56 to 1 81 with a mean value of 1 64 the evaluator r ranged from 0 96 to 0 98 with a mean value of 0 97 and the evaluator nse ranged from 0 92 to 0 95 with a mean value of 0 94 for testing the model the evaluator rmse ranged from 1 21 to 2 35 with a mean value of 1 51 the evaluator r ranged from 0 95 to 0 99 with a mean value of 0 97 and the evaluator nse ranged from 0 90 to 0 98 with a mean value of 0 95 the goodness of fit statistics suggested that the lstm network adequately simulated the river water temperature and could be applied to reconstruct long term water temperature series the validated lstm network driven by the long term observed air temperature evaporation and streamflow resulted in long term monthly water temperature covering january 1960 to december 2020 fig 6 the monthly mean variation in water temperature was dominated by the sinusoidal seasonal pattern in which maximum temperatures occur over the summer months and minimum over the winter months annual mean water temperature series were calculated and each month s water temperature series were extracted for the following trend analysis 4 2 temporal dynamics of annual and monthly river water temperature linear regression illustrated prominent increasing trends in the annual averaging water temperatures in the dongting lake basin fig 7 the river water temperature fluctuated and increased gradually over six decades the tfpw mk test confirmed that these warming trends of river water temperature were statistically significant the warming rate of annual mean water temperature in the xiangjiang river zishui river yuanjiang river and lishui river was 0 16 0 10 0 16 and 0 18 per decade respectively they resulted in an average warming rate of 0 15 per decade the results were in line with the previous findings and added a piece of case evidence supporting the idea that river water temperature was increasing globally under climate change ouellet et al 2020 the monthly mean water temperature in the xiangjiang river experienced different variations from 1960 to 2020 fig 8 linear regression and sen s slope analysis indicated a decreasing water temperature trend in july however the tfpw mk test rejected the significance of this decreasing trend in other months except for july the water temperatures increased with various sen s slops ranging from 0 01 to 0 37 per decade the tfpw mk test identified significant warming water temperatures in the winter month of february and the spring month of april in april the water temperature s warming rate reached 0 37 per decade the highest value compared with the warming rates in other months in february the water temperature s warming rate was 0 30 per decade therefore the rising annual mean water temperature in the xiangjiang river might be partially attributed to february and april s significantly increased water temperature the long term reconstructed data suggested different temporal dynamics of monthly mean water temperature in the zishui river fig 9 in january and july the water temperature dropped slightly with a decreasing rate of 0 02 and 0 16 per decade respectively however these decreasing trends had not passed the tfpw mk test yet in other months except for january and july the water temperatures increased the water temperature warming rates ranged from 0 03 to 0 33 per decade with a mean value of 0 14 per decade the increasing water temperature trends in the two spring months of march and april were significant as confirmed by the tfpw mk test the substantial increase in water temperature in these two months contributed to the substantial increase in the annual mean water temperature of the zishui river the monthly water temperature variations in the yuanjiang river were dominated by the increasing tendency in the past six decades indicated by the linear regression and sen s slope analysis fig 10 a slight and insignificant decreasing trend was detected in only one month july the water temperatures in other months increased and the warming rates ranged from 0 07 to 0 36 per decade with a mean value of 0 18 per decade as suggested by the tfpw mk test the increasing water temperature trends in the two spring months of march and april and the two autumn months of october and november were significant accounting for the substantial increase in the annual mean water temperature of the yuanjiang river in the lishui river the reconstructed monthly data suggested a dominantly rising water temperature from 1960 to 2020 with a minimum warming rate of 0 11 per decade and a maximum warming rate of 0 33 per decade fig 11 the tfpw mk test detected significant increasing trends in the water temperatures for january february march april may september and december in these seven months the average warming rate of water temperature reached 0 22 per decade contributing to the noticeable increase in the annual mean water temperature of the lishui river the water temperature variations in the remaining months i e june july august october and november were not significant confirmed by the tfpw mk test these results suggested spatial and temporal heterogeneity in river water temperature variations consistent with the findings from other regions wagner et al 2017 although a common characteristic was the warming water temperature as a more pronounced variation the changing rates of water temperature varied across the four tributaries in the dongting lake basin except for the heterogeneity across sub basins heterogeneity of tendency and changing rates existed across months some negative sen s slope values indicated the cooling water temperature but the tfpw mk test rejected their significance a homogeneity in water temperature variations was the significantly warming water temperature in the spring month of april in the four tributaries although the warming rates differed the results were inconsistent with the seasonal water temperature changes for river sites in the western us where the water temperature notably increased during the fall and winter seasons wagner et al 2017 the seasonal variations also differed from those in fifty two catchments in switzerland where water temperature has significantly increased over the past five decades with positive trends for all four seasons michel et al 2020 4 3 periods embedded in monthly river water temperature series given the well defined trends in the river water temperature series of the dongting lake basin the long term reconstructed data were detrended and then analyzed using the wavelet transform method resulting in the wavelet power spectrums fig 12 in fig 12 cross hatched regions on either end indicated the cone of influence where edge effects became important higher wavelet power at a time scale implied more robust oscillations at the corresponding time scale and vice versa a high wavelet power was identified at the one year time scale and this high power spectrum continued through the six decades the thick dashed red contour enclosed less than 0 05 significance level regions indicating the significant one year period embedded in the monthly mean water temperature series the river water temperature had pronounced seasonal components with low water temperature occurring in winter when the air temperature reached a minimum and high water temperature occurring in summer fig 6 this intrinsic intra annual fluctuation induced a significant one year period as identified by the wavelet transform except for the prominent one year period the wavelet transform did not suggest strong power at greater time scales there was no indication of a significant period other than one year despite the considerable inter annual variation of the monthly water temperature series 4 4 complexity changes of monthly river water temperature series fig 13 displays the temporal evolution of water temperature complexity quantified using sample entropy a higher sample entropy value indicates more complexity in water temperature series characterized by disorderliness randomness and irregularity in contrast a lower sample entropy value indicates more orderliness regularity and self similarity linear regression and sen s slopes suggested declined sample entropies of water temperatures in the xiangjiang river zishui river and yuanjiang river the tfpw mk test identified the significance of these decreasing trends there was a significant increasing trend in the sample entropy of water temperature in the lishui river as confirmed by the tfpw mk test the river water temperature complexity in the dongting lake basin experienced inter annual variations from 1960 to 2020 significantly lowered water temperature complexity was detected in the xiangjiang zishui and yuanjiang rivers while significantly enhanced water temperature complexity was suggested in the lishui river 4 5 advantages limitations and future research water temperature is a vital attribute of riverine habitat and assessing its alterations is one of the focal objectives of river engineering and management this study proposed a framework to address the limitation of data scarcity in comprehensively evaluating riverine thermal regime alterations the framework incorporated the lstm network to simulate and extend the water temperature series and the time series analysis technologies to reveal the temporal dynamics of the thermal regime the framework s application in the dongting lake basin verified its practicality and suggested its potential in other basins given the development and prosperity of artificial intelligence other deep learning technologies except for the lstm network can also be employed to construct the water temperature models when applying the proposed framework in other basins these machine learning algorithms include but are not limited to a random forest extreme gradient boosting feed forward neural networks and wavelet neural networks abdi et al 2021 feigl et al 2021 piotrowski et al 2015 based on a basin s physiographic characteristics and data availability model inputs to be considered can include air temperature precipitation evaporation global radiation streamflow landform attributes and land cover attributes to mention a few deweber and wagner 2014 feigl et al 2021 the research objective and the time scale of available data determine the time scale of model output e g hourly daily monthly and annual simulations it is worth noting that more complex and advanced models do not necessarily outperform simple and popular neural networks the performance significance and choice of models should be verified piotrowski et al 2015 the parameterized and validated water temperature model produces long term water temperature data an essential supplement to the missing historical data the reconstructed data provide a critical basis for assessing thermal regime alterations regarding trend periodicity and complexity and exploring the driving mechanisms behind the thermal regime alterations river water temperature is a product of multiple environmental factors and is also impacted by anthropogenic perturbations such as thermal pollution and deforestation caissie 2006 tao et al 2020 the present study was limited in not incorporating anthropogenic factors into water temperature simulation and failed to distinguish the impact of climate change and human activities on water temperature variations the lstm network was trained and tested using the parallel water temperature data and its driving factors the lstm network s data requirement restrained the framework s applicability in the basins where the water temperature data are unavailable as essentially a black box model the lstm network could not explain the physical mechanisms behind the water temperature evolution future efforts will improve water temperature simulation identify riverine thermal regime alterations and analyze causative mechanisms changes in river water temperature are anticipated to affect thermal habitat and fish population directly for example in the fraser river basin of british columbia the increase in average summer water temperature has doubled the number of days exceeding 20 the water temperature that if exceeded potentially increases the physiological stress of salmon during migration islam et al 2019 5 conclusions the proposed framework for reconstructing and investigating long term water temperature data was practical in addressing the issue of observed data scarcity for riverine thermal assessment the incorporation of the lstm network and the trend periodicity and complexity algorithms resulted in an explicit framework structure whose components could be flexibly substituted by other algorithms of machine learning and time series analysis the framework structure was clear and its performance was satisfactory as suggested by the application in the dongting lake basin china in the dongting lake basin the lstm network parameterized using the 2007 to 2020 data produced the river water temperature series from 1960 to 2020 the produced water temperature series can be a good surrogate for investigating long term riverine thermal dynamics the combination of linear regression the tfpw mk test and sen s slope revealed the trend in water temperature over six decades in the four tributaries namely xiangjiang river zishui river yuanjiang river and lishui river the annual water temperature increased significantly with an average warming rate of 0 15 per decade heterogeneity of tendency and changing rates existed across sub basins and months with the warming water temperature demonstrating a more pronounced variation in the spring month of april the river water temperature commonly increased significantly while there was no indication of a significant declining trend in other months for the four tributaries wavelet transform unraveled a significant oscillation over one year from 1960 to 2020 and did not suggest prominent inter annual periodic fluctuations moving sample entropy combined with the linear regression and tfpw mk test indicated lowered water temperature complexity in the xiangjiang zishui and yuanjiang rivers it suggested enhanced water temperature complexity in the lishui river the practicality and flexibility of the proposed framework proved its potential to be applied in other basins for long term river water temperature simulation and analysis credit authorship contribution statement feng huang conceptualization data curation formal analysis funding

temperature changes in those basins where the water temperature measurement just started in recent years and long term historical observation was lacking although continuous and regular water temperature monitoring is essential for assessing riverine thermal alterations these data are rarely available in many basins pohle et al 2019 water temperature models prove a helpful tool for reconstructing river water temperature over a long period thereby providing valuable information to assess thermal regime alterations deweber and wagner 2014 water temperature models are generally classified into physically based deterministic and stochastically data driven models deterministic models employ an energy budget approach to predict river water temperature whereas stochastical models typically rely on air to water temperature relationships caissie 2006 deterministic models are generally based on the heat exchange dynamics between the water body and the surrounding environments they require a myriad of inputs including fluvial topography a complete set of meteorological variables and the hydraulic properties of the river piccolroaz et al 2016 due to the intrinsic complexity of heat equations that require a lot of data inputs the deterministic models applicability in the case of data scarcity is limited tao et al 2021 flexible statistical models particularly artificial intelligence algorithms are promising alternatives qiu et al 2020 zhu and piotrowski 2020 deep learning a new generation of artificial neural network research is especially suited for information extraction from sequential data it serves functionalities to build models with more accurate simulation far greater processing capability and reduced requirements for human involvement and expertise shen 2018 long short term memory lstm network is a type of deep machine learning method previous studies have demonstrated that the lstm network has a satisfying potential to simulate river water temperature and quantify temporal oscillations in thermal regimes induced by climate change and anthropogenic activities feigl et al 2021 qiu et al 2021 considering the abundance of hydrometeorological data and recent developments in artificial intelligence deep learning this study proposed a framework to help bridge the knowledge gap for assessing riverine thermal alterations in water temperature data scarce basins the proposed framework employs the lstm network to reconstruct and extend the river water temperature series and examines the long term dynamics in terms of trend periodicity and complexity the framework was applied in the dongting lake basin a sub basin of the yangtze river basin in china the dongting lake basin was a representative basin where water temperature monitoring was initiated recently and lacked historical observation data resulting in knowledge gaps in the long term dynamics of riverine thermal regimes the water temperature was monitored from 2007 to 2020 lacking long term records for evaluating thermal variations the streamflow and meteorological observation continued from 1960 to 2020 providing the inputs for the lstm network to extend the water temperature series this case study illustrated the framework s execution processes and practicality and provided implications for other basins suffering from data scarcity for local interests this application s results provided vital information for managers and policymakers to systematically assess the riverine thermal regime alteration and develop strategies to deal with this change in the dongting lake basin for worldwide interests the framework proposed by this study provided the basins lacking historical water temperature observations with an effective tool for water temperature reconstruction and assessment which is a vital component of fishery management and watershed preservation policy initiatives 2 case study site and data 2 1 study area yangtze river is the longest river in china and the third longest river in the world it originates in the qinghai tibet plateau and flows 6300 km into the east china sea draining an area of 1 8 million km2 fig 1 a the basin lies in the monsoon region of east asia s subtropical zone and has mean annual precipitation of 1090 mm jiang et al 2006 generally spring lasts from march to may summer lasts from june to august autumn lasts from september to november and winter lasts from december to february the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river have thousands of freshwater lakes among them poyang lake and dongting lake are the two largest lakes and have excellent value for socio economic development and environmental conservation dongting lake is the second largest freshwater lake in china and is located on the south bank of the middle yangtze river fig 1b four large tributaries feed dongting lake namely xiangjiang river zishui river yuanjiang river and lishui river the published literature has provided a detailed introduction to the geography meteorology hydrology and ecology of the yangtze river basin and its dongting lake sub basin liang et al 2021 yang et al 2020 yu et al 2018 zhao et al 2017 2 2 hydrological and meteorological data monthly averaged water temperature and streamflow m3 s data were collected from four hydrometric stations xiangtan taojiang taoyuan and shimen these hydrometric stations are located at the lower reaches of the tributaries discharging into dongting lake fig 1b xiangtan taojiang taoyuan and shimen stations monitor the streamflow processes of xiangjiang zishui yuanjiang and lishui rivers respectively monthly average water temperature data spanned from 2007 to 2020 and monthly average streamflow data spanned from 1960 to 2020 the hydrological data were provided by the changjiang water resources commission and the hydrological bureau of hunan province they have checked and firmly controlled the homogeneity and reliability of the hydrological data monthly mean air temperature and monthly accumulated evaporation mm data were obtained from twenty meteorological stations scattered over the dongting lake basin fig 1b these data were provided by the china meteorological data service centre https data cma cn en the meteorological records spanned from 1960 to 2020 covering sixty one years each sub basin s spatial mean air temperature and evaporation values were calculated by averaging the available data from meteorological stations in xiangjiang zishui yuanjiang and lishui river basins 3 methods 3 1 methodological framework fig 2 illustrates the methodological framework used to simulate the long term water temperature and investigate its variations data collection and pre processing e g air temperature evaporation streamflow and water temperature provide the information basis for constructing the water temperature model extending the water temperature series and evaluating the thermal alterations the original datasets are standardized and segmented for model construction and water temperature simulation lstm network is suggested to reconstruct long term water temperature from its affecting factors e g air temperature evaporation and streamflow over the same period as river water temperature data are available the linkage between water temperature and its affecting factors is depicted using the lstm network the lstm network can be constructed optimized trained and tested using keras a deep learning application programming interface written in python running on the machine learning platform tensorflow https keras io the validated water temperature model driven by the long term observed hydrometeorological data i e air temperature evaporation and streamflow produces long term water temperature investigating the trend periodicity and complexity of the reconstructed water temperature series helps in understanding the temporal dynamics of the riverine thermal regimes 3 2 lstm model for modeling river water temperature lstm network is a special kind of recurrent neural network the unit of which is composed of a cell an input gate an output gate and a forget gate hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 the lstm architecture consists of a set of recurrently connected sub networks known as memory blocks these blocks maintain their states over time and regulate the information flow the output of the block is recurrently connected back to the block input and all of the gates van houdt et al 2020 one reason for the lstm network s success lies in its ability to handle the exploding and vanishing gradient problem which stands as a difficult issue to be circumvented when training recurrent or very deep neural networks van houdt et al 2020 previous studies have proved the practicability and effectiveness of the lstm network to simulate sea river and lake surface water temperatures kim et al 2020 qiu et al 2021 rahmani et al 2021 read et al 2019 given the satisfying performance of the lstm network with a simple structure an lstm network encompassing an input layer two lstm layers one fully connected layer and an output layer was used to model the river water temperature in the dongting lake basin the lstm formulation for modeling the river water temperature with a monthly scale is expressed by 1 t w t f t a t e t q t where t w t is the river water temperature at the current month t unit t a t is the spatially averaged air temperature of a sub basin at the current month t unit e t is the spatially averaged evaporation of a sub basin at the current month t unit mm and q t is the tributary streamflow at the current month t unit m3 s all computations were conducted using python 3 8 10 software the keras running on tensorflow was used to program the lstm network the input layer received air temperature evaporation and streamflow it transferred the inputting information to the lstm and fully connected layers for processing and the output layer produced the water temperature simulation results the lstm layers used the hyperbolic tangent function as the activation function and the fully connected layer used the linear function as the activation function the key to the lstm network is the hidden neurons in the lstm layer called memory cells which receive information from the input layer and perceive the information at the previous moment the number of hidden neurons was set using the keras tuner function suggesting 30 memory cells for each lstm layer to model water temperature the adaptive moment estimation was used to optimize the network during the learning process and the early stopping method was applied to prevent over fitting when constructing the water temperature models for the xiangjiang zishui yuanjiang and lishui rivers the observed data from 2011 to 2020 were used to train the lstm networks the observed data from 2007 to 2010 were used to test the models because the differences in absolute values of air temperature evaporation streamflow and water temperature negatively affect the model s learning ability the hydrological and meteorological data were standardized using the z score method the model performance was evaluated using root mean square error rmse correlation coefficient r and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse which are commonly used performance evaluators huang et al 2021a huang et al 2021b qiu et al 2021 given air temperature evaporation and streamflow data spanned from 1960 to 2020 water temperature data were reconstructed from 1960 to 2020 using the validated lstm network 3 3 trend periodicity and complexity analysis 3 3 1 trend detection the trend embedded in the water temperature series was identified by the linear regression analysis combined with the trend free pre whitening mann kendall tfpw mk and sen s slope algorithms linear regression analysis illustrated the trend and the tfpw mk test ascertained whether the variation was significant sen s slope s quantified the magnitude of increasing or decreasing tendency in the water temperature series the tfpw mk test addresses serial autocorrelation issues by detrending the series before pre whitening and provides a more accurate assessment of the trend s significance the diagram of the tfpw mk test is illustrated in fig 3 yue et al 2002b the published literature provided detailed information on the algorithms of the tfpw mk test and sen s slope sen 1968 yue et al 2002a yue et al 2002b the python package pymannkendall https pypi org project pymannkendall supported trend detection and the significance level p was set as 0 05 hussain and mahmud 2019 3 3 2 periodicity identification the periodicity embedded in the water temperature series was analyzed using wavelet transform a standard tool for detecting localized power variations within a time series torrence and compo 1998 wavelet transform uses generalized local base functions named wavelets that can be stretched and translated with a flexible resolution in frequency and time the flexible windows are adaptive to the entire time frequency domain known as the wavelet domain which narrows while focusing on high frequency signals and widens while searching the low frequency background lau and weng 1995 the wavelet analysis results interpret the dominant modes of variability and how those modes vary in time the diagram of the wavelet transform is illustrated in fig 4 and a detailed introduction to the algorithms can be found in the literature lau and weng 1995 torrence and compo 1998 the wavelet analysis was conducted using the python package pycwt https pypi org project pycwt the complex morlet wavelet method was used because of its reliability in detecting signal periodicity liang et al 2013 detrending is necessary to remove the impact of tendency on periodicity detection the detrending was performed by fitting a one degree polynomial function and subtracting it from the original series before the wavelet analysis the detrended water temperature series was standardized using the z score method 3 3 3 complexity investigation water temperature complexity analyzed in this study could be defined as the degree of uncertainty or the rate of information production of water temperature series sivakumar and singh 2012 in light of the sample entropy s effectiveness and reliability it was used to quantify the water temperature complexity huang et al 2021b the sample entropy was an unbiased estimator of the conditional probability that two similar sequences of m consecutive data points m was the template length would remain similar when one more consecutive point was included a detailed description of the sample entropy algorithms can be found in the literature huang et al 2011 wu et al 2013 the moving sample entropy was calculated to unravel how the water temperature complexity changed over six decades a ten year long window moved with a one year step divided the 1960 2020 series into fifty two subseries 1960 1969 1961 1970 1962 1971 2009 2018 2010 2019 and 2011 2020 calculating sample entropy for each subseries produced a sample entropy series covering 1960 to 2011 the linear regression and tfpw mk test were employed to identify the trend in the sample entropy series the computation of water temperature complexity used python programming when calculating sample entropy previous studies have suggested setting the template length at m 2 and the tolerance criterion at r 0 15 δ where δ denotes the standard deviation of the original water temperature series li and zhang 2008 wu et al 2013 4 results and discussion 4 1 long term river water temperature simulation fig 5 illustrates the performance of the lstm network to simulate the river water temperature in the dongting lake basin during the model training and testing the scatters of water temperature were distributed alongside the 1 1 line the simulated water temperature matched well with the observed one with satisfactory goodness of fit statistics of the lstm model performance table 1 for training the model the evaluator rmse ranged from 1 56 to 1 81 with a mean value of 1 64 the evaluator r ranged from 0 96 to 0 98 with a mean value of 0 97 and the evaluator nse ranged from 0 92 to 0 95 with a mean value of 0 94 for testing the model the evaluator rmse ranged from 1 21 to 2 35 with a mean value of 1 51 the evaluator r ranged from 0 95 to 0 99 with a mean value of 0 97 and the evaluator nse ranged from 0 90 to 0 98 with a mean value of 0 95 the goodness of fit statistics suggested that the lstm network adequately simulated the river water temperature and could be applied to reconstruct long term water temperature series the validated lstm network driven by the long term observed air temperature evaporation and streamflow resulted in long term monthly water temperature covering january 1960 to december 2020 fig 6 the monthly mean variation in water temperature was dominated by the sinusoidal seasonal pattern in which maximum temperatures occur over the summer months and minimum over the winter months annual mean water temperature series were calculated and each month s water temperature series were extracted for the following trend analysis 4 2 temporal dynamics of annual and monthly river water temperature linear regression illustrated prominent increasing trends in the annual averaging water temperatures in the dongting lake basin fig 7 the river water temperature fluctuated and increased gradually over six decades the tfpw mk test confirmed that these warming trends of river water temperature were statistically significant the warming rate of annual mean water temperature in the xiangjiang river zishui river yuanjiang river and lishui river was 0 16 0 10 0 16 and 0 18 per decade respectively they resulted in an average warming rate of 0 15 per decade the results were in line with the previous findings and added a piece of case evidence supporting the idea that river water temperature was increasing globally under climate change ouellet et al 2020 the monthly mean water temperature in the xiangjiang river experienced different variations from 1960 to 2020 fig 8 linear regression and sen s slope analysis indicated a decreasing water temperature trend in july however the tfpw mk test rejected the significance of this decreasing trend in other months except for july the water temperatures increased with various sen s slops ranging from 0 01 to 0 37 per decade the tfpw mk test identified significant warming water temperatures in the winter month of february and the spring month of april in april the water temperature s warming rate reached 0 37 per decade the highest value compared with the warming rates in other months in february the water temperature s warming rate was 0 30 per decade therefore the rising annual mean water temperature in the xiangjiang river might be partially attributed to february and april s significantly increased water temperature the long term reconstructed data suggested different temporal dynamics of monthly mean water temperature in the zishui river fig 9 in january and july the water temperature dropped slightly with a decreasing rate of 0 02 and 0 16 per decade respectively however these decreasing trends had not passed the tfpw mk test yet in other months except for january and july the water temperatures increased the water temperature warming rates ranged from 0 03 to 0 33 per decade with a mean value of 0 14 per decade the increasing water temperature trends in the two spring months of march and april were significant as confirmed by the tfpw mk test the substantial increase in water temperature in these two months contributed to the substantial increase in the annual mean water temperature of the zishui river the monthly water temperature variations in the yuanjiang river were dominated by the increasing tendency in the past six decades indicated by the linear regression and sen s slope analysis fig 10 a slight and insignificant decreasing trend was detected in only one month july the water temperatures in other months increased and the warming rates ranged from 0 07 to 0 36 per decade with a mean value of 0 18 per decade as suggested by the tfpw mk test the increasing water temperature trends in the two spring months of march and april and the two autumn months of october and november were significant accounting for the substantial increase in the annual mean water temperature of the yuanjiang river in the lishui river the reconstructed monthly data suggested a dominantly rising water temperature from 1960 to 2020 with a minimum warming rate of 0 11 per decade and a maximum warming rate of 0 33 per decade fig 11 the tfpw mk test detected significant increasing trends in the water temperatures for january february march april may september and december in these seven months the average warming rate of water temperature reached 0 22 per decade contributing to the noticeable increase in the annual mean water temperature of the lishui river the water temperature variations in the remaining months i e june july august october and november were not significant confirmed by the tfpw mk test these results suggested spatial and temporal heterogeneity in river water temperature variations consistent with the findings from other regions wagner et al 2017 although a common characteristic was the warming water temperature as a more pronounced variation the changing rates of water temperature varied across the four tributaries in the dongting lake basin except for the heterogeneity across sub basins heterogeneity of tendency and changing rates existed across months some negative sen s slope values indicated the cooling water temperature but the tfpw mk test rejected their significance a homogeneity in water temperature variations was the significantly warming water temperature in the spring month of april in the four tributaries although the warming rates differed the results were inconsistent with the seasonal water temperature changes for river sites in the western us where the water temperature notably increased during the fall and winter seasons wagner et al 2017 the seasonal variations also differed from those in fifty two catchments in switzerland where water temperature has significantly increased over the past five decades with positive trends for all four seasons michel et al 2020 4 3 periods embedded in monthly river water temperature series given the well defined trends in the river water temperature series of the dongting lake basin the long term reconstructed data were detrended and then analyzed using the wavelet transform method resulting in the wavelet power spectrums fig 12 in fig 12 cross hatched regions on either end indicated the cone of influence where edge effects became important higher wavelet power at a time scale implied more robust oscillations at the corresponding time scale and vice versa a high wavelet power was identified at the one year time scale and this high power spectrum continued through the six decades the thick dashed red contour enclosed less than 0 05 significance level regions indicating the significant one year period embedded in the monthly mean water temperature series the river water temperature had pronounced seasonal components with low water temperature occurring in winter when the air temperature reached a minimum and high water temperature occurring in summer fig 6 this intrinsic intra annual fluctuation induced a significant one year period as identified by the wavelet transform except for the prominent one year period the wavelet transform did not suggest strong power at greater time scales there was no indication of a significant period other than one year despite the considerable inter annual variation of the monthly water temperature series 4 4 complexity changes of monthly river water temperature series fig 13 displays the temporal evolution of water temperature complexity quantified using sample entropy a higher sample entropy value indicates more complexity in water temperature series characterized by disorderliness randomness and irregularity in contrast a lower sample entropy value indicates more orderliness regularity and self similarity linear regression and sen s slopes suggested declined sample entropies of water temperatures in the xiangjiang river zishui river and yuanjiang river the tfpw mk test identified the significance of these decreasing trends there was a significant increasing trend in the sample entropy of water temperature in the lishui river as confirmed by the tfpw mk test the river water temperature complexity in the dongting lake basin experienced inter annual variations from 1960 to 2020 significantly lowered water temperature complexity was detected in the xiangjiang zishui and yuanjiang rivers while significantly enhanced water temperature complexity was suggested in the lishui river 4 5 advantages limitations and future research water temperature is a vital attribute of riverine habitat and assessing its alterations is one of the focal objectives of river engineering and management this study proposed a framework to address the limitation of data scarcity in comprehensively evaluating riverine thermal regime alterations the framework incorporated the lstm network to simulate and extend the water temperature series and the time series analysis technologies to reveal the temporal dynamics of the thermal regime the framework s application in the dongting lake basin verified its practicality and suggested its potential in other basins given the development and prosperity of artificial intelligence other deep learning technologies except for the lstm network can also be employed to construct the water temperature models when applying the proposed framework in other basins these machine learning algorithms include but are not limited to a random forest extreme gradient boosting feed forward neural networks and wavelet neural networks abdi et al 2021 feigl et al 2021 piotrowski et al 2015 based on a basin s physiographic characteristics and data availability model inputs to be considered can include air temperature precipitation evaporation global radiation streamflow landform attributes and land cover attributes to mention a few deweber and wagner 2014 feigl et al 2021 the research objective and the time scale of available data determine the time scale of model output e g hourly daily monthly and annual simulations it is worth noting that more complex and advanced models do not necessarily outperform simple and popular neural networks the performance significance and choice of models should be verified piotrowski et al 2015 the parameterized and validated water temperature model produces long term water temperature data an essential supplement to the missing historical data the reconstructed data provide a critical basis for assessing thermal regime alterations regarding trend periodicity and complexity and exploring the driving mechanisms behind the thermal regime alterations river water temperature is a product of multiple environmental factors and is also impacted by anthropogenic perturbations such as thermal pollution and deforestation caissie 2006 tao et al 2020 the present study was limited in not incorporating anthropogenic factors into water temperature simulation and failed to distinguish the impact of climate change and human activities on water temperature variations the lstm network was trained and tested using the parallel water temperature data and its driving factors the lstm network s data requirement restrained the framework s applicability in the basins where the water temperature data are unavailable as essentially a black box model the lstm network could not explain the physical mechanisms behind the water temperature evolution future efforts will improve water temperature simulation identify riverine thermal regime alterations and analyze causative mechanisms changes in river water temperature are anticipated to affect thermal habitat and fish population directly for example in the fraser river basin of british columbia the increase in average summer water temperature has doubled the number of days exceeding 20 the water temperature that if exceeded potentially increases the physiological stress of salmon during migration islam et al 2019 5 conclusions the proposed framework for reconstructing and investigating long term water temperature data was practical in addressing the issue of observed data scarcity for riverine thermal assessment the incorporation of the lstm network and the trend periodicity and complexity algorithms resulted in an explicit framework structure whose components could be flexibly substituted by other algorithms of machine learning and time series analysis the framework structure was clear and its performance was satisfactory as suggested by the application in the dongting lake basin china in the dongting lake basin the lstm network parameterized using the 2007 to 2020 data produced the river water temperature series from 1960 to 2020 the produced water temperature series can be a good surrogate for investigating long term riverine thermal dynamics the combination of linear regression the tfpw mk test and sen s slope revealed the trend in water temperature over six decades in the four tributaries namely xiangjiang river zishui river yuanjiang river and lishui river the annual water temperature increased significantly with an average warming rate of 0 15 per decade heterogeneity of tendency and changing rates existed across sub basins and months with the warming water temperature demonstrating a more pronounced variation in the spring month of april the river water temperature commonly increased significantly while there was no indication of a significant declining trend in other months for the four tributaries wavelet transform unraveled a significant oscillation over one year from 1960 to 2020 and did not suggest prominent inter annual periodic fluctuations moving sample entropy combined with the linear regression and tfpw mk test indicated lowered water temperature complexity in the xiangjiang zishui and yuanjiang rivers it suggested enhanced water temperature complexity in the lishui river the practicality and flexibility of the proposed framework proved its potential to be applied in other basins for long term river water temperature simulation and analysis credit authorship contribution statement feng huang conceptualization data curation formal analysis funding

2606,it is necessary but difficult to accurately predict the water levels in front of pumping stations of an open channel water transfer project because of the complex interactions among hydraulic structures in this study an improved beetle antennae search extreme learning machine ibas elm water level prediction model is proposed by combining the improved beetle antennae search ibas algorithm with extreme learning machine elm first the water level data is divided into regulated and unregulated periods according to whether the pump unit is regulated or not second the model inputs in the regulated period are improved by taking into account the regulation time of pumping units and the flow before and after regulation then the beetle antennae search bas algorithm is improved by increasing the search direction and introducing the optimal individual and levy flight finally the ibas elm model is established to predict water levels in front of huibu and dongsong pumping stations of the jiaodong water transfer project china the results show that 1 the values of mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and mean absolute percentage error mape of all models under group

the control parameter 1 introduction water shortage has become a serious problem in many countries and regions because of population growth economic development and environmental pollution ostad ali askari et al 2017a ostad ali askari 2022 and a possible solution to this problem is to build inter basin water transfer projects han et al 2020 yan et al 2022 it is important to accurately predict changes in water levels in front of pumping stations of a water transfer project in order to optimize the distribution of water resources many physically based models and data driven models have been proposed for this purpose ardiclioglu et al 2022 dasineh et al 2021 daneshfaraz et al 2022 bajirao et al 2021 physically based models mainly use saint venant equations and control equations of hydraulic structures to predict the state of water flow shayannejad et al 2022 ostad ali askari et al 2018 despite of their clear physical meaning these methods also require the data of engineering and topographic parameters data driven methods have found widespread use because they avoid hydraulic modeling and directly explore the relationships between data pirnazar et al 2018 ostad ali askari et al 2017b ostad ali askari and shayannejad 2021 singh et al 2022 over the past years data driven models have been widely used for predicting water levels in rivers li et al 2020 tao et al 2021 lakes kisi et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 and groundwater barzegar et al 2017 ghasemlounia et al 2021 li et al 2015 found that artificial neural network ann was as accurate as the hydrodynamic model but the calculation time of ann was shorter castillo botón et al 2020 employed ann and support vector machine svm for water level prediction in a hydropower reservoir in calicia spain chen et al 2020 proposed a model combining auto regressive ar analysis and non stationary tidal harmonic analysis ns tide to improve the short term daily water level prediction of estuaries under the influence of tides guo et al 2018 proposed an improved least squares support vector machine lssvm model for water level prediction in the middle reaches of the yangtze river china however these methods may have some constraints such as low learning rate and falling into local minimum in the prediction elm is an efficient learning algorithm because of its fast learning speed and high prediction performance hua et al 2022 sulaiman et al 2022 wang et al 2022 and it is better than ann and svm in overcoming the local minimum problem in the regression analysis li et al 2022 a possible way to improve the prediction accuracy of elm is to combine with intelligent algorithms such as particle swarm optimization algorithm pso li and wei 2020 the beetle antennae search bas algorithm is an efficient optimization algorithm inspired by the foraging and mate seeking behaviors of the beetle jiang and li 2018 and it is simpler and faster than pso and many other intelligent optimization algorithms sun et al 2019 xu et al 2020 however it is easy to fall into local optimization as only a single beetle is considered in order to overcome this problem this paper proposes an ibas algorithm in which the search direction is increased and the optimal individual and levy flight are introduced to prevent the algorithm from falling into local optimum then the ibas algorithm is used to optimize the weight and bias of elm to improve the prediction accuracy it should also be noted that previous water level prediction models have focused on rivers lakes and groundwater but little is known about water level prediction in water transfer projects where the water level can be significantly affected by hydraulic buildings especially those projects with cascade pumping stations the switching of pumping units can cause sudden changes in the flow and consequently the water level in front of the pumping station which makes it more difficult for water level prediction in this study the ibas elm model is proposed in order to accurately predict the water level in front of the pumping station which is greatly affected by human regulation first the data are divided into unregulated and regulated periods of the pumping station which are predicted separately to reduce the interference between them second in order to improve the prediction accuracy of the model in the regulated period the regulation time of the pumping station and the discharge after regulation are taken into account in the model input finally the ibas algorithm is used to optimize the parameters of elm model in order to further improve the prediction accuracy of the model the main innovations of this paper are as follows 1 the search ability of the bas algorithm is improved by increasing the search direction and introducing the optimal individual and levy flight 2 the ibas algorithm is used to optimize the weight and bias of elm to improve the prediction accuracy 3 the data are divided into regulated and unregulated periods for water level prediction according to whether the unit is regulated or not 4 model input in the regulated period is improved considering the regulation time and the discharge of the pumping station the rest of this paper is structured as follows section 2 introduces the research methods section 3 describes the research area and data section 4 presents the main results and section 5 presents the conclusions 2 methods 2 1 beetle antennae search algorithm the bas algorithm is an intelligent optimization algorithm inspired by the foraging and mate seeking behaviors of the beetle jiang and li 2018 at first the beetle does not know the exact location of the food and it uses its two antennas to detect the odor based on which the forward direction is determined the beetle will move to the left if the odor intensity detected by the left antennae is greater than that by the right antennae and move to the right if the odor intensity detected by the left antennae is lower than that by the right antennae after continuous search the beetle will eventually find the location of the food in this algorithm the calculation result is equivalent to the odor intensity of the food and the target is equivalent to the exact location of the food the beetle will determine the forward direction based on the calculation results of the two antennas the algorithm has simple structure and low complexity the calculation process is given as follows step 1 randomly generate a d dimensional vector as the antenna of the beetle and normalize the vector 1 b rands d 1 norm r a n d s d 1 where b represents the direction of the antennae rands represents the generation of a random number between 1 and 1 and norm represents the norm of the vector step 2 calculate the position of left and right antennas 2 x left x t b d t 2 x right x t b d t 2 where xleft and xright represent the positions of left and right antennas respectively xt represents the position of the beetle at the t th iteration dt represents the distance between left and right antennas at the t th iteration and the rest are the same as above step 3 the fitness function values of left and right antennas are determined and then the position of the beetle is updated jiang and li 2018 3 x t 1 x t δ t s i g n f x left f x right where f xleft and f xright represent the function values of left and right antennas of the beetle respectively δt represents the search step at the t th iteration sign represents the symbol determination function and the rest are the same as above step 4 update the search step of the beetle note that the search range of the beetle is dependent on the step size the search range will be large at larger step sizes making it easier for the miss of global optimal values but it will be narrow at smaller step sizes making it easier to fall into local optimization in order to ensure the search range and accuracy the step size is set by the linearized decreasing weight value 4 δ t 1 δ t e where e represents the attenuation factor which is in the range of 0 1 and generally taken to be 0 95 and the rest are the same as above step 5 repeat steps 1 4 until the maximum number of iterations is reached 2 2 improved beetle antennae search algorithm in the bas algorithm a single beetle with two antennas is used and the search direction is randomly generated without considering historical experience in this case it is easy to fall into local optimization in this study the bas algorithm is improved in the following aspects 1 the number of beetles is increased to 100 which increases the number of search populations and consequently the search ability of the algorithm 2 a chaotic sequence is introduced to initialize the population in a swarm intelligence search algorithm the distribution property of the initial population has an impact on the convergence of the algorithm the more uniform the distribution of the population is the faster the optimal initial value can be obtained chaos is a unique and common form of aperiodic motion in nonlinear systems and it is a long term behavior that is very sensitive to the initial conditions the unique properties of chaotic motion such as pseudo randomness ergodicity and regularity make it exhibit complex spatio temporal dynamics the use of chaotic sequence can make the initial population more uniformly distributed so that the search ability of the algorithm can be increased liu et al 2019 the logistic equation is widely used to generate chaotic sequence because of its simple structure low calculation cost and convenience the logistic equation is described as follows liu et al 2019 5 o i 1 μ o i 1 o i i 1 2 3 n where μ is the control parameter when μ is 4 and o is between 0 and 1 the system is in a chaotic state and the motion conforms to the chaotic characteristics 3 the two antennas are expanded to multiple antennas with the increase of search space and dimension the search need could not be adequately satisfied with the use of only two antennas in order to improve the search ability of the bas algorithm and avoid local optimization multiple antennas are considered and the specific number of antennas is dependent on the search space and dimension in order to make the search direction of the algorithm as scattered as possible the search directions of any two antennas are vertical or opposite to each other take six antennas in the three dimensional search space as an example first a search direction a a1 a2 a3 is randomly generated and the opposite search direction is b a1 a2 a3 at this time there is a plane perpendicular to the vector a the pink plane on the left side of fig 1 on which a vector c c1 c2 c3 is randomly selected and the opposite search direction d c1 c2 c3 is determined a b c and d are on the same plane the light green plane on the right side of fig 1 at this time there is a vector e e1 e2 e3 perpendicular to the plane and the last direction f e1 e2 e3 is opposite to the vector then each vector is normalized to calculate the position and fitness of each antenna the best direction is selected as the direction at the next moment 6 b a a norm a 7 x a x b a d t 8 f bx min f x a f x b f x c f x d f x e f x f where ba is the direction of antenna a xa is the position of antenna a f xa is the fitness of antenna a f bx is the optimal fitness bbx is the optimal direction of the beetle assuming that f bx is f xa and the next direction bbx is ba 4 individual and global optimal locations of antennas are introduced the updated formula of the improved bas is 9 x t 1 x t δ m b bx c 1 r a n d x pb x t c 2 r a n d x gb x t where c 1 and c 2 represent the learning factors xpb represents the individual optimal location xgb represents the global optimal location and the rest are the same as above 5 levy flight random walk is introduced levy flight is a random search method based on ryan distribution it is found that the trajectories of many creatures even including people are consistent with the levy flight process because of strong randomness it is often used to improve the optimization algorithm beşkirli 2022 yan et al 2020 the simulation shows that the improved algorithm based on levy flight is superior to the original one li et al 2021 then the position formula of the algorithm is li et al 2021 10 x t 1 x t 2 r a n d 1 l e v y λ where levy λ is the levy s random search path which is determined by formula 11 and the rest are the same as above 11 levy λ u v 1 λ 2 3 experimental simulation and results the performance of the ibas algorithm is compared with bas and particle swarm optimization pso algorithms in five typical benchmark function optimization problems table 1 the population number is set to 100 in pso and ibas algorithms and the iteration number is set to 200 in all algorithms each function is optimized 30 times and the optimization performance of each algorithm is evaluated by the average and standard deviation as shown in table 2 table 2 reveals that the optimization results of the ibas algorithm are closest to the theoretical values and have the smallest standard deviations notably the average is only 1 48e 9 2 24e 4 and 5 92e 8 for sphere ackley and zakharov function respectively which is close to the theoretical value of 0 and the standard deviation is only 2 20e 10 1 22e 5 and 1 97e 8 indicating high stability of the algorithm it is clear that the ibas algorithm is better than bas and pso algorithms in terms of accuracy and stability 2 4 extreme learning machine elm is a special feedforward neural network developed on the basis of single layer feedforward neural network it eliminates the need of repeated adjustment of the weight and threshold of the model and thus greatly improves the operation efficiency of the model compared with traditional neural network algorithms elm has the advantages of global optimal solution short training time and strong generalization ability it consists of three layers input layer hidden layer and output layer assuming that the number of inputs outputs and neurons in the hidden layer is n m and l respectively the elm network model can be expressed as hua et al 2022 12 i 1 l β i g w i s j b i y j where w i is the input weight β i is the output weight b i is the bias of the hidden layer neurons g x is the activation function of the hidden layer s j is the network input and y j is the network output 2 5 ibas optimized elm some problems may arise from the random selection of input weights and biases in elm such as low generalization ability in this study the ibas algorithm is used to optimize the input weights and biases of elm to improve its learning performance here the average error of elm is set as the optimization objective gao et al 2022 13 f i 1 t y i y i t where f is the optimization objective y i is the output value of elm yi is the true value and t is the number of samples 2 6 performance evaluation of prediction models four indexes are

515 billion m3 water to the jiaodong area and thus plays a critical role in the social and economic development of the area yan et al 2021 the 90 54 km long section from songzhuang sluice to bushang sluice consisting of 2 pumping stations and 20 inverted siphons is selected as the study area fig 2 where the bottom width of the channel is 3 50 8 20 m the side slope coefficient is 1 2 and the bottom slope is 0 05 0 10 in order to ensure the accuracy in water level prediction the data in regulated and unregulated periods of the pumping station are used separately the regulated period means that pumping units are regulated in the prediction period and the unregulated period means that pumping units are not regulated in the prediction period the data of water level in front of the pumping station upstream inflow and pumping flow in the stable operation period april to june 2019 are used for training and prediction the time interval is 2 h the data are divided into training data 70 and verification data 30 4 results and discussion the future water level in front of the pumping station is mainly affected by the current water level upstream inflow and pumping flow of the downstream pumping station these three factors are selected as model inputs and the water level in front of the pumping station at the next time is selected as the model output 4 1 comparison between group and direct prediction this section compares the prediction accuracy of ibas elm bas elm pso elm and elm models under group prediction and direct prediction it is seen from tables 3 and 4 that the mae rmse and mape values for the prediction of water levels in front of the huibu pumping station in the unregulated period under group prediction are 0 0240 0 0290 m 0 0345 0 0426 m and 0 84 1 00 which are 17 85 24 65 10 32 23 86 and 21 97 26 96 lower than those under direct prediction respectively the nse values under group prediction are 0 33 0 81 higher than those under direct prediction these results suggest that more accurate prediction is obtained under group prediction in comparison to direct prediction the scatter plots of measured and predicted water levels in front of the huibu pumping station provide a more intuitive comparison between group and direct prediction fig 3 reveals that under group prediction there is a good agreement between predicted and measured water levels in the unregulated period and only a few predicted water levels differ greatly from the measured ones fig 4 reveals that under direct prediction the predicted water levels are significantly higher than the measured ones at water levels lower than 4 80 m and there is a significant deviation from the 1 1 diagonal in order to more clearly illustrate the difference between group and direct prediction the trend line red dotted line is supplemented in the figure it is found that under group prediction the trend line almost coincides with the diagonal line where the slope is close to 1 and the intercept is close to 0 while under direct prediction the trend line deviates considerably from the diagonal line it can be seen from tables 5 and 6 that the mae rmse and mape values for the prediction of water levels in front of the dongsong pumping station in the unregulated period under group prediction are 15 60 18 87 10 18 19 23 and 14 81 19 49 lower than those under direct prediction respectively and the nse values are 1 02 2 14 higher again more accurate prediction is obtained under group prediction in order to save space comparison is made only on the prediction results of the ibas elm model between group and direct prediction fig 5 shows that there is a good agreement between predicted and measured water levels under group prediction the trend line for group prediction almost coincides with the diagonal line where the slope is 1 0145 while that for direct prediction deviates substantially from the diagonal line where the slope is 1 0846 the r 2 value of the trend line for group prediction 0 9641 is larger than that for direct prediction again group prediction yields more accurate prediction results the above results suggest that group prediction is more accurate than direct prediction in the unregulated period note that the data in the unregulated period under group prediction is characterized by high consistency and correlation while the data in the regulated period under direct prediction is affected by artificial regulation which may have an impact on model training and consequently reduces the accuracy of the model it is seen from tables 7 and 8 that the mae rmse and mape values for the prediction of water levels in front of the huibu pumping station in the unregulated period under group prediction are 4 39 10 21 6 51 11 11 and 2 74 8 05 lower than those under direct prediction respectively and the nse values in the regulated period are 1 46 2 61 higher it should be noted that although group prediction is more accurate than direct prediction the accuracy level is still far from the desired level fig 6 shows that there is a substantial difference between predicted and measured water levels in front of the huibu pumping station in the regulated period whether under group or direct prediction although the slope of the trend line for group prediction 0 9977 is very close to 1 it is obviously below the diagonal line the r2 value is only 0 9214 and the points are widely scattered around the line the slope of the trend line for direct prediction is only 0 8751 and it intersects the diagonal line the r2 value is only 0 9136 and the prediction errors of some points even exceed 30 cm it is concluded that the prediction accuracy is low in the regulated period whether under group or direct prediction it is seen from tables 9 and 10 that the mae rmse and mape values for the prediction of water levels in front of the dongsong pumping station in the regulated period under group prediction are 0 0569 0 0623 m 0 0740 0 0759 m and 1 95 2 11 which are 6 88 17 18 9 14 12 11 and 6 22 15 95 lower than those under direct prediction respectively it is noted that although group prediction can improve the prediction accuracy in the regulated period the prediction accuracy under group and direct prediction is not sufficiently high fig 7 shows that although the trend line for group prediction is very close to the diagonal with a slope of 0 9839 the r2 value is only 0 8979 and the points are rather scattered similarly the r2 value of the trend line for direct prediction is only 0 892 and it deviates significantly from the diagonal line with a slope of 0 8542 thus it is less accurate for the prediction of water levels in front of the dongsong pumping station in the regulated period under the two prediction conditions for data driven models the data characteristics will determine the upper limit of the model performance xiao et al 2021 given the differences in data characteristics between regulated and unregulated periods the use of the same model structure may make it less accurate for water level prediction for time varying data it is better to classify the data into different periods in water level prediction zhao et al 2020 gu et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 used k means clustering and support vector machine classification models to classify the data of high sediment load river reaches which were predicted separately using support vector regression models the results showed that the prediction accuracy was 3 13 higher than that of the traditional model yuan et al 2022 used dynamic time warping and hierarchical clustering algorithm to classify the 19 stations on the mainstream yangtze river into 6 categories and more reliable prediction results were obtained compared to traditional models in this study the data in the prediction period is classified according to whether the pump unit is regulated or not ren et al 2020 only predicted the water level in front of the gate when there is no regulation of the gate this shows from the side that regulation of hydraulic structures has an effect on the prediction accuracy of water levels it is also noted that although group prediction can significantly improve the prediction accuracy in the unregulated period it has little impact on the prediction accuracy in the regulation period this is because although the data is separated into regulated and unregulated periods for training under group prediction the flow of the pumping station is changed in the regulated period and the regulation time and the flow after regulation are random in this circumstance the actual results may vary greatly even when the model inputs are the same there is no fixed relationship between the input and output of the model which leads to the reduction of model accuracy for this reason model inputs are improved considering the regulation time and the flow after regulation and the prediction accuracy before and after the improvement of model input is compared 4 2 comparison between different model inputs model inputs are improved in order to more accurately predict the water levels in front of the pumping station in the regulated period as the pumping station is artificially regulated the regulation time and the flow before and after the regulation could be known in advance based on which the average flow of the downstream pumping station in the next period could be calculated to reduce the complexity of the model the current water level in front of the pumping station the upstream inflow and the average flow of the downstream pumping station in the next period are taken as model inputs in the regulated period the results are shown in fig 8 and tables 11 and 12 it is seen from table 7 table 8 and table 11 that the mae rmse and mape values of the models considering model inputs for the prediction of water levels in front of the huibu pumping station in the regulated period under group prediction are 30 30 38 85 31 04 43 12 and 30 65 40 58 lower than those without considering model inputs under group prediction and 22 54 43 69 22 95 49 40 and 23 27 43 17 lower than those without considering model inputs under direct prediction respectively the nse values are 4 20 8 84 and 6 05 8 61 higher respectively it is seen from figs 6 and 8 that the trend line considering model inputs is closer to the diagonal and the r2 value 0 9725 is significantly higher than that without considering model inputs this demonstrates that the prediction accuracy in the regulated period is significantly improved with the improvement of model inputs it is seen from table 9 table 10 and table 12 that the mae rmse and mape values of the models considering model inputs under group prediction are 27 03 30 39 24 64 33 25 and 28 44 30 44 lower than those without considering model inputs under group prediction and 25 76 40 47 28 64 39 79 and 26 42 40 52 lower than those under direct prediction respectively the nse values are 5 09 6 70 and 5 62 7 24 respectively thus the improvement of model inputs leads to a significant improvement of the prediction accuracy in the regulated period it is seen from figs 7 and 9 that the slope of the trend line considering model inputs is 1 0074 and it is located slightly below the diagonal this is similar to the trend line without considering model inputs under group prediction and is significantly better than that under direct prediction however the r2 value 0 9553 is higher than that without considering model inputs under group prediction and direct prediction fig 9 also reveals that the points are scattered closer to the diagonal line after the improvement of model inputs model inputs are crucial for the prediction accuracy of water levels the accuracy of the model considering the regulation time and the flow of the pumping station is obviously improved simply because the operation of the pumping station will affect the water level change in the future when the hydrodynamic model is used to predict the water level change the changes of pumping stations gates and other control structures must be taken into account as the inner boundary of the model lei et al 2019 lu et al 2018 the same is true for data driven models zhou et al 2022 considered the future gate opening as the input of the model in the prediction of the water level in front of the gate of the middle route south to north water transfer project it should be noted that although the prediction accuracy in the regulated period can be significantly improved with the improvement of model inputs it differs between regulated and unregulated periods especially in the huibu pumping station this may be attributed to the differences in the manual recording of the regulation time because dispatchers often work in three shifts and they may have different recording habits that lead to substantial differences in the recording of the regulation time there are few data in the regulated period which makes it difficult for the model to learn the relationship between the data in the training process and thus leads to lower prediction accuracy compared to the unregulated period the presence of some errors in data monitoring also reduces the prediction accuracy of the model in the future research hydrodynamic model simulation can be used to increase data samples and filtering model can be used to reduce data noise to further improve the prediction accuracy of the model 4 3 comparison between different prediction models this section only compares the prediction results in the unregulated period and that in the regulated period after improvement of model inputs under group prediction table 3 reveals that the mae rmse and mape values of the ibas elm model for predicted water levels in front of the huibu pumping station in the unregulated period 0 0240 0 0345 and 0 84 are 1 23 18 09 5 22 19 01 and 0 18 45 lower than those of other models respectively and the nse value 0 9911 is 0 10 0 47 higher than that of other models similarly table 5 shows that the mae rmse and mape values of the ibas elm model for predicted water levels in front of the dongsong pumping station in the unregulated period 0 0265 0 0369 and 0 88 respectively are 1 85 9 56 1 07 8 44 and 2 22 9 28 lower than those of other models respectively and the nse value 0 9633 is 0 09 0 74 higher than that of other models table 11 reveals that the mae rmse and mape values for the prediction of water levels in front of the huibu pumping station in the regulated period are smallest 0 0602 0 0715 and 2 26 in the ibas elm model which are 0 66 28 50 1 65 30 18 and 0 27 10 lower than those in other models respectively although the mape value of the bas elm model is equal to that of the ibas elm model it has higher mae and rmse values the nse value 0 9718 is 0 10 3 05 higher than that of other models table 12 reveals that the mae rmse and mape values for the prediction of water levels in front the dongsong pumping station in the regulated period are also smallest 0 0409 0 0507 and 1 38 in the ibas elm model which are 3 54 12 42 3 24 12 89 and 3 50 12 10 lower than those in other models respectively the nse value 0 9569 is 0 29 1 43 higher than that of other models thus the ibas elm model has higher prediction accuracy than other models fig 3 reveals that the trend line of the bas elm model is slightly higher than the diagonal line at water levels below 4 60 m and the trend lines of other models almost coincides with the diagonal line with a slope close to 1 however the r2 value of the ibas elm model is slightly larger than those of other models which indicates that the prediction result of the ibas elm model is closer to the diagonal it is seen from figs 8 and 10 that the trend line of the ibas elm model almost coincides with the diagonal line while the trend lines of other models deviate from the diagonal line to varying extents the slope 0 9784 is closer to 1 compared to other models and the r2 value 0 9725 is slightly lower than that of the bas elm model see fig 11 similar results are observed for the dongsong pumping station and will not be elaborated here in order to save space in general the use of the optimization algorithm to optimize elm model parameters can improve the prediction accuracy of the model however the optimization algorithm may easily fall into local optimization due to the influence of population number and search efficiency in this study an ibas model is proposed to improve the search ability of the bas algorithm by using multiple individuals rather than a single individual and the number of antennas per individual the directions of all antennas are perpendicular or opposite to each other which can increase the search direction of the algorithm as much as possible and thus improve its search ability in high dimensional space levy flight is introduced into the model to prevent the model from falling into local optimum because of its strong randomness beşkirli 2022 levy flight has been used to improve bat algorithm li et al 2021 and whale optimization algorithm yan et al 2020 it is also seen in section 2 3 that ibas produces more accurate and stable search results than bas and pso therefore better prediction results are obtained with the use of the elm model optimized by ibas 5 conclusions in this study the ibas algorithm is proposed to improve the search ability of the bas algorithm by increasing the search direction and introducing the optimal value and levy flight and then it is used to optimize the parameters of the elm model to improve the prediction ability the data are divided into regulated and unregulated periods for water level prediction according to whether the unit is regulated or not model inputs are improved considering the regulation time and the flow before and after regulation in the regulated period to further improve the model accuracy the results show that 1 group prediction can significantly improve the prediction accuracy in the unregulated period but it has little effect on the prediction accuracy in the regulated period the mae rmse and mape values in the unregulated period under group prediction are 15 60 24 65 10 18 23 86 and 14 81 26 96 lower than those under direct prediction respectively and the nse values are 0 33 2 14 higher 2 the prediction accuracy in the regulated period is significantly improved with the improvement of model inputs the mae rmse and mape values after improvement of model inputs are 27 03 38 85 24 64 43 12 and 28 44 40 58 lower than those without improvement of model inputs and the nse values are 4 20 8 84 higher 3 the ibas elm model has higher prediction accuracy than other models examined the mae rmse and mape values of the ibas elm model are 0 66 28 50 1 07 30 18 and 0 27 10 lower than those of other models respectively and the nse value is 0 09 3 05 higher in general the proposed model can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of water levels in front of the pumping station however the model performance will be affected by the quality and quantity of data and low prediction accuracy would be expected in case of low data quality and quantity in the future hydrodynamic simulation can be used to increase data samples and filtering model can be used to reduce data noise in order to further improve the prediction

2606,it is necessary but difficult to accurately predict the water levels in front of pumping stations of an open channel water transfer project because of the complex interactions among hydraulic

changes in water levels in front of pumping stations of a water transfer project in order to optimize the distribution of water resources many physically based models and data driven models have been proposed for this purpose ardiclioglu et al 2022 dasineh et al 2021 daneshfaraz et al 2022 bajirao et al 2021 physically based models mainly use saint venant equations and control equations of hydraulic structures to predict the state of water flow shayannejad et al 2022 ostad ali askari et al 2018 despite of their clear physical meaning these methods also require the data of engineering and topographic parameters data driven methods have found widespread use because they avoid hydraulic modeling and directly explore the relationships between data pirnazar et al 2018 ostad ali askari et al 2017b ostad ali askari and shayannejad 2021 singh et al 2022 over the past years data driven models have been widely used for predicting water levels in rivers li et al 2020 tao et al 2021 lakes kisi et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 and groundwater barzegar et al 2017 ghasemlounia et al 2021 li et al 2015 found that artificial neural network ann was as accurate as the hydrodynamic model but the calculation time of ann was shorter castillo botón et al 2020 employed ann and support vector machine svm for water level prediction in a hydropower reservoir in calicia spain chen et al 2020 proposed a model combining auto regressive ar analysis and non stationary tidal harmonic analysis ns tide to improve the short term daily water level prediction of estuaries under the influence of tides guo et al 2018 proposed an improved least squares support vector machine lssvm model for water level prediction in the middle reaches of the yangtze river china however these methods may have some constraints such as low learning rate and falling into local minimum in the prediction elm is an efficient learning algorithm because of its fast learning speed and high prediction performance hua et al 2022 sulaiman et al 2022 wang et al 2022 and it is better than ann and svm in overcoming the local minimum problem in the regression analysis li et al 2022 a possible way to improve the prediction accuracy of elm is to combine with intelligent algorithms such as particle swarm optimization algorithm pso li and wei 2020 the beetle antennae search bas algorithm is an efficient optimization algorithm inspired by the foraging and mate seeking behaviors of the beetle jiang and li 2018 and it is simpler and faster than pso and many other intelligent optimization algorithms sun et al 2019 xu et al 2020 however it is easy to fall into local optimization as only a single beetle is considered in order to overcome this problem this paper proposes an ibas algorithm in which the search direction is increased and the optimal individual and levy flight are introduced to prevent the algorithm from falling into local optimum then the ibas algorithm is used to optimize the weight and bias of elm to improve the prediction accuracy it should also be noted that previous water level prediction models have focused on rivers lakes and groundwater but little is known about water level prediction in water transfer projects where the water level can be significantly affected by hydraulic buildings especially those projects with cascade pumping stations the switching of pumping units can cause sudden changes in the flow and consequently the water level in front of the pumping station which makes it more difficult for water level prediction in this study the ibas elm model is proposed in order to accurately predict the water level in front of the pumping station which is greatly affected by human regulation first the data are divided into unregulated and regulated periods of the pumping station which are predicted separately to reduce the interference between them second in order to improve the prediction accuracy of the model in the regulated period the regulation time of the pumping station and the discharge after regulation are taken into account in the model input finally the ibas algorithm is used to optimize the parameters of elm model in order to further improve the prediction accuracy of the model the main innovations of this paper are as follows 1 the search ability of the bas algorithm is improved by increasing the search direction and introducing the optimal individual and levy flight 2 the ibas algorithm is used to optimize the weight and bias of elm to improve the prediction accuracy 3 the data are divided into regulated and unregulated periods for water level prediction according to whether the unit is regulated or not 4 model input in the regulated period is improved considering the regulation time and the discharge of the pumping station the rest of this paper is structured as follows section 2 introduces the research methods section 3 describes the research area and data section 4 presents the main results and section 5 presents the conclusions 2 methods 2 1 beetle antennae search algorithm the bas algorithm is an intelligent optimization algorithm inspired by the foraging and mate seeking behaviors of the beetle jiang and li 2018 at first the beetle does not know the exact location of the food and it uses its two antennas to detect the odor based on which the forward direction is determined the beetle will move to the left if the odor intensity detected by the left antennae is greater than that by the right antennae and move to the right if the odor intensity detected by the left antennae is lower than that by the right antennae after continuous search the beetle will eventually find the location of the food in this algorithm the calculation result is equivalent to the odor intensity of the food and the target is equivalent to the exact location of the food the beetle will determine the forward direction based on the calculation results of the two antennas the algorithm has simple structure and low complexity the calculation process is given as follows step 1 randomly generate a d dimensional vector as the antenna of the beetle and normalize the vector 1 b rands d 1 norm r a n d s d 1 where b represents the direction of the antennae rands represents the generation of a random number between 1 and 1 and norm represents the norm of the vector step 2 calculate the position of left and right antennas 2 x left x t b d t 2 x right x t b d t 2 where xleft and xright represent the positions of left and right antennas respectively xt represents the position of the beetle at the t th iteration dt represents the distance between left and right antennas at the t th iteration and the rest are the same as above step 3 the fitness function values of left and right antennas are determined and then the position of the beetle is updated jiang and li 2018 3 x t 1 x t δ t s i g n f x left f x right where f xleft and f xright represent the function values of left and right antennas of the beetle respectively δt represents the search step at the t th iteration sign represents the symbol determination function and the rest are the same as above step 4 update the search step of the beetle note that the search range of the beetle is dependent on the step size the search range will be large at larger step sizes making it easier for the miss of global optimal values but it will be narrow at smaller step sizes making it easier to fall into local optimization in order to ensure the search range and accuracy the step size is set by the linearized decreasing weight value 4 δ t 1 δ t e where e represents the attenuation factor which is in the range of 0 1 and generally taken to be 0 95 and the rest are the same as above step 5 repeat steps 1 4 until the maximum number of iterations is reached 2 2 improved beetle antennae search algorithm in the bas algorithm a single beetle with two antennas is used and the search direction is randomly generated without considering historical experience in this case it is easy to fall into local optimization in this study the bas algorithm is improved in the following aspects 1 the number of beetles is increased to 100 which increases the number of search populations and consequently the search ability of the algorithm 2 a chaotic sequence is introduced to initialize the population in a swarm intelligence search algorithm the distribution property of the initial population has an impact on the convergence of the algorithm the more uniform the distribution of the population is the faster the optimal initial value can be obtained chaos is a unique and common form of aperiodic motion in nonlinear systems and it is a long term behavior that is very sensitive to the initial conditions the unique properties of chaotic motion such as pseudo randomness ergodicity and regularity make it exhibit complex spatio temporal dynamics the use of chaotic sequence can make the initial population more uniformly distributed so that the search ability of the algorithm can be increased liu et al 2019 the logistic equation is widely used to generate chaotic sequence because of its simple structure low calculation cost and convenience the logistic equation is described as follows liu et al 2019 5 o i 1 μ o i 1 o i i 1 2 3 n where μ is the control parameter when μ is 4 and o is between 0 and 1 the system is in a chaotic state and the motion conforms to the chaotic characteristics 3 the two antennas are expanded to multiple antennas with the increase of search space and dimension the search need could not be adequately satisfied with the use of only two antennas in order to improve the search ability of the bas algorithm and avoid local optimization multiple antennas are considered and the specific number of antennas is dependent on the search space and dimension in order to make the search direction of the algorithm as scattered as possible the search directions of any two antennas are vertical or opposite to each other take six antennas in the three dimensional search space as an example first a search direction a a1 a2 a3 is randomly generated and the opposite search direction is b a1 a2 a3 at this time there is a plane perpendicular to the vector a the pink plane on the left side of fig 1 on which a vector c c1 c2 c3 is randomly selected and the opposite search direction d c1 c2 c3 is determined a b c and d are on the same plane the light green plane on the right side of fig 1 at this time there is a vector e e1 e2 e3 perpendicular to the plane and the last direction f e1 e2 e3 is opposite to the vector then each vector is normalized to calculate the position and fitness of each antenna the best direction is selected as the direction at the next moment 6 b a a norm a 7 x a x b a d t 8 f bx min f x a f x b f x c f x d f x e f x f where ba is the direction of antenna a xa is the position of antenna a f xa is the fitness of antenna a f bx is the optimal fitness bbx is the optimal direction of the beetle assuming that f bx is f xa and the next direction bbx is ba 4 individual and global optimal locations of antennas are introduced the updated formula of the improved bas is 9 x t 1 x t δ m b bx c 1 r a n d x pb x t c 2 r a n d x gb x t where c 1 and c 2 represent the learning factors xpb represents the individual optimal location xgb represents the global optimal location and the rest are the same as above 5 levy flight random walk is introduced levy flight is a random search method based on ryan distribution it is found that the trajectories of many creatures even including people are consistent with the levy flight process because of strong randomness it is often used to improve the optimization algorithm beşkirli 2022 yan et al 2020 the simulation shows that the improved algorithm based on levy flight is superior to the original one li et al 2021 then the position formula of the algorithm is li et al 2021 10 x t 1 x t 2 r a n d 1 l e v y λ where levy λ is the levy s random search path which is determined by formula 11 and the rest are the same as above 11 levy λ u v 1 λ 2 3 experimental simulation and results the performance of the ibas algorithm is compared with bas and particle swarm optimization pso algorithms in five typical benchmark function optimization problems table 1 the population number is set to 100 in pso and ibas algorithms and the iteration number is set to 200 in all algorithms each function is optimized 30 times and the optimization performance of each algorithm is evaluated by the average and standard deviation as shown in table 2 table 2 reveals that the optimization results of the ibas algorithm are closest to the theoretical values and have the smallest standard deviations notably the average is only 1 48e 9 2 24e 4 and 5 92e 8 for sphere ackley and zakharov function respectively which is close to the theoretical value of 0 and the standard deviation is only 2 20e 10 1 22e 5 and 1 97e 8 indicating high stability of the algorithm it is clear that the ibas algorithm is better than bas and pso algorithms in terms of accuracy and stability 2 4 extreme learning machine elm is a special feedforward neural network developed on the basis of single layer feedforward neural network it eliminates the need of repeated adjustment of the weight and threshold of the model and thus greatly improves the operation efficiency of the model compared with traditional neural network algorithms elm has the advantages of global optimal solution short training time and strong generalization ability it consists of three layers input layer hidden layer and output layer assuming that the number of inputs outputs and neurons in the hidden layer is n m and l respectively the elm network model can be expressed as hua et al 2022 12 i 1 l β i g w i s j b i y j where w i is the input weight β i is the output weight b i is the bias of the hidden layer neurons g x is the activation function of the hidden layer s j is the network input and y j is the network output 2 5 ibas optimized elm some problems may arise from the random selection of input weights and biases in elm such as low generalization ability in this study the ibas algorithm is used to optimize the input weights and biases of elm to improve its learning performance here the average error of elm is set as the optimization objective gao et al 2022 13 f i 1 t y i y i t where f is the optimization objective y i is the output value of elm yi is the true value and t is the number of samples 2 6 performance evaluation of prediction models four indexes are

515 billion m3 water to the jiaodong area and thus plays a critical role in the social and economic development of the area yan et al 2021 the 90 54 km long section from songzhuang sluice to bushang sluice consisting of 2 pumping stations and 20 inverted siphons is selected as the study area fig 2 where the bottom width of the channel is 3 50 8 20 m the side slope coefficient is 1 2 and the bottom slope is 0 05 0 10 in order to ensure the accuracy in water level prediction the data in regulated and unregulated periods of the pumping station are used separately the regulated period means that pumping units are regulated in the prediction period and the unregulated period means that pumping units are not regulated in the prediction period the data of water level in front of the pumping station upstream inflow and pumping flow in the stable operation period april to june 2019 are used for training and prediction the time interval is 2 h the data are divided into training data 70 and verification data 30 4 results and discussion the future water level in front of the pumping station is mainly affected by the current water level upstream inflow and pumping flow of the downstream pumping station these three factors are selected as model inputs and the water level in front of the pumping station at the next time is selected as the model output 4 1 comparison between group and direct prediction this section compares the prediction accuracy of ibas elm bas elm pso elm and elm models under group prediction and direct prediction it is seen from tables 3 and 4 that the mae rmse and mape values for the prediction of water levels in front of the huibu pumping station in the unregulated period under group prediction are 0 0240 0 0290 m 0 0345 0 0426 m and 0 84 1 00 which are 17 85 24 65 10 32 23 86 and 21 97 26 96 lower than those under direct prediction respectively the nse values under group prediction are 0 33 0 81 higher than those under direct prediction these results suggest that more accurate prediction is obtained under group prediction in comparison to direct prediction the scatter plots of measured and predicted water levels in front of the huibu pumping station provide a more intuitive comparison between group and direct prediction fig 3 reveals that under group prediction there is a good agreement between predicted and measured water levels in the unregulated period and only a few predicted water levels differ greatly from the measured ones fig 4 reveals that under direct prediction the predicted water levels are significantly higher than the measured ones at water levels lower than 4 80 m and there is a significant deviation from the 1 1 diagonal in order to more clearly illustrate the difference between group and direct prediction the trend line red dotted line is supplemented in the figure it is found that under group prediction the trend line almost coincides with the diagonal line where the slope is close to 1 and the intercept is close to 0 while under direct prediction the trend line deviates considerably from the diagonal line it can be seen from tables 5 and 6 that the mae rmse and mape values for the prediction of water levels in front of the dongsong pumping station in the unregulated period under group prediction are 15 60 18 87 10 18 19 23 and 14 81 19 49 lower than those under direct prediction respectively and the nse values are 1 02 2 14 higher again more accurate prediction is obtained under group prediction in order to save space comparison is made only on the prediction results of the ibas elm model between group and direct prediction fig 5 shows that there is a good agreement between predicted and measured water levels under group prediction the trend line for group prediction almost coincides with the diagonal line where the slope is 1 0145 while that for direct prediction deviates substantially from the diagonal line where the slope is 1 0846 the r 2 value of the trend line for group prediction 0 9641 is larger than that for direct prediction again group prediction yields more accurate prediction results the above results suggest that group prediction is more accurate than direct prediction in the unregulated period note that the data in the unregulated period under group prediction is characterized by high consistency and correlation while the data in the regulated period under direct prediction is affected by artificial regulation which may have an impact on model training and consequently reduces the accuracy of the model it is seen from tables 7 and 8 that the mae rmse and mape values for the prediction of water levels in front of the huibu pumping station in the unregulated period under group prediction are 4 39 10 21 6 51 11 11 and 2 74 8 05 lower than those under direct prediction respectively and the nse values in the regulated period are 1 46 2 61 higher it should be noted that although group prediction is more accurate than direct prediction the accuracy level is still far from the desired level fig 6 shows that there is a substantial difference between predicted and measured water levels in front of the huibu pumping station in the regulated period whether under group or direct prediction although the slope of the trend line for group prediction 0 9977 is very close to 1 it is obviously below the diagonal line the r2 value is only 0 9214 and the points are widely scattered around the line the slope of the trend line for direct prediction is only 0 8751 and it intersects the diagonal line the r2 value is only 0 9136 and the prediction errors of some points even exceed 30 cm it is concluded that the prediction accuracy is low in the regulated period whether under group or direct prediction it is seen from tables 9 and 10 that the mae rmse and mape values for the prediction of water levels in front of the dongsong pumping station in the regulated period under group prediction are 0 0569 0 0623 m 0 0740 0 0759 m and 1 95 2 11 which are 6 88 17 18 9 14 12 11 and 6 22 15 95 lower than those under direct prediction respectively it is noted that although group prediction can improve the prediction accuracy in the regulated period the prediction accuracy under group and direct prediction is not sufficiently high fig 7 shows that although the trend line for group prediction is very close to the diagonal with a slope of 0 9839 the r2 value is only 0 8979 and the points are rather scattered similarly the r2 value of the trend line for direct prediction is only 0 892 and it deviates significantly from the diagonal line with a slope of 0 8542 thus it is less accurate for the prediction of water levels in front of the dongsong pumping station in the regulated period under the two prediction conditions for data driven models the data characteristics will determine the upper limit of the model performance xiao et al 2021 given the differences in data characteristics between regulated and unregulated periods the use of the same model structure may make it less accurate for water level prediction for time varying data it is better to classify the data into different periods in water level prediction zhao et al 2020 gu et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 used k means clustering and support vector machine classification models to classify the data of high sediment load river reaches which were predicted separately using support vector regression models the results showed that the prediction accuracy was 3 13 higher than that of the traditional model yuan et al 2022 used dynamic time warping and hierarchical clustering algorithm to classify the 19 stations on the mainstream yangtze river into 6 categories and more reliable prediction results were obtained compared to traditional models in this study the data in the prediction period is classified according to whether the pump unit is regulated or not ren et al 2020 only predicted the water level in front of the gate when there is no regulation of the gate this shows from the side that regulation of hydraulic structures has an effect on the prediction accuracy of water levels it is also noted that although group prediction can significantly improve the prediction accuracy in the unregulated period it has little impact on the prediction accuracy in the regulation period this is because although the data is separated into regulated and unregulated periods for training under group prediction the flow of the pumping station is changed in the regulated period and the regulation time and the flow after regulation are random in this circumstance the actual results may vary greatly even when the model inputs are the same there is no fixed relationship between the input and output of the model which leads to the reduction of model accuracy for this reason model inputs are improved considering the regulation time and the flow after regulation and the prediction accuracy before and after the improvement of model input is compared 4 2 comparison between different model inputs model inputs are improved in order to more accurately predict the water levels in front of the pumping station in the regulated period as the pumping station is artificially regulated the regulation time and the flow before and after the regulation could be known in advance based on which the average flow of the downstream pumping station in the next period could be calculated to reduce the complexity of the model the current water level in front of the pumping station the upstream inflow and the average flow of the downstream pumping station in the next period are taken as model inputs in the regulated period the results are shown in fig 8 and tables 11 and 12 it is seen from table 7 table 8 and table 11 that the mae rmse and mape values of the models considering model inputs for the prediction of water levels in front of the huibu pumping station in the regulated period under group prediction are 30 30 38 85 31 04 43 12 and 30 65 40 58 lower than those without considering model inputs under group prediction and 22 54 43 69 22 95 49 40 and 23 27 43 17 lower than those without considering model inputs under direct prediction respectively the nse values are 4 20 8 84 and 6 05 8 61 higher respectively it is seen from figs 6 and 8 that the trend line considering model inputs is closer to the diagonal and the r2 value 0 9725 is significantly higher than that without considering model inputs this demonstrates that the prediction accuracy in the regulated period is significantly improved with the improvement of model inputs it is seen from table 9 table 10 and table 12 that the mae rmse and mape values of the models considering model inputs under group prediction are 27 03 30 39 24 64 33 25 and 28 44 30 44 lower than those without considering model inputs under group prediction and 25 76 40 47 28 64 39 79 and 26 42 40 52 lower than those under direct prediction respectively the nse values are 5 09 6 70 and 5 62 7 24 respectively thus the improvement of model inputs leads to a significant improvement of the prediction accuracy in the regulated period it is seen from figs 7 and 9 that the slope of the trend line considering model inputs is 1 0074 and it is located slightly below the diagonal this is similar to the trend line without considering model inputs under group prediction and is significantly better than that under direct prediction however the r2 value 0 9553 is higher than that without considering model inputs under group prediction and direct prediction fig 9 also reveals that the points are scattered closer to the diagonal line after the improvement of model inputs model inputs are crucial for the prediction accuracy of water levels the accuracy of the model considering the regulation time and the flow of the pumping station is obviously improved simply because the operation of the pumping station will affect the water level change in the future when the hydrodynamic model is used to predict the water level change the changes of pumping stations gates and other control structures must be taken into account as the inner boundary of the model lei et al 2019 lu et al 2018 the same is true for data driven models zhou et al 2022 considered the future gate opening as the input of the model in the prediction of the water level in front of the gate of the middle route south to north water transfer project it should be noted that although the prediction accuracy in the regulated period can be significantly improved with the improvement of model inputs it differs between regulated and unregulated periods especially in the huibu pumping station this may be attributed to the differences in the manual recording of the regulation time because dispatchers often work in three shifts and they may have different recording habits that lead to substantial differences in the recording of the regulation time there are few data in the regulated period which makes it difficult for the model to learn the relationship between the data in the training process and thus leads to lower prediction accuracy compared to the unregulated period the presence of some errors in data monitoring also reduces the prediction accuracy of the model in the future research hydrodynamic model simulation can be used to increase data samples and filtering model can be used to reduce data noise to further improve the prediction accuracy of the model 4 3 comparison between different prediction models this section only compares the prediction results in the unregulated period and that in the regulated period after improvement of model inputs under group prediction table 3 reveals that the mae rmse and mape values of the ibas elm model for predicted water levels in front of the huibu pumping station in the unregulated period 0 0240 0 0345 and 0 84 are 1 23 18 09 5 22 19 01 and 0 18 45 lower than those of other models respectively and the nse value 0 9911 is 0 10 0 47 higher than that of other models similarly table 5 shows that the mae rmse and mape values of the ibas elm model for predicted water levels in front of the dongsong pumping station in the unregulated period 0 0265 0 0369 and 0 88 respectively are 1 85 9 56 1 07 8 44 and 2 22 9 28 lower than those of other models respectively and the nse value 0 9633 is 0 09 0 74 higher than that of other models table 11 reveals that the mae rmse and mape values for the prediction of water levels in front of the huibu pumping station in the regulated period are smallest 0 0602 0 0715 and 2 26 in the ibas elm model which are 0 66 28 50 1 65 30 18 and 0 27 10 lower than those in other models respectively although the mape value of the bas elm model is equal to that of the ibas elm model it has higher mae and rmse values the nse value 0 9718 is 0 10 3 05 higher than that of other models table 12 reveals that the mae rmse and mape values for the prediction of water levels in front the dongsong pumping station in the regulated period are also smallest 0 0409 0 0507 and 1 38 in the ibas elm model which are 3 54 12 42 3 24 12 89 and 3 50 12 10 lower than those in other models respectively the nse value 0 9569 is 0 29 1 43 higher than that of other models thus the ibas elm model has higher prediction accuracy than other models fig 3 reveals that the trend line of the bas elm model is slightly higher than the diagonal line at water levels below 4 60 m and the trend lines of other models almost coincides with the diagonal line with a slope close to 1 however the r2 value of the ibas elm model is slightly larger than those of other models which indicates that the prediction result of the ibas elm model is closer to the diagonal it is seen from figs 8 and 10 that the trend line of the ibas elm model almost coincides with the diagonal line while the trend lines of other models deviate from the diagonal line to varying extents the slope 0 9784 is closer to 1 compared to other models and the r2 value 0 9725 is slightly lower than that of the bas elm model see fig 11 similar results are observed for the dongsong pumping station and will not be elaborated here in order to save space in general the use of the optimization algorithm to optimize elm model parameters can improve the prediction accuracy of the model however the optimization algorithm may easily fall into local optimization due to the influence of population number and search efficiency in this study an ibas model is proposed to improve the search ability of the bas algorithm by using multiple individuals rather than a single individual and the number of antennas per individual the directions of all antennas are perpendicular or opposite to each other which can increase the search direction of the algorithm as much as possible and thus improve its search ability in high dimensional space levy flight is introduced into the model to prevent the model from falling into local optimum because of its strong randomness beşkirli 2022 levy flight has been used to improve bat algorithm li et al 2021 and whale optimization algorithm yan et al 2020 it is also seen in section 2 3 that ibas produces more accurate and stable search results than bas and pso therefore better prediction results are obtained with the use of the elm model optimized by ibas 5 conclusions in this study the ibas algorithm is proposed to improve the search ability of the bas algorithm by increasing the search direction and introducing the optimal value and levy flight and then it is used to optimize the parameters of the elm model to improve the prediction ability the data are divided into regulated and unregulated periods for water level prediction according to whether the unit is regulated or not model inputs are improved considering the regulation time and the flow before and after regulation in the regulated period to further improve the model accuracy the results show that 1 group prediction can significantly improve the prediction accuracy in the unregulated period but it has little effect on the prediction accuracy in the regulated period the mae rmse and mape values in the unregulated period under group prediction are 15 60 24 65 10 18 23 86 and 14 81 26 96 lower than those under direct prediction respectively and the nse values are 0 33 2 14 higher 2 the prediction accuracy in the regulated period is significantly improved with the improvement of model inputs the mae rmse and mape values after improvement of model inputs are 27 03 38 85 24 64 43 12 and 28 44 40 58 lower than those without improvement of model inputs and the nse values are 4 20 8 84 higher 3 the ibas elm model has higher prediction accuracy than other models examined the mae rmse and mape values of the ibas elm model are 0 66 28 50 1 07 30 18 and 0 27 10 lower than those of other models respectively and the nse value is 0 09 3 05 higher in general the proposed model can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of water levels in front of the pumping station however the model performance will be affected by the quality and quantity of data and low prediction accuracy would be expected in case of low data quality and quantity in the future hydrodynamic simulation can be used to increase data samples and filtering model can be used to reduce data noise in order to further improve the prediction

soil vegetation and water surfaces however the urban ei process was overlooked mainly due to its low amount in this study the urban ei was determined by eddy correlation ec observations combined with a flux footprint model and urban land use information for two urban ec sites the evaluation of flux data quality indicated that more than 76 of observed flux data can be used for ei analysis at the two stations during rainy periods the daily urban ei exhibited high intermittent temporal patterns the ei value was 0 during the non rainy period and peaked on the following 1 2 days after the rainy event then gradually decreased to 0 the average daily ei accounted for 11 14 of the total et for the two ec stations during the rainy period further analysis indicated that urban ei significantly altered the urban energy balance and turbulent transport processes the urban ei reduced sensible heat flux h and bowen ratio br during the rainfall period thereby playing a vital role in mitigating urban heat land effect moreover urban ei improved the turbulent transport efficiency of latent heat flux rwq and restored turbulent transport similarity in an urban area the temporal characteristics of urban ei exhibited a large discrepancy among different impervious surface materials which mainly depend on the water retention and thermodynamic properties of the impervious surface gravel had the best water retention capability and resulted in the highest spatially averaged ei while the concrete surface had the best thermal storage capability and resulted in the longest duration time of ei the spatial average of urban ei and its duration time were positively correlated with the water retention and heat storage capabilities of impervious surface materials this study gained insight into urban ei including its determination method temporal characteristics controlling factors and impacts of urban ei on the regional energy balance and turbulent transport process keywords urban impervious surface evaporation flux footprint eddy correlation turbulent transport similarity impervious surface material data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction terrestrial evapotranspiration et is closely related to climate change water safety ecological restoration and agricultural irrigation oki and kanae 2006 wang and dickinson 2012 tu and yang 2022 previously et in natural ecosystems and cultivated areas has been extensively studied using the modelling and measuring methods e g kustas and norman 1999 fisher et al 2008 kool et al 2014 talsma et al 2018 chen et al 2020 2021 however relatively few studies on urban et result in less understanding of its response on urban microclimate and urban hydrology e g grimmond and oke 1986 1991 ramamurthy and bou zeid 2014 2017 vulova et al 2021 the significant difference between et in the urban ecosystem and natural ecosystem is that urban et does not only consists of soil evaporation vegetation transpiration and water surface evaporation but also involves the evaporation from artificial surfaces e g houses buildings and traffic areas hanna et al 2011 vesala et al 2017 chen et al 2022a b the water retention and thermodynamics properties for artificial impervious areas are quite distinct from natural vegetation soil and water body areas leading to different heat transfer and turbulent transport processes ramamurthy and bou zeid 2014 wong et al 2015 oke 1982 suggested that the urban impervious surfaces significantly altered the regional hydrological cycle and energy balance and emphasized that impervious areas are not deserts unfortunately we are still rudimentary about the characteristics of evaporation from urban impervious surfaces ei and their response mechanisms to the urban thermal environment and microclimate a large number of previous studies have shown that the evaporation from urban impervious surfaces was zero or close to zero based on the in situ observations or modelling simulations oke et al 1999 kato and yamaguchi 2007 wong et al 2015 chen et al 2022a b for instance oke et al 1999 found the ratio of latent heat flux to net radiative flux le rn was only 0 04 in central mexico city based on the urban flux tower measurements kato and yamaguchi 2007 estimated the energy balance components in nagoya japan using the thermal infrared satellite image which reported the le rn value varied within 0 0 04 for the commercial road and impervious areas wong et al 2015 developed an energy balance conceptualization based method for modelling anthropogenic heat flux in hong kong they suggested that the le in impervious urban areas was generally lower than 10 w m2 ranged from 5 to 10 w m2 on 11 oct 2012 and 3 to 8 75 w m2 on 13 jan 2013 recently chen et al 2022a demonstrated the le in tianjin china ranged between 0 and 33 6 w m2 with an average value of 17 3 w m2 it seems that most previous studies have accepted the view that urban ei is quite low as explained by the lower water retention capacity of impervious surface that result no water available for evaporation wong et al 2015 faridatul et al 2020 song 2021 zhou et al 2021 chen et al 2022a however the current research on urban ei has considerable limitations due to large uncertainties in measuring and modeling methods the first limitation is the lack of appropriate in situ measurement technology to determine urban ei as a standard et observation method eddy covariance ec technology has been widely applied to measure et in natural ecosystems cultivated lands and urban areas e g coutts et al 2005 vesala et al 2008 kordowski and kuttler 2010 menzer et al 2015 vulova et al 2021 duarte rocha et al 2022 chen et al 2022a b although the ec technology enriched people s understanding of urban water heat and energy transmission processes the et measured by the ec system represents the flux sources from multiple urban surfaces e g vegetation soil water and impervious surfaces while their individual contributions to the total et cannot be distinguished in addition the heterogeneity of flux sources sinks caused by the urban surface inhomogeneity will further lead to the advection errors which brings another challenge to interpreting raw ec measuring data in the complex urban turbulent environment grimmond et al 2002 finally it is known that the ec systems often suffer from energy closure problems where the sum of le and sensible heat flux h are lower than the rn minus ground heat flux g le h rn g twine et al 2000 liu et al 2011 zhou and xin 2019 this energy non closure problem is more severe in urban areas due to the high heterogeneity of urban surfaces and the impact of anthropogenic heat fluxes on surface energy balance järvi et al 2012 vulova et al 2021 duarte rocha et al 2022 chen et al 2022a b consequently these limitations associated with the ec technology restricted its ability to observe evaporation from urban impervious surfaces another challenge is that it is difficult to continuously and accurately estimate urban ei the development of the urban et model started from the pioneering work by grimmond and oke 1986 the model was modified by grimmond and oke 1991 where the et in urban areas was estimated using the improved penman monteith formula for the last two decades researchers have made many efforts to apply energy balance theory to estimate urban et lemonsu et al 2007 proposed a town energy balance teb scheme which adopted a water and energy coupled way to estimate urban et liu et al 2010 developed a satellite based energy balance urban et model järvi et al 2011 conducted a surface urban energy and water balance scheme suews faridatul et al 2020 applied the urban surface energy balance algorithm for land useabl model to simulate et in dhaka bangladesh recently the multiple source energy balance urban et models has also been proposed to gain the capability to partition urban et into its components e g separate evaporation from vegetation soil water and impervious surface the popular multiple source energy balance urban et models include modified two source energy balance tseb model jiang and weng 2017 three dimensional 3d transpiration and photosynthesis model bournez et al 2017 three temperature 3 t model qiu et al 2017 qin et al 2022 zhang et al 2020a b 2022 xiong et al 2022 three sources and four sources energy balance model chen et al 2022a b another prevalent urban et approach is the so called urban canopy model ucm kusaka et al 2001 kondo et al 2005 ucm successfully integrated urban landforms structures and morphology into the parameterization scheme of ground atmosphere interaction such as the height of the roof wall and ground surface hagishima and tanimoto 2005 ryu et al 2011 lee 2011 the et in ucm is determined through the atmospheric boundary layer theory miao et al 2014 wang et al 2021 the latest version of ucm further coupled the contribution of vegetation to urban et through the tiling or integration approaches lee 2011 ban weiss and vahmani 2016 vahmani and ban weiss 2016 generally the detailed geometric description in ucm advanced the simulation accuracy of urban energy exchange and heat transfer processes although various types of urban et models have been widely developed significant challenges remain for accurately estimating urban ei the conventional single source energy and water balance models can only estimate the total urban et but cannot divide its components resulting in urban ei not being available recently proposed multi source energy balance models gained the capability to estimate urban ei however these models typically rely upon thermal infrared satellite images to parameterize urban sensible and latent heat fluxes chen et al 2022a b unfortunately the thermal infrared satellite based urban et models can only map the urban ei distribution on cloud free days but cannot obtain urban ei during rainy periods due to the extensive cloud coverage mitchell et al 1977 molnar and coakley 1985 it shall be reminded that the amount of urban ei in the rainy period is significantly larger than that in the non rainy period ramamurthy and bou zeid 2014 in addition these satellite based et models cannot obtain continuous daily ei values limited by the satellite return visit period as a result there is still a lack of customized method to continuously determine urban ei the flux footprint approach also called the source weight function describes the relationship between observed et flux and the spatial distribution of surface sources sinks in the near surface layer chu et al 2021 kong et al 2022 the flux footprint contours can well trace the average or cumulative condition of the surface fluxes to the ec observations thus it opens up the opportunity to accurately estimate urban ei based on the ec observation data sogachev et al 2004 wang and rotach 2010 at present the flux footprint approach has been widely applied in the ground validation of satellite based energy balance or photosynthesis models e g kong et al 2022 chen et al 2021 vulova et al 2021 however no identified studies combined the flux footprint approach and ec observations to estimate urban ei common impervious surface materials include concrete asphalt tile and gravel which are widely used to construct buildings and roads in urban areas grimmond and oke 1986 1991 ramamurthy and bou zeid 2014 vulova et al 2021 previous research shown that these impervious surfaces had different water retention and thermodynamic properties ramamurthy and bou zeid 2014 however there is currently a lack of deep understanding of the ei characteristics under different impervious surface materials suppose the response mechanism of ei under different impermeable surface materials cannot be accurately identified in that case it will bring significant obstacles to devising various policy initiatives to alleviate the urban heat island effect and propose scientific urban water resources management plans in order to more accurately estimate the urban ei and reveal its impact on the urban energy balance and turbulent transport process this study includes the following objectives 1 to conduct an urban ei method that is based on the flux footprint approach and ground ec observations 2 to identify the temporal characteristics of urban ei during the rainy and non rainy periods 3 to distinguish the contribution of urban ei to total urban et 4 to analyze the impact of urban ei on the urban energy balance and turbulent transport processes and 5 to reveal the relationships between the water retention and thermodynamic properties of impervious materials and urban ei this study will provide a deep understanding of urban ei including its determination method temporal characteristics controlling factors and implications for the turbulent transport of water and heat on the atmosphere boundary layer of urban areas 2 methodology 2 1 study region to provide a comprehensive understanding about the characteristics of urban ei under different climates two urban ec sites were selected for the ei analysis in this study the first ec tower is located in a coastal megacity in northern china tianjin and the second ec tower is located in a coastal megacity in southern china shenzhen specifically tower 1 was installed at the campus of nankai university in the southern suburbs of tianjin nk station 38 59 n 117 20 e altitude 3 m height 10 m the surrounding land use consists of 55 6 impervious surface within a 5 km radius tower 2 was installed near the chiao reservoir in the eastern suburbs of shenzhen ca station 22 24 n 114 13 e altitude 110 m height 20 m the surrounding land use consists of 29 1 impervious surface within a 5 km radius there is a considerable proportion of impervious surfaces traffic areas buildings etc around both two ec towers therefore the observation results from the two ec sites can well reflect the exchange and turbulent diffusion processes of water vapour and heat fluxes from urban artificial surfaces the impervious surface material composition around the two sites is significantly different the buildings and roads around the nk site are made of concrete while the surrounding area of the ca site includes concrete surfaces and large areas of asphalt pavement roofs around both sites are mainly covered with tile but a small fraction of gravel roofs existed around the nk site furthermore the cross slopes of the traffic roads around the two sites are also different since the two cities are situated in different climatic zones tianjin has a warm temperate semi humid monsoon climate with annual precipitation ranging between 360 970 mm the cross slope of the traffic road near the nk station is relatively lower approximate 1 8 while shenzhen has a south subtropical monsoon climate and the annual precipitation is significantly larger than tianjin ranging between 913 2662 mm as a result the cross slope of the traffic road near the ca station is designed to be larger for faster drainage approximate 2 9 fig 1 shows the geographic locations of the two ec towers and the schematic diagrams of two cross slope shoulders 2 2 field observations 2 2 1 flux and meteorological observations both two ec towers used infrared laser analyzers to measure water vapour and carbon dioxide co2 concentrations li 7500 for nk station and ec 150 for ca station and used a sonic anemometer thermometer to measure wind speeds and sonic temperatures in three directions irgason campbell scientific usa the measuring frequency of water vapour and wind speeds were both 10 hz in order to prevent the open circuit laser analyzers from being affected by the rain a transparent baffle was placed above the two open circuit ec systems to protect laser sensors during rainy events the half hour et fluxes and heat fluxes were determined using the eddypro software li cor fratini et al 2012 onalenna et al 2018 duarte rocha et al 2022 after the flux calculations data need to be preprocessed to make necessary corrections these preprocessing procedures consist of double rotation dr frequency response correction for high frequency losses ultrasound virtual correction for sonic temperature schotanus correction for relative humidity webb pearman and leuning wpl correction for air density effect moncrieff et al 1997 webb et al 1980 duarte rocha et al 2022 moreover the flux quality control was performed to exclude abnormal flux data 1 the wild point greater than five standard deviations were excluded 2 the observed flux data with flag quality larger than one was excluded 3 the observed flux data beyond the physically reasonable range were excluded 4 the negative et values at nighttime was excluded due to condensation rather than evaporation 5 the observed flux data with abnormal bowen ratio br h le i e br 100 and br 100 was excluded for the two ec stations to generate continuous et flux observations gap filling is required to interpolate the missed flux data duarte rocha et al 2022 for missing flux data within 2 h the linear interpolation method was used for imputation for missing flux data greater than 2 h the marginal distribution sampling mds method was used for imputation falge et al 2001 wutzler et al 2018 duarte rocha et al 2022 where the mds method takes into account the effect of meteorological factors on seasonal et variation for the observed energy balance components rn g le and h the energy balance closure was corrected using bowen ratio br method for the two ec stations twine et al 2000 mauder 2020 bowen ratio method assigned underestimated energy to le and h based on br value wohlfahrt et al 2009 pan et al 2017 in addition to the et flux and heat flux observations the two ec systems also had the observations of mourning obukhov length l frictional wind speed u and water vapour density etc furthermore the in situ measurements of meteorological factors were conducted around the two sites rainwise portlog the seven conventional meteorological factors including air temperature long wave and short wave radiation relative humidity vapour pressure deficit wind speed and precipitation were continuously measured in every half hour table 1 summarizes the specific information of the two ec sites the water retention capabilities of four typical concrete materials concrete gravel asphalt and tile were measured through the bulk density method specifically the samples of four types concrete materials were put into plexiglass centrifuge tubes then the saturated water content of the four types of concrete materials were measured after they were completely saturated with water the samples of four types concrete were further put into a high speed refrigerated centrifuge to measure the water content under different centrifuge revolutions and pressures settings finally the the water characteristic curves for the four typical concrete materials can be obtained the measuring results suggested that gravel had the strongest water retention capability 10 mm followed by concrete 1 mm asphalt 0 5 mm and tile 0 1 mm 2 2 2 flux data quality evaluation since urban ei is estimated using ec observations during both of rainy and non rainy periods it is necessary to perform a quality assessment of the measured et fluxes data the quality evaluation of flux data includes turbulence stationarity test tst and turbulent variance similarity test tvst liu et al 2011 2013 forken et al 2004 the tst requires the covariance of turbulence remain stable within an observation time step for example the mean of the covariance of water vapor concentration and wind speed during the 30 min is equal to the sum mean of the covariance of water vapor concentration and wind speed for each 5 min the expression of the stationarity coefficient st for the tst is shown in eq 1 1 st w c 5 w c 30 w c 30 100 where w represents the vertical wind speed c represents the water vapor concentration the superscript represents the fluctuations of w and c the subscripts 5 and 30 indicates 5 min and 30 min time periods the monin obukhov similarity theory applies only when turbulence is fully developed the objective of tvst is to check the consistency of the ratio of the measured vertical wind speed variance σw and the frictional wind speed u with the simulated σw u based on the mourning obukhov similarity theory the expression for the overall turbulence characteristic coefficient itc is shown in eq 2 2 itc σ w u s σ w u o σ w u o where σw u s represents the simulated σw u value by mourning obukhov similarity theory σw u o represents the observed σw u value by ec system finally the quality of the observed et flux is evaluated according to the testing results of the tst and tvst foken et al 2004 the overall flux data quality is classified as 9 categories best quality categories 1 3 better quality categories 4 6 medium quality recommended to qualitative analysis categories 7 8 poor quality recommended to remove categories 9 the specific flux data quality categories and classification criterion are presented in tables a1 and a2 2 3 flux footprint of the ec system 2 3 1 description of flux footprint model the flux source area needs to be determined for the two sites before the ei calculation the flux footprint model has widely used to trace the flux sources of ec observations for natural ecosystems and farmland areas e g sogachev et al 2004 wang and rotach 2010 recent studies applied the flux footprint model to the flux trace for urban ec systems e g vulova et al 2021 duarte rocha et al 2022 chen et al 2022a b in the present study the half hour flux footprint was firstly estimated using the flux footprint model and then aggregated to the daily scale chu et al 2021 kong et al 2022 to improve the computational efficiency this study used the analytical footprint model that is based on the euler analytic function to calculate the flux source area kormann and meixner 2001 the euler analytic method is an explicit function where the method derives the analytical solution of the flux footprint using a series of atmospheric boundary layer parameters e g the wind speed profile in the near surface layer the turbulent diffusion coefficient profile and the similarity of the near surface layer kormann and meixner 2001 zhang 2018 the specific operation process of the euler analytic method is presented below assuming the relationship between vertical profiles of the near surface horizontal wind speed uz and eddy diffusivity coefficient k can be written as a power function shown as eqs 3 and 4 3 u z z u z m 4 k z k 0 z n where uz z is the vertical profile of the reynolds averaged wind velocity l t

kormann and meixner 2001 zhang 2018 m is the exponent of the wind velocity power law unitless and n is the exponent of the eddy diffusivity power law unitless the two exponent parameters are calculated using the following formulas 5 m z u z u z z u k φ m u z 6 n z k k z where u is the friction wind speed l t k is the von kaman constant k 0 4 φm is the universal function of momentum

is the correction coefficient of momentum transfer stability unitless φh is the universal function of heat transfer the u and k0 can be solved after bringing eqs 7 and 8 to eqs 3 and 4 the crosswind

zm was normalized kormann and meixner 2001 zhang 2018 then the calculated flux contribution results were sorted and all of flux contribution results were accumulated until a given effective fetch value p was reached the source area ωp is defined as including all the pixels within the effective fetch p and the effective fetch p is defined as the ratio of the area of the cumulative flux footprint to the area of the maximum flux footprint given as eq 15 kormann and meixner 2001 zhang 2018 15 p ω p ω tot ω p f ec x y z m d x d y f ec x y z m d x d y where ωp and ωtot are the integrals

challenge in application of flux footprint models for urban areas is to consider the impervious surface on aerodynamic roughness zom determination eq 7 in this study an enhanced parametric scheme for zom was applied in urban areas the new zom parameterization scheme accounted for the effects of morphological characteristics of buildings and roads on urban turbulent transport which significantly improved the reliability of the zom and flux source area estimates for urban area huang et al 2021 the enhanced parameterization scheme of zom for urban area are shown in eqs 17 and 18 17 z om h av 1

through the floor number of buildings cb represents the coefficient that reflects the building drag set to 1 2 unitless rt represents the crown radius for the trees around the flux tower l pv represents the ratio of drag coefficient of vegetation to drag coefficient of building parameterized through guan et al 2000 one metric to test the applicability of modified flux footprint model in urban area is whether the estimated flux source area can explain 100 of the cumulative flux contribution chen et al 2009 fig 2 present the relationship between annual cumulative footprint and corresponding footprint areas km2 for the two ec stations as envisaged in fig 2 the footprint areas varied from 0 to 2 4 km2 when cumulative footprint ranged between 0 and 100 for nk station the footprint areas varied from 0 to 4 3 km2 when cumulative footprint ranged between 0 and 100 for ca station the flux footprint area exhibited a significant positive relationship with cumulative footprint value and increased rapidly with increased cumulative footprint value this result suggested that the enhanced urban flux footprint model successfully captured the flux footprint of the urban ec system under different cumulative footprint conditions therefore the enhanced flux footprint model is applicable and reliable in mapping flux footprint weight distribution for urban areas with high degree of heterogeneity 2 4 determination of half hour and daily ei ei was calculated from the relative weight distribution of the flux footprint map and the land use map around the two ec sites the core idea is to accumulate the ei values of each impervious surface pixel according to the relative weight distribution of flux footprint the specific operation processes are given as the following 1 the relative weight distribution of the flux source areas was mapped using the flux footprint model for every half hour 2 the sentinel 2 satellite imagery around the two stations was downloaded from the european space agency esa official website https sentinel esa int web sentinel missions sentinel 2 at a spatial resolution of 10 m the deep learning method was applied to extract land use and land cover information within a 5 km radius of the two ec towers luus et al 2015 burud 2021 3 the land use and land cover image around the two ec towers were superimposed on the relative weight distribution of the flux source map according to their latitude and longitude then meshing the flux footprint map and ensuring the grid resolution of the flux footprint map is aligned with the spatial resolution of satellite imagery 10 m 4 the impervious surface pixels were extracted from the land use and land cover map and the latitude and longitude of each impervious surface pixel was recorded 5 the weight value for a specific impervious surface pixel was extracted from the relative weight flux footprint map according to the latitude and longitude of the impervious surface pixel 6 the weight value of each impervious surface pixel was accumulated to obtain the total weight of flux footprint contribution for all impervious surface pixels shown as eq 19 19 w i w 1 w 2 w 3 w n where wi is the total weights of flux footprint contribution for all impervious surface pixels wn is the weights of flux footprint contribution for each impervious surface pixel 7 the half hour ei was calculated through the observed et value multiplied by the total weights of flux footprint contribution of the impervious surface wi shown as eq 20 20 e i et w i et w 1 w 2 w 3 w n the daily ei was calculated as the sum of ei for all available half hours in a single day it is mentioned that the proposed urban ei method realized continuous calculation of half hour and daily ei values since the method is based on the in situ ec observation temporal resolution of half hour and flux footprint model therefore the newly developed method overcomed the limitation that cannot continuously estimate ei in the conventional satellite based ei method the operation flow chart of the proposed urban ei method is demonstrated in fig 3 3 results and analysis 3 1 measured flux data quality fig 4 shows the quality assessment results of the observed flux data at the two ec stations during the rainy and non rainy periods the rainy period is defined as the first day to the seventh day after the rainy event as envisage in fig 4 the quality of ec flux observations in the non rainy period was better than that in the rainy period the overall flux quality testing of the non rainy period was generally classified as 1 4 while the overall flux quality testing of the rainy period was generally classified as 3 8 for the two ec stations specifically the average category values were 3 4 4 4 and 5 3 for tst tvst and overall quality testing during the rainy period at the nk station the corresponding values were 2 0 2 4 and 2 2 during the non rainy period at the nk station similar testing results also appleared at the ca station where the average category values were 3 1 4 1 and 4 7 for tst tvst and overall quality during the rainy period and 2 4 2 4 and 2 5 during the non rainy period at the ca station for nk station more than 76 of observed flux data had an overall data quality category lower than 7 during rainy periods for ca station more than 78 of observed flux data had an overall data quality category lower than 7 during rainy periods the measured flux data with overall quality as categories 7 and 8 were excluded in the subsequent ei calculations for the two ec stations the above testing results indicated that while the quality of the observed flux data in the rainy period was worse than that in the non rainy period the observed flux data in the rainy period can also be used for urban ei analysis since the two ec stations had more than 75 measured flux data with overall quality category lower than 7 during rainy periods 3 2 distribution of flux footprint contours the 70 80 and 95 flux footprint contours were calculated and mapped using the analytical footprint model kormann and meixner 2001 fig 5 a d shows the flux footprint contours during the selected rainy and non rainy periods for the two ec stations 13 jul 27 jul rainy period for nk station 17 may 31 may non rainy period for nk station 08 sep 22 sep rainy period for ca station and 01 jan 15 jan non rainy period for ca station the rainfall amount during the selected two rainy periods were larger than 70 mm fig 5 e h also presents the half hour flux footprint contours for the two ec stations generally the half hour flux footprint contours presented an elliptical and symmetrical shape in the upwind direction of the two ec towers moreover the total area within the flux footprint contours increased exponentially from 70 to 95 contours indicating that most of the flux footprint is from the areas close to the ec tower although the flux source area between the 80 and 95 flux footprint contours was significantly larger than the flux source area between the 70 and 80 flux footprint contours these regions contributed minimally to the observed fluxes of the two ec towers similar flux footprint contour patterns also reported in the ec observations for the natural ecosystems chu et al 2021 kong et al 2022 and cultivated lands song et al 2016 liu et al 2016 intercomparison of the 95 flux footprint contours for the rainy and non rainy periods suggested that the land use composition within 95 flux footprint contours were similar during a longer temporal periods e g longer than 10 days for example the fractional impervious surface fi within the 95 flux footprint contours was 0 49 from 13 jul 27 jul at nk station where the corresponding statistics were 0 47 from 17 may 31 may a similar phenomenon also appeared at the ca station where the fi was 0 29 from 08 sep 22 sep and 0 30 from 01 jan 15 jan nevertheless the land use composition within 95 flux footprint contours varied in a wide range within a half hour temporal interval compare fig 5 e and 5 g 5 f and 5 h furthermore it is noted that the 70 80 and 95 flux footprint contours of the two sites are more cluttered during the rainy period than the non rainy period which is due to the changeable wind direction during the rainy period the flux footprint extent ffe represents the maximum distance from ec tower to 95 flux footprint contour ranged between 350 and 890 m for nk station and 530 and 1420 m for ca station during the whole year of 2021 the area within the 95 flux footprint contour of the ca site is larger than that of the nk site because the ec tower in ca site is higher than that of the nk site 3 3 temporal characteristics of urban ei for the two ec towers the time series of daily ei and rainfall for the two ec stations in 2021 are presented in fig 6 a b the results suggested that the daily ei exhibited highly intermittent temporal patterns at the two ec stations for non rainy periods urban ei was zero or closed to zero as the impervious surface had no available water for evaporation for rainy periods ei reached its peak on the following 1 2 days after the rain event then gradually decreased to zero the peak value of urban ei after rain events demonstrated that the heat had been stored in impervious surfaces after intensive ei the stored heat is further supplied back to maintain a high evaporation rate after rain showers ramamurthy and bou zeid 2014 the observed annual urban ei was 46 1 mm for nk station and 91 6 mm for ca station in 2021 the higher annual urban ei value in ca station is due to the more considerable annual rainfall than the nk station fig 6 c d presents the long term average half hour urban ei during the rainy period for the two stations generally the half hour ei value approximated a sinusoidal curve which reached a maximum value at mid noon and attended a minimum value at nighttime the half hour ei pattern was similar to the temporal patterns of air temperature solar radiation and total et observed by the ec system note that a very low daily ei value also appeared on a few experiment days during the non rainy period for example ei was 0 20 mm in the day of year doy 293 for nk station and 0 52 mm in doy 58 for ca station red circle marked in fig 6 one possible explanation is a sprinkler vehicle passed through the traffic area around the ec tower or a water source was artificially created furthermore the errors caused by flux footprint model are also likely responsible for the lower ei values that appeared during the non rainy periods although the temporal characteristics of urban ei were quite similar for the two ec sites the ei decline rates differed considerably between the two sites after rainfall events fig 7 shows the daily ei variations after the selected eight rainfall events at two stations these eight typical rainfall events contained different rainfall amount ranged from 8 1 to 123 2 mm which can well represent the temporal characteristics of ei under different rainfall intensities the ei value of the nk site gradually decreased to 0 within 2 6 days after the rainfall event with an average of 3 9 days for all of the rainy periods in 2021 while the ei value of the ca site gradually decreased to 0 within 2 4 days after the rainfall event with an average of 2 7 days for all of rainy periods in 2021 the faster rate of ei decline for the ca site could be explained from three aspects as the following the first reason was the larger road cross slope around the ca site which accelerates the drainage process 1 8 for the road near the nk station 2 9 for the road near the ca station secondly the different compositions of impervious surface materials around the two ec sites can contribute to the discrepancy rate of ei decline specifically the impervious surface material around the nk site is mainly concrete while the impervious surface material around the ca site included concrete and large portions of asphalt surfaces the concrete 1 mm had a better water holding capacity than asphalt 0 5 mm according to our testing results and previous findings grimmond and oke 1986 1991 ramamurthy and bou zeid 2014 therefore the concrete surfaces are able to sustain impervious surfaces evaporation for a longer time than asphalt surfaces and lead to a lower ei decline rate the last reason was the existence of a small fraction of gravel roofs around the nk station which was very common in northern china but unusual in southern china due to dirt buildup and pore clogging gravel roofs can hold water up to 10 mm in short those mentioned above demonstrated that the impervious surface evaporation mainly occurred during the rainy periods and reached its peak within 1 2 days after the rainfall events and gradually decreased to zero additionally the decline rate of urban ei mainly depends on the impervious surface material and cross slope 3 4 contributions of urban ei to total urban et a significant advantage of the flux footprint method is that it has the capability to distinguish evaporation from various urban land uses we further calculated urban et components including soil evaporation vegetation transpiration water body evaporation and evaporation from different impervious surface materials and their contributions to the total observed et flux based on the flux footprint model ec observations and urban land use information the temporal variations of the ratio of ei to total urban et ei et for the two stations are presented in fig 8 the daily ei et values were closed to 0 during the non rainy period for the two stations the average daily ei et was 0 11 for the nk station and 0 14 for the ca station during the rainy period for the whole year of 2021 the average daily ei et was 0 07 for the nk station and 0 09 for the ca station if only 1 2 days after rainfall events were selected for analysis the ei et value increased significantly to 0 47 for the nk station and 0 52 for the ca station the results indicated the urban ei accounted for a considerable proportion of total et when impervious surfaces were covered with sufficient water while the transpiration and evaporation from vegetation and soil surfaces dominated the observed et flux during the non rainy periods and last several days during the rainy periods this is solid evidence that while impervious surfaces occupied a small proportion of urban et they significantly altered the urban hydrological cycle and energy balance processes especially for the 1 2 days following rainfall events the ei rate just after rainfall events was higher than that of soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration due to the small surface resistance on the impervious surfaces it shall be mentioned that under the sufficient water supply condition vegetation transpiration is controlled by the opening degree of vegetation stomata and soil evaporation is limited by soil infiltration and pore resistance kuchment et al 2006 zhang et al 2017 while the evaporation from impervious surfaces is close to its potential rate chen et al 2022a b the urban ei in different impervious surface materials also exhibited significantly different temporal patterns fig 9 displays the half hour ei variation from various impervious surfaces at the ca station asphalt concrete and roof the selected four rainy events had wide range of rainfall intensities 8 1 123 2 mm as envisaged in fig 9 urban ei from asphalt and roof surfaces reached its peak rapidly just after the rainy event and dropped to 0 within the following 1 2 days while the ei from concrete surfaces sustained a longer time than the asphalt and roof surfaces the longer duration time of ei from the concrete surface is due to the fact that concrete has a higher heat efflux rate as a result more energy is stored on the concrete surface that can be used for a longer evaporation time in essence the different ei temporal patterns from various impervious surfaces could be attributed to the varying thermodynamic properties of impervious surface materials resulting in different surface temperatures and surface specific humidity over the wet impervious surface the asphalt had the highest surface temperature during the daytime and the lowest surface temperature at nighttime on the contrary the surface temperature for concrete was lower than asphalt surfaces during the daytime but higher than asphalt surfaces during the nighttime the higher surface temperature of the asphalt material during the daytime caused the surface water to evaporate and deplete quickly while the small temperature difference between daytime and nighttime on the concrete surface proves its better heat storage ability which allow concrete to maintain the ei for a longer time in addition it is observed that the ei value of the roofs was significantly lower than that of the concrete and asphalt pavements roofs had lower ei values than asphalt and concrete surfaces despite being fully covered with water just after the rainy event this is due to the large cross slope of the roof surface which allows the rainwater to be quickly drained and results in the lowest water retention capacity 0 1 mm the temporal ei patterns under different impervious surfaces were similar to the previous studies ramamurthy and bou zeid 2014 to summarize evaporation from urban impervious surfaces accounted for 11 14 of total et during the rainy periods furthermore the temporal characteristics of ei for different impervious surfaces showed significant differences the ei duration time of the concrete surface was significantly longer than that of the asphalt surface while the ei value and its duration time of the roof was the smallest due to the poor water retention capacity 4 discussion 4 1 the main factors in controlling urban ei the spatial and temporal variations of urban ei are mainly controlled by meteorological factors water retention and thermal properties of impervious surface materials as mentioned in section 3 3 urban ei is close to the potential evaporation in the following 1 2 days after rainfall due to the sufficient water on the impervious surface in this case the magnitude of ei is dominated by meteorological factors e g air temperature solar radiation wind speed and its physics processes had been widely studied in the previous et research liu et al 2005 yin et al 2010 here we mainly focus on the effects of water retention and thermal properties of impervious materials on urban ei common impervious surface materials include concrete asphalt tile and gravel which vary widely in water retention and heat transfer properties to learn the impact of water retention capability of different impervious materials on urban ei we extracted the pixels of four types of impervious surfaces and determined their ei values based on the flux footprint mapping fig 10 a presents the box plot of spatial average ei distribution in the four impervious surfaces the data present in fig 10 was collected from the whole experiment period the highest ei value appeared on the gravel surface with an average value of 2 2 mm while the tile had the lowest ei value with an average of 0 2 mm a positive correlation was obtained between the spatial mean ei with the water retention capacity of the impervious materials fig 10 b notice that although gravel has the largest spatial average ei value the total amount of ei in gravel is significantly lower than the ei in asphalt and concrete surfaces due to its relatively smaller area only a small fraction of gravel area near the nk site in essence the gravel surface has a stronger water retention capacity because its loose internal structure leads to a large water storage space while the denser structure of concrete asphalt and tile results in less water storage space meier and hauer 2010 venditti et al 2010 it is worth pointing out that the newly developed concrete materials may have more substantial water retention capabilities than the conventional concrete materials e g recycled concrete pervious concrete and foamed concrete limbachiya et al 2000 volder et al 2009 kearsley and wainwright 2002 however these novel concrete materials do not exist around the two ec sites therefore their water retention capability cannot be evaluated in the present study on the other hand the cross slope assoicte with the concrete asphalt and tile surfaces is another important reason for their lower water retention capacity for these two reasons urban ei will be higher in areas dominated by gravel than in areas dominated by concrete asphalt and tile therefore extensive use of gravel roofs in urban areas could effectively increase urban evaporation and reduce urban temperature thus alleviate urban uhi the thermodynamic properties of different impervious materials is another important factor in controlling the temporal variation of urban ei which is mainly reflected in the surface temperatures ramamurthy and bou zeid 2014 fig 10 c compares the average surface temperature of the four impervious surface materials during the daytime and nighttime generally asphalt has the highest surface temperature during the daytime while the surface temperature for the asphalt was the lowest during the nighttime conversely the surface temperature of concrete was lowest during the daytime and highest at nighttime the surface temperature of the gravel and tile surfaces was between asphalt and concrete in the daytime and nighttime the surface temperature of concrete varied in a smaller range during the daytime and nighttime while they varied in a wide range for asphalt surfaces ramamurthy and bou zeid 2014 these results suggested that concrete has the best thermal storage capability among the four types of concrete materials while the thermal storage capability of asphalt is the poorest the better heat storage capability associated with the concrete surface explained its longer ei duration time refer to section 3 4 the correlation between the δst representing the daytime surface temperature minus nighttime surface temperature and urban ei duration time is displayed in fig 10 d clearly a negative relationship between δst and ei duration time is observed the average duration time of ei for concrete surfaces was 3 2 days followed by gravel surfaces 3 1 days asphalt surfaces 1 4 days and tile 0 7 days notice that although the heat storage capacity of the gravel surface is worse than that of the concrete surface their ei durations are similar 3 2 days for concrete and 3 1 days for gravel these results can be explained as the gravel surface stored more water than the concrete surface and can be used for longer durations of evaporation the concrete surface had a highest heat efflux rate and a longest duration time of ei leading to a broader water cycle which positively impacts the urban energy exchange and uhi mitigation in conclusion it is found that urban ei is controlled by the joint effect of meteorological elements water retention and thermodynamic characteristics of impervious surface for the four types of commonly used concrete materials the gravel had the best water retention capability and resulted in the highest spatially averaged ei while the concrete surface had the best thermal storage capability and results in the longest duration time of ei table 2 summarizes the specific information about water retention and thermal capabilities of four types of impervious surface materials 4 2 differences of ei characteristics between two urban ec sites this study used two ec sites for urban ei analysis the reason for selection of these two urban ec sites is that they are located in different climates and have different land cover and impervious material compositions meanwhile the cross slopes of the traffic roads near the two ec sites are also quite different therefore a comparative analysis of the ei from the seclected two urban ec sites could provide a comprehensive and deep understanding about the response of urban ei to different climates impervious surface materials and road slopes settings the above results indicated that the ei between the two ec sites exhibited a large difference in both of the magnitude and temporal characteristics although the annual ei of the ca site was significantly higher than that of the nk site the nk site maintained a longer ei duration time than the ca site affected by the subtropical monsoon climate the annual rainfall amount and rainfall events in shenzhen were significantly larger than in tianjin as a consequence ca site produced higher annual ei than the nk site due to adequate water supply nevertheless the ei et values for the two ec sites were relatively close 0 11 for nk site and 0 14 for ca site during the rainy period refer to section 3 4 one explanation is the larger proportion of impervious surfaces near the nk site than the ca site as a result the nk site had a larger evaporation surface than the ca site thus promoted ei another explanation is that nk site had smaller annual evapotranspiration than ca site the lower annual evapotranspiration consequenced the ei et in the nk site was close to the ca site despite the annual ei of the nk site was significantly lower than that of the ca site the duration time of ei in the ca site was shorter than the nk site which could be attributed to the different concrete material compositions and road slopes near the two sites first the larger proportion of concrete surface near the nk site led to a stronger heat storage capacity thus maintained the ei for a longer time than the ca site second the cross slope of the road near the nk site 1 8 was more gentle than that of the ca site 2 9 thereby the road near the nk site could store more water for continuous evaporation thrid a small fraction of gravel surface existed near the nk site the stronger water retention capability of the gravel surface significantly extended the ei duration time for the nk site in general the different magnitude of urban ei and ei et between the two ec sites were mainly explained as discrepancy in rainfall and evapotranspiration due to different climatic conditions however the varying ei duration time of the two ec sites were mainly caused by the different concrete materials and road slopes near the two ec sites 4 3 implications of urban ei on the regional hydrological cycle energy balance and turbulent transport process significant increase in urban ei during the rainfall period altered regional hydrological cycle energy balance and turbulent transport process understanding the impact of ei on the urban hydrological cycle is essential as it closely relates to scientific urban water resource management allocation and decision making previously it was thought that all of the rainfall in the impervious areas was drained through the underground pipe network lee et al 2018 evaporation from impervious surfaces is ignored in most urban hydrological models and watershed hydrological models such as mike and storm water management model swmm sun et al 2014 feng 2021 ma et al 2022 however the results of this study confirmed that the amount of ei and ei et is considerable during the rainy period to this end ignoring ei will lead to conceptual errors in the urban hydrological models and cause significant uncertainty in hydrological elements simulations therefore an independent calculation module for impervious surface evaporation should be added to the next version of the hydrological models on the other hand higher ei after rain events will reduce urban runoff and infiltration consequently the existing urban drainage standards may overestimate the actual runoff reduction requirements considering the contribution of ei to runoff reduction in the design standard of the drainage network will help reduce the budget and cost of drainage network construction in addition to altering the urban hydrological cycle ei also changed the energy balance process in urban areas a recent study has shown that urbanization reduced regional latent heat flux le and increased sensible heat flux h and bowen ratio br chen et al 2022a b the increased h and br eventually led to urban warming and the urban heat island effect uhi br is a critical parameter in the energy balance equation as it closely relates to the accurate net radiation flux partitioning angus and watts 1984 richard et al 2000 to gain an in depth understanding of the impact of urban ei on br the daily br was calculated during the rainy period for the two sites fig 11 a b shows the plots of daily br variation during the selected rainy periods for the two stations clearly br dropped significantly within 1 2 days after rain events and rose to a normal level over the next few days the average br value was about 0 6 during the rainy period while the average br value was larger than 1 during the non rainy period for the two ec stations the results confirmed that the urban ei partially offset the urban warming trend as the ei increased the le and reduced the h and br although the proportion of ei in total urban et is relatively lower the weakening effect of ei on urban warming and uhi is even higher than that of vegetation transpiration and soil evaporation during rainy periods these results also highlighted the cooling effect of precipitation on urban warming which is very meaningful for cities with large annual precipitation the impact of ei on transfer efficiencies for water vapour flux and sensible heat flux in urban areas was further investigated ramamurthy and bou zeid 2014 the turbulent transport similarity is defined as atmospheric turbulence transports sensible and latent heat fluxes from the surface to the atmospheric boundary layer with similar efficiency dias 2013 this assumption works well for homogeneous surfaces such as natural ecosystems and cultivated lands however the turbulent transport similarity is disrupted in urban areas due to the diversity and heterogeneity of sources and sinks of heat and water vapour asanuma and brutsaert 1999 nordbo et al 2013 ramamurthy and bou zeid 2014 the establishment of the turbulent transport similarity is critical as it determines whether the ei can effectively alleviate the urban heat island effect ramamurthy and bou zeid 2014 compared the transfer efficiency of heat and water vapor for two ec towers one grass site and one urban site and suggested that the turbulent transport effectiveness of sensible heat is higher than the latent heat for a dry urban area li et al 2012 indicated that buoyancy effects in urban flow increased sensible heat transfer effectiveness which was also reported in rotach et al 2005 to investigate whether higher ei values during rainy periods can effectively improve latent heat flux transport efficiency and restore flux transport similarity in urban area we compared the turbulent transport efficiency values for heat rwh and water vapour rwq during non rainy and rainy periods the specific calculation methods for the two turbulent transport efficiency parameters rwh and rwq are referred to appendix a1 a2 ramamurthy and bou zeid 2014 fig 11 c d shows the histograms of daily δ values represents the rwh minus rwq during rainy and non rainy periods in the whole year 2021 for the two ec stations as envisaged in fig 11 c d the annual average δ values δ rwh rwq were 0 54 and 0 50 for the two ec stations during the non rainy period while the annual average δ values were 0 01 and 0 05 for the two ec stations during the rainy periods clearly the rwh and rwq values were relatively close during the rainy period but were pretty different during the non rain periods generally rwh was higher than rwq during the non rainy periods although some obvious inconsistence between rwh and rwq was observed the relative close rwh and rwq values during the rainy periods demonstrated that the turbulent transport similarity can be recovered in urban areas actually rwh and rwq cannot be exactly the same but only roughly the same due to they have different physics meanings roth and oke 1995 these results indicated that the latent heat flux could exchange and transport with the similar turbulent transport efficiency as sensible heat flux between the ground surface and atmospheric boundary layer during the rainy periods overall according to the above discussion urban ei significantly altered the regional hydrological cycle energy balance and turbulent transport process urban ei reduced runoff and infiltration thereby alleviating pipe network drainage pressure moreover urban ei reduced the h and br increased the turbulent transport efficiency of latent heat flux and restored turbulent transport similarity in urban areas 4 4 primary uncertainty limitations of the study and ways forward the evaporation from the urban impervious surface was estimated using ec observations and flux footprint model which provided a new and promising method for urban ei determination considering the limitations of the ec technology and flux footprint model the results of this study still have large uncertainties and require further improvements in the subsequent research the uncertainty of this study mainly comes from the following aspects 1 uncertainty comes from ec observations on rainy days the biggest challenge in current urban et research is accurate et observation during rainfall periods in this study the ec system was applied to measure the urban ei because of its capability to obtain the flux information on a large spatial scale and trace the flux contribution from different land uses previous studies had shown that the ec system was unreliable during rain events as the glass windows of the open circuit sensors li 7500 and ec 150 are saturated 30 60 min heusinkveld et al 2008 ramamurthy and bou zeid 2014 moreover the three dimensional ultrasonic anemometer will also produce errors on the rainy days in this study we used a clear baffle above the ec system to protect the li 7500 and ec 150 sensors when rain occurs the flux data quality evaluation suggested that the protection of glass windows significantly improved the reliability of the open path ec system in flux observations during the rainy events refer to results in section 3 1 nevertheless this practice may disrupt the eddy currents and turbulent diffusion above the ec system thus causing errors in et flux observation as an alternative the closed path ec system avoids exposure of the glass windows to air during rainy days however the wind speed observation errors from the three dimensional ultrasonic anemometer are still an inevitable problem therefore follow up research needs to optimize the existing ec system to enhance the observation ability of the water and heat fluxes on rainy days 2 uncertainties caused by energy non closure problem limited by the sensor size and installation height of the ec system the ec observed fluxes can only represent the turbulent transport of small eddies near the surface ground but cannot represent the turbulent transport of large eddies in the upper atmosphere as a consequence the energy non closure problem is occurred for the ec system in this study the average energy closure ratio ecr le h rn g was 0 79 for the nk station and 0 77 for the ca station during the whole year 2021 the ecr values for the two urban ec sites were generally lower than the previous studies conducted in the natural ecosystem wilson et al 2002 pan et al 2017 gerken et al 2017 and cultivated area eshonkulov et al 2019 mbangiwa et al 2019 the relatively lower ecr value of the urban flux station is due to the highly heterogeneity of the urban underlying surface and existion of anthropogenic heat flux that resulting in complex near surface eddy currents in this study although the classic bowen s ratio method was implemented to rectify the energy closure it did not completely solve the serious energy non closure issue of urban ec systems previous studies have shown that the errors for measured le was larger than 10 w m2 when use the bowen ratio method to correct energy closure pan et al 2017 undoubtedly the errors caused by the energy imbalance problem will lead to ei uncertainty through error transmission therefore follow up research is expected to propose an enhanced energy balance correction method for urban ec system which will help to further improve the reliability of urban ei determination 3 uncertainties from flux footprint model and spatial resolution of the satellite image this study performed the euler analytic function based analytic flux footprint model to calculate the flux footprint areas for the two ec sites due to the lower computing resource requirements however previous studies demonstrated that the euler equation based flux footprint model might underestimate the flux contributing source area kormann and meixner 2001 kumari et al 2020 which will lead to systematic errors in the urban ei estimation in addition the extraction of land use and land cover information from sentinel 2 satellite imagery and the relatively lower spatial resolution of satellite products will also result in errors in ei estimation the application of the deep learning method to extract land use information around the two ec sites has considerable uncertainty limited by the training samples luus et al 2015 burud 2021 on the other hand the spatial resolution of sentinel 2 satellite imagery is 10 m which is the highest resolution that can be obtained for various open source satellite data sets however the 10 m spatial resolution is not clear enough to accurately distinguish the edge information of impervious surfaces in urban areas with high heterogeneity if the width of the road is less than 10 m there may be a large error in the pixel scale impervious surface extraction and ei determination to this end more efforts are needed to use unmanned aerial vehicle uav and visible light imagers to achieve accurate extraction of impervious surface pixels which provide the opportunity to further enhance the reliability of urban ei determination 5 conclusions this study proposed an urban impervious surface evaporation ei method based on ec observations flux footprint model and urban land use information the proposed urban ei method was applied in two urban ec stations in china the temporal characteristics of urban ei and contributions of urban ei to total urban et ei et for the two ec towers were analyzed the impact of urban ei on the regional energy balance and turbulent transport process were revealed the main conclusions of the study are summarized as follows 1 the two ec systems well captured et flux during rainy days for nk station more than 76 of observed flux data can be used for ei analysis during rainy periods for ca station more than 78 of observed flux data can be used for ei analysis during rainy periods 2 the daily ei exhibited highly intermittent temporal patterns for the two ec stations the ei value was 0 during the non rainy period and reached its peak in the following 1 2 days after the rainy events then gradually decreased to 0 the decline rate of ei at the ca site was higher than that of the nk site which is due to the larger cross slope of the road and the existence of a large area of asphalt surface near the ca site 3 the daily ei et was 0 during the non rainy period the average daily ei et ranged from 0 11 to 0 14 for the two ec stations during the rainy period the temporal changes of ei et in different impervious surfaces exhibited large differences where the ei et in concrete surfaces sustained a longer time than the asphalt and roof surfaces the temporal patterns of ei for different impervious surfaces mainly depend on the impervious surface materials water retention and thermodynamic properties 4 urban ei significantly changed the regional energy balance and turbulent transport process urban ei reduced urban h and br during rainy periods thereby helping to mitigation of urban warming and the uhi effect moreover ei increased the turbulent transport efficiency of latent heat flux rwq during the rainy period and restored turbulent transport similarity in urban areas 5 urban ei is mainly controlled by meteorological factors water retention and thermal properties of impervious surface materials the spatial average ei is positively correlated with the water retention capability of impervious surface materials the ei duration time is controlled by the surface temperature and the heat storage capacity of the impervious surface the gravel has the best water retention capability resulting in the highest spatial average ei in contrast the concrete surface has the best thermal storage capability resulting in the longest duration time of ei declaration

2607,urban evapotranspiration is an important component linking the urban hydrological cycle and energy balance previous studies on urban evapotranspiration et mainly focused on evaporation from the soil vegetation and water surfaces however the urban ei process was overlooked mainly due to its low amount in this study the urban ei was determined by eddy correlation ec observations combined with a flux footprint model and urban land use information for two urban ec sites the evaluation of flux data quality indicated that more than 76 of observed flux data can be used for ei analysis at the two stations during rainy periods the daily urban ei exhibited high intermittent temporal patterns the ei value was 0 during the non rainy period and peaked on the following 1 2 days after the rainy event then gradually decreased to 0 the average daily ei accounted for 11 14 of the total et for the two ec stations during the rainy period further analysis indicated that urban ei significantly altered the urban energy balance and turbulent transport processes the urban ei reduced sensible heat flux h and bowen ratio br during the rainfall period thereby playing a vital role in mitigating urban heat land effect moreover urban ei improved the turbulent transport efficiency of latent heat flux rwq and restored turbulent transport similarity in an urban area the temporal characteristics of urban ei exhibited a large discrepancy among different impervious surface materials which mainly depend on the water retention and thermodynamic properties of the impervious surface gravel had the best water retention capability and resulted in the highest spatially averaged ei while the concrete surface had the best thermal storage capability and resulted in the longest duration time of ei the spatial average of urban ei and its duration time were positively correlated with the water retention and heat storage capabilities of impervious surface materials this study gained insight into urban ei including its determination method temporal characteristics controlling factors and impacts of urban ei on the regional energy balance and turbulent transport process keywords urban impervious

evapotranspiration et is closely related to climate change water safety ecological restoration and agricultural irrigation oki and kanae 2006 wang and dickinson 2012 tu and yang 2022 previously et in natural ecosystems and cultivated areas has been extensively studied using the modelling and measuring methods e g kustas and norman 1999 fisher et al 2008 kool et al 2014 talsma et al 2018 chen et al 2020 2021 however relatively few studies on urban et result in less understanding of its response on urban microclimate and urban hydrology e g grimmond and oke 1986 1991 ramamurthy and bou zeid 2014 2017 vulova et al 2021 the significant difference between et in the urban ecosystem and natural ecosystem is that urban et does not only consists of soil evaporation vegetation transpiration and water surface evaporation but also involves the evaporation from artificial surfaces e g houses buildings and traffic areas hanna et al 2011 vesala et al 2017 chen et al 2022a b the water retention and thermodynamics properties for artificial impervious areas are quite distinct from natural vegetation soil and water body areas leading to different heat transfer and turbulent transport processes ramamurthy and bou zeid 2014 wong et al 2015 oke 1982 suggested that the urban impervious surfaces significantly altered the regional hydrological cycle and energy balance and emphasized that impervious areas are not deserts unfortunately we are still rudimentary about the characteristics of evaporation from urban impervious surfaces ei and their response mechanisms to the urban thermal environment and microclimate a large number of previous studies have shown that the evaporation from urban impervious surfaces was zero or close to zero based on the in situ observations or modelling simulations oke et al 1999 kato and yamaguchi 2007 wong et al 2015 chen et al 2022a b for instance oke et al 1999 found the ratio of latent heat flux to net radiative flux le rn was only 0 04 in central mexico city based on the urban flux tower measurements kato and yamaguchi 2007 estimated the energy balance components in nagoya japan using the thermal infrared satellite image which reported the le rn value varied within 0 0 04 for the commercial road and impervious areas wong et al 2015 developed an energy balance conceptualization based method for modelling anthropogenic heat flux in hong kong they suggested that the le in impervious urban areas was generally lower than 10 w m2 ranged from 5 to 10 w m2 on 11 oct 2012 and 3 to 8 75 w m2 on 13 jan 2013 recently chen et al 2022a demonstrated the le in tianjin china ranged between 0 and 33 6 w m2 with an average value of 17 3 w m2 it seems that most previous studies have accepted the view that urban ei is quite low as explained by the lower water retention capacity of impervious surface that result no water available for evaporation wong et al 2015 faridatul et al 2020 song 2021 zhou et al 2021 chen et al 2022a however the current research on urban ei has considerable limitations due to large uncertainties in measuring and modeling methods the first limitation is the lack of appropriate in situ measurement technology to determine urban ei as a standard et observation method eddy covariance ec technology has been widely applied to measure et in natural ecosystems cultivated lands and urban areas e g coutts et al 2005 vesala et al 2008 kordowski and kuttler 2010 menzer et al 2015 vulova et al 2021 duarte rocha et al 2022 chen et al 2022a b although the ec technology enriched people s understanding of urban water heat and energy transmission processes the et measured by the ec system represents the flux sources from multiple urban surfaces e g vegetation soil water and impervious surfaces while their individual contributions to the total et cannot be distinguished in addition the heterogeneity of flux sources sinks caused by the urban surface inhomogeneity will further lead to the advection errors which brings another challenge to interpreting raw ec measuring data in the complex urban turbulent environment grimmond et al 2002 finally it is known that the ec systems often suffer from energy closure problems where the sum of le and sensible heat flux h are lower than the rn minus ground heat flux g le h rn g twine et al 2000 liu et al 2011 zhou and xin 2019 this energy non closure problem is more severe in urban areas due to the high heterogeneity of urban surfaces and the impact of anthropogenic heat fluxes on surface energy balance järvi et al 2012 vulova et al 2021 duarte rocha et al 2022 chen et al 2022a b consequently these limitations associated with the ec technology restricted its ability to observe evaporation from urban impervious surfaces another challenge is that it is difficult to continuously and accurately estimate urban ei the development of the urban et model started from the pioneering work by grimmond and oke 1986 the model was modified by grimmond and oke 1991 where the et in urban areas was estimated using the improved penman monteith formula for the last two decades researchers have made many efforts to apply energy balance theory to estimate urban et lemonsu et al 2007 proposed a town energy balance teb scheme which adopted a water and energy coupled way to estimate urban et liu et al 2010 developed a satellite based energy balance urban et model järvi et al 2011 conducted a surface urban energy and water balance scheme suews faridatul et al 2020 applied the urban surface energy balance algorithm for land useabl model to simulate et in dhaka bangladesh recently the multiple source energy balance urban et models has also been proposed to gain the capability to partition urban et into its components e g separate evaporation from vegetation soil water and impervious surface the popular multiple source energy balance urban et models include modified two source energy balance tseb model jiang and weng 2017 three dimensional 3d transpiration and photosynthesis model bournez et al 2017 three temperature 3 t model qiu et al 2017 qin et al 2022 zhang et al 2020a b 2022 xiong et al 2022 three sources and four sources energy balance model chen et al 2022a b another prevalent urban et approach is the so called urban canopy model ucm kusaka et al 2001 kondo et al 2005 ucm successfully integrated urban landforms structures and morphology into the parameterization scheme of ground atmosphere interaction such as the height of the roof wall and ground surface hagishima and tanimoto 2005 ryu et al 2011 lee 2011 the et in ucm is determined through the atmospheric boundary layer theory miao et al 2014 wang et al 2021 the latest version of ucm further coupled the contribution of vegetation to urban et through the tiling or integration approaches lee 2011 ban weiss and vahmani 2016 vahmani and ban weiss 2016 generally the detailed geometric description in ucm advanced the simulation accuracy of urban energy exchange and heat transfer processes although various types of urban et models have been widely developed significant challenges remain for accurately estimating urban ei the conventional single source energy and water balance models can only estimate the total urban et but cannot divide its components resulting in urban ei not being available recently proposed multi source energy balance models gained the capability to estimate urban ei however these models typically rely upon thermal infrared satellite images to parameterize urban sensible and latent heat fluxes chen et al 2022a b unfortunately the thermal infrared satellite based urban et models can only map the urban ei distribution on cloud free days but cannot obtain urban ei during rainy periods due to the extensive cloud coverage mitchell et al 1977 molnar and coakley 1985 it shall be reminded that the amount of urban ei in the rainy period is significantly larger than that in the non rainy period ramamurthy and bou zeid 2014 in addition these satellite based et models cannot obtain continuous daily ei values limited by the satellite return visit period as a result there is still a lack of customized method to continuously determine urban ei the flux footprint approach also called the source weight function describes the relationship between observed et flux and the spatial distribution of surface sources sinks in the near surface layer chu et al 2021 kong et al 2022 the flux footprint contours can well trace the average or cumulative condition of the surface fluxes to the ec observations thus it opens up the opportunity to accurately estimate urban ei based on the ec observation data sogachev et al 2004 wang and rotach 2010 at present the flux footprint approach has been widely applied in the ground validation of satellite based energy balance or photosynthesis models e g kong et al 2022 chen et al 2021 vulova et al 2021 however no identified studies combined the flux footprint approach and ec observations to estimate urban ei common impervious surface materials include concrete asphalt tile and gravel which are widely used to construct buildings and roads in urban areas grimmond and oke 1986 1991 ramamurthy and bou zeid 2014 vulova et al 2021 previous research shown that these impervious surfaces had different water retention and thermodynamic properties ramamurthy and bou zeid 2014 however there is currently a lack of deep understanding of the ei characteristics under different impervious surface materials suppose the response mechanism of ei under different impermeable surface materials cannot be accurately identified in that case it will bring significant obstacles to devising various policy initiatives to alleviate the urban heat island effect and propose scientific urban water resources management plans in order to more accurately estimate the urban ei and reveal its impact on the urban energy balance and turbulent transport process this study includes the following objectives 1 to conduct an urban ei method that is based on the flux footprint approach and ground ec observations 2 to identify the temporal characteristics of urban ei during the rainy and non rainy periods 3 to distinguish the contribution of urban ei to total urban et 4 to analyze the impact of urban ei on the urban energy balance and turbulent transport processes and 5 to reveal the relationships between the water retention and thermodynamic properties of impervious materials and urban ei this study will provide a deep understanding of urban ei including its determination method temporal characteristics controlling factors and implications for the turbulent transport of water and heat on the atmosphere boundary layer of urban areas 2 methodology 2 1 study region to provide a comprehensive understanding about the characteristics of urban ei under different climates two urban ec sites were selected for the ei analysis in this study the first ec tower is located in a coastal megacity in northern china tianjin and the second ec tower is located in a coastal megacity in southern china shenzhen specifically tower 1 was installed at the campus of nankai university in the southern suburbs of tianjin nk station 38 59 n 117 20 e altitude 3 m height 10 m the surrounding land use consists of 55 6 impervious surface within a 5 km radius tower 2 was installed near the chiao reservoir in the eastern suburbs of shenzhen ca station 22 24 n 114 13 e altitude 110 m height 20 m the surrounding land use consists of 29 1 impervious surface within a 5 km radius there is a considerable proportion of impervious surfaces traffic areas buildings etc around both two ec towers therefore the observation results from the two ec sites can well reflect the exchange and turbulent diffusion processes of water vapour and heat fluxes from urban artificial surfaces the impervious surface material composition around the two sites is significantly different the buildings and roads around the nk site are made of concrete while the surrounding area of the ca site includes concrete surfaces and large areas of asphalt pavement roofs around both sites are mainly covered with tile but a small fraction of gravel roofs existed around the nk site furthermore the cross slopes of the traffic roads around the two sites are also different since the two cities are situated in different climatic zones tianjin has a warm temperate semi humid monsoon climate with annual precipitation ranging between 360 970 mm the cross slope of the traffic road near the nk station is relatively lower approximate 1 8 while shenzhen has a south subtropical monsoon climate and the annual precipitation is significantly larger than tianjin ranging between 913 2662 mm as a result the cross slope of the traffic road near the ca station is designed to be larger for faster drainage approximate 2 9 fig 1 shows the geographic locations of the two ec towers and the schematic diagrams of two cross slope shoulders 2 2 field observations 2 2 1 flux and meteorological observations both two ec towers used infrared laser analyzers to measure water vapour and carbon dioxide co2 concentrations li 7500 for nk station and ec 150 for ca station and used a sonic anemometer thermometer to measure wind speeds and sonic temperatures in three directions irgason campbell scientific usa the measuring frequency of water vapour and wind speeds were both 10 hz in order to prevent the open circuit laser analyzers from being affected by the rain a transparent baffle was placed above the two open circuit ec systems to protect laser sensors during rainy events the half hour et fluxes and heat fluxes were determined using the eddypro software li cor fratini et al 2012 onalenna et al 2018 duarte rocha et al 2022 after the flux calculations data need to be preprocessed to make necessary corrections these preprocessing procedures consist of double rotation dr frequency response correction for high frequency losses ultrasound virtual correction for sonic temperature schotanus correction for relative humidity webb pearman and leuning wpl correction for air density effect moncrieff et al 1997 webb et al 1980 duarte rocha et al 2022 moreover the flux quality control was performed to exclude abnormal flux data 1 the wild point greater than five standard deviations were excluded 2 the observed flux data with flag quality larger than one was excluded 3 the observed flux data beyond the physically reasonable range were excluded 4 the negative et values at nighttime was excluded due to condensation rather than evaporation 5 the observed flux data with abnormal bowen ratio br h le i e br 100 and br 100 was excluded for the two ec stations to generate continuous et flux observations gap filling is required to interpolate the missed flux data duarte rocha et al 2022 for missing flux data within 2 h the linear interpolation method was used for imputation for missing flux data greater than 2 h the marginal distribution sampling mds method was used for imputation falge et al 2001 wutzler et al 2018 duarte rocha et al 2022 where the mds method takes into account the effect of meteorological factors on seasonal et variation for the observed energy balance components rn g le and h the energy balance closure was corrected using bowen ratio br method for the two ec stations twine et al 2000 mauder 2020 bowen ratio method assigned underestimated energy to le and h based on br value wohlfahrt et al 2009 pan et al 2017 in addition to the et flux and heat flux observations the two ec systems also had the observations of mourning obukhov length l frictional wind speed u and water vapour density etc furthermore the in situ measurements of meteorological factors were conducted around the two sites rainwise portlog the seven conventional meteorological factors including air temperature long wave and short wave radiation relative humidity vapour pressure deficit wind speed and precipitation were continuously measured in every half hour table 1 summarizes the specific information of the two ec sites the water retention capabilities of four typical concrete materials concrete gravel asphalt and tile were measured through the bulk density method specifically the samples of four types concrete materials were put into plexiglass centrifuge tubes then the saturated water content of the four types of concrete materials were measured after they were completely saturated with water the samples of four types concrete were further put into a high speed refrigerated centrifuge to measure the water content under different centrifuge revolutions and pressures settings finally the the water characteristic curves for the four typical concrete materials can be obtained the measuring results suggested that gravel had the strongest water retention capability 10 mm followed by concrete 1 mm asphalt 0 5 mm and tile 0 1 mm 2 2 2 flux data quality evaluation since urban ei is estimated using ec observations during both of rainy and non rainy periods it is necessary to perform a quality assessment of the measured et fluxes data the quality evaluation of flux data includes turbulence stationarity test tst and turbulent variance similarity test tvst liu et al 2011 2013 forken et al 2004 the tst requires the covariance of turbulence remain stable within an observation time step for example the mean of the covariance of water vapor concentration and wind speed during the 30 min is equal to the sum mean of the covariance of water vapor concentration and wind speed for each 5 min the expression of the stationarity coefficient st for the tst is shown in eq 1 1 st w c 5 w c 30 w c 30 100 where w represents the vertical wind speed c represents the water vapor concentration the superscript represents the fluctuations of w and c the subscripts 5 and 30 indicates 5 min and 30 min time periods the monin obukhov similarity theory applies only when turbulence is fully developed the objective of tvst is to check the consistency of the ratio of the measured vertical wind speed variance σw and the frictional wind speed u with the simulated σw u based on the mourning obukhov similarity theory the expression for the overall turbulence characteristic coefficient itc is shown in eq 2 2 itc σ w u s σ w u o σ w u o where σw u s represents the simulated σw u value by mourning obukhov similarity theory σw u o represents the observed σw u value by ec system finally the quality of the observed et flux is evaluated according to the testing results of the tst and tvst foken et al 2004 the overall flux data quality is classified as 9 categories best quality categories 1 3 better quality categories 4 6 medium quality recommended to qualitative analysis categories 7 8 poor quality recommended to remove categories 9 the specific flux data quality categories and classification criterion are presented in tables a1 and a2 2 3 flux footprint of the ec system 2 3 1 description of flux footprint model the flux source area needs to be determined for the two sites before the ei calculation the flux footprint model has widely used to trace the flux sources of ec observations for natural ecosystems and farmland areas e g sogachev et al 2004 wang and rotach 2010 recent studies applied the flux footprint model to the flux trace for urban ec systems e g vulova et al 2021 duarte rocha et al 2022 chen et al 2022a b in the present study the half hour flux footprint was firstly estimated using the flux footprint model and then aggregated to the daily scale chu et al 2021 kong et al 2022 to improve the computational efficiency this study used the analytical footprint model that is based on the euler analytic function to calculate the flux source area kormann and meixner 2001 the euler analytic method is an explicit function where the method derives the analytical solution of the flux footprint using a series of atmospheric boundary layer parameters e g the wind speed profile in the near surface layer the turbulent diffusion coefficient profile and the similarity of the near surface layer kormann and meixner 2001 zhang 2018 the specific operation process of the euler analytic method is presented below assuming the relationship between vertical profiles of the near surface horizontal wind speed

value p was reached the source area ωp is defined as including all the pixels within the effective fetch p and the effective fetch p is defined as the ratio of the area of the cumulative flux

challenge in application of flux footprint models for urban areas is to consider the impervious surface on aerodynamic roughness zom determination eq 7 in this study an enhanced parametric scheme for zom was applied in urban areas the new zom parameterization scheme accounted for the effects of morphological characteristics of buildings and roads on urban turbulent transport which significantly improved the reliability of the zom and flux source area estimates for urban area huang et al 2021 the enhanced parameterization scheme of zom for urban area are shown in eqs 17 and 18 17 z om h av 1

through the floor number of buildings cb represents the coefficient that reflects the building drag set to 1 2 unitless rt represents the crown radius for the trees around the flux tower l pv represents the ratio of drag coefficient of vegetation to drag coefficient of building parameterized through guan et al 2000 one metric to test the applicability of modified flux footprint model in urban area is whether the estimated flux source area can explain 100 of the cumulative flux contribution chen et al 2009 fig 2 present the relationship between annual cumulative footprint and corresponding footprint areas km2 for the two ec stations as envisaged in fig 2 the footprint areas varied from 0 to 2 4 km2 when cumulative footprint ranged between 0 and 100 for nk station the footprint areas varied from 0 to 4 3 km2 when cumulative footprint ranged between 0 and 100 for ca station the flux footprint area exhibited a significant positive relationship with cumulative footprint value and increased rapidly with increased cumulative footprint value this result suggested that the enhanced urban flux footprint model successfully captured the flux footprint of the urban ec system under different cumulative footprint conditions therefore the enhanced flux footprint model is applicable and reliable in mapping flux footprint weight distribution for urban areas with high degree of heterogeneity 2 4 determination of half hour and daily ei ei was calculated from the relative weight distribution of the flux footprint map and the land use map around the two ec sites the core idea is to accumulate the ei values of each impervious surface pixel according to the relative weight distribution of flux footprint the specific operation processes are given as the following 1 the relative weight distribution of the flux source areas was mapped using the flux footprint model for every half hour 2 the sentinel 2 satellite imagery around the two stations was downloaded from the european space agency esa official website https sentinel esa int web sentinel missions sentinel 2 at a spatial resolution of 10 m the deep learning method was applied to extract land use and land cover information within a 5 km radius of the two ec towers luus et al 2015 burud 2021 3 the land use and land cover image around the two ec towers were superimposed on the relative weight distribution of the flux source map according to their latitude and longitude then meshing the flux footprint map and ensuring the grid resolution of the flux footprint map is aligned with the spatial resolution of satellite imagery 10 m 4 the impervious surface pixels were extracted from the land use and land cover map and the latitude and longitude of each impervious surface pixel was recorded 5 the weight value for a specific impervious surface pixel was extracted from the relative weight flux footprint map according to the latitude and longitude of the impervious surface pixel 6 the weight value of each impervious surface pixel was accumulated to obtain the total weight of flux footprint contribution for all impervious surface pixels shown as eq 19 19 w i w 1 w 2 w 3 w n where wi is the total weights of flux footprint contribution for all impervious surface pixels wn is the weights of flux footprint contribution for each impervious surface pixel 7 the half hour ei was calculated through the observed et value multiplied by the total weights of flux footprint contribution of the impervious surface wi shown as eq 20 20 e i et w i et w 1 w 2 w 3 w n the daily ei was calculated as the sum of ei for all available half hours in a single day it is mentioned that the proposed urban ei method realized continuous calculation of half hour and daily ei values since the method is based on the in situ ec observation temporal resolution of half hour and flux footprint model therefore the newly developed method overcomed the limitation that cannot continuously estimate ei in the conventional satellite based ei method the operation flow chart of the proposed urban ei method is demonstrated in fig 3 3 results and analysis 3 1 measured flux data quality fig 4 shows the quality assessment results of the observed flux data at the two ec stations during the rainy and non rainy periods the rainy period is defined as the first day to the seventh day after the rainy event as envisage in fig 4 the quality of ec flux observations in the non rainy period was better than that in the rainy period the overall flux quality testing of the non rainy period was generally classified as 1 4 while the overall flux quality testing of the rainy period was generally classified as 3 8 for the two ec stations specifically the average category values were 3 4 4 4 and 5 3 for tst tvst and overall quality testing during the rainy period at the nk station the corresponding values were 2 0 2 4 and 2 2 during the non rainy period at the nk station similar testing results also appleared at the ca station where the average category values were 3 1 4 1 and 4 7 for tst tvst and overall quality during the rainy period and 2 4 2 4 and 2 5 during the non rainy period at the ca station for nk station more than 76 of observed flux data had an overall data quality category lower than 7 during rainy periods for ca station more than 78 of observed flux data had an overall data quality category lower than 7 during rainy periods the measured flux data with overall quality as categories 7 and 8 were excluded in the subsequent ei calculations for the two ec stations the above testing results indicated that while the quality of the observed flux data in the rainy period was worse than that in the non rainy period the observed flux data in the rainy period can also be used for urban ei analysis since the two ec stations had more than 75 measured flux data with overall quality category lower than 7 during rainy periods 3 2 distribution of flux footprint contours the 70 80 and 95 flux footprint contours were calculated and mapped using the analytical footprint model kormann and meixner 2001 fig 5 a d shows the flux footprint contours during the selected rainy and non rainy periods for the two ec stations 13 jul 27 jul rainy period for nk station 17 may 31 may non rainy period for nk station 08 sep 22 sep rainy period for ca station and 01 jan 15 jan non rainy period for ca station the rainfall amount during the selected two rainy periods were larger than 70 mm fig 5 e h also presents the half hour flux footprint contours for the two ec stations generally the half hour flux footprint contours presented an elliptical and symmetrical shape in the upwind direction of the two ec towers moreover the total area within the flux footprint contours increased exponentially from 70 to 95 contours indicating that most of the flux footprint is from the areas close to the ec tower although the flux source area between the 80 and 95 flux footprint contours was significantly larger than the flux source area between the 70 and 80 flux footprint contours these regions contributed minimally to the observed fluxes of the two ec towers similar flux footprint contour patterns also reported in the ec observations for the natural ecosystems chu et al 2021 kong et al 2022 and cultivated lands song et al 2016 liu et al 2016 intercomparison of the 95 flux footprint contours for the rainy and non rainy periods suggested that the land use composition within 95 flux footprint contours were similar during a longer temporal periods e g longer than 10 days for example the fractional impervious surface fi within the 95 flux footprint contours was 0 49 from 13 jul 27 jul at nk station where the corresponding statistics were 0 47 from 17 may 31 may a similar phenomenon also appeared at the ca station where the fi was 0 29 from 08 sep 22 sep and 0 30 from 01 jan 15 jan nevertheless the land use composition within 95 flux footprint contours varied in a wide range within a half hour temporal interval compare fig 5 e and 5 g 5 f and 5 h furthermore it is noted that the 70 80 and 95 flux footprint contours of the two sites are more cluttered during the rainy period than the non rainy period which is due to the changeable wind direction during the rainy period the flux footprint extent ffe represents the maximum distance from ec tower to 95 flux footprint contour ranged between 350 and 890 m for nk station and 530 and 1420 m for ca station during the whole year of 2021 the area within the 95 flux footprint contour of the ca site is larger than that of the nk site because the ec tower in ca site is higher than that of the nk site 3 3 temporal characteristics of urban ei for the two ec towers the time series of daily ei and rainfall for the two ec stations in 2021 are presented in fig 6 a b the results suggested that the daily ei exhibited highly intermittent temporal patterns at the two ec stations for non rainy periods urban ei was zero or closed to zero as the impervious surface had no available water for evaporation for rainy periods ei reached its peak on the following 1 2 days after the rain event then gradually decreased to zero the peak value of urban ei after rain events demonstrated that the heat had been stored in impervious surfaces after intensive ei the stored heat is further supplied back to maintain a high evaporation rate after rain showers ramamurthy and bou zeid 2014 the observed annual urban ei was 46 1 mm for nk station and 91 6 mm for ca station in 2021 the higher annual urban ei value in ca station is due to the more considerable annual rainfall than the nk station fig 6 c d presents the long term average half hour urban ei during the rainy period for the two stations generally the half hour ei value approximated a sinusoidal curve which reached a maximum value at mid noon and attended a minimum value at nighttime the half hour ei pattern was similar to the temporal patterns of air temperature solar radiation and total et observed by the ec system note that a very low daily ei value also appeared on a few experiment days during the non rainy period for example ei was 0 20 mm in the day of year doy 293 for nk station and 0 52 mm in doy 58 for ca station red circle marked in fig 6 one possible explanation is a sprinkler vehicle passed through the traffic area around the ec tower or a water source was artificially created furthermore the errors caused by flux footprint model are also likely responsible for the lower ei values that appeared during the non rainy periods although the temporal characteristics of urban ei were quite similar for the two ec sites the ei decline rates differed considerably between the two sites after rainfall events fig 7 shows the daily ei variations after the selected eight rainfall events at two stations these eight typical rainfall events contained different rainfall amount ranged from 8 1 to 123 2 mm which can well represent the temporal characteristics of ei under different rainfall intensities the ei value of the nk site gradually decreased to 0 within 2 6 days after the rainfall event with an average of 3 9 days for all of the rainy periods in 2021 while the ei value of the ca site gradually decreased to 0 within 2 4 days after the rainfall event with an average of 2 7 days for all of rainy periods in 2021 the faster rate of ei decline for the ca site could be explained from three aspects as the following the first reason was the larger road cross slope around the ca site which accelerates the drainage process 1 8 for the road near the nk station 2 9 for the road near the ca station secondly the different compositions of impervious surface materials around the two ec sites can contribute to the discrepancy rate of ei decline specifically the impervious surface material around the nk site is mainly concrete while the impervious surface material around the ca site included concrete and large portions of asphalt surfaces the concrete 1 mm had a better water holding capacity than asphalt 0 5 mm according to our testing results and previous findings grimmond and oke 1986 1991 ramamurthy and bou zeid 2014 therefore the concrete surfaces are able to sustain impervious surfaces evaporation for a longer time than asphalt surfaces and lead to a lower ei decline rate the last reason was the existence of a small fraction of gravel roofs around the nk station which was very common in northern china but unusual in southern china due to dirt buildup and pore clogging gravel roofs can hold water up to 10 mm in short those mentioned above demonstrated that the impervious surface evaporation mainly occurred during the rainy periods and reached its peak within 1 2 days after the rainfall events and gradually decreased to zero additionally the decline rate of urban ei mainly depends on the impervious surface material and cross slope 3 4 contributions of urban ei to total urban et a significant advantage of the flux footprint method is that it has the capability to distinguish evaporation from various urban land uses we further calculated urban et components including soil evaporation vegetation transpiration water body evaporation and evaporation from different impervious surface materials and their contributions to the total observed et flux based on the flux footprint model ec observations and urban land use information the temporal variations of the ratio of ei to total urban et ei et for the two stations are presented in fig 8 the daily ei et values were closed to 0 during the non rainy period for the two stations the average daily ei et was 0 11 for the nk station and 0 14 for the ca station during the rainy period for the whole year of 2021 the average daily ei et was 0 07 for the nk station and 0 09 for the ca station if only 1 2 days after rainfall events were selected for analysis the ei et value increased significantly to 0 47 for the nk station and 0 52 for the ca station the results indicated the urban ei accounted for a considerable proportion of total et when impervious surfaces were covered with sufficient water while the transpiration and evaporation from vegetation and soil surfaces dominated the observed et flux during the non rainy periods and last several days during the rainy periods this is solid evidence that while impervious surfaces occupied a small proportion of urban et they significantly altered the urban hydrological cycle and energy balance processes especially for the 1 2 days following rainfall events the ei rate just after rainfall events was higher than that of soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration due to the small surface resistance on the impervious surfaces it shall be mentioned that under the sufficient water supply condition vegetation transpiration is controlled by the opening degree of vegetation stomata and soil evaporation is limited by soil infiltration and pore resistance kuchment et al 2006 zhang et al 2017 while the evaporation from impervious surfaces is close to its potential rate chen et al 2022a b the urban ei in different impervious surface materials also exhibited significantly different temporal patterns fig 9 displays the half hour ei variation from various impervious surfaces at the ca station asphalt concrete and roof the selected four rainy events had wide range of rainfall intensities 8 1 123 2 mm as envisaged in fig 9 urban ei from asphalt and roof surfaces reached its peak rapidly just after the rainy event and dropped to 0 within the following 1 2 days while the ei from concrete surfaces sustained a longer time than the asphalt and roof surfaces the longer duration time of ei from the concrete surface is due to the fact that concrete has a higher heat efflux rate as a result more energy is stored on the concrete surface that can be used for a longer evaporation time in essence the different ei temporal patterns from various impervious surfaces could be attributed to the varying thermodynamic properties of impervious surface materials resulting in different surface temperatures and surface specific humidity over the wet impervious surface the asphalt had the highest surface temperature during the daytime and the lowest surface temperature at nighttime on the contrary the surface temperature for concrete was lower than asphalt surfaces during the daytime but higher than asphalt surfaces during the nighttime the higher surface temperature of the asphalt material during the daytime caused the surface water to evaporate and deplete quickly while the small temperature difference between daytime and nighttime on the concrete surface proves its better heat storage ability which allow concrete to maintain the ei for a longer time in addition it is observed that the ei value of the roofs was significantly lower than that of the concrete and asphalt pavements roofs had lower ei values than asphalt and concrete surfaces despite being fully covered with water just after the rainy event this is due to the large cross slope of the roof surface which allows the rainwater to be quickly drained and results in the lowest water retention capacity 0 1 mm the temporal ei patterns under different impervious surfaces were similar to the previous studies ramamurthy and bou zeid 2014 to summarize evaporation from urban impervious surfaces accounted for 11 14 of total et during the rainy periods furthermore the temporal characteristics of ei for different impervious surfaces showed significant differences the ei duration time of the concrete surface was significantly longer than that of the asphalt surface while the ei value and its duration time of the roof was the smallest due to the poor water retention capacity 4 discussion 4 1 the main factors in controlling urban ei the spatial and temporal variations of urban ei are mainly controlled by meteorological factors water retention and thermal properties of impervious surface materials as mentioned in section 3 3 urban ei is close to the potential evaporation in the following 1 2 days after rainfall due to the sufficient water on the impervious surface in this case the magnitude of ei is dominated by meteorological factors e g air temperature solar radiation wind speed and its physics processes had been widely studied in the previous et research liu et al 2005 yin et al 2010 here we mainly focus on the effects of water retention and thermal properties of impervious materials on urban ei common impervious surface materials include concrete asphalt tile and gravel which vary widely in water retention and heat transfer properties to learn the impact of water retention capability of different impervious materials on urban ei we extracted the pixels of four types of impervious surfaces and determined their ei values based on the flux footprint mapping fig 10 a presents the box plot of spatial average ei distribution in the four impervious surfaces the data present in fig 10 was collected from the whole experiment period the highest ei value appeared on the gravel surface with an average value of 2 2 mm while the tile had the lowest ei value with an average of 0 2 mm a positive correlation was obtained between the spatial mean ei with the water retention capacity of the impervious materials fig 10 b notice that although gravel has the largest spatial average ei value the total amount of ei in gravel is significantly lower than the ei in asphalt and concrete surfaces due to its relatively smaller area only a small fraction of gravel area near the nk site in essence the gravel surface has a stronger water retention capacity because its loose internal structure leads to a large water storage space while the denser structure of concrete asphalt and tile results in less water storage space meier and hauer 2010 venditti et al 2010 it is worth pointing out that the newly developed concrete materials may have more substantial water retention capabilities than the conventional concrete materials e g recycled concrete pervious concrete and foamed concrete limbachiya et al 2000 volder et al 2009 kearsley and wainwright 2002 however these novel concrete materials do not exist around the two ec sites therefore their water retention capability cannot be evaluated in the present study on the other hand the cross slope assoicte with the concrete asphalt and tile surfaces is another important reason for their lower water retention capacity for these two reasons urban ei will be higher in areas dominated by gravel than in areas dominated by concrete asphalt and tile therefore extensive use of gravel roofs in urban areas could effectively increase urban evaporation and reduce urban temperature thus alleviate urban uhi the thermodynamic properties of different impervious materials is another important factor in controlling the temporal variation of urban ei which is mainly reflected in the surface temperatures ramamurthy and bou zeid 2014 fig 10 c compares the average surface temperature of the four impervious surface materials during the daytime and nighttime generally asphalt has the highest surface temperature during the daytime while the surface temperature for the asphalt was the lowest during the nighttime conversely the surface temperature of concrete was lowest during the daytime and highest at nighttime the surface temperature of the gravel and tile surfaces was between asphalt and concrete in the daytime and nighttime the surface temperature of concrete varied in a smaller range during the daytime and nighttime while they varied in a wide range for asphalt surfaces ramamurthy and bou zeid 2014 these results suggested that concrete has the best thermal storage capability among the four types of concrete materials while the thermal storage capability of asphalt is the poorest the better heat storage capability associated with the concrete surface explained its longer ei duration time refer to section 3 4 the correlation between the δst representing the daytime surface temperature minus nighttime surface temperature and urban ei duration time is displayed in fig 10 d clearly a negative relationship between δst and ei duration time is observed the average duration time of ei for concrete surfaces was 3 2 days followed by gravel surfaces 3 1 days asphalt surfaces 1 4 days and tile 0 7 days notice that although the heat storage capacity of the gravel surface is worse than that of the concrete surface their ei durations are similar 3 2 days for concrete and 3 1 days for gravel these results can be explained as the gravel surface stored more water than the concrete surface and can be used for longer durations of evaporation the concrete surface had a highest heat efflux rate and a longest duration time of ei leading to a broader water cycle which positively impacts the urban energy exchange and uhi mitigation in conclusion it is found that urban ei is controlled by the joint effect of meteorological elements water retention and thermodynamic characteristics of impervious surface for the four types of commonly used concrete materials the gravel had the best water retention capability and resulted in the highest spatially averaged ei while the concrete surface had the best thermal storage capability and results in the longest duration time of ei table 2 summarizes the specific information about water retention and thermal capabilities of four types of impervious surface materials 4 2 differences of ei characteristics between two urban ec sites this study used two ec sites for urban ei analysis the reason for selection of these two urban ec sites is that they are located in different climates and have different land cover and impervious material compositions meanwhile the cross slopes of the traffic roads near the two ec sites are also quite different therefore a comparative analysis of the ei from the seclected two urban ec sites could provide a comprehensive and deep understanding about the response of urban ei to different climates impervious surface materials and road slopes settings the above results indicated that the ei between the two ec sites exhibited a large difference in both of the magnitude and temporal characteristics although the annual ei of the ca site was significantly higher than that of the nk site the nk site maintained a longer ei duration time than the ca site affected by the subtropical monsoon climate the annual rainfall amount and rainfall events in shenzhen were significantly larger than in tianjin as a consequence ca site produced higher annual ei than the nk site due to adequate water supply nevertheless the ei et values for the two ec sites were relatively close 0 11 for nk site and 0 14 for ca site during the rainy period refer to section 3 4 one explanation is the larger proportion of impervious surfaces near the nk site than the ca site as a result the nk site had a larger evaporation surface than the ca site thus promoted ei another explanation is that nk site had smaller annual evapotranspiration than ca site the lower annual evapotranspiration consequenced the ei et in the nk site was close to the ca site despite the annual ei of the nk site was significantly lower than that of the ca site the duration time of ei in the ca site was shorter than the nk site which could be attributed to the different concrete material compositions and road slopes near the two sites first the larger proportion of concrete surface near the nk site led to a stronger heat storage capacity thus maintained the ei for a longer time than the ca site second the cross slope of the road near the nk site 1 8 was more gentle than that of the ca site 2 9 thereby the road near the nk site could store more water for continuous evaporation thrid a small fraction of gravel surface existed near the nk site the stronger water retention capability of the gravel surface significantly extended the ei duration time for the nk site in general the different magnitude of urban ei and ei et between the two ec sites were mainly explained as discrepancy in rainfall and evapotranspiration due to different climatic conditions however the varying ei duration time of the two ec sites were mainly caused by the different concrete materials and road slopes near the two ec sites 4 3 implications of urban ei on the regional hydrological cycle energy balance and turbulent transport process significant increase in urban ei during the rainfall period altered regional hydrological cycle energy balance and turbulent transport process understanding the impact of ei on the urban hydrological cycle is essential as it closely relates to scientific urban water resource management allocation and decision making previously it was thought that all of the rainfall in the impervious areas was drained through the underground pipe network lee et al 2018 evaporation from impervious surfaces is ignored in most urban hydrological models and watershed hydrological models such as mike and storm water management model swmm sun et al 2014 feng 2021 ma et al 2022 however the results of this study confirmed that the amount of ei and ei et is considerable during the rainy period to this end ignoring ei will lead to conceptual errors in the urban hydrological models and cause significant uncertainty in hydrological elements simulations therefore an independent calculation module for impervious surface evaporation should be added to the next version of the hydrological models on the other hand higher ei after rain events will reduce urban runoff and infiltration consequently the existing urban drainage standards may overestimate the actual runoff reduction requirements considering the contribution of ei to runoff reduction in the design standard of the drainage network will help reduce the budget and cost of drainage network construction in addition to altering the urban hydrological cycle ei also changed the energy balance process in urban areas a recent study has shown that urbanization reduced regional latent heat flux le and increased sensible heat flux h and bowen ratio br chen et al 2022a b the increased h and br eventually led to urban warming and the urban heat island effect uhi br is a critical parameter in the energy balance equation as it closely relates to the accurate net radiation flux partitioning angus and watts 1984 richard et al 2000 to gain an in depth understanding of the impact of urban ei on br the daily br was calculated during the rainy period for the two sites fig 11 a b shows the plots of daily br variation during the selected rainy periods for the two stations clearly br dropped significantly within 1 2 days after rain events and rose to a normal level over the next few days the average br value was about 0 6 during the rainy period while the average br value was larger than 1 during the non rainy period for the two ec stations the results confirmed that the urban ei partially offset the urban warming trend as the ei increased the le and reduced the h and br although the proportion of ei in total urban et is relatively lower the weakening effect of ei on urban warming and uhi is even higher than that of vegetation transpiration and soil evaporation during rainy periods these results also highlighted the cooling effect of precipitation on urban warming which is very meaningful for cities with large annual precipitation the impact of ei on transfer efficiencies for water vapour flux and sensible heat flux in urban areas was further investigated ramamurthy and bou zeid 2014 the turbulent transport similarity is defined as atmospheric turbulence transports sensible and latent heat fluxes from the surface to the atmospheric boundary layer with similar efficiency dias 2013 this assumption works well for homogeneous surfaces such as natural ecosystems and cultivated lands however the turbulent transport similarity is disrupted in urban areas due to the diversity and heterogeneity of sources and sinks of heat and water vapour asanuma and brutsaert 1999 nordbo et al 2013 ramamurthy and bou zeid 2014 the establishment of the turbulent transport similarity is critical as it determines whether the ei can effectively alleviate the urban heat island effect ramamurthy and bou zeid 2014 compared the transfer efficiency of heat and water vapor for two ec towers one grass site and one urban site and suggested that the turbulent transport effectiveness of sensible heat is higher than the latent heat for a dry urban area li et al 2012 indicated that buoyancy effects in urban flow increased sensible heat transfer effectiveness which was also reported in rotach et al 2005 to investigate whether higher ei values during rainy periods can effectively improve latent heat flux transport efficiency and restore flux transport similarity in urban area we compared the turbulent transport efficiency values for heat rwh and water vapour rwq during non rainy and rainy periods the specific calculation methods for the two turbulent transport efficiency parameters rwh and rwq are referred to appendix a1 a2 ramamurthy and bou zeid 2014 fig 11 c d shows the histograms of daily δ values represents the rwh minus rwq during rainy and non rainy periods in the whole year 2021 for the two ec stations as envisaged in fig 11 c d the annual average δ values δ rwh rwq were 0 54 and 0 50 for the two ec stations during the non rainy period while the annual average δ values were 0 01 and 0 05 for the two ec stations during the rainy periods clearly the rwh and rwq values were relatively close during the rainy period but were pretty different during the non rain periods generally rwh was higher than rwq during the non rainy periods although some obvious inconsistence between rwh and rwq was observed the relative close rwh and rwq values during the rainy periods demonstrated that the turbulent transport similarity can be recovered in urban areas actually rwh and rwq cannot be exactly the same but only roughly the same due to they have different physics meanings roth and oke 1995 these results indicated that the latent heat flux could exchange and transport with the similar turbulent transport efficiency as sensible heat flux between the ground surface and atmospheric boundary layer during the rainy periods overall according to the above discussion urban ei significantly altered the regional hydrological cycle energy balance and turbulent transport process urban ei reduced runoff and infiltration thereby alleviating pipe network drainage pressure moreover urban ei reduced the h and br increased the turbulent transport efficiency of latent heat flux and restored turbulent transport similarity in urban areas 4 4 primary uncertainty limitations of the study and ways forward the evaporation from the urban impervious surface was estimated using ec observations and flux footprint model which provided a new and promising method for urban ei determination considering the limitations of the ec technology and flux footprint model the results of this study still have large uncertainties and require further improvements in the subsequent research the uncertainty of this study mainly comes from the following aspects 1 uncertainty comes from ec observations on rainy days the biggest challenge in current urban et research is accurate et observation during rainfall periods in this study the ec system was applied to measure the urban ei because of its capability to obtain the flux information on a large spatial scale and trace the flux contribution from different land uses previous studies had shown that the ec system was unreliable during rain events as the glass windows of the open circuit sensors li 7500 and ec 150 are saturated 30 60 min heusinkveld et al 2008 ramamurthy and bou zeid 2014 moreover the three dimensional ultrasonic anemometer will also produce errors on the rainy days in this study we used a clear baffle above the ec system to protect the li 7500 and ec 150 sensors when rain occurs the flux data quality evaluation suggested that the protection of glass windows significantly improved the reliability of the open path ec system in flux observations during the rainy events refer to results in section 3 1 nevertheless this practice may disrupt the eddy currents and turbulent diffusion above the ec system thus causing errors in et flux observation as an alternative the closed path ec system avoids exposure of the glass windows to air during rainy days however the wind speed observation errors from the three dimensional ultrasonic anemometer are still an inevitable problem therefore follow up research needs to optimize the existing ec system to enhance the observation ability of the water and heat fluxes on rainy days 2 uncertainties caused by energy non closure problem limited by the sensor size and installation height of the ec system the ec observed fluxes can only represent the turbulent transport of small eddies near the surface ground but cannot represent the turbulent transport of large eddies in the upper atmosphere as a consequence the energy non closure problem is occurred for the ec system in this study the average energy closure ratio ecr le h rn g was 0 79 for the nk station and 0 77 for the ca station during the whole year 2021 the ecr values for the two urban ec sites were generally lower than the previous studies conducted in the natural ecosystem wilson et al 2002 pan et al 2017 gerken et al 2017 and cultivated area eshonkulov et al 2019 mbangiwa et al 2019 the relatively lower ecr value of the urban flux station is due to the highly heterogeneity of the urban underlying surface and existion of anthropogenic heat flux that resulting in complex near surface eddy currents in this study although the classic bowen s ratio method was implemented to rectify the energy closure it did not completely solve the serious energy non closure issue of urban ec systems previous studies have shown that the errors for measured le was larger than 10 w m2 when use the bowen ratio method to correct energy closure pan et al 2017 undoubtedly the errors caused by the energy imbalance problem will lead to ei uncertainty through error transmission therefore follow up research is expected to propose an enhanced energy balance correction method for urban ec system which will help to further improve the reliability of urban ei determination 3 uncertainties from flux footprint model and spatial resolution of the satellite image this study performed the euler analytic function based analytic flux footprint model to calculate the flux footprint areas for the two ec sites due to the lower computing resource requirements however previous studies demonstrated that the euler equation based flux footprint model might underestimate the flux contributing source area kormann and meixner 2001 kumari et al 2020 which will lead to systematic errors in the urban ei estimation in addition the extraction of land use and land cover information from sentinel 2 satellite imagery and the relatively lower spatial resolution of satellite products will also result in errors in ei estimation the application of the deep learning method to extract land use information around the two ec sites has considerable uncertainty limited by the training samples luus et al 2015 burud 2021 on the other hand the spatial resolution of sentinel 2 satellite imagery is 10 m which is the highest resolution that can be obtained for various open source satellite data sets however the 10 m spatial resolution is not clear enough to accurately distinguish the edge information of impervious surfaces in urban areas with high heterogeneity if the width of the road is less than 10 m there may be a large error in the pixel scale impervious surface extraction and ei determination to this end more efforts are needed to use unmanned aerial vehicle uav and visible light imagers to achieve accurate extraction of impervious surface pixels which provide the opportunity to further enhance the reliability of urban ei determination 5 conclusions this study proposed an urban impervious surface evaporation ei method based on ec observations flux footprint model and urban land use information the proposed urban ei method was applied in two urban ec stations in china the temporal characteristics of urban ei and contributions of urban ei to total urban et ei et for the two ec towers were analyzed the impact of urban ei on the regional energy balance and turbulent transport process were revealed the main conclusions of the study are summarized as follows 1 the two ec systems well captured et flux during rainy days for nk station more than 76 of observed flux data can be used for ei analysis during rainy periods for ca station more than 78 of observed flux data can be used for ei analysis during rainy periods 2 the daily ei exhibited highly intermittent temporal patterns for the two ec stations the ei value was 0 during the non rainy period and reached its peak in the following 1 2 days after the rainy events then gradually decreased to 0 the decline rate of ei at the ca site was higher than that of the nk site which is due to the larger cross slope of the road and the existence of a large area of asphalt surface near the ca site 3 the daily ei et was 0 during the non rainy period the average daily ei et ranged from 0 11 to 0 14 for the two ec stations during the rainy period the temporal changes of ei et in different impervious surfaces exhibited large differences where the ei et in concrete surfaces sustained a longer time than the asphalt and roof surfaces the temporal patterns of ei for different impervious surfaces mainly depend on the impervious surface materials water retention and thermodynamic properties 4 urban ei significantly changed the regional energy balance and turbulent transport process urban ei reduced urban h and br during rainy periods thereby helping to mitigation of urban warming and the uhi effect moreover ei increased the turbulent transport efficiency of latent heat flux rwq during the rainy period and restored turbulent transport similarity in urban areas 5 urban ei is mainly controlled by meteorological factors water retention and thermal properties of impervious surface materials the spatial average ei is positively correlated with the water retention capability of impervious surface materials the ei duration time is controlled by the surface temperature and the heat storage capacity of the impervious surface the gravel has the best water retention capability resulting in the highest spatial average ei in contrast the concrete surface has the best thermal storage capability resulting in the longest duration time of ei declaration

2608,methane and water vapor transport in shale mud rocks is important in many resource and environmental issues e g effectively exploiting shale gas and clearly understanding water and methane global cycles to investigate methane and water vapor permeability in shale a new permeability determination method was proposed using a linearization approach based on previous studies the experimental samples are crushed carboniferous shale from the eastern qaidam basin in china simultaneous methane and water vapor transport experiments in shale were performed water vapor was derived through deionized water evaporation under different methane pressures the relative humidity dynamically changed during the experiment the methane and water vapor transport processes were observed and recorded and the methane and water vapor permeability in the shale matrix was calculated both the methane and water vapor permeabilities temporally varied and a critical abrupt point occurred in the decreasing process over time after the abrupt point the permeability rapidly decreased which was mainly due to capillary condensation plugging at high relative humidities pore throat closure could dramatically affect permeability the relationship between permeability and water saturation s w conformed to an exponential equation methane permeability was sensitive to water saturation variation at very low or high levels s w 20 or s w 50 respectively and relatively insensitive at a moderate water content water vapor permeability variation with water saturation was similar to that in methane but basically remained stable at a moderate water saturation 10 s w 50 at high water saturations water vapor permeability reduction was more sensitive than that in methane keywords methane and water vapor

2014 ghanbari and dehghanpour 2016 water is usually adsorbed onto the surface of shale particles or freely occurs in the shale pore space water in shale may have negative effects on the gas storage capacity of reservoirs gasparik et al 2014 wang et al 2018 and gas migration in shale pores landry et al 2016 li et al 2019 the transport properties of water and gas in shale matrices need further study the permeability is an important parameter to characterize the fluid transport capacity the growing interest in shale gas has led to a broader study of the shale permeability permeability models under different knudsen numbers were obtained by using weight coefficients determined via nonlinear superposition of diffusion and sliding flow regimes shi et al 2013 a general expression for the apparent permeability of dense porous media was derived using a hagen poiseuille type equation ali and george 1999 florence et al 2007 the gas slip factor and knudsen number were linked in the model florence et al 2007 proposed a complex polynomial function to estimate the intrinsic permeability while considering gas flow in microtubules with the use of the molecular collision frequency as a weighting factor to couple slip flow and knudsen diffusion wu et al 2015 established a gas transport model for nanopores with circular and rectangular cross sections the mercury intrusion curve method and gas method are common methods for measuring the permeability of shale samples in the laboratory cui et al 2009 adsorption has a non negligible effect on permeability perera 2017 perera et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 methods to measure permeability using gas adsorption experiments have been proposed and they all calculated the permeability after adsorption equilibrium using partial data from dynamic methane adsorption experiments cui et al 2009 wang and yu 2019 zhao et al 2019 liu and yu 2022 studied the permeability during dynamic water vapor adsorption at helium pressure although the dynamic permeability variation at methane pressure is of more practical interest furthermore permeability models considering gas adsorption stress dependence non darcy flow and surface diffusion have been established song et al 2016 wang et al 2015 most of these permeability measurement methods are static techniques and research on permeability in the dynamic adsorption process of shale gas remains insufficient numerous studies have demonstrated that water can reduce the gas permeability in rocks chakraborty et al 2017 hun et al 2016 yang and yu 2020 the gas permeability in tight sandstones decreased by 3 orders of magnitude with increasing water content amann hildenbrand et al 2017 through methane permeability comparison between wet and dry shale it was found that the permeability decreased with increasing water saturation wang and yu 2020 in porous media water transport can occur in the liquid or gas phase depending on the transport mechanism chong et al 2018 kalra et al 2003 liquid water infiltration from fractures macropores into the matrix can be mainly attributed to capillarity engelder 2012 water vapor flow in shale nanopores mainly involves volume diffusion of the water vapor phase surface diffusion of the adsorbed phase and flow of capillary condensate choi et al 2001 sirghi 2012 to further study the effect of water on rocks sang et al 2020 and yang et al 2021 have estimated the permeability or diffusion coefficient using experimental data pertaining to dynamic water vapor adsorption the water vapor permeability in shale gradually decreased with water vapor adsorption and basically did not change when the experiment reached equilibrium liu and yu 2022 it should be noted that this experiment was performed under helium pressure water plays an important role in fluid transport yet the study of the fluid permeability in shale reservoirs is insufficiently comprehensive in particular there are few reports on the permeability during mixed gas adsorption experiments in this paper three shale samples from the qaidam basin were used to investigate permeability evolution of methane and water vapor when their mixture transported in shale a new method to calculate the permeability using dynamic methane and water vapor transport data was proposed pure methane transport experiments in dry shale were conducted prior to simultaneous methane and water vapor transport experiments in shale the water vapor and methane adsorption amount and permeability under different pressures were measured and calculated the temporal evolution of the methane and water vapor permeability was analyzed the similarities and differences between the methane and water vapor permeability changes during the experiments were compared a relation between the permeability and water saturation was established the effect of rock composition on permeability and adsorption was also examined 2 methodology 2 1 theory if gas transport in shale is dominated by gas seepage in pores a permeability calculation model considering gas adsorption can be established combined with the law of conservation of mass and darcy s law

mesopores the pore diameter of the micropores is less than or equal to 2 nm these three grades of pores are based on the classification of pores by the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac sing 1985 sangwichien et al 2002 the pore size distributions of mesopores and micropores were obtained via low pressure n2 adsorption experiments and low pressure co2 adsorption experiments respectively please refer to liu and yu 2022 for a detailed description of the microstructural characteristics of the samples the simultaneous methane and water vapor transport experiments in shale were performed using an isothermal adsorption device a schematic diagram of the experimental apparatus is shown in fig 4 water vapor was obtained through deionized water 6 ml evaporation the experimental temperature was set to 40 c with a relative error of 0 2 c during the simultaneous transport experiments methane was injected into the reference cell evacuated beforehand and stabilized for 4 h place the dry shale in the prepared sample box the sample box and deionized water were immediately placed in the adsorption chamber the valve was closed after flowing methane into the adsorption cell and the experiment was initiated the temperature relative humidity and pressure in the adsorption cell were detected in real time simultaneous transport experiments under three pressures 1 3 and 5 mpa were conducted involving each sample the overall procedure of the reference experiments was the same as that of the simultaneous transport experiments except that no sample was loaded pure methane transport experiments in dry shale were also performed in this study more experimental procedure details can be found in previous studies liu and yu 2022 ma and yu 2022 zhang and

be calculated based on the functional relationship between evaporation rate and relative humidity obtained via liquid water evaporation comparison experiments liu and yu 2022 zhang and yu 2022 according to the comparative experiment under methane pressure a scatter plot of the evaporation rate and relative humidity was obtained as shown in fig 5 in regard to this experiment it was difficult to fit the relationship with a single equation therefore the method of piecewise curve fitting was adopted pourkarimi et al 2011 gálvez and iglesias 2016 used a particle based heuristic method to determine the optimal values of the breakpoints and extreme values of their fitted curve and the curve fit was satisfactory in terms of self intersection aspects and sharp curvature changes in this paper 1stopt software multivariate nonlinear curve fitting software based on the levenberg marquardt and general global optimization algorithm nian et al 2018 was used to perform piecewise regression analysis of the relationship between the evaporation rate and relative humidity the evolution of the evaporation rate with relative humidity could be divided into two stages the segment points and fitted equations under each pressure are summarized in table 2 via the application of the equations in table 2 to the simultaneous transport experiments in shale the water evaporation amount could be obtained fig 6 shows the evaporation amount of water w e and the amount of free water vapor w f during the simultaneous transport experiments the amounts of methane and water vapor adsorbed were obtained based on the calculation method in section 2 2 the changes of methane and water vapor adsorption with time during the simultaneous transport experiments are shown in fig 7 a c methane reached adsorption equilibrium faster than did water vapor the higher the methane pressure was the higher the methane adsorption amount and the smaller the water vapor adsorption amount fig 7 d f show the evolution in methane adsorption over time during the pure methane transport experiments in dry shale after the simultaneous transport experiments the samples were immediately taken out and weighed the equilibrium adsorption amount of water vapor can be calculated by using the mass of the samples before and after the experiment fig 8 shows the water vapor equilibrium adsorption amount obtained with the calculation and gravimetric methods the difference between the two methods remains within 5 it is feasible to use the method presented in section 2 2 2 to calculate the water vapor adsorption amount table 3 lists the experimental time and equilibrium adsorption amount as shown in fig 9 during the pure methane transport experiments in dry shale s1 and s3 exhibited the highest and lowest methane equilibrium adsorption amount respectively and the methane adsorption amount increased with increasing pressure the methane adsorption amount at each pressure was significantly smaller than that of water vapor in the simultaneous transport experiments as shown in fig 10 the water vapor equilibrium adsorption amount was 4 4 27 6 times that of methane the water vapor adsorption amounts of the three samples indicated the order of s1 s2 s3 according to figs 9 and 10 a the pure methane adsorption amount during the dry shale experiments was greater than that during the simultaneous methane and water vapor transport experiments 3 2 permeability and its temporal evolution the simultaneous methane and water vapor transport experiments and pure methane transport experiments were performed involving all three crushed shale samples at 1 3 and 5 mpa and the gas permeability was calculated using the experimental data methane and water vapor permeability values were calculated with the method described in section 2 1 a prerequisite for applying this method is that the gas density pressure change is considerably small cui et al 2009 considered a pressure change less than 10 sufficiently small wang and yu 2019 calculated the methane permeability during the last 1 h of the experimental equilibrium stage without providing a specific pressure variation range in this study the methane t 100 s and water vapor t 10 s permeability was calculated at a gas density change less than 0 02 fig 2 obviously the method in this paper is able to calculate the permeability for almost the entire adsorption process which is the advantage of this method compared with previous studies fig 11 a c show the variation in methane permeability over time during the pure methane transport experiments in dry shale the permeability decreased with methane adsorption and stabilized as the adsorption process approached equilibrium the change in methane permeability over time during the simultaneous transport experiments is shown in fig 11 d f the methane permeability gradually decreased and stabilized at the end of the experiment experimental and computational results generally indicated that the methane permeability decreased with increasing pressure fig 11 g i show the temporal water vapor permeability variation during the simultaneous transport experiments the water vapor permeability first decreased slowly then decreased rapidly over time and finally stabilized the variation in water vapor under each methane pressure revealed no obvious regularity table 4 provides the gas permeability at experimental equilibrium during the pure methane transport experiments in dry shale and the simultaneous methane and water vapor transport experiments during the pure methane transport experiments the equilibrium permeability ranged from 1 1332 10 21 to 7 1969 10 21 m2 during the simultaneous transport experiments the equilibrium methane permeability ranged from 4 315 10 24 26 3082 10 23 m2 and the equilibrium water vapor permeability ranged from 9 335 10 25 5 5711 10 24 m2 the temporal evolution of the methane and water vapor permeability during the experiments was analyzed based on the permeability calculation results fig 11 we selected data points best reflecting the permeability temporal evolution and connected them with smooth curves fig 12 shows the temporal evolution of the permeability fig 12 a c show that the methane permeability during the pure methane transport experiments in dry shale first rapidly decreased over time and then tended to stabilize as shown in fig 13 pure methane was rapidly adsorbed in the shale pores and adsorption equilibrium was reached from 100 to 1000 s the permeability rapidly decreased with increasing methane adsorption and stabilized at methane adsorption equilibrium during the pure methane transport experiments in dry shale methane adsorption was the main reason for the permeability decrease if the experimental fluid becomes adsorbed in the experimental sample permeability determination must consider the adsorption effect cui et al 2009 mahmoud et al 2019 studied the adsorption effect on the permeability measured via pulse attenuation using carbonate cores the predicted permeability results based on the freundlich correction model were overestimated by 35 without considering adsorption there are differences between various computational models and relative calculation errors can occur compared to helium and nitrogen shale permeability measurement with methane could provide a better understanding of the actual gas transport mechanism in shale cao et al 2016 proposed a shale permeability measurement method considering adsorption and through experiments and calculations they determined that if gas adsorption were not considered the permeability in pure shale could be underestimated by up to 97 the gas adsorption effect in shale on permeability measurement cannot be neglected fig 12 d f show the change in methane permeability over time during the simultaneous transport experiments in shale during the experiments the methane permeability exhibited a decreasing trend with different decrease rates as shown in fig 14 during the simultaneous transport experiments the methane permeability varied continuously over time during the first 5 min approximately of the experiments the methane permeability decreased rapidly the main reason for the permeability reduction at this time was the adsorption of methane and water vapor the adsorbed molecules reduced the pore channels for gas transport and the permeability significantly decreased moreover water vapor could hinder the transport of methane molecules rani et al 2018 comparing fig 12 a c and d f it could be found that the methane permeability during the simultaneous transport experiments was lower than that during the pure methane transport experiments the decrease rate of the methane permeability declined as the methane adsorption process increasingly approached equilibrium the decrease in methane permeability was mainly due to water vapor adsorption with increasing experimental progress the relative humidity continuously increased water vapor experienced capillary condensation in the shale pores progressive thickening of the water film resulted in nanopore channel blocking li et al 2016 as marked by the red dashed lines and arrows in fig 14 the blocked pore channels led to a rapid permeability drop at the end of the experiments both methane and water vapor reached a dynamic equilibrium between adsorption and desorption and the simultaneous methane and water vapor transport process tended to remain stable this equilibrium permeability could characterize the shale gas permeability at the corresponding water content the temporal evolution of the water vapor permeability is shown in fig 12 g i to analyze the water vapor permeability reduction the water vapor permeability and methane and water vapor adsorption versus time are plotted in fig 15 at the early stage of the experiments methane and water vapor quickly entered the shale nanopore channels and adsorption occurred the pore channels were reduced and the permeability decreased fig 15 shows that the methane adsorption amount at the early stage of the experiments was greater than that of water vapor therefore methane adsorption at this stage more notably impacted the water vapor permeability the water vapor permeability slightly changed from approximately 100 s to 10000 s according to lee and hwang 1986 when the relative humidity is lower than 0 8 the permeability of samples without adsorption increases with increasing relative humidity under low relative pressures the bulk flow of water vapor and surface flow of the adsorbed phase dominate the initial flow pattern sang et al 2020 water vapor adsorption in shale cannot be neglected which reduces the permeability the combination of these reasons led to a slight decrease in the water vapor permeability during this period under high relative pressures the water vapor permeability sharply decreased over time the red dotted line in fig 15 marks the critical point at which the water vapor permeability began to sharply decline previous studies have determined that permeability reduction at high relative humidities can be attributed to a shift in the flow pattern from domination by capillary forces to domination by the total gas pressure gradient jaguste and bhatia 1995 lee and hwang 1986 rhim and hwang 1975 this occurs because capillary saturation ensues in the shale pore channels the appearance of capillary condensate could lead to blockage of narrow pores ghanizadeh et al 2014a ghanizadeh et al 2014b yoshimoto et al 2017 contributing to a rapid decrease in permeability at the later stage of the experiments the adsorption process reached equilibrium the relative humidity remained basically unchanged and the water vapor permeability tended to remain stable 3 3 comparison of the water vapor and methane permeability fig 12 d i show that there occurred significant differences in the temporal evolution of the methane and water vapor permeability according to figs 14 and 15 comparative analysis of the time dependent processes of the methane and water vapor permeability was conducted early in the experiments the reduction in the water vapor permeability was not as large as that in the methane permeability the methane permeability rapidly decreased during the first 5 min of the experiments while the water vapor permeability rapidly decreased during the first 100 s the water vapor permeability reduction was less than that in methane the adsorbed methane molecules increasingly occupied the pore space the loss of methane permeability was therefore severe both the total and amounts of free water vapor entering the shale pores increased because water vapor originated from the continuous evaporation of liquid water an increase in relative humidity could promote water vapor seepage but the hindering effect of adsorption was highly obvious therefore the water vapor permeability continuously decreased and the rate of decrease was lower than that of methane after 5 min the reduction in methane permeability decelerated while the change in the water vapor permeability was not obvious from 100 s the methane permeability continued to decrease due to the increase in water saturation the promoting effect of relative humidity enhancement on the water vapor permeability was counteracted by the hindering effect of adsorption on the permeability and the change in the water vapor permeability was small after pore plugging approximately 10000 s both the methane and water vapor permeabilities rapidly decreased the water vapor permeability decreased more significantly the occurrence of capillary condensation exerted a great influence on the water vapor permeability when the experimental equilibrium was reached both the methane and water vapor permeabilities tended to stabilize fig 12 d f show that the methane permeability evolution indicated that the methane permeability is negatively related to the pressure either during the experiments or at equilibrium table 4 demonstrates that the water vapor permeability was lower than the methane permeability at experimental equilibrium the shale permeability may vary with the permeate fluid according to previous studies the decreasing order of permeability is he n2 ch4 co2 adeboye and bustin 2013 han et al 2010 pan et al 2010 the wettability of rock to the permeating fluid gas adsorption and slip flow effect contribute to permeability variation busch and gensterblum 2011 han et al 2010 pan and connell 2012 pini et al 2009 there existed no obvious law in the change in water vapor permeability under the various pressures during the experiments at adsorption equilibrium the water vapor permeability decreased with increasing pressure 3 4 relationship between the permeability and water saturation the water saturation of the shale samples could be calculated according to the test results of the pore size distribution and those of the water vapor adsorption amount it should be noted that the water saturation obtained in this paper is the dynamic water saturation of the shale samples during the experiments rather than the equilibrium water saturation at the corresponding relative humidity figs 16 and 17 show the relationship of the methane permeability and the water vapor permeability to water saturation respectively there existed a negative correlation between the permeability and water saturation and the relationship between these two quantities conformed to the following exponential equation 32 k a 1 e s w t 1 a 2 e s w t 2 b or 33 k a 1 e s w t 1 a 2 e s w t 2 a 3 e s w t 3 b where s w is the water saturation and a 1 a 2 a 3 t 1 t 2 t 3 and b are fitting parameters tables 5 and 6 list the fitted equations and correlation coefficients respectively between the methane and water vapor permeability and water saturation fig 16 shows that the methane permeability decreased with increasing shale water saturation a low water saturation corresponds to the initial phase of the experiment at the initial stage methane adsorption rapidly increased fig 14 and the methane permeability was greatly affected by methane adsorption when the water saturation varied between 20 and 50 or 60 the methane permeability slowly decreased with increasing water saturation when the water saturation was higher than 50 or 60 the methane permeability significantly decreased with the water saturation wang and yu 2020 obtained similar conclusions they conducted methane adsorption experiments using dry shale and shale with different water contents and calculated the permeability at experimental equilibrium they obtained that the methane permeability decreased with the water content fig 17 shows that the water vapor permeability decreased with increasing water saturation and the decrease rate of the permeability differed among the various water saturations choosing sample s1 at 1 mpa as an example when the water saturation was lower than 8 the water vapor permeability rapidly decreased with increasing water saturation when the water saturation varied between 8 and 68 the water vapor permeability slowly decreased or even did not change with the water saturation when the water saturation was higher than 68 the water vapor permeability rapidly decreased section 3 2 outlines the reasons for the above decrease in permeability liu and yu 2022 calculated the permeability during a water vapor adsorption experiment in shale under helium pressure and determined that the water vapor permeability and water saturation fit the exponential equation of k e a b s w c s w 2 where a b and c are fitting parameters the methane adsorption effect on the water vapor permeability cannot be ignored which leads to a highly obvious reduction in the water vapor permeability methane imposes a stronger inhibitory effect on liquid water evaporation than that of helium liu and yu 2022 ma and yu 2022 zhang and yu 2022 hence the water vapor adsorption rate under methane pressure is lower than that under helium pressure the distribution of the water saturation in shale differs between the two experimental processes and the exponential equations for the water vapor permeability and water saturation also vary comparing figs 16 and 17 it could be found that there occurred differences in the variation patterns of the methane and water vapor permeability with the water saturation when the water saturation varied between approximately 20 and 60 the reduction in the methane permeability with the water saturation was greater than that in the water vapor permeability the reduction in the methane permeability revealed a hysteresis phenomenon compared to that in the water vapor permeability the methane permeability evolution under the different pressures basically revealed that the higher the pressure was the smaller the permeability the water vapor permeability exhibited no obvious relationship with the total gas mixture pressure the water saturation corresponding to the sudden drop point of permeability decreased with increasing pressure this could be mainly attributed to the difference in relative humidity under each pressure verma and pruess 1988 proposed the following relationship between the porosity and permeability 34 k k 0 φ φ c φ 0 φ c n where k 0 and φ 0 are the initial permeability and porosity respectively φ c is the critical porosity where the permeability is reduced to zero and n is the exponent we adopted the first permeability value calculated in the experiment as the initial permeability the critical porosity could not be obtained in this study however the value of φ φ c could be calculated according to the water saturation fig 18 a shows the permeability reduction under the three models proposed by verma and pruess 1988 the cubic model refers to the model in which all flow channels are straight flat and equal in diameter all channels in the series model are planar and identical verma and pruess 1988 fig 18 b and c show the methane and water vapor permeability versus porosity in this study respectively comparing fig 18 b and c to fig 18 a it could be observed that the relationship between the permeability and porosity in this study conformed to the series model and it could be expected that φ c is less than 0 8 fig 18 shows that the bound porosity highly significantly affects permeability reduction pore throat closure could cause dramatic permeability changes 3 5 effect of the rock composition on the permeability the correlations between methane and water vapor adsorption and shale physico chemical characteristics were analyzed among the three shale samples s1 exhibited the largest adsorption amount and s3 attained the smallest table 3 clay minerals and quartz were the main mineral components of the three shale samples liu and yu 2022 fig 19 a c show that both the methane and water vapor adsorption amounts achieved a suitable positive correlation with the clay mineral content clay minerals contain a high internal specific surface area which can provide a large adsorption space for gases sang et al 2018 clay minerals especially illite and montmorillonite are strongly hydrophilic so shale with a relatively high clay mineral content can achieve higher water vapor adsorption yang et al 2016 yang and yu 2020 there existed a negative correlation between the quartz content and gas adsorption amount but the correlation was poor as shown in fig 19 d f the methane and water vapor adsorption amounts were positively correlated with the toc content fig 19 g i wu and yu 2020 experimentally determined that the water condensation amount increased with increasing toc content organics are generally hydrophobic but organic minerals provide more nanopores chen and xiao 2014 morishige et al 2014 offering more space for methane and water vapor to adsorb a permeability comparison between the samples was conducted based on the methane and water vapor permeability at experimental equilibrium during the pure methane transport experiments the s3 sample exhibited the highest methane permeability followed by the s2 and s1 samples table 4 during the simultaneous methane and water vapor transport experiments the presence of water vapor complicated the gas transportation process and there occurred differences in the relationship between the permeability of each sample among the various pressures except for individual experiments the permeability was negatively correlated with the clay content as shown in fig 20 a c the higher the clay content was the more the pore volume occupied by gas adsorption and the lower the permeability fig 20 d f show that there existed a certain negative correlation between the permeability and toc content the fluid conductivity in organic rich shale matrices is governed by the transport properties of the inorganic and organic components ghanizadeh et al 2014a inorganic substrates typically contain large pores and irregularly shaped cracks whereas organic substrates kerogen are finely dispersed in inorganic matrices and can comprise micro and mesopore networks depending on the maturity of the organics and the type of kerogen bernard et al 2012a curtis et al 2012 based on experimental observations ghanizadeh et al 2014a found that the fluid transport characteristics of organic rich shale are significantly affected by the thermal maturity bernard et al 2012a and the existence and connectivity of micro and mesopores in organic molecules within particles bernard et al 2012a bernard et al 2012b the thermal maturity of the samples used in this study was relatively consistent table 1 and the correlation between the thermal maturity and permeability was not analyzed theoretically the presence of organic matter contributes to the pore space and the permeability should increase in regard to adsorbent fluids however this rule may no longer be satisfied fig 20 g i show that the methane permeability in dry shale was positively correlated with the mesopore volume percentage the correlation between the methane and water vapor permeability and the mesopore volume percentage worsened in partially saturated shale 4 conclusions a new method was proposed to investigate the permeability evolution of methane and water vapor while they simultaneously transported in shale simultaneous methane and water vapor transport experiments in shale and pure methane transport experiments in dry shale were conducted and the results were compared according to the experimental and calculation results several findings were drawn the permeability of the shale samples over time in this study ranged from 9 335 10 25 4 1502 10 16 m2 the permeability decreased over time in the seepage process due to gas adsorption during the pure methane transport experiments in dry shale the equilibrium methane permeability ranged from 1 1332 10 21 7 1969 10 21 m2 during the simultaneous transport experiments the equilibrium permeability values of methane and water vapor ranged from 4 315 10 24 26 3082 10 23 m2 and 9 335 10 25 5 5711 10 24 m2 respectively during the pure methane experiments the methane permeability decreased over time and gradually stabilized as the methane adsorption process approached equilibrium the influence of methane adsorption in shale on permeability measurement cannot be neglected during the simultaneous transport experiments the reduction in the methane and water vapor permeability generally first rapidly increased then slowly rose and then suddenly accelerated at the early stage of the experiments the water vapor permeability reduction was smaller than that in methane especially between 100 and 10000 s the water vapor permeability basically remained unchanged a sudden reduction in both the methane and water vapor permeability occurred at approximately 10000 s the reduction in the methane permeability lagged behind that in the water vapor permeability and the decrease rate and value of the water vapor permeability were higher than those of the methane permeability the sudden drop in permeability was due to capillary plugging the methane and water vapor permeability reduction with the water saturation satisfied the exponential equation of k a 1 e s w t 1 a 2 e s w t 2 a 3 e s w t 3 b where a 1 a 2 a 3 t 1 t 2 t 3 and b are fitting parameters when the water saturation varied between 20 and 50 or 60 the decrease rate of the methane permeability decelerated with increasing water saturation the methane permeability rapidly decreased when the water saturation was higher than 50 or 60 the variation in the water vapor permeability with the water saturation differed from that in the methane permeability at a moderate water saturation the water vapor permeability essentially remained stable there existed differences in the permeability and permeability evolution trends between the shale samples the equilibrium permeability was basically negatively correlated with the clay content the toc content and thermal maturity of organic matter may affect the permeability the variations in clay mineral water absorption and organic inorganic pore connectivity during simultaneous methane and water vapor transport in shale could explain the differences in permeability evolution between the shale samples credit authorship contribution statement tingting liu methodology investigation validation data curation writing

2608,methane and water vapor transport in shale mud rocks is important in many resource and environmental issues e g effectively exploiting shale gas and clearly understanding water and methane global cycles to investigate methane and water vapor permeability in shale a new permeability determination method was proposed using a linearization approach based on previous studies the experimental samples are crushed carboniferous shale from the eastern qaidam basin in china simultaneous methane and water vapor transport experiments in shale were performed water vapor was derived through deionized water evaporation under different methane pressures the relative humidity dynamically changed during the experiment the methane and water vapor transport processes were observed and recorded and the methane and water vapor permeability in the shale matrix was calculated both the methane and water vapor permeabilities temporally varied and a critical abrupt point occurred in the decreasing process over time after the abrupt point the permeability rapidly decreased which was mainly due to capillary condensation plugging at high relative humidities pore throat closure could dramatically affect permeability the relationship between permeability and water saturation s w conformed to an exponential equation methane permeability was sensitive to water saturation variation at very low or high levels s w 20 or s w 50 respectively and relatively insensitive at a moderate water content water vapor permeability variation with water saturation was similar to that in methane but basically remained stable at a moderate water saturation 10 s w 50 at high water saturations water vapor permeability reduction was more sensitive than that in methane keywords methane and water vapor

dynamic methane adsorption experiments cui et al 2009 wang and yu 2019 zhao et al 2019 liu and yu 2022 studied the permeability during dynamic water vapor adsorption at helium pressure although the dynamic permeability variation at methane pressure is of more practical interest furthermore permeability models considering gas adsorption stress dependence non darcy flow and surface diffusion have been established song et al 2016 wang et al 2015 most of these permeability measurement methods are static techniques and research on permeability in the dynamic adsorption process of shale gas remains insufficient numerous studies have demonstrated that water can reduce the gas permeability in rocks chakraborty et al 2017 hun et al 2016 yang and yu 2020 the gas permeability in tight sandstones decreased by 3 orders of magnitude with increasing water content amann hildenbrand et al 2017 through methane permeability comparison between wet and dry shale it was found that the permeability decreased with increasing water saturation wang and yu 2020 in porous media water transport can occur in the liquid or gas phase depending on the transport mechanism chong et al 2018 kalra et al 2003 liquid water infiltration from fractures macropores into the matrix can be mainly attributed to capillarity engelder 2012 water vapor flow in shale nanopores mainly involves volume diffusion of the water vapor phase surface diffusion of the adsorbed phase and flow of capillary condensate choi et al 2001 sirghi 2012 to further study the effect of water on rocks sang et al 2020 and yang et al 2021 have estimated the permeability or diffusion coefficient using experimental data pertaining to dynamic water vapor adsorption the water vapor permeability in shale gradually decreased with water vapor adsorption and basically did not change when the experiment reached equilibrium liu and yu 2022 it should be noted that this experiment was performed under helium pressure water plays an important role in fluid transport yet the study of the fluid permeability in shale reservoirs is insufficiently comprehensive in particular there are few reports on the permeability during mixed gas adsorption experiments in this paper three shale samples from the qaidam basin were used to investigate permeability evolution of methane and water vapor when their mixture transported in shale a new method to calculate the permeability using dynamic methane and water vapor transport data was proposed pure methane transport experiments in dry shale were conducted prior to simultaneous methane and water vapor transport experiments in shale the water vapor and methane adsorption amount and permeability under different pressures were measured and calculated the temporal evolution of the methane and water vapor permeability was analyzed the similarities and differences between the methane and water vapor permeability changes during the experiments were compared a relation between the permeability and water saturation was established the effect of rock composition on permeability and adsorption was also examined 2 methodology 2 1 theory if gas transport in shale is dominated by gas seepage in pores a permeability calculation model considering gas adsorption can be established combined with the law of conservation of mass and darcy s law

chemistry iupac sing 1985 sangwichien et al 2002 the pore size distributions of mesopores and micropores were obtained via low pressure n2 adsorption experiments and low pressure co2 adsorption experiments respectively please refer to liu and yu 2022 for a detailed description of the microstructural characteristics of the samples the simultaneous methane and water vapor transport experiments in shale were performed using an isothermal adsorption device a schematic diagram of the experimental apparatus is shown in fig 4 water vapor was obtained through deionized water 6 ml evaporation the experimental temperature was set to 40 c with a relative error of 0 2 c during the simultaneous transport experiments methane was injected into the reference cell evacuated beforehand and stabilized

pressures 1 3 and 5 mpa were conducted involving each sample the overall procedure of the reference experiments was the same as that of the simultaneous transport experiments except that no sample was loaded pure methane transport experiments in dry shale were also performed in this study more experimental procedure details can be found in previous studies liu and yu 2022 ma and yu 2022 zhang and

be calculated based on the functional relationship between evaporation rate and relative humidity obtained via liquid water evaporation comparison experiments liu and yu 2022 zhang and yu 2022 according to the comparative experiment under methane pressure a scatter plot of the evaporation rate and relative humidity was obtained as shown in fig 5 in regard to this experiment it was difficult to fit the relationship with a single equation therefore the method of piecewise curve fitting was adopted pourkarimi et al 2011 gálvez and iglesias 2016 used a particle based heuristic method to determine the optimal values of the breakpoints and extreme values of their fitted curve and the curve fit was satisfactory in terms of self intersection aspects and sharp curvature changes in this paper 1stopt software multivariate nonlinear curve fitting software based on the levenberg marquardt and general global optimization algorithm nian et al 2018 was used to perform piecewise regression analysis of the relationship between the evaporation rate and relative humidity the evolution of the evaporation rate with relative humidity could be divided into two stages the segment points and fitted equations under each pressure are summarized in table 2 via the application of the equations in table 2 to the simultaneous transport experiments in shale the water evaporation amount could be obtained fig 6 shows the evaporation amount of water w e and the amount of free water vapor w f during the simultaneous transport experiments the amounts of methane and water vapor adsorbed were obtained based on the calculation method in section 2 2 the changes of methane and water vapor adsorption with time during the simultaneous transport experiments are shown in fig 7 a c methane reached adsorption equilibrium faster than did water vapor the higher the methane pressure was the higher the methane adsorption amount and the smaller the water vapor adsorption amount fig 7 d f show the evolution in methane adsorption over time during the pure methane transport experiments in dry shale after the simultaneous transport experiments the samples were immediately taken out and weighed the equilibrium adsorption amount of water vapor can be calculated by using the mass of the samples before and after the experiment fig 8 shows the water vapor equilibrium adsorption amount obtained with the calculation and gravimetric methods the difference between the two methods remains within 5 it is feasible to use the method presented in section 2 2 2 to calculate the water vapor adsorption amount table 3 lists the experimental time and equilibrium adsorption amount as shown in fig 9 during the pure methane transport experiments in dry shale s1 and s3 exhibited the highest and lowest methane equilibrium adsorption amount respectively and the methane adsorption amount increased with increasing pressure the methane adsorption amount at each pressure was significantly smaller than that of water vapor in the simultaneous transport experiments as shown in fig 10 the water vapor equilibrium adsorption amount was 4 4 27 6 times that of methane the water vapor adsorption amounts of the three samples indicated the order of s1 s2 s3 according to figs 9 and 10 a the pure methane adsorption amount during the dry shale experiments was greater than that during the simultaneous methane and water vapor transport experiments 3 2 permeability and its temporal evolution the simultaneous methane and water vapor transport experiments and pure methane transport experiments were performed involving all three crushed shale samples at 1 3 and 5 mpa and the gas permeability was calculated using the experimental data methane and water vapor permeability values were calculated with the method described in section 2 1 a prerequisite for applying this method is that the gas density pressure change is considerably small cui et al 2009 considered a pressure change less than 10 sufficiently small wang and yu 2019 calculated the methane permeability during the last 1 h of the experimental equilibrium stage without providing a specific pressure variation range in this study the methane t 100 s and water vapor t 10 s permeability was calculated at a gas density change less than 0 02 fig 2 obviously the method in this paper is able to calculate the permeability for almost the entire adsorption process which is the advantage of this method compared with previous studies fig 11 a c show the variation in methane permeability over time during the pure methane transport experiments in dry shale the permeability decreased with methane adsorption and stabilized as the adsorption process approached equilibrium the change in methane permeability over time during the simultaneous transport experiments is shown in fig 11 d f the methane permeability gradually decreased and stabilized at the end of the experiment experimental and computational results generally indicated that the methane permeability decreased with increasing pressure fig 11 g i show the temporal water vapor permeability variation during the simultaneous transport experiments the water vapor permeability first decreased slowly then decreased rapidly over time and finally stabilized the variation in water vapor under each methane pressure revealed no obvious regularity table 4 provides the gas permeability at experimental equilibrium during the pure methane transport experiments in dry shale and the simultaneous methane and water vapor transport experiments during the pure methane transport experiments the equilibrium permeability ranged from 1 1332 10 21 to 7 1969 10 21 m2 during the simultaneous transport experiments the equilibrium methane permeability ranged from 4 315 10 24 26 3082 10 23 m2 and the equilibrium water vapor permeability ranged from 9 335 10 25 5 5711 10 24 m2 the temporal evolution of the methane and water vapor permeability during the experiments was analyzed based on the permeability calculation results fig 11 we selected data points best reflecting the permeability temporal evolution and connected them with smooth curves fig 12 shows the temporal evolution of the permeability fig 12 a c show that the methane permeability during the pure methane transport experiments in dry shale first rapidly decreased over time and then tended to stabilize as shown in fig 13 pure methane was rapidly adsorbed in the shale pores and adsorption equilibrium was reached from 100 to 1000 s the permeability rapidly decreased with increasing methane adsorption and stabilized at methane adsorption equilibrium during the pure methane transport experiments in dry shale methane adsorption was the main reason for the permeability decrease if the experimental fluid becomes adsorbed in the experimental sample permeability determination must consider the adsorption effect cui et al 2009 mahmoud et al 2019 studied the adsorption effect on the permeability measured via pulse attenuation using carbonate cores the predicted permeability results based on the freundlich correction model were overestimated by 35 without considering adsorption there are differences between various computational models and relative calculation errors can occur compared to helium and nitrogen shale permeability measurement with methane could provide a better understanding of the actual gas transport mechanism in shale cao et al 2016 proposed a shale permeability measurement method considering adsorption and through experiments and calculations they determined that if gas adsorption were not considered the permeability in pure shale could be underestimated by up to 97 the gas adsorption effect in shale on permeability measurement cannot be neglected fig 12 d f show the change in methane permeability over time during the simultaneous transport experiments in shale during the experiments the methane permeability exhibited a decreasing trend with different decrease rates as shown in fig 14 during the simultaneous transport experiments the methane permeability varied continuously over time during the first 5 min approximately of the experiments the methane permeability decreased rapidly the main reason for the permeability reduction at this time was the adsorption of methane and water vapor the adsorbed molecules reduced the pore channels for gas transport and the permeability significantly decreased moreover water vapor could hinder the transport of methane molecules rani et al 2018 comparing fig 12 a c and d f it could be found that the methane permeability during the simultaneous transport experiments was lower than that during the pure methane transport experiments the decrease rate of the methane permeability declined as the methane adsorption process increasingly approached equilibrium the decrease in methane permeability was mainly due to water vapor adsorption with increasing experimental progress the relative humidity continuously increased water vapor experienced capillary condensation in the shale pores progressive thickening of the water film resulted in nanopore channel blocking li et al 2016 as marked by the red dashed lines and arrows in fig 14 the blocked pore channels led to a rapid permeability drop at the end of the experiments both methane and water vapor reached a dynamic equilibrium between adsorption and desorption and the simultaneous methane and water vapor transport process tended to remain stable this equilibrium permeability could characterize the shale gas permeability at the corresponding water content the temporal evolution of the water vapor permeability is shown in fig 12 g i to analyze the water vapor permeability reduction the water vapor permeability and methane and water vapor adsorption versus time are plotted in fig 15 at the early stage of the experiments methane and water vapor quickly entered the shale nanopore channels and adsorption occurred the pore channels were reduced and the permeability decreased fig 15 shows that the methane adsorption amount at the early stage of the experiments was greater than that of water vapor therefore methane adsorption at this stage more notably impacted the water vapor permeability the water vapor permeability slightly changed from approximately 100 s to 10000 s according to lee and hwang 1986 when the relative humidity is lower than 0 8 the permeability of samples without adsorption increases with increasing relative humidity under low relative pressures the bulk flow of water vapor and surface flow of the adsorbed phase dominate the initial flow pattern sang et al 2020 water vapor adsorption in shale cannot be neglected which reduces the permeability the combination of these reasons led to a slight decrease in the water vapor permeability during this period under high relative pressures the water vapor permeability sharply decreased over time the red dotted line in fig 15 marks the critical point at which the water vapor permeability began to sharply decline previous studies have determined that permeability reduction at high relative humidities can be attributed to a shift in the flow pattern from domination by capillary forces to domination by the total gas pressure gradient jaguste and bhatia 1995 lee and hwang 1986 rhim and hwang 1975 this occurs because capillary saturation ensues in the shale pore channels the appearance of capillary condensate could lead to blockage of narrow pores ghanizadeh et al 2014a ghanizadeh et al 2014b yoshimoto et al 2017 contributing to a rapid decrease in permeability at the later stage of the experiments the adsorption process reached equilibrium the relative humidity remained basically unchanged and the water vapor permeability tended to remain stable 3 3 comparison of the water vapor and methane permeability fig 12 d i show that there occurred significant differences in the temporal evolution of the methane and water vapor permeability according to figs 14 and 15 comparative analysis of the time dependent processes of the methane and water vapor permeability was conducted early in the experiments the reduction in the water vapor permeability was not as large as that in the methane permeability the methane permeability rapidly decreased during the first 5 min of the experiments while the water vapor permeability rapidly decreased during the first 100 s the water vapor permeability reduction was less than that in methane the adsorbed methane molecules increasingly occupied the pore space the loss of methane permeability was therefore severe both the total and amounts of free water vapor entering the shale pores increased because water vapor originated from the continuous evaporation of liquid water an increase in relative humidity could promote water vapor seepage but the hindering effect of adsorption was highly obvious therefore the water vapor permeability continuously decreased and the rate of decrease was lower than that of methane after 5 min the reduction in methane permeability decelerated while the change in the water vapor permeability was not obvious from 100 s the methane permeability continued to decrease due to the increase in water saturation the promoting effect of relative humidity enhancement on the water vapor permeability was counteracted by the hindering effect of adsorption on the permeability and the change in the water vapor permeability was small after pore plugging approximately 10000 s both the methane and water vapor permeabilities rapidly decreased the water vapor permeability decreased more significantly the occurrence of capillary condensation exerted a great influence on the water vapor permeability when the experimental equilibrium was reached both the methane and water vapor permeabilities tended to stabilize fig 12 d f show that the methane permeability evolution indicated that the methane permeability is negatively related to the pressure either during the experiments or at equilibrium table 4 demonstrates that the water vapor permeability was lower than the methane permeability at experimental equilibrium the shale permeability may vary with the permeate fluid according to previous studies the decreasing order of permeability is he n2 ch4 co2 adeboye and bustin 2013 han et al 2010 pan et al 2010 the wettability of rock to the permeating fluid gas adsorption and slip flow effect contribute to permeability variation busch and gensterblum 2011 han et al 2010 pan and connell 2012 pini et al 2009 there existed no obvious law in the change in water vapor permeability under the various pressures during the experiments at adsorption equilibrium the water vapor permeability decreased with increasing pressure 3 4 relationship between the permeability and water saturation the water saturation of the shale samples could be calculated according to the test results of the pore size distribution and those of the water vapor adsorption amount it should be noted that the water saturation obtained in this paper is the dynamic water saturation of the shale samples during the experiments rather than the equilibrium water saturation at the corresponding relative humidity figs 16 and 17 show the relationship of the methane permeability and the water vapor permeability to water saturation respectively there existed a negative correlation between the permeability and water saturation and the relationship between these two quantities conformed to the following exponential equation 32 k a 1 e s w t 1 a 2 e s w t 2 b or 33 k a 1 e s w t 1 a 2 e s w t 2 a 3 e s w t 3 b where s w is the water saturation and a 1 a 2 a 3 t 1 t 2 t 3 and b are fitting parameters tables 5 and 6 list the fitted equations and correlation coefficients respectively between the methane and water vapor permeability and water saturation fig 16 shows that the methane permeability decreased with increasing shale water saturation a low water saturation corresponds to the initial phase of the experiment at the initial stage methane adsorption rapidly increased fig 14 and the methane permeability was greatly affected by methane adsorption when the water saturation varied between 20 and 50 or 60 the methane permeability slowly decreased with increasing water saturation when the water saturation was higher than 50 or 60 the methane permeability significantly decreased with the water saturation wang and yu 2020 obtained similar conclusions they conducted methane adsorption experiments using dry shale and shale with different water contents and calculated the permeability at experimental equilibrium they obtained that the methane permeability decreased with the water content fig 17 shows that the water vapor permeability decreased with increasing water saturation and the decrease rate of the permeability differed among the various water saturations choosing sample s1 at 1 mpa as an example when the water saturation was lower than 8 the water vapor permeability rapidly decreased with increasing water saturation when the water saturation varied between 8 and 68 the water vapor permeability slowly decreased or even did not change with the water saturation when the water saturation was higher than 68 the water vapor permeability rapidly decreased section 3 2 outlines the reasons for the above decrease in permeability liu and yu 2022 calculated the permeability during a water vapor adsorption experiment in shale under helium pressure and determined that the water vapor permeability and water saturation fit the exponential equation of k e a b s w c s w 2 where a b and c are fitting parameters the methane adsorption effect on the water vapor permeability cannot be ignored which leads to a highly obvious reduction in the water vapor permeability methane imposes a stronger inhibitory effect on liquid water evaporation than that of helium liu and yu 2022 ma and yu 2022 zhang and yu 2022 hence the water vapor adsorption rate under methane pressure is lower than that under helium pressure the distribution of the water saturation in shale differs between the two experimental processes and the exponential equations for the water vapor permeability and water saturation also vary comparing figs 16 and 17 it could be found that there occurred differences in the variation patterns of the methane and water vapor permeability with the water saturation when the water saturation varied between approximately 20 and 60 the reduction in the methane permeability with the water saturation was greater than that in the water vapor permeability the reduction in the methane permeability revealed a hysteresis phenomenon compared to that in the water vapor permeability the methane permeability evolution under the different pressures basically revealed that the higher the pressure was the smaller the permeability the water vapor permeability exhibited no obvious relationship with the total gas mixture pressure the water saturation corresponding to the sudden drop point of permeability decreased with increasing pressure this could be mainly attributed to the difference in relative humidity under each pressure verma and pruess 1988 proposed the following relationship between the porosity and permeability 34 k k 0 φ φ c φ 0 φ c n where k 0 and φ 0 are the initial permeability and porosity respectively φ c is the critical porosity where the permeability is reduced to zero and n is the exponent we adopted the first permeability value calculated in the experiment as the initial permeability the critical porosity could not be obtained in this study however the value of φ φ c could be calculated according to the water saturation fig 18 a shows the permeability reduction under the three models proposed by verma and pruess 1988 the cubic model refers to the model in which all flow channels are straight flat and equal in diameter all channels in the series model are planar and identical verma and pruess 1988 fig 18 b and c show the methane and water vapor permeability versus porosity in this study respectively comparing fig 18 b and c to fig 18 a it could be observed that the relationship between the permeability and porosity in this study conformed to the series model and it could be expected that φ c is less than 0 8 fig 18 shows that the bound porosity highly significantly affects permeability reduction pore throat closure could cause dramatic permeability changes 3 5 effect of the rock composition on the permeability the correlations between methane and water vapor adsorption and shale physico chemical characteristics were analyzed among the three shale samples s1 exhibited the largest adsorption amount and s3 attained the smallest table 3 clay minerals and quartz were the main mineral components of the three shale samples liu and yu 2022 fig 19 a c show that both the methane and water vapor adsorption amounts achieved a suitable positive correlation with the clay mineral content clay minerals contain a high internal specific surface area which can provide a large adsorption space for gases sang et al 2018 clay minerals especially illite and montmorillonite are strongly hydrophilic so shale with a relatively high clay mineral content can achieve higher water vapor adsorption yang et al 2016 yang and yu 2020 there existed a negative correlation between the quartz content and gas adsorption amount but the correlation was poor as shown in fig 19 d f the methane and water vapor adsorption amounts were positively correlated with the toc content fig 19 g i wu and yu 2020 experimentally determined that the water condensation amount increased with increasing toc content organics are generally hydrophobic but organic minerals provide more nanopores chen and xiao 2014 morishige et al 2014 offering more space for methane and water vapor to adsorb a permeability comparison between the samples was conducted based on the methane and water vapor permeability at experimental equilibrium during the pure methane transport experiments the s3 sample exhibited the highest methane permeability followed by the s2 and s1 samples table 4 during the simultaneous methane and water vapor transport experiments the presence of water vapor complicated the gas transportation process and there occurred differences in the relationship between the permeability of each sample among the various pressures except for individual experiments the permeability was negatively correlated with the clay content as shown in fig 20 a c the higher the clay content was the more the pore volume occupied by gas adsorption and the lower the permeability fig 20 d f show that there existed a certain negative correlation between the permeability and toc content the fluid conductivity in organic rich shale matrices is governed by the transport properties of the inorganic and organic components ghanizadeh et al 2014a inorganic substrates typically contain large pores and irregularly shaped cracks whereas organic substrates kerogen are finely dispersed in inorganic matrices and can comprise micro and mesopore networks depending on the maturity of the organics and the type of kerogen bernard et al 2012a curtis et al 2012 based on experimental observations ghanizadeh et al 2014a found that the fluid transport characteristics of organic rich shale are significantly affected by the thermal maturity bernard et al 2012a and the existence and connectivity of micro and mesopores in organic molecules within particles bernard et al 2012a bernard et al 2012b the thermal maturity of the samples used in this study was relatively consistent table 1 and the correlation between the thermal maturity and permeability was not analyzed theoretically the presence of organic matter contributes to the pore space and the permeability should increase in regard to adsorbent fluids however this rule may no longer be satisfied fig 20 g i show that the methane permeability in dry shale was positively correlated with the mesopore volume percentage the correlation between the methane and water vapor permeability and the mesopore volume percentage worsened in partially saturated shale 4 conclusions a new method was proposed to investigate the permeability evolution of methane and water vapor while they simultaneously transported in shale simultaneous methane and water vapor transport experiments in shale and pure methane transport experiments in dry shale were conducted and the results were compared according to the experimental and calculation results several findings were drawn the permeability of the shale samples over time in this study ranged from 9 335 10 25 4 1502 10 16 m2 the permeability decreased over time in the seepage process due to gas adsorption during the pure methane transport experiments in dry shale the equilibrium methane permeability ranged from 1 1332 10 21 7 1969 10 21 m2 during the simultaneous transport experiments the equilibrium permeability values of methane and water vapor ranged from 4 315 10 24 26 3082 10 23 m2 and 9 335 10 25 5 5711 10 24 m2 respectively during the pure methane experiments the methane permeability decreased over time and gradually stabilized as the methane adsorption process approached equilibrium the influence of methane adsorption in shale on permeability measurement cannot be neglected during the simultaneous transport experiments the reduction in the methane and water vapor permeability generally first rapidly increased then slowly rose and then suddenly accelerated at the early stage of the experiments the water vapor permeability reduction was smaller than that in methane especially between 100 and 10000 s the water vapor permeability basically remained unchanged a sudden reduction in both the methane and water vapor permeability occurred at approximately 10000 s the reduction in the methane permeability lagged behind that in the water vapor permeability and the decrease rate and value of the water vapor permeability were higher than those of the methane permeability the sudden drop in permeability was due to capillary plugging the methane and water vapor permeability reduction with the water saturation satisfied the exponential equation of k a 1 e s w t 1 a 2 e s w t 2 a 3 e s w t 3 b where a 1 a 2 a 3 t 1 t 2 t 3 and b are fitting parameters when the water saturation varied between 20 and 50 or 60 the decrease rate of the methane permeability decelerated with increasing water saturation the methane permeability rapidly decreased when the water saturation was higher than 50 or 60 the variation in the water vapor permeability with the water saturation differed from that in the methane permeability at a moderate water saturation the water vapor permeability essentially remained stable there existed differences in the permeability and permeability evolution trends between the shale samples the equilibrium permeability was basically negatively correlated with the clay content the toc content and thermal maturity of organic matter may affect the permeability the variations in clay mineral water absorption and organic inorganic pore connectivity during simultaneous methane and water vapor transport in shale could explain the differences in permeability evolution between the shale samples credit authorship contribution statement tingting liu methodology investigation validation data curation writing

2609,water level variation of explorational boreholes in mining sites is one of the most direct representations of water inrush risk despite recent efforts on mine water inrush accident prediction based on various types of observation data including water level of boreholes using a wide range of machine learning models the accuracy and timeliness of the prediction for major accidents are still unsatisfactory in this study a novel prediction method based on the analysis of water level variation anomalies in borehole groups is proposed using the coupled model of long short time memory lstm and isolation forest iforest multi variate lstm algorithm is firstly used to model the correlated time sequence water level data in the borehole group followed by the full extraction of the data variation feature based on the combination of variables including the prediction error being used as inputs of the iforest algorithm as a result anomalous variations of the data are detected as possible precursors of water inrush accident finally a set of water inrush risk level grading rule is established based on the number of simultaneous anomalous data instances being detected within a borehole group the results obtained for the water inrush accident in xingdong coal mine demonstrate extraordinary timeliness and high accuracy as high water inrush risk warning is issued for more than 2 days earlier than the time of actual sighting of the accident with very few false alarms being caused throughout the period of the testing dataset this study provides an innovative solution to the low prediction accuracy and slow responding speed during major water inrush accidents of existing methods the major parameters of the proposed coupled model of lstm iforest can also be easily calibrated based on traditional empirical methods for the best performance allowing the method to be widely applied in various mining conditions keywords water inrush borehole group long short time memory isolation forest anomaly detection risk evaluation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction and background water inrush accident is a major risk to mining safety over the world especially in coal producing countries such as china united states india and australia chen et al 2015 dash et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 despite stringent safety regulations such disasters still have caused heavy loss of lives and properties over the years bringemeier 2012 owing to effects such as precipitation permeability of aquiclude and human transformation of geological structures the occurrence of water inrush accidents during mining is random and uncertain li et al 2017 mokhov 2007 which causes the prediction of such mining accidents to be challenging despite various novel geophysical methods having been proposed over the years to analyze the hydrogeological properties of water bearing structures for the prediction xu et al 2022 yang 2014 drilling exploration remains one of the most direct and reliable ways of dynamically obtaining water inrush risk information by easily accessed data such as water level gao 2019 li 2018 zhao 2021 however the long term variation of water level data of borehole groups in mines has not been systematically studied thus far over the years extensive efforts have been made through the analysis of various types of observed data to predict mining accidents traditional methods based on static data analysis and threshold setting du et al 2017 guan 2012 qiu et al 2017 such as the water inrush coefficient and the vulnerable index method cao et al 2022 li et al 2022 wu et al 2011 are frequently used as the majority of them are reliable in specific conditions but highly dependent on empirical knowledge and is less suitable for dynamic water inrush prediction in changing mining environments li et al 2017 the methods based on regression and statistical analysis are also extensively applied in data analysis for mining such as the rainfall runoff model luo et al 2022 pca model li et al 2020 probability index qiu et al 2017 and discriminant analysis bi et al 2021 zhang et al 2013 these methods can also produce reliable prediction results but usually have strict limitations on the input data in recent years the adoption of machine learning models to predict mining accidents have surged a variety of novel prediction methods have been proposed correspondingly some frequently used methods are the autoregressive integrated moving average arima yang et al 2021 holt winters exponential smoothing hwes linghu et al 2020 support vector machine cao and zhao 2011 mahmoodzadeh et al 2022b and extreme gradient boosting mahmoodzadeh et al 2022d the trend and seasonal variation features of the predicted data can be well extracted by these methods nevertheless most of them are also only suitable for specific mining conditions and have high limitations on the input data lately prediction efforts using methods based on deep learning such as convolution neural network model and recursive neural network rnn model yu 2021 have been extensively attempted deep learning models have the advantage of being adaptive and accurate since they are data driven on the other hand they often require large amounts of data as inputs and hardware with high computational capability for training before the data prediction besides the interpretability and stability of the machine learning models can be lower than other methods at times ma et al 2022a ma et al 2022b ma et al 2022c although various techniques such as multi source data fusion bi et al 2022 li et al 2021 model combination gao wang 2012 residual correction zhu 2021 and parameter optimization qiao 2011 mahmoodzadeh et al 2022a mahmoodzadeh et al 2022c wang et al 2022 have been used to optimize the performance and improve the accuracy of various prediction models few of the methods effectiveness are tested on datasets in cases of actual water inrush disasters the dramatic decrease of accuracies and response speeds of many of the algorithms used in case of large data variations in disastrous scenarios have not been adequately addressed in this study the coupled model of lstm iforest is innovatively used to analyze the water level time sequence data as a special type of recursive neural network lstm and its variants are proven to be ones of the most effective models to extract complex time sequence data s variation features over long periods meyal et al 2020 kratzert et al 2018 nevertheless its prediction accuracy also decreases remarkably preceding and during the accident the major novelties to overcome such issues in this study are highlighted as follows a the variation of the prediction error by lstm is analyzed to detect unexpected anomalous disturbance on the water levels of boreholes rather than merely attempting to reduce the prediction error b the potential combination of input variables including the prediction error of lstm are compared for the best performance of the iforest model for anomaly detection since iforest is a frequently used machine learning model for its accuracy and efficiency for the anomaly detection in high dimensional data with small ratio of anomalous instances of substantial value difference to the normal ones c the water inrush risk is evaluated according to the outcome of the anomaly detection in real time as low medium high and extra high levels according to which early warnings of potential accident are issued d the major parameters of the models used can be easily calibrated using traditional empirical methods increasing the robustness of the method for its adoption in various mining conditions in summary this proposed method is expected to issue early warnings of water inrush accidents with very few false alarms under various mining conditions 2 data modeling 2 1 lstm lstm has been proven as an effective method of modeling large amounts of complex time series data with multiple variates over a long period additionally lstm has already been applied to various forms of data prediction in the field of mining safety over the world mostly for methane gas outbreaks and seismic activities kurach pawlowski 2016 pawlowski et al 2015 shu et al 2022 zhang et al 2019 with only a few water hazard related study cases recently zeng et al 2021 dong et al 2019 qiao et al 2020 xing 2021 similar applications have also been reported in other fields such as earthquake forecasting yan et al 2021 lstm is a special form of recursive neural network with a forget gate added to the cell unit to avoid long term dependency the cell structure of the lstm contains a forget gate ft input gate it output gate ot and memory cell gers et al 2000 as shown in fig 1 the forget gate decides the amount of information that is passed to the current state ct from the last time step ct 1 when the current input is x t according to the following formula 1 f t σ w f h t 1 x t b f in which f t is the function value of the forget gate at time t w f and b f is the weight and offset of the forget gate function h t 1 is the hidden state at time t 1 σ is the sigmoid activation function the input gate controls the input of the latest information according to the following formulae 2 i t σ w i h t 1 x t b i in which i t is the function value of the input gate at time t w i and b i is the weight and offset of the input gate function 3 c t tan h w c h t 1 x t b c in which c t is the function value of the current cell state at time t w c and b c is the weight and offset of the current state function tanh is the tanh activation function the updated memory cell state is 4 c t f t c t 1 i t c t the formula of the output gate is 5 o t σ w o h t 1 x t b o where o t is the function value of the output gate at time t w o and b o is the weight and offset of the current state function the hidden state at time t can be obtained using the following formula 6 h t o t tan h c t a single layer lstm model can be constructed using the cell structure in fig 1 connected by cell state and hidden state in series the prediction outcome of this model on sample data containing the water inrush quantities in a coal mine is shown in fig 2 in which the model is adequately trained and its parameters and structures are properly adjusted the water levels and water inrush quantities were used as the inputs to the model to predict future water inrush quantities as shown in fig 2 the prediction is accurate in general since under normal conditions the fluctuation of the water inrush quantity is consistently between 7 and 8 5 and there is no substantial increase or decrease throughout the time of observation however the prediction curve always lags behind the actual curve as if it was the actual curve being shifted to the right along the time axis this is a typical prediction phenomenon of lstm and many other neural networks and regression models consequently this reduces the referencing significance of the predicted value for forecasting water inrush accidents 2 2 isolation forest iforest iforest is an effective and efficient unsupervised machine learning algorithm for modeling high dimensional data containing large numbers of instances chen wu 2019 therefore this algorithm can be used to construct the anomaly detection feature in this study iforest uses a binary tree structure called itree to search for isolated instances liu 2018 additionally h x is the path length for the root node to traverse the itree up to the outside nodes and c n is the average value of h x for a specific n value to normalize h x the anomaly score s x n is defined as follows liu et al 2008 7 s x n 2 e h x c n 8 c n 2 h n 1 2 n 1 n 2 1 n 2 0 o t h e r s where h i is the harmonic number to be estimated by ln i 0 5772156649 euler s constant and e h x is the average of h x from a collection of isolation trees when e h x c n s 0 5 when e h x 0 s 1 when e h x n 1 s 0 if s 1 x is anomalous in contrast if s 0 x can be regarded as a normal instance if all s 0 5 the entire sample can be regarded as having no anomalies using the adequately trained iforest model with its parameters properly adjusted to detect anomalies in the same sample data as shown in fig 2 the outcomes are as shown in fig 3 the result is reasonable since no water inrush accident had occurred during the observing period 3 proposed method the proposed method follows the process shown in fig 4 firstly all borehole data is pre processed to handle erroneous and missing values as well as being resampled by suitable sampling period then data are analyzed for correlation on which basis correlated data from corresponding boreholes are grouped and partitioned as training and validation set for prediction and anomaly detection models the lstm and iforest model are then trained as iforest model take the prediction error of lstm as part of its input variates followed by anomaly detection outcome s validation using empirical knowledge on the training set the parameter of iforest can be repetitively adjusted till the outcome is adequately validated finally the properly trained and validated lstm and iforest model are used on the testing dataset to obtain abnormal detection result in order to issue early warnings prior to the water inrush accident 3 1 studied area and dataset in march 2018 a coal seam floor ordovician limestone water inrush accident occurred in the xingdong coal mine in hanxing mining area the coal field is located in the baiquan spring field of the hangxing hydrogeological unit in the middle of the eastern foot of taihang mountains fig 5 a its area is 3843 km2 and the exposed area of cambrian and ordovician limestone is 645 km2 the water inflow layer is the ordovician limestone aquifer below the coal seam floor the aquifer has great thickness of more than 500 m fig 5 b fig 6 with strong water yield and rich dynamic and static reserves the water head exceeds the coal seam floor by about 1000 m a unique working condition of coal seam mining with water pressure is formed with the pressure on the coal seam floor exceeding 10 mpa after the coal seam is mined and forming a cavity in the goaf the goaf formed till march 3 has the dimension of width of 165 m mining length of 155 m mining thickness of 4 m the ordovician limestone water driven by high water pressure often breaks through the floor aquicludes causing water inrush accidents this case of water inrush at the 2228 working face of xingdong mine is a typical representation fig 5 b the water inrush is roughly divided into three stages the first stage is from march 3 to 13 which lasts for 9 days the water yield increases rapidly from 60 m3 h to 2649 m3 h in the same period the water level of w2 borehole also experienced two precipitous drops for the first time it dropped from 32 9 m on march 3 to 3 4 m on march 6 the second time from 2 5 m on the 11th to 45 5 m on the 13th the second stage is from march 13 to april 15 which lasts for 31 days the water yield decreases rapidly from the peak to about 1750 m3 h and steadily decreases to about 1600 m3 h the third stage is the grouting treatment stage after three months of comprehensive implementation of the regional grouting treatment in the floor area the water inrush was effectively controlled and the mining project was gradually restored this study focuses mostly on the process of water inrush from march 1 to 5 in the first stage in this study the water level data from 2015 02 01 to 2018 04 25 of the w2 w4 w1 w5 w9 and d11 in the borehole group near the location of the accident shown in fig 5 b are chosen for analysis using the dataset provided by this particular case have several advantages for the proposed method to be fully studied firstly it provides a water level dataset of approximately 336 000 instances of each borehole being monitored continuously in over three years observation time before the accident with few discontinuations or missing values secondly all of the data have varied substantially during a certain period of heavy precipitation rather than being stable throughout the observation time thirdly the dataset contains data in the period when a major water inrush accident actually took place allowing the effectiveness of the proposed method to be proven the first two advantages are beneficial for the machine learning models to be fully trained and to be able to adapt to the amplitude of variation when the accident takes place 3 2 data pre processing fig 7 shows the pre processed data in which missing values were filled using linear interpolation as shown in fig 7 most of the boreholes have a similar trend of variations during the time of observation fig 8 shows the seasonal and residual components obtained by decomposing the w2 data using the additive model lazzeri 2020 to analyze its variation trend the sum of the trend seasonal and residual curve is the original curve of w2 on observing the water level data no obvious seasonality is found and the trend is obvious for instance from july to december 2016 the water level increased substantially owing to the large amounts of precipitation that year although this section of data does not have good typicality it is included in the dataset to fully train the prediction and anomaly detection model to adapt to the amplitude of variation this can intuitively improve the performance of the model in case of events of small probability such as water inrush accidents from the beginning of 2017 till before the water inrush accident on 208 03 03 the water level data does not show a variable trend however random fluctuations are observed at times the residual component does not vary greatly until just before the accident is sighted thereby indicating the randomness of water level variations under anomalous disturbance during the accident the sampling period of the original data is 1 h the water level variation with time is considered to be minor under normal conditions in the mine and therefore the sample period is decreased to 5 min using forward filling for vacant values such that the timeliness of the prediction can be improved although linear interpolation can be used the filling method is used for better differentiation of data which is proven to be beneficial for prediction and anomaly detection in this study furthermore the data of w9 is missing over a large period these missing values are linearly interpolated since linear interpolation is relatively stable and efficient in comparison to other techniques in this case according to the time at which the water inrush accident occurs fig 7 the w2 data is partitioned into training validation and testing sets with starting times of 2015 02 01 00 00 00 2017 11 01 00 00 00 and 2018 02 01 00 00 00 respectively the ending time of the testing set is set to 2018 04 07 23 00 00 to avoid interference owing to grouting and other countermeasures after the accident the data from the rest of the boreholes are similarly partitioned 3 3 correlation analysis correlation analysis is conducted on all borehole data using the spearman correlation coefficient after removing a few apparent recording errors related to the discontinuities in the dataset the spearman correlation coefficient determines whether a correlation exists between two variables by synchronism examination this adaptive method can identify the linear correlation between two variables and monotonic non linear correlation with no normal distribution requirement for the analyzed data zhang et al 2018 the spearman correlation coefficient can be calculated as follows duan song 2016 9 r s ρ rg x i r g y i c o v r g x i r g y i σ rg x i σ rg y i where cov rgxi rgyi is the covariance of the rank variables and σ rg x i and σ rg y i are the standard deviations of the rank variables the heatmap of the spearman correlation coefficients of the borehole data is shown in fig 9 the closer the spearman coefficient is to 1 the higher the positive monotonic correlation is between two variables duan song 2016 fig 9 shows that the w2 w4 w1 w5 and d11 data have positive and monotonic correlations with each other however the w9 data is not highly correlated to others this can be validated since all the boreholes correspond to the same aquifer except for w9 since multicollinearity of the input variables of a prediction model can be detrimental the frequently used variance inflation factor vif method in feature engineering is applied to select the appropriate features and reduce redundancy for prediction abood salman 2021 as an indicator of multicollinearity tamura et al 2019 the vif of each borehole data is calculated as follows 10 vif i 1 1 r i 2 where r i 2 is the coefficient of determination of the ith variable the vif variables in the range of 10 225 are often considered to be of moderate collinearity whereas those less than 10 and above 225 are considered to be of low and high collinearity respectively chatterjee et al 2012 as shown in table 1 for all other borehole data w9 is of low collinearity hence w9 is eliminated from the analysis meanwhile multiple variables with high multicollinearity are present therefore only one variable with the lowest vif is reserved along with the variable to be predicted to be the input of the corresponding prediction model that is w2 with w4 w4 with w2 w1 with w2 and w5 with w4 in which the formers are the variables to be predicted 3 4 data prediction using the above data combinations the water levels in w2 w4 w1 and w5 are predicted by applying their partitioned dataset to the multivariate lstm model considering the dynamically renewed demand while deploying a gated recurrent unit which is an efficient variant of lstm can also be used lazzeri 2020 however only lstm is used as the prediction results of both models in this study have been proven by experimentations to be almost identical additionally the stack of multiple layers of the lstm models is not used in this study owing to its limited effect on improving prediction accuracies and a dramatic increase in the training time to train the lstm using the training set the mean absolute error mae is applied as the loss function mae is used in this study to evaluate the model rather than rmse or r2 since the absolute error ae of each instance in the dataset is subsequently studied as a time sequence to be detected for anomalies due to its ability to represent prediction error in the most direct linear and robust fashion and the evaluation criteria of the prediction model should be used accordingly for consistency as the mean value of aes of the instances moreover mae is less sensitive than the others to the large errors of few of the predicted instances which is preferable to subsequent anomaly detection analysis the definitions of mae and ae are as follows 11 ae y i y i 12 mae 1 n i 1 n y i y i 100 where y i is the predicted value of the ith instance y i is the actual observed value of the ith instance and n is the number of instances in the sample data the accuracy is calculated as the ratio of the number of accurate instances to the number of all instances in the testing set on predicting the water level on the testing set of each borehole data the predicted instances with aes less than 0 2 m are considered to be accurate exclusively considering the dramatic change in the water level of w2 during the disaster an ae of 1 m is considered to be accurate for w2 the model uses adam as the optimizer through experimentation the increase in the number of the cell units of the model i e the number of time steps for a specific prediction to above 10 is found to have an insignificant effect on improving the prediction accuracy and a major effect on increasing the training time therefore 12 cell units of the models are used to predict the value at the next time step i e the value after the next 5 min interval using the values from the last 1 h to obtain relatively good results over a short training time the model is trained for 50 epochs with an early stop condition of 20 instances of non improvement of the loss function on the validation set the implementations were performed using python 3 7 0 in the windows system on an intel core i5 9600 k cpu 3 70 ghz with 32 gb of ram in addition the gpu of nvidia geforce gtx 1660ti is used to accelerate computations the loss functions of the training and validation sets of w2 by epoch are shown in fig 10 the training loss appeared to be adequately converged after 50 epochs of training the corresponding differentials of the first order corresponding to each combination of input variables are additionally tested on the model and minor improvements are achieved in the outcome the complexity of the lstm model is o 4 n n m 1 where n is the size of the hidden states and m is the dimension of the input the parameter uncertainty of lstm is mainly caused by its number of cell units t which decides the structure and n of the model and the performance with various t values are compared in fig 11 as fig 11 shows the variation of the maes and accuracies is rather stable and no obvious variation trend is presented whereas the models with multi variate generally outperform those with single variate the standard rnn gru and lstm are compared in terms of prediction accuracy mean absolute error mae and computation time in table 2 as table 2 presents the lstm and gru model outperform the rnn in terms of average mae accuracy and computation time for 50 runs of training on w2 dataset the performance between lstm and gru are similar while all models have similar stability in terms of standard deviations of mae and accuracy the input variables of multi and single variate are compared for their prediction outputs in table 3 as table 3 presents the lstm model with w2 and w4 as input variables outperforms the model with single w2 input in terms of average mae and accuracy for 50 runs of training on w2 dataset meanwhile they have similar stability in terms of standard deviations of mae and accuracy use the above multi variate lstm model to conduct predictions with w2 and w4 dataset in various length of periods before the accident as inputs the comparison results is shown in table 4 as table 4 presents the performance of the lstm model improves substantially with the increase of the sample size of the datasets in terms of average mae and accuracy for 50 runs of training on w2 dataset the stability of the model also increases as standard deviations of mae decreases substantially the prediction outcomes of each borehole using the proposed lstm model are shown in fig 12 as shown in fig 12 the accuracy of w2 and w1 decreases substantially during the water inrush accident all the ae curves contain certain spikes and level shifts immediately preceding and during the accident except in the case of w5 in comparison to the absolute variation rate curve the ae curves are more sensitive to the anomalies in the water level variations especially for w2 the ae curve shows dramatic variations in spikes and level shifts during the generation and occurrence of the disaster a sample of the w2 prediction data during the accident is shown in table 5 table 5 shows that the water level dropped considerably during the early generation and development of the accident with all of the predicted values being greater than the actual value some of the predicted value is even greater than the actual value from the past hour which is far behind the actual variation moreover the ae increased sharply to over 2 m on 2018 03 03 at 18 55 00 therefore forecasting major water inrush accidents by merely using water level data predictions is unrealistic and the anomaly detection model should be jointly used based on the prediction results to issue early warnings of accidents 3 5 anomaly detection based on the prediction results anomaly detection is conducted using the ae absolute variation rate δ y 1 i and absolute variation rate δ y 2 i of the water level of the correlated borehole used as the input to the prediction model to fully extract the features of the ae with respect to time the first order differential of the ae δ a e is included as one of the input variables in the anomaly detection model the corresponding expressions are as follows 13 δ a e i ae i ae i 1 14 δ y i y i y i 1 where y i and y i 1 are the actual values and ae i and ae i 1 are the absolute prediction errors of the ith and i 1 th instances to prevent the water level from negatively affecting the anomaly detection the actual value of water level data is not included as an input variable the potential combination of input variables is presented in table 6 the input variables of the combinations in table 6 are compared for their performances on w2 training set in terms of the receiver operating characteristic roc curve and the area under the curve auc which are commonly used evaluation criteria of anomaly detection models as in the fig 13 the traditional threshold setting method on the water level variation is also adopted in this evaluation of the iforest model and its calibration since the water level data after july 2016 is of less typicality the threshold is set as 0 3 times the largest absolute variation rate of w2 from february 2015 to february 2016 instances with water level variation rate larger than such threshold can be regard as anomalous according to such criteria the values of true positive false positive true negative and false negative of the detection result of iforest are obtained for each run by adjusting the contamination rate cr of iforest which is the ratio of the number of instances of the highest anomaly scores to the total number of instances in the training set from 0 5 to 2 and running the model for 50 times each to obtain sets of average false positive rate fpr and the corresponding average true positive rate tpr values the roc curve and the auc corresponding to each input combinations table 6 is obtained it can be seen from fig 13 that the combination of ae δy1 and δae group 1 as the inputs of the iforest obtained the highest auc the combination of ae and δy1 obtain the second best roc curve with slightly less auc as fig 13 shows to further analyze the sensitivity the model performance for these two sets of input variables are evaluated with statistical data in table 7 the cr values are both set as 1 as shown in table 7 the stability difference between the models with these two sets of input variables in terms of standard deviation of the tpr fpr accuracy precision and miss rate are negligible whereas the inclusion of δae as one of the input variables lowers the average false alarm rate same as fpr and miss rate noticeably which is able to contribute to the timeliness and accurateness of early warnings issued by the method therefore the combination of group 1 variables is used for subsequent analysis whereas the combination of δy1 and δy2 group 2 are also used for comparison since it does not contain information from the prediction using lstm the parameter uncertainty of iforest is mainly caused by its cr which decides the threshold of the obtained anomalous score according to which anomalous instances are detected the performance with various cr values are compared in fig 14 as fig 14 shows the youden index which is the difference of tpr and fpr peaks at 1 2 of cr however as the fpr also starts to increase noticeably after 1 0 of cr cr values slightly less than 1 2 but greater than 1 0 are thus all acceptable in this case the value of 1 0 is used in subsequent analysis to minimize the times of false alarms in practical the 1 0 value could also be used initially to train the model in various cases since water inrush accidents are rare events of low probability followed by the calibration using plots as demonstrated in fig 14 the number of itrees t and subsample size ψ is set as 100 and 256 respectively which are set by default in the original study liu et al 2008 for best model performance and efficiency over a wide range of datasets since the model complexity is o tψlogψ the iforest model is trained on the training set of each borehole before being used to detect anomalies on their testing sets the detection outcomes using the variables in group 1 of w2 are visualized on the training set for further validation and adjustment as shown in fig 15 a the anomalous instances detected using the above mentioned traditional threshold method based on expert knowledge are also visualized for instances with an absolute variation rate larger than the threshold on the w2 training set as shown in fig 15 b as can be seen in fig 15 both the detection methods detected the water level anomalies under the impact of precipitation mining activities and so on additionally the ratio of the number of instances that are identically labeled by both methods to the total number of instances in the training set is 99 42 thereby validating the high accuracy of iforest the accuracy can also be improved by slightly adjusting the cr of iforest for 0 1 at once on the base of 1 0 as fig 14 suggests while observing the visualization of anomaly detection on the training set till the detection outcomes of iforest best matches that of the threshold method to obtain best performance of the proposed method for comparison the group 2 variables are used to detect the anomalies in the training set by applying iforest and the results on w2 training set using the above methods are shown in fig 16 on the above basis the anomalies in the testing set are detected using the variables in groups 1 and 2 and the trained iforest model since the instances of anomalous rise in water level normally cannot reflect the risks of water inrush accidents the corresponding anomalous instances obtained using group 2 variables are removed the anomalous instances corresponding to w2 obtained using multiple methods are comprehensively displayed in fig 17 as shown in fig 17 the variables in groups 1 and 2 and the iforest model detected the anomalous water level variations that occurred on 2018 3 1 at 8 55 00 which corresponds to the start of the mining activities on the day therefore we inferred that the water inrush accident is likely to be induced by human factors as also shown in fig 17 the time at which anomalies are detected by the group 1 variables using iforest is prior to the water inrush accident additionally this time is much earlier than that obtained from the traditional threshold method of detecting the variation rate of water levels and the warning water level furthermore the proposed method causes minimal false alarms and the warning time is more than 2 days before a noticeable water inrush is sighted and more than a day before that of the threshold method the anomalous instances of w2 obtained using group 1 variables and iforest are therefore labeled as instances of water inrush risk as shown in fig 18 furthermore the anomalies instances detected using the group 2 variables and iforest are found to be close to that obtained using the group 1 variables however the use of the group 1 variables is generally more sensitive to anomalous variations than that using the group 2 variables as shown in fig 19 the rule applied for labeling the anomalies in w2 is used on w4 w1 and w5 the detection outcomes are shown in fig 20 3 6 risk assessment results the above analysis reveals that anomalies can be detected in water level data from all the boreholes studied over a certain period before and during the water inrush accident however false alarms are issued a few times owing to the small fluctuations in the water levels of a few boreholes the anomalous instances of each borehole with time on the w2 water level curve are shown in fig 21 owing to all the studied water levels of the boreholes being highly correlated the risk level at a specific time can be graded by the number of anomalous boreholes based on water level anomaly detection an instant of no anomalous water levels in a borehole is graded as low water inrush risk and the instances of one two and 3 or higher number of anomalous boreholes are graded as a medium high and extremely high water inrush risk respectively as shown in fig 21 the instances of medium risk contain a few anomalies caused by small fluctuations in a single borehole whereas high risk warnings are issued consecutively from 2018 03 01 at 08 55 00 during which the warnings are issued on time moreover only four false alarms are issued in over a one month period on the testing dataset before the accident occurred the four false alarms are not difficult to dismiss since they are caused by temporary and rapid changes in the water levels during small fluctuations in a few of the boreholes for comparison and further reducing the false alarms the overlapping anomalies obtained using the variables in groups 1 and 2 and iforest are designated to be the anomalous instances corresponding to each borehole subsequently the risk is graded using an identical method to obtain the reduced risk assessment result as shown in fig 22 the overlapped result from group 1 and 2 ensures the accuracy of the detection since intuitively group 1 variables express unexpected disturbance mainly from the perspective of prediction results whereas group 2 variables do mainly from the perspective of simultaneous anomalous variations of water level of both studied boreholes 3 7 comparison of the results for comparison seasonal arima sarima a variation of arima for time series data with seasonality and holt winters exponential smoothing hwes which are effective traditional regression models for predicting time series data are used to predict the variations in the water levels of the boreholes the prediction results on the testing set of w2 borehole is shown in fig 23 the performance comparisons in terms of prediction accuracy mae and computation time are provided in table 8 as table 8 presents the sarima and hwes model outperform the lstm in terms of average mae and accuracy for 50 runs of training on w2 dataset unlike deep learning models sarima and hwes are frequently used prediction models that obtain identical results for each run therefore they cause little model stability issues for affecting the final results in the form of early warning being issued the computation time for hwes is short whereas the sarima is low in efficiency since it needs to be dynamically fitted for every instance to be predicted identical methods as those described above are used to detect the anomalies corresponding to each borehole and subsequently assess the water inrush risk the outcome of the risk assessment is shown in fig 24 the input data of the sarima model must meet the stabilization requirements yang et al 2021 which the up sampled data with a 5 min sampling period does not satisfy hence the original data with a 1 h sampling period are used with the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions as shown in fig 25 and the autoregressive order p moving average order q and differential order d of the model are each set as 1 the seasonal parameter is specified as 24 by considering the complexity and efficiency of the model for the suggested observation period of 1 day the previous data of 720 h is used to fit the model to predict the value over the next hour the obtained prediction accuracy on the testing datasets of borehole w2 w1 w4 and w5 is 99 81 99 12 99 94 and 99 62 respectively which are all above 99 with the standard same as lstm nevertheless prediction result of w2 still lags behind the actual variation temporally especially before and during the water inrush accident making it unable to issue early warnings directly moreover spikes and level shifts of the ae curves are all far less than those of the lstm model as shown in fig 23 a as shown in fig 24 a the effective high risk alert is issued far later than that of lstm model and after the water inrush accident takes place meanwhile no extremely high risk alert is issued the hwes model is used without considering the seasonality of the data the accuracy of borehole w2 w1 w4 and w5 is 99 80 98 99 99 94 and 99 81 respectively which are all above 98 with standard same as lstm nevertheless prediction result of w2 still lags behind the actual variation temporally and are unable to issue early warnings prior to the accident the ae curve of w2 is almost identical to its variation rate as shown in fig 23 b and there are very few disturbances shown on the ae curves of other boreholes as shown in fig 24 b the effective high risk and extremely high risk alert is also issued far later than that of lstm model and after the water inrush accident takes place 4 discussion 4 1 results discussion the prediction results of each regression model show that the accuracy is generally high as shown in fig 23 however their referencing significance for accident forecasting remains low the first 15 instances of high risk warnings for the testing dataset based on the prediction results of the lstm sarima and hwes models are listed in table 9 the first and second column is the original and reduced result for lstm respectively shown in fig 21 and fig 22 the sarima and hwes models did not provide timely warnings of high water inrush risks before the accident despite their high prediction accuracy unlike neural network models the traditional regression models are limited by strict requirements and other limitations on the input data the water level data of the boreholes in mines are often easily affected by the deformation of geological structures precipitation mining activity recording sensor faults and so on which imparts a high level of randomness therefore using regression models for predicting water inrush risk is less suitable furthermore regression models generally require less time to fit on a dataset to perform prediction for a single instance compared to those of neural network models however this advantage diminishes when the number of instances to be predicted becomes large for a large data sample from a mine frequent update of the model is needed and a long duration is required for fitting which may be longer than the sampling period for regression models to be dynamically fitted to maintain a high prediction accuracy however fully trained neural network models can be used for a relatively long period before updates are required in summary the adaptiveness of complex and large data samples and anomaly detection of the lstm neural network model in this study are proven to be more promising than those of traditional regression models 4 2 method limitations despite the timeliness and high accuracy of the proposed method it has some limitations firstly as same as most of other machine learning models relatively large data sample sizes with continuously observed instances are required for the lstm and iforest models to be adequately trained to obtain satisfactory results consequently the water level should be monitored for long continuous periods and with adequate sampling rate in the studied case the sampling period is 1 h and data preprocessing is conducted for up sampling to ensure the timeliness of the results secondly minor differences in the results are found for each run such as slight changes of the accuracy and false alarm rate of the iforest which is caused by the instability of the machine learning models in the studied case the influence of such effect on the final result is negligible since the risk evaluation process based on the number of simultaneous anomalous borehole is conducted for mitigation as a result multiple geologically correlated observational boreholes are required for the method thirdly false alarms are still likely to be caused during the few occurrences of random noise like fluctuations of water level which decreases the accuracy of the method for further improvement on the proposed method future research can be conducted to filter minor water level fluctuations using suitable algorithms before the prediction additionally the model structure and parameters can be further optimized and compared by various algorithms experiments using other suitable algorithms on the anomaly detection of water level data and its prediction error may be also beneficial finally more neural network models can be applied to determine the water inrush risk of a water level anomaly as substantial effort is required with empirical knowledge to accurately label the data in the training set this can transfer the subject of the study from prediction and anomaly detection to categorization using supervised deep learning models which may also lead to promising results for predicting water inrush accidents 5 conclusions our proposed method uses accessible and commonly observed water level data from explorational borehole groups in coal mines to issue early warnings of water inrush accidents based on the sequential combination of lstm and iforest models despite the original data sample size being limited with a low sampling rate promising results are obtained which proves the practicality of the proposed method several innovative contributions of the study are presented firstly a coupled model of lstm iforest is provided for the lack of accuracy and timeliness during disastrous scenarios of existing prediction methods based on empirical threshold setting regressive algorithms and machine learning algorithms secondly a dynamic water inrush risk level grading rule is specified based on the results of the analysis allowing real time evaluation of mining water inrush risk thirdly the proposed method is tested on the actual case of water inrush accident for its effectiveness obtaining the result of early warnings that are more than 2 days earlier than the actual sighting of the accident with very few false alarms finally major model parameters are adjusted and validated with empirical methods allowing the method to be robust enough for its broad application in various types of mining conditions with limited

2609,water level variation of explorational boreholes in mining sites is one of the most direct representations of water inrush risk despite recent efforts on mine water inrush accident prediction based on various types of observation data including water level of boreholes using a wide range of machine learning models the accuracy and timeliness of the prediction for major accidents are still unsatisfactory in this study a novel prediction method based on the analysis of water level variation anomalies in borehole groups is proposed using the coupled model of long short time memory lstm and isolation forest iforest multi variate lstm algorithm is firstly used to model the correlated time sequence water level data in the borehole group followed by the full extraction of the data variation feature based on the combination of variables including the prediction error being used as inputs of the iforest algorithm as a result anomalous variations of the data are detected as possible precursors of water inrush accident finally a set of water inrush risk level grading rule is established based on the number of simultaneous anomalous data instances being detected within a borehole group the results obtained for the water inrush accident in xingdong coal mine demonstrate extraordinary timeliness and high accuracy as high water inrush risk warning is issued for more than 2 days earlier than the time of actual sighting of the accident with very few false alarms being caused throughout the period of the testing dataset this study provides an innovative solution to the low prediction accuracy and slow responding speed during major water inrush accidents of existing methods the major parameters of the proposed coupled model of lstm iforest can also be easily calibrated based on traditional empirical methods for the best performance allowing the method to be widely applied in various mining conditions keywords water inrush borehole group long short time memory isolation forest anomaly detection risk evaluation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction and background water inrush accident is a major risk to mining safety over the world especially in coal producing countries such as china united states india and australia chen et al 2015 dash et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 despite stringent safety regulations such disasters still have caused heavy loss of lives and properties over the years bringemeier 2012 owing to effects such as precipitation permeability of aquiclude and human transformation of geological structures the occurrence of water inrush accidents during mining is random and uncertain li et al 2017 mokhov 2007 which causes the prediction of such mining accidents to be challenging despite various novel geophysical methods having been proposed over the years to analyze the hydrogeological properties of water bearing structures for the prediction xu et al 2022 yang 2014 drilling exploration remains one of the most direct and reliable ways of dynamically obtaining water inrush risk information by easily accessed data such as water level gao 2019 li 2018 zhao 2021 however the long term variation of water level data of borehole groups in mines has not been systematically studied thus far over the years extensive efforts have been made through the analysis of various types of observed data to predict mining accidents traditional methods based on static data analysis and threshold setting du et al 2017 guan 2012 qiu et al 2017 such as the water inrush coefficient and the vulnerable index method cao et al 2022 li et al 2022 wu et al 2011 are frequently used as the majority of them are reliable in specific conditions but highly dependent on empirical knowledge and is less suitable for dynamic water inrush prediction in changing mining environments li et al 2017 the methods based on regression and statistical analysis are also extensively applied in data analysis for mining such as the rainfall runoff model luo et al 2022 pca model li et al 2020 probability index qiu et al 2017 and discriminant analysis bi et al 2021 zhang et al 2013 these methods can also produce reliable prediction results but usually have strict limitations on the input data in recent years the adoption of machine learning models to predict mining accidents have surged a variety of novel prediction methods have been proposed correspondingly some frequently used methods are the autoregressive integrated moving average arima yang et al 2021 holt winters exponential smoothing hwes linghu et al 2020 support vector machine cao and zhao 2011 mahmoodzadeh et al 2022b and extreme gradient boosting mahmoodzadeh et al 2022d the trend and seasonal variation features of the predicted data can be well extracted by these methods nevertheless most of them are also only suitable for specific mining conditions and have high limitations on the input data lately prediction efforts using methods based on deep learning such as convolution neural network model and recursive neural network rnn model yu 2021 have been extensively attempted deep learning models have the advantage of being adaptive and accurate since they are data driven on the other hand they often require large amounts of data as inputs and hardware with high computational capability for training before the data prediction besides the interpretability and stability of the machine learning models can be lower than other methods at times ma et al 2022a ma et al 2022b ma et al 2022c although various techniques such as multi source data fusion bi et al 2022 li et al 2021 model combination gao wang 2012 residual correction zhu 2021 and parameter optimization qiao 2011 mahmoodzadeh et al 2022a mahmoodzadeh et al 2022c wang et al 2022 have been used to optimize the performance and improve the accuracy of various prediction models few of the methods effectiveness are tested on datasets in cases of actual water inrush disasters the dramatic decrease of accuracies and response speeds of many of the algorithms used in case of large data variations in disastrous scenarios have not been adequately addressed in this study the coupled model of lstm iforest is innovatively used to analyze the water level time sequence data as a special type of recursive neural network lstm and its variants are proven to be ones of the most effective models to extract complex time sequence data s variation features over long periods meyal et al 2020 kratzert et al 2018 nevertheless its prediction accuracy also decreases remarkably preceding and during the accident the major novelties to overcome such issues in this study are highlighted as follows a the variation of the prediction error by lstm is analyzed to detect unexpected anomalous disturbance on the water levels of boreholes rather than merely attempting to reduce the prediction error b the potential combination of input variables including the prediction error of lstm are compared for the best performance of the iforest model for anomaly detection since iforest is a frequently used machine learning model for its accuracy and efficiency for the anomaly detection in high dimensional data with small ratio of anomalous instances of substantial value difference to the normal ones c the water inrush risk is evaluated according to the outcome of the anomaly detection in real time as low medium high and extra high levels according to which early warnings of potential accident are issued d the major parameters of the models used can be easily calibrated using traditional empirical methods increasing the robustness of the method for its adoption in various mining conditions in summary this proposed method is expected to issue early warnings of water inrush accidents with very few false alarms under various mining conditions 2 data modeling 2 1 lstm lstm has been proven as an effective method of modeling large amounts of complex time series data with multiple variates over a long period additionally lstm has already been applied to various forms of data prediction in the field of mining safety over the world mostly for methane gas outbreaks and seismic activities kurach pawlowski 2016 pawlowski et al 2015 shu et al 2022 zhang et al 2019 with only a few water hazard related study cases recently zeng et al 2021 dong et al 2019 qiao et al 2020 xing 2021 similar applications have also been reported in other fields such as earthquake forecasting yan et al 2021 lstm is a special form of recursive neural network with a forget gate added to the cell unit to avoid long term dependency the cell structure of the lstm contains a forget gate ft input gate it output gate ot and memory cell gers et al 2000 as shown in fig 1 the forget gate decides the amount of information that is passed to the current state ct from the last time step ct 1 when the current input is x t according to the following formula 1 f t σ w f h t 1 x t b f in which f t is the function value of the forget gate at time t w f and b f is the weight and offset of the forget gate function h t 1 is the hidden state at time t 1 σ is the sigmoid activation function the input gate controls the input of the latest information according to the following formulae 2 i t σ w i h t 1 x t b i in which i t is the function value of the input gate at time t w i and b i is the weight and offset of the input gate function 3 c t tan h w c h t 1 x t b c in which c t is the function value of the current cell state at time t w c and b c is the weight and offset of the current state function tanh is the tanh activation function the updated memory cell state is 4 c t f t c t 1 i t c t the formula of the output gate is 5 o t σ w o h t 1 x t b o where o t is the function value of the output gate at time t w o and b o is the weight and offset of the current state function the hidden state at time t can be obtained using the following formula 6 h t o t tan h c t a single layer lstm model can be constructed using the cell structure in fig 1 connected by cell state and hidden state in series the prediction outcome of this model on sample data containing the water inrush quantities in a coal mine is shown in fig 2 in which the model is adequately trained and its parameters and structures are properly adjusted the water levels and water inrush quantities were used as the inputs to the model to predict future water inrush quantities as shown in fig 2 the prediction is accurate in general since under normal conditions the fluctuation of the water inrush quantity is consistently between 7 and 8 5 and there is no substantial increase or decrease throughout the time of observation however the prediction curve always lags behind the actual curve as if it was the actual curve being shifted to the right along the time axis this is a typical prediction phenomenon of lstm and many other neural networks and regression models consequently this reduces the referencing significance of the predicted value for forecasting water inrush accidents 2 2 isolation forest iforest iforest is an effective and efficient unsupervised machine learning algorithm for modeling high dimensional data containing large numbers of instances chen wu 2019 therefore this algorithm can be used to construct the anomaly detection feature in this study iforest uses a binary tree structure called itree to search for isolated instances liu 2018 additionally h x is the path length for the root node to traverse the itree up to the outside nodes and c n is the average value of h x for a specific n value to normalize h x the anomaly score s x n is defined as follows liu et al 2008 7 s x n 2 e h x c n 8 c n 2 h n 1 2 n 1 n 2 1 n 2 0 o t h e r s where h i is the harmonic number to be estimated by ln i 0 5772156649 euler s constant and e h x is the average of h x from a collection of isolation trees when e h x c n s 0 5 when e h x 0 s 1 when e h x n 1 s 0 if s 1 x is anomalous in contrast if s 0 x can be regarded as a normal instance if all s 0 5 the entire sample can be regarded as having no anomalies using the adequately trained iforest model with its parameters properly adjusted to detect anomalies in the same sample data as shown in fig 2 the outcomes are as shown in fig 3 the result is reasonable since no water inrush accident had occurred during the observing period 3 proposed method the proposed method follows the process shown in fig 4 firstly all borehole data is pre processed to handle erroneous and missing values as well as being resampled by suitable sampling period then data are analyzed for correlation on which basis correlated data from corresponding boreholes are grouped and partitioned as training and validation set for prediction and anomaly detection models the lstm and iforest model are then trained as iforest model take the prediction error of lstm as part of its input variates followed by anomaly detection outcome s validation using empirical knowledge on the training set the parameter of iforest can be repetitively adjusted till the outcome is adequately validated finally the properly trained and validated lstm and iforest model are used on the testing dataset to obtain abnormal detection result in order to issue early warnings prior to the water inrush accident 3 1 studied area and dataset in march 2018 a coal seam floor ordovician limestone water inrush accident occurred in the xingdong coal mine in hanxing mining area the coal field is located in the baiquan spring field of the hangxing hydrogeological unit in the middle of the eastern foot of taihang mountains fig 5 a its area is 3843 km2 and the exposed area of cambrian and ordovician limestone is 645 km2 the water inflow layer is the ordovician limestone aquifer below the coal seam floor the aquifer has great thickness of more than 500 m fig 5 b fig 6 with strong water yield and rich dynamic and static reserves the water head exceeds the coal seam floor by about 1000 m a unique working condition of coal seam mining with water pressure is formed with the pressure on the coal seam floor exceeding 10 mpa after the coal seam is mined and forming a cavity in the goaf the goaf formed till march 3 has the dimension of width of 165 m mining length of 155 m mining thickness of 4 m the ordovician limestone water driven by high water pressure often breaks through the floor aquicludes causing water inrush accidents this case of water inrush at the 2228 working face of xingdong mine is a typical representation fig 5 b the water inrush is roughly divided into three stages the first stage is from march 3 to 13 which lasts for 9 days the water yield increases rapidly from 60 m3 h to 2649 m3 h in the same period the water level of w2 borehole also experienced two precipitous drops for the first time it dropped from 32 9 m on march 3 to 3 4 m on march 6 the second time from 2 5 m on the 11th to 45 5 m on the 13th the second stage is from march 13 to april 15 which lasts for 31 days the water yield decreases rapidly from the peak to about 1750 m3 h and steadily decreases to about 1600 m3 h the third stage is the grouting treatment stage after three months of comprehensive implementation of the regional grouting treatment in the floor area the water inrush was effectively controlled and the mining project was gradually restored this study focuses mostly on the process of water inrush from march 1 to 5 in the first stage in this study the water level data from 2015 02 01 to 2018 04 25 of the w2 w4 w1 w5 w9 and d11 in the borehole group near the location of the accident shown in fig 5 b are chosen for analysis using the dataset provided by this particular case have several advantages for the proposed method to be fully studied firstly it provides a water level dataset of approximately 336 000 instances of each borehole being monitored continuously in over three years observation time before the accident with few discontinuations or missing values secondly all of the data have varied substantially during a certain period of heavy precipitation rather than being stable throughout the observation time thirdly the dataset contains data in the period when a major water inrush accident actually took place allowing the effectiveness of the proposed method to be proven the first two advantages are beneficial for the machine learning models to be fully trained and to be able to adapt to the amplitude of variation when the accident takes place 3 2 data pre processing fig 7 shows the pre processed data in which missing values were filled using linear interpolation as shown in fig 7 most of the boreholes have a similar trend of variations during the time of observation fig 8 shows the seasonal and residual components obtained by decomposing the w2 data using the additive model lazzeri 2020 to analyze its variation trend the sum of the trend seasonal and residual curve is the original curve of w2 on observing the water level data no obvious seasonality is found and the trend is obvious for instance from july to december 2016 the water level increased substantially owing to the large amounts of precipitation that year although this section of data does not have good typicality it is included in the dataset to fully train the prediction and anomaly detection model to adapt to the amplitude of variation this can intuitively improve the performance of the model in case of events of small probability such as water inrush accidents from the beginning of 2017 till before the water inrush accident on 208 03 03 the water level data does not show a variable trend however random fluctuations are observed at times the residual component does not vary greatly until just before the accident is sighted thereby indicating the randomness of water level variations under anomalous disturbance during the accident the sampling period of the original data is 1 h the water level variation with time is considered to be minor under normal conditions in the mine and therefore the sample period is decreased to 5 min using forward filling for vacant values such that the timeliness of the prediction can be improved although linear interpolation can be used the filling method is used for better differentiation of data which is proven to be beneficial for prediction and anomaly detection in this study furthermore the data of w9 is missing over a large period these missing values are linearly interpolated since linear interpolation is relatively stable and efficient in comparison to other techniques in this case according to the time at which the water inrush accident occurs fig 7 the w2 data is partitioned into training validation and testing sets with starting times of 2015 02 01 00 00 00 2017 11 01 00 00 00 and 2018 02 01 00 00 00 respectively the ending time of the testing set is set to 2018 04 07 23 00 00 to avoid interference owing to grouting and other countermeasures after the accident the data from the rest of the boreholes are similarly partitioned 3 3 correlation analysis correlation analysis is conducted on all borehole data using the spearman correlation coefficient after removing a few apparent recording errors related to the discontinuities in the dataset the spearman correlation coefficient determines whether a correlation exists between two variables by synchronism examination this adaptive method can identify the linear correlation between two variables and monotonic non linear correlation with no normal distribution requirement for the analyzed data zhang et al 2018 the spearman correlation coefficient can be calculated as follows duan song 2016 9 r s ρ rg x i r g y i c o v r g x i r g y i σ rg x i σ rg y i where cov rgxi rgyi is the covariance of the rank variables and σ rg x i and σ rg y i are the standard deviations of the rank variables the heatmap of the spearman correlation coefficients of the borehole data is shown in fig 9 the closer the spearman coefficient is to 1 the higher the positive monotonic correlation is between two variables duan song 2016 fig 9 shows that the w2 w4 w1 w5 and d11 data have positive and monotonic correlations with each other however the w9 data is not highly correlated to others this can be validated since all the boreholes correspond to the same aquifer except for w9 since multicollinearity of the input variables of a prediction model can be detrimental the frequently used variance inflation factor vif method in feature engineering is applied to select the appropriate features and reduce redundancy for prediction abood salman 2021 as an indicator of multicollinearity tamura et al 2019 the vif of each borehole data is calculated as follows 10 vif i 1 1 r i 2 where r i 2 is the coefficient of determination of the ith variable the vif variables in the range of 10 225 are often considered to be of moderate collinearity whereas those less than 10 and above 225 are considered to be of low and high collinearity respectively chatterjee et al 2012 as shown in table 1 for all other borehole data w9 is of low collinearity hence w9 is eliminated from the analysis meanwhile multiple variables with high multicollinearity are present therefore only one variable with the lowest vif is reserved along with the variable to be predicted to be the input of the corresponding prediction model that is w2 with w4 w4 with w2 w1 with w2 and w5 with w4 in which the formers are the variables to be predicted 3 4 data prediction using the above data combinations the water levels in w2 w4 w1 and w5 are predicted by applying their partitioned dataset to the multivariate lstm model considering the dynamically renewed demand while deploying a gated recurrent unit which is an efficient variant of lstm can also be used lazzeri 2020 however only lstm is used as the prediction results of both models in this study have been proven by experimentations to be almost identical additionally the stack of multiple layers of the lstm models is not used in this study owing to its limited effect on improving prediction accuracies and a dramatic increase in the training time to train the lstm using the training set the mean absolute error mae is applied as the loss function mae is used in this study to evaluate the model rather than rmse or r2 since the absolute error ae of each instance in the dataset is subsequently studied as a time sequence to be detected for anomalies due to its ability to represent prediction error in the most direct linear and robust fashion and the evaluation criteria of the prediction model should be used accordingly for consistency as the mean value of aes of the instances moreover mae is less sensitive than the others to the large errors of few of the predicted instances which is preferable to subsequent anomaly detection analysis the definitions of mae and ae are as follows 11 ae y i y i 12 mae 1 n i 1 n y i y i 100 where y i is the predicted value of the ith instance y i is the actual observed value of the ith instance and n is the number of instances in the sample data the accuracy is calculated as the ratio of the number of accurate instances to the number of all instances in the testing set on predicting the water level on the testing set of each borehole data the predicted instances with aes less than 0 2 m are considered to be accurate exclusively considering the dramatic change in the water level of w2 during the disaster an ae of 1 m is considered to be accurate for w2 the model uses adam as the optimizer through experimentation the increase in the number of the cell units of the model i e the number of time steps for a specific prediction to above 10 is found to have an insignificant effect on improving the prediction accuracy and a major effect on increasing the training time therefore 12 cell units of the models are used to predict the value at the next time step i e the value after the next 5 min interval using the values from the last 1 h to obtain relatively good results over a short training time the model is trained for 50 epochs with an early stop condition of 20 instances of non improvement of the loss function on the validation set the implementations were performed using python 3 7 0 in the windows system on an intel core i5 9600 k cpu 3 70 ghz with 32 gb of ram in addition the gpu of nvidia geforce gtx 1660ti is used to accelerate computations the loss functions of the training and validation sets of w2 by epoch are shown in fig 10 the training loss appeared to be adequately converged after 50 epochs of training the corresponding differentials of the first order corresponding to each combination of input variables are additionally tested on the model and minor improvements are achieved in the outcome the complexity of the lstm model is o 4 n n m 1 where n is the size of the hidden states and m is the dimension of the input the parameter uncertainty of lstm is mainly caused by its number of cell units t which decides the structure and n of the model and the performance with various t values are compared in fig 11 as fig 11 shows the variation of the maes and accuracies is rather stable and no obvious variation trend is presented whereas the models with multi variate generally outperform those with single variate the standard rnn gru and lstm are compared in terms of prediction accuracy mean absolute error mae and computation time in table 2 as table 2 presents the lstm and gru model outperform the rnn in terms of average mae accuracy and computation time for 50 runs of training on w2 dataset the performance between lstm and gru are similar while all models have similar stability in terms of standard deviations of mae and accuracy the input variables of multi and single variate are compared for their prediction outputs in table 3 as table 3 presents the lstm model with w2 and w4 as input variables outperforms the model with single w2 input in terms of average mae and accuracy for 50 runs of training on w2 dataset meanwhile they have similar stability in terms of standard deviations of mae and accuracy use the above multi variate lstm model to conduct predictions with w2 and w4 dataset in various length of periods before the accident as inputs the comparison results is shown in table 4 as table 4 presents the performance of the lstm model improves substantially with the increase of the sample size of the datasets in terms of average mae and accuracy for 50 runs of training on w2 dataset the stability of the model also increases as standard deviations of mae decreases substantially the prediction outcomes of each borehole using the proposed lstm model are shown in fig 12 as shown in fig 12 the accuracy of w2 and w1 decreases substantially during the water inrush accident all the ae curves contain certain spikes and level shifts immediately preceding and during the accident except in the case of w5 in comparison to the absolute variation rate curve the ae curves are more sensitive to the anomalies in the water level variations especially for w2 the ae curve shows dramatic variations in spikes and level shifts during the generation and occurrence of the disaster a sample of the w2 prediction data during the accident is shown in table 5 table 5 shows that the water level dropped considerably during the early generation and development of the accident with all of the predicted values being greater than the actual value some of the predicted value is even greater than the actual value from the past hour which is far behind the actual variation moreover the ae increased sharply to over 2 m on 2018 03 03 at 18 55 00 therefore forecasting major water inrush accidents by merely using water level data predictions is unrealistic and the anomaly detection model should be jointly used based on the prediction results to issue early warnings of accidents 3 5 anomaly detection based on the prediction results anomaly detection is conducted using the ae absolute variation rate δ y 1 i and absolute variation rate δ y 2 i of the water level of the correlated borehole used as the input to the prediction model to fully extract the features of the ae with respect to time the first order differential of the ae δ a e is included as one of the input variables in the anomaly detection model the corresponding expressions are as follows 13 δ a e i ae i ae i 1 14 δ y i y i y i 1 where y i and y i 1 are the actual values and ae i and ae i 1 are the absolute prediction errors of the ith and i 1 th instances to prevent the water level from negatively affecting the anomaly detection the actual value of water level data is not included as an input variable the potential combination of input variables is presented in table 6 the input variables of the combinations in table 6 are compared for their performances on w2 training set in terms of the receiver operating characteristic roc curve and the area under the curve auc which are commonly used evaluation criteria of anomaly detection models as in the fig 13 the traditional threshold setting method on the water level variation is also adopted in this evaluation of the iforest model and its calibration since the water level data after july 2016 is of less typicality the threshold is set as 0 3 times the largest absolute variation rate of w2 from february 2015 to february 2016 instances with water level variation rate larger than such threshold can be regard as anomalous according to such criteria the values of true positive false positive true negative and false negative of the detection result of iforest are obtained for each run by adjusting the contamination rate cr of iforest which is the ratio of the number of instances of the highest anomaly scores to the total number of instances in the training set from 0 5 to 2 and running the model for 50 times each to obtain sets of average false positive rate fpr and the corresponding average true positive rate tpr values the roc curve and the auc corresponding to each input combinations table 6 is obtained it can be seen from fig 13 that the combination of ae δy1 and δae group 1 as the inputs of the iforest obtained the highest auc the combination of ae and δy1 obtain the second best roc curve with slightly less auc as fig 13 shows to further analyze the sensitivity the model performance for these two sets of input variables are evaluated with statistical data in table 7 the cr values are both set as 1 as shown in table 7 the stability difference between the models with these two sets of input variables in terms of standard deviation of the tpr fpr accuracy precision and miss rate are negligible whereas the inclusion of δae as one of the input variables lowers the average false alarm rate same as fpr and miss rate noticeably which is able to contribute to the timeliness and accurateness of early warnings issued by the method therefore the combination of group 1 variables is used for subsequent analysis whereas the combination of δy1 and δy2 group 2 are also used for comparison since it does not contain information from the prediction using lstm the parameter uncertainty of iforest is mainly caused by its cr which decides the threshold of the obtained anomalous score according to which anomalous instances are detected the performance with various cr values are compared in fig 14 as fig 14 shows the youden index which is the difference of tpr and fpr peaks at 1 2 of cr however as the fpr also starts to increase noticeably after 1 0 of cr cr values slightly less than 1 2 but greater than 1 0 are thus all acceptable in this case the value of 1 0 is used in subsequent analysis to minimize the times of false alarms in practical the 1 0 value could also be used initially to train the model in various cases since water inrush accidents are rare events of low probability followed by the calibration using plots as demonstrated in fig 14 the number of itrees t and subsample size ψ is set as 100 and 256 respectively which are set by default in the original study liu et al 2008 for best model performance and efficiency over a wide range of datasets since the model complexity is o tψlogψ the iforest model is trained on the training set of each borehole before being used to detect anomalies on their testing sets the detection outcomes using the variables in group 1 of w2 are visualized on the training set for further validation and adjustment as shown in fig 15 a the anomalous instances detected using the above mentioned traditional threshold method based on expert knowledge are also visualized for instances with an absolute variation rate larger than the threshold on the w2 training set as shown in fig 15 b as can be seen in fig 15 both the detection methods detected the water level anomalies under the impact of precipitation mining activities and so on additionally the ratio of the number of instances that are identically labeled by both methods to the total number of instances in the training set is 99 42 thereby validating the high accuracy of iforest the accuracy can also be improved by slightly adjusting the cr of iforest for 0 1 at once on the base of 1 0 as fig 14 suggests while observing the visualization of anomaly detection on the training set till the detection outcomes of iforest best matches that of the threshold method to obtain best performance of the proposed method for comparison the group 2 variables are used to detect the anomalies in the training set by applying iforest and the results on w2 training set using the above methods are shown in fig 16 on the above basis the anomalies in the testing set are detected using the variables in groups 1 and 2 and the trained iforest model since the instances of anomalous rise in water level normally cannot reflect the risks of water inrush accidents the corresponding anomalous instances obtained using group 2 variables are removed the anomalous instances corresponding to w2 obtained using multiple methods are comprehensively displayed in fig 17 as shown in fig 17 the variables in groups 1 and 2 and the iforest model detected the anomalous water level variations that occurred on 2018 3 1 at 8 55 00 which corresponds to the start of the mining activities on the day therefore we inferred that the water inrush accident is likely to be induced by human factors as also shown in fig 17 the time at which anomalies are detected by the group 1 variables using iforest is prior to the water inrush accident additionally this time is much earlier than that obtained from the traditional threshold method of detecting the variation rate of water levels and the warning water level furthermore the proposed method causes minimal false alarms and the warning time is more than 2 days before a noticeable water inrush is sighted and more than a day before that of the threshold method the anomalous instances of w2 obtained using group 1 variables and iforest are therefore labeled as instances of water inrush risk as shown in fig 18 furthermore the anomalies instances detected using the group 2 variables and iforest are found to be close to that obtained using the group 1 variables however the use of the group 1 variables is generally more sensitive to anomalous variations than that using the group 2 variables as shown in fig 19 the rule applied for labeling the anomalies in w2 is used on w4 w1 and w5 the detection outcomes are shown in fig 20 3 6 risk assessment results the above analysis reveals that anomalies can be detected in water level data from all the boreholes studied over a certain period before and during the water inrush accident however false alarms are issued a few times owing to the small fluctuations in the water levels of a few boreholes the anomalous instances of each borehole with time on the w2 water level curve are shown in fig 21 owing to all the studied water levels of the boreholes being highly correlated the risk level at a specific time can be graded by the number of anomalous boreholes based on water level anomaly detection an instant of no anomalous water levels in a borehole is graded as low water inrush risk and the instances of one two and 3 or higher number of anomalous boreholes are graded as a medium high and extremely high water inrush risk respectively as shown in fig 21 the instances of medium risk contain a few anomalies caused by small fluctuations in a single borehole whereas high risk warnings are issued consecutively from 2018 03 01 at 08 55 00 during which the warnings are issued on time moreover only four false alarms are issued in over a one month period on the testing dataset before the accident occurred the four false alarms are not difficult to dismiss since they are caused by temporary and rapid changes in the water levels during small fluctuations in a few of the boreholes for comparison and further reducing the false alarms the overlapping anomalies obtained using the variables in groups 1 and 2 and iforest are designated to be the anomalous instances corresponding to each borehole subsequently the risk is graded using an identical method to obtain the reduced risk assessment result as shown in fig 22 the overlapped result from group 1 and 2 ensures the accuracy of the detection since intuitively group 1 variables express unexpected disturbance mainly from the perspective of prediction results whereas group 2 variables do mainly from the perspective of simultaneous anomalous variations of water level of both studied boreholes 3 7 comparison of the results for comparison seasonal arima sarima a variation of arima for time series data with seasonality and holt winters exponential smoothing hwes which are effective traditional regression models for predicting time series data are used to predict the variations in the water levels of the boreholes the prediction results on the testing set of w2 borehole is shown in fig 23 the performance comparisons in terms of prediction accuracy mae and computation time are provided in table 8 as table 8 presents the sarima and hwes model outperform the lstm in terms of average mae and accuracy for 50 runs of training on w2 dataset unlike deep learning models sarima and hwes are frequently used prediction models that obtain identical results for each run therefore they cause little model stability issues for affecting the final results in the form of early warning being issued the computation time for hwes is short whereas the sarima is low in efficiency since it needs to be dynamically fitted for every instance to be predicted identical methods as those described above are used to detect the anomalies corresponding to each borehole and subsequently assess the water inrush risk the outcome of the risk assessment is shown in fig 24 the input data of the sarima model must meet the stabilization requirements yang et al 2021 which the up sampled data with a 5 min sampling period does not satisfy hence the original data with a 1 h sampling period are used with the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions as shown in fig 25 and the autoregressive order p moving average order q and differential order d of the model are each set as 1 the seasonal parameter is specified as 24 by considering the complexity and efficiency of the model for the suggested observation period of 1 day the previous data of 720 h is used to fit the model to predict the value over the next hour the obtained prediction accuracy on the testing datasets of borehole w2 w1 w4 and w5 is 99 81 99 12 99 94 and 99 62 respectively which are all above 99 with the standard same as lstm nevertheless prediction result of w2 still lags behind the actual variation temporally especially before and during the water inrush accident making it unable to issue early warnings directly moreover spikes and level shifts of the ae curves are all far less than those of the lstm model as shown in fig 23 a as shown in fig 24 a the effective high risk alert is issued far later than that of lstm model and after the water inrush accident takes place meanwhile no extremely high risk alert is issued the hwes model is used without considering the seasonality of the data the accuracy of borehole w2 w1 w4 and w5 is 99 80 98 99 99 94 and 99 81 respectively which are all above 98 with standard same as lstm nevertheless prediction result of w2 still lags behind the actual variation temporally and are unable to issue early warnings prior to the accident the ae curve of w2 is almost identical to its variation rate as shown in fig 23 b and there are very few disturbances shown on the ae curves of other boreholes as shown in fig 24 b the effective high risk and extremely high risk alert is also issued far later than that of lstm model and after the water inrush accident takes place 4 discussion 4 1 results discussion the prediction results of each regression model show that the accuracy is generally high as shown in fig 23 however their referencing significance for accident forecasting remains low the first 15 instances of high risk warnings for the testing dataset based on the prediction results of the lstm sarima and hwes models are listed in table 9 the first and second column is the original and reduced result for lstm respectively shown in fig 21 and fig 22 the sarima and hwes models did not provide timely warnings of high water inrush risks before the accident despite their high prediction accuracy unlike neural network models the traditional regression models are limited by strict requirements and other limitations on the input data the water level data of the boreholes in mines are often easily affected by the deformation of geological structures precipitation mining activity recording sensor faults and so on which imparts a high level of randomness therefore using regression models for predicting water inrush risk is less suitable furthermore regression models generally require less time to fit on a dataset to perform prediction for a single instance compared to those of neural network models however this advantage diminishes when the number of instances to be predicted becomes large for a large data sample from a mine frequent update of the model is needed and a long duration is required for fitting which may be longer than the sampling period for regression models to be dynamically fitted to maintain a high prediction accuracy however fully trained neural network models can be used for a relatively long period before updates are required in summary the adaptiveness of complex and large data samples and anomaly detection of the lstm neural network model in this study are proven to be more promising than those of traditional regression models 4 2 method limitations despite the timeliness and high accuracy of the proposed method it has some limitations firstly as same as most of other machine learning models relatively large data sample sizes with continuously observed instances are required for the lstm and iforest models to be adequately trained to obtain satisfactory results consequently the water level should be monitored for long continuous periods and with adequate sampling rate in the studied case the sampling period is 1 h and data preprocessing is conducted for up sampling to ensure the timeliness of the results secondly minor differences in the results are found for each run such as slight changes of the accuracy and false alarm rate of the iforest which is caused by the instability of the machine learning models in the studied case the influence of such effect on the final result is negligible since the risk evaluation process based on the number of simultaneous anomalous borehole is conducted for mitigation as a result multiple geologically correlated observational boreholes are required for the method thirdly false alarms are still likely to be caused during the few occurrences of random noise like fluctuations of water level which decreases the accuracy of the method for further improvement on the proposed method future research can be conducted to filter minor water level fluctuations using suitable algorithms before the prediction additionally the model structure and parameters can be further optimized and compared by various algorithms experiments using other suitable algorithms on the anomaly detection of water level data and its prediction error may be also beneficial finally more neural network models can be applied to determine the water inrush risk of a water level anomaly as substantial effort is required with empirical knowledge to accurately label the data in the training set this can transfer the subject of the study from prediction and anomaly detection to categorization using supervised deep learning models which may also lead to promising results for predicting water inrush accidents 5 conclusions our proposed method uses accessible and commonly observed water level data from explorational borehole groups in coal mines to issue early warnings of water inrush accidents based on the sequential combination of lstm and iforest models despite the original data sample size being limited with a low sampling rate promising results are obtained which proves the practicality of the proposed method several innovative contributions of the study are presented firstly a coupled model of lstm iforest is provided for the lack of accuracy and timeliness during disastrous scenarios of existing prediction methods based on empirical threshold setting regressive algorithms and machine learning algorithms secondly a dynamic water inrush risk level grading rule is specified based on the results of the analysis allowing real time evaluation of mining water inrush risk thirdly the proposed method is tested on the actual case of water inrush accident for its effectiveness obtaining the result of early warnings that are more than 2 days earlier than the actual sighting of the accident with very few false alarms finally major model parameters are adjusted and validated with empirical methods allowing the method to be robust enough for its broad application in various types of mining conditions with limited
