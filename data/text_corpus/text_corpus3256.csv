16280,cost effective disinfection technology is urgently needed in poor rural areas erythrosine ery based solar disinfection sodis provides a promising solution because of its effective inactivation of viruses and gram positive bacteria at low cost however the poor gram negative bacteria g e g escherichia coli inactivation of photosensitized ery inhibits its application herein for the first time the protonation of ery was found to greatly enhance its g inactivation and 99 99999 7 0 log of e coli were completely inactivated within only 30 s using 2 5 mg l ery under 200 mw cm2 visible light irradiation the inactivation rate constant k reached 17 5 min 1 at ph 4 0 which was 4730 times higher than that at ph 7 0 at a lower ph more severe cell wall and genomic dna damage was observed a linear correlation between k and monoanionic ery he content was obtained indicating that he rather than dianionic ery e2 participated in the inactivation at ph 5 0 7 0 which was further explained by the higher production of reactive oxygen species and bacterial adsorption of he than e2 both 1o2 and o 2 dominated bacterial inactivation contributing 56 8 and 43 2 respectively o 2 but not 1o2 caused ery photobleaching oh was not involved in either inactivation or photobleaching humic acid and salts nacl na2so4 cacl2 and mgcl2 slightly inhibited inactivation while nahco3 accelerated inactivation complete inactivation 99 9999 of e coli was achieved within 30 min at ph 5 0 in ery based sodis with good adaptation to various water matrices and weather sunny or partly cloudy this work will help to promote the application of ery based disinfection especially for sodis in poor rural areas graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords solar disinfection erythrosine protonation bacterial inactivation radicals 1 introduction because of poverty and shortages of facilities as of 2015 800 million people around the world lacked basic drinking water services world health organization 2017 developing solar disinfection sodis will help to improve drinking water security chu et al 2019 the biggest problem with sodis is the low efficiency towards bacteria and viruses fisher et al 2012 erythrosine ery a food and drug administration fda permitted food coloring with a cheap price 15 kg has great potential to be used as a new cheap water disinfector in sodis because it can kill many pathogens at low concentrations and decompose after disinfection under visible light irradiation ryberg et al 2018 as a photosensitizer ery can activate molecular oxygen and generate various bactericidal reactive oxygen species ros including 1o2 o 2 and oh which is driven by energy and electron transfer processes according to the photosensitization scheme cieplik et al 2018 photosensitized ery has an excellent inactivation towards gram positive bacteria g and viruses such as listeria monocytogenes silva et al 2018 staphylococcus aureus silva et al 2018 silva et al 2019 streptococcus mutans costa et al 2010 romão et al 2018 enterococcus faecalis borba et al 2017 silva et al 2018 and ms2 ryberg et al 2018 for example 99 9999 staphylococcus aureus was inactivated within 5 min by only 0 5 μm ery with a green light emitting diode silva et al 2019 and 99 99 ms2 was inactivated within 5 min by 5 μm ery ryberg et al 2018 other viruses including zika li et al 2018 dengue li et al 2018 and covid 19 bojadzic et al 2021 can also be effectively killed by ery even under dark conditions however compared with its excellent inactivation performance towards viruses and g the inactivation efficiency of gram negative bacteria g by photosensitized ery is rather low rossoni et al 2010 silva et al 2019 yassunaka et al 2015 no e coli cells were killed even when the concentration of ery was up to 50 μm rossoni et al 2010 and 100 μm ery was required to achieve 3 4 log e coli reduction after 30 min of green light irradiation yassunaka et al 2015 high concentrations 50 100 μm of ery are unsuitable for drinking water disinfection because they may not only increase the disinfection cost but also require more time to decompose therefore effective g inactivation with a low concentration of ery is a bottleneck of applying ery in drinking water disinfection the pk a values of the oh and cooh groups in ery are 3 79 and 2 35 respectively batistela et al 2011 which means that ery mainly exists as a dianion e2 in circumneutral ph 5 5 7 4 water the poor g inactivation of ery can likely be attributed to the electrostatic repulsion between the e2 and negatively charged g surfaces and the barrier function of the unique g outer membrane om dahl et al 1989 these two reasons cause inadequate contact of ery with g and weaken the lethality of the produced ros therefore enhancing the contact of ery with g and ros production is crucial to promote g inactivation bacellar et al 2018 li et al 2012 nagata et al 2012 protonation of e2 by simple ph adjustment may be promising to enhance ery cell contact and ros production simultaneously on the one hand protonation of the phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups in ery can reduce the electrostatic repulsion and increase hydrogen bonding between ery molecules and g on the other hand protonation is also expected to promote ros production by ery similar to some other photosensitizers dumas et al 2004 hirakawa et al 2020 mcdonnell et al 2005 radunz et al 2020 it is therefore hypothesized that protonation of e2 by simply lowering the water ph could enhance the g inactivation of photosensitized ery this work aimed to examine the feasibility of overcoming the poor g inactivation of photosensitized ery by simple protonation the relationship between water ph and the g inactivation rate constant k was established the adsorption and ros production modes of e2 and monoanionic ery he were distinguished the roles of various ros in the photoinactivation and photobleaching processes were demonstrated various environmental factors were examined to determine the optimum disinfection conditions of ery based disinfection the feasibility of using ery for effective e coli inactivation in sodis was also tested with authentic water matrices 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals ery was purchased from solarbio china humic acid ha was procured from adamas beta switzerland tert butyl alcohol tba and

experiments were performed in 50 ml of di water containing 2 5 mg l ery the solution ph was adjusted with 0 5 or glacial acetic acid and 0 05 or 2 m naoh for the commercial availability of acetic acid in daily life and the negligible effect of na on disinfection approximately 35 μl of 1 5 109 cfu ml cell suspension was added to the ery solution and the final bacterial concentration was 106 cfu ml the mixture was cultured for 15 min in the dark to achieve adsorption equilibrium before vl exposure a xenon lamp was used as the light source with a filter λ 420 nm and the light intensity was 200 mw

autoanalyzed by q analyzer software 2 3 ery adsorption experiment e coli 106 cfu ml and ery 2 5 mg l were mixed at different ph values under dark conditions for 15 min at 30 c the mixture was then centrifuged at 8000 g for 10 min the absorbance of the resultant supernatant a was measured at 526 nm using a spectrophotometer uv 2450 shimadzu japan there was no absorbance in the control group of e coli alone the absorbance of ery solution without e coli a0 was measured with the same operation the adsorption efficiency of ery on bacteria was calculated as a 0 a a 0 100 the zeta potential ζ of e coli cells at different solution ph values with or without ery was measured using a zetasizer nano zs malvern instruments u k 2 4 ros analysis the presence and amount of ros in the experimental solutions were analyzed with an electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectrometer emxplus bruker germany with the method detailed in supplementary text s1 to determine the roles of ros in photochemical processes excess ros quenchers including 30 mm ffa 25 mm tba and 10 mm tempol were added to quench 1o2 oh and o 2 respectively wang et al 2020 qin et al 2020 zeng et al 2020 the three quenchers are nontoxic at experimental concentrations as shown in supplementary fig s1 2 5 water sample collection and characterization samples including underground water uw surface water and tap water tw were

supplementary table s1 2 6 solar disinfection approximately 250 ml of the water samples containing 2 5 mg l ery with the ph adjusted to 5 0 were encapsulated in 550 ml polyethylene glycol terephthalate bottles nongfu spring china e coli cells were added 106 cfu ml and cultured in the dark for 15 min before exposure to sunlight on a grassland on the zijingang campus of zhejiang university the sunlight intensity during the experiment measured by an optical power meter pl mw2000 perfect light china was within 77 347 mw cm2 the initial solution temperature was 15 6 27 7 c after sunlight exposure for 40 min the ultimate solution temperature was 29 5 39 5 c aliquots of the reacted water samples were collected after severe shaking in the dark and spread on lb plates for bacterial colony counting as described in section 2 2 2 7 statistical analysis all experiments were repeated at least three times the results are expressed as means standard deviations statistical significance analyses were performed with one way analysis of variance anova along with tukey s test using origin 2017 normality and variance homogeneity were previously verified p 0 05 was considered statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 e coli inactivation by vl ery at different ph the solution ph remained nearly unchanged during the entire inactivation process as shown in fig s2a within ph 4 0 7 0 vl irradiation or ery treatment alone did not cause cell death fig s2b ph dependent bacterial inactivation was observed in the vl ery system fig 1 a at ph 7 0 only approximately 0 17 log bacteria were killed after 60 min which is consistent with previous studies silva et al 2019 yassunaka et al 2015 at ph 6 0 and 5 5 1 4 and 4 6 log cell losses were observed after 60 min respectively impressively at ph 5 0 6 0 log e coli were completely inactivated within 15 min and this inactivation time was dramatically decreased to 20 s at ph 4 0 even for a higher initial bacterial density 107 cfu ml only 30 s were needed to kill 99 99999 7 0 log of the e coli organic acid anions have been proven to complex metal ions in om increase cell membrane permeability and thus enhance photoinactivation ghate et al 2015 radical conversion can also happen with the addition of ch3coona in which ch2coo is generated as in eq 1 buxton et al 1988 in this work 0 22 7 μm acetate ac was introduced into the system by ph adjustment the effect of ac on disinfection is shown in fig s2c only when the ac concentration was up to 10 mm was an evident enhancement effect observed while 1000 μm or less ac had no significant effect therefore the solution ph rather than the introduced 0 22 7 μm ac accounted for the enhanced disinfection 1 c h 3 c o o o h c h 2 c o o h 2 o the bacterial inactivation curve by the vl ery system was well fitted with the first order kinetics model fig 1a at ph 7 0 the fitted inactivation rate constant k was 0 0037 min 1 while it sharply increased 10 5 20 5 105 and 4730 times reaching 0 0390 0 0760 0 3900 and 17 49 min 1 at ph 6 0 5 5 5 0 and 4 0 respectively within solution ph 5 0 7 0 k had a good linear relationship with ph r2 0 99 eq 2 and it increased approximately 10 times for each 1 unit ph decrease h increases 10 times fig 1b as the ph decreased from 5 0 to 4 0 k increased approximately 45 times this large enhancement could be caused by the generation of neutral ery molecules h2e at ph 4 0 as discussed later the increase in bacterial density 107 cfu ml did not markedly impact the inactivation kinetics as indicated by the comparable k 14 27 min 1 at ph 4 0 2 k 1 0 0 9757 p h 3 612 m i n 1 5 p h 7 live and dead cell staining experiments were carried out to examine cell survival and membrane integrity live cells with intact membranes were stained with syto9 green and dead cells were stained with propidium iodide pi red as shown in fig 1c at the beginning bacterial cells were almost stained green which indicates that they were alive after 20 min at ph 5 0 all the green cells turned red which means that they were all dead fig 1d in contrast at ph 7 0 even after 60 min irradiation approximately half of the bacteria remained alive half green and half red fig 1e sem observations exhibited similar trends as the staining experiment the cells were almost intact at the beginning fig 1f but severely damaged with unclear outlines after 20 min at ph 5 0 fig 1g however even after 60 min at ph 7 0 the cell morphology was nearly intact with a rough surface fig 1h these observations are well fitted with the results of spread plate experiments indicating that the damage to the cell wall at ph 7 0 was much weaker than that at ph 5 0 as displayed in fig 1i the bacterial g dna bands after different treatment times also showed a similar trend the brightened dna stripes were clear at the beginning and remained bright after 60 min at ph 7 0 but almost disappeared after 5 and 20 min at ph 5 0 the average concentration of g dna decreased dramatically in the first 10 s at ph 4 0 from 8134 pg μl to 3680 pg μl while it remained largely stable at ph 6 0 and 7 0 even after 60 min fig s3 at ph 5 0 the concentration of g dna suffered a relatively fast decrease in the first 15 min and a relatively slow decrease in the remaining 45 min this means that limited g dna damage occurred at ph 6 0 and 7 0 but was more severe at lower ph values 4 0 and 5 0 no low molecular weight stripes were observed in gel electrophoresis fig 1i which means no g dna breakage occurred this was further evidenced by capillary electrophoresis fig 1j k in which small dna fragments were not observed it has been reported that dna bands could be broken into small fragments in the so 4 dominated inactivation process wang et al 2019 xia et al 2017 this discrepancy can be explained by the different g dna attack modes of radicals and nonradical 1o2 as discussed later 3 2 enhanced ery adsorption on e coli at low ph to illustrate the mechanism of how h caused such an inactivation difference the adsorption of ery on e coli was first evaluated as shown in fig 2 a the adsorption efficiency dramatically increased when the ph was below 5 5 while at ph 5 5 6 0 or 7 0 there was no measurable adsorption of ery on bacteria indicating increased ery adsorption at low ph adsorption of electronegative ery on e coli would lead to a ζ decrease as shown in fig 2b at ph 7 0 or 6 0 the addition of ery had no significant effect on ζ of e coli while at ph 5 5 5 0 and 4 0 significantly lower ζ values were obtained the molecular structure of ery is shown in fig s4 it has four species at various ph values fig s5 i e e2 he h2e and cationic h3e h3e was not considered in our study because it only appears under extremely acidic conditions pk a 0 batistela et al 2011 h2e only existed at a significant concentration at ph 4 0 fig 2c while e2 and he were the main species at ph 5 0 7 0 compared with e2 the less electronegative he has phenolic hydroxyl groups and thus may form hydrogen bonds with the surface functional groups of bacteria more easily therefore he rather than e2 may account for the increased adsorption at low ph this deduction was confirmed by the same variation trends of he fig 2c and ery adsorption fig 2a with ph in addition the content of he correlated well with k fig 2d at ph 5 0 7 0 as shown in eq 3 although a slight deviation occurred at ph 4 0 this indicates that only he directly participated in e coli inactivation by adsorbing on bacteria in this case ros produced by adsorbed he were closer to e coli than those produced by nonadsorbed e2 and were thus conducive to attack om this distance dependent inactivation difference of ros has also been reported in modified nontronite bactericidal systems xia et al 2020 the positive deviation at ph 4 0 could be attributed to the generated h2e which was supposed to adsorb on the bacteria and kill them 3 k 1 0 0 9866 η 0 7240 m i n 1 5 p h 7 3 3 roles of ros in the photochemical processes 1o2 o 2 and oh were all detected at the investigated ph 4 0 7 0 in the vl ery system fig s6a c 1o2 had the highest production followed by oh and o 2 fig 3 a all ros increased with decreasing ph indicating that the protonation of phenolic hydroxyl groups improved the ros production of ery in previous studies the ros production of some photosensitizers containing hydroxyl and n atoms such as hypericin ehrenberg et al 1998 pyrp v tmpp hirakawa et al 2020 bf2 chelated azadipyrromethenes mcdonnell et al 2005 and dmatmpyp radunz et al 2020 was greatly enhanced by protonation at low ph while excited triplet photosensitizers as ros generators were quenched by photoinduced electron transfer pet at high ph values protonation of hydroxyl groups rather than the n atom likely leads to higher ros production and cell killing because numerous n containing photosensitizers such as methylene blue mb bonneau et al 1975 toluidine blue tbo pottier et al 1975 dmapv arnbjerg et al 2007 ce 6 kardumyan et al 2020 and phthalocyanine beeby et al 2001 ostler et al 2000 exhibit decreased ros production with decreasing ph and the bacterial inactivation performance of mb decreases as the ph decreases from 8 6 8 9 to 7 1 7 6 acher et al 1990 similar to ery hydroxyl containing bodipy and rose bengal also showed a better cell killing performance at a lower ph radunz et al 2020 schäfer et al 2000 it is also notable that reactive red 4 another type of anionic photosensitizer has shown better adsorption on corynebacterium biomass at a lower ph won et al 2005 therefore through enhanced adsorption and ros production protonation may be a universal strategy for hydroxyl containing anionic photosensitizers to improve g inactivation although nonradical 1o2 is often discussed the roles of radicals in ery photochemical processes have usually been ignored in previous studies ishiyama et al 2012 karlsson et al 2017 schäfer et al 2000 ph 5 0 rather than 4 0 was chosen to perform the quenching experiments due to the moderate and measurable disinfection kinetics under this ph condition the solution ph remained nearly unchanged in the tempol and tba quenching systems and decreased slightly in the ffa quenching system from 5 0 to 4 6 a remarkable inhibitory effect was observed by adding ffa or tempol while tba had no effect fig 3b this indicates that 1o2 and o 2 were the main ros involved in inactivation while oh played no role because the 1o2 production rate is proportional to the transient concentration of the photosensitizer arakane et al 1996 and the concentration of ery the photosensitizer in this study at different times is proportional to the integration area under the photobleaching curve of ery fig s7 the integration area can be proportional to the 1o2 production as shown in fig s7 the areas under the photobleaching curves between 0 and 15 min with and without tempol were integrated using origin 2017 to be 15 labelled a1 the green and red shadow area and 8 52 labelled a2 the green shadow area respectively therefore the 1o2 production in the vl ery system with tempol was 1 76 a 1 a 2 times that without tempol since 1o2 and o 2 contributed to 100 6 0 log reduction inactivation within 15 min in the vl ery system without tempol 1o2 could contribute to 99 98 3 8 log reduction inactivation of e coli after the quenching of o 2 by the addition of tempol taking the contributions of 1o2 and o 2 to bacterial inactivation in the vl ery system without adding tempol as n1 and n2 respectively we can obtain 1 76 n1 99 98 and thus n1 56 8 and n2 43 2 therefore the contributions of 1o2 and o 2 were 56 8 and 43 2 respectively the 1o2 produced by o 2 and oh as in eqs 4 5 nosaka and nosaka 2017 is ignored here because it is negligible compared to the 1o2 production of ery 4 o 2 h o 2 h 1 o 2 h 2 o 2 5 o 2 o h 1 o 2 o h 1o2 is a bactericidal ros that can cause lipid peroxidation di mascio et al 2019 and protein crosslinking alarcon et al 2017 the high contribution of 1o2 can be attributed to its relatively long lifetime 3 5 4 0 μs francis et al 1995 kha et al 2020 lindig and rodgers 1979 diffusion distance 100 220 nm di mascio et al 2019 francis et al 1995 redmond and kochevar 2006 and largest production in the vl ery system fig 3a unlike radicals such as oh which is known to cause dna breakage xiao et al 2019 1o2 adds to the c c bonds of dna but does not break the dna chain lafleur et al 1987 nieuwint et al 1985 piette et al 1981 which may explain the absence of g dna fragments in fig 1 i k like 1o2 o 2 also has a relatively long lifetime 0 1 1 ms dichmann et al 2021 although o 2 cannot react with most biological molecules including dna collin 2019 it can be protonated and thus form highly reactive h o 2 pk a 4 8 bielski et al 1985 causing lipid peroxidation aikens and dix 1991 and cell death oh has a very short half life period 1 ns jomova and valko 2011 and diffusion radius 3 nm ali et al 2020 which may have made it impossible to attack om and kill bacteria in this study as shown in fig 3c the addition of tempol completely inhibits photobleaching while ffa and tba fail to inhibit photobleaching which means that o 2 is exclusively responsible for ery photobleaching at ph 5 0 instead of 1o2 as reported karlsson et al 2017 o 2 is highly reactive to halogenated aromatics hayyan et al 2017 men et al 2016 and can replace the halogen atoms in the aromatic ring by nucleophilic replacement hayyan et al 2017 the halogenated aromatic structures of ery may account for the photobleaching effect of o 2 3 4 the effects of environmental factors on inactivation efficiency to determine the best conditions for ery based disinfection the effect of environmental factors on the vl ery system was tested as shown in fig 4 a a higher concentration 5 mg l of ery at ph 5 0 did not show a better inactivation performance which can be explained by the saturated adsorption of he at 2 5 mg l when the concentration decreased from 2 5 to 1 mg l 1 99 log cell loss occurred within 30 min which may be attributed to the decreased amount of adsorbed he on e coli considering both cost and effectiveness comprehensively the optimized ery concentration for inactivation of 106 cfu ml e coli at ph 5 0 was 2 5 mg l as shown in fig 4b c a light intensity below than 200 mw cm2 or a temperature above 30 c in the vl ery system exhibits good inactivation which can be easily achieved in sodis the inhibition of bacterial inactivation at 300 mw cm2 could be caused by the fast photobleaching of ery which was unfavorable to the ros yield karlsson et al 2017 while the higher temperature could lead to higher ros production and thus facilitate inactivation karlsson et al 2017 n2 purging slightly inhibited the inactivation process fig 4d suggesting that no aeration was needed in ery based disinfection the effect of ha on inactivation is displayed in fig 4e as the concentration of ha increased from 0 to 2 5 mg l there was only a small inactivation inhibition with the adequate disinfection time delayed from 15 to 25 min when the concentration of ha increased to 5 20 mg l severe inactivation inhibition was observed with only 1 6 1 9 log cell loss within 30 min natural organic matter nom was reported to have a very weak quenching effect on 1o2 even at a concentration up to 25 mg l brame et al 2014 similarly as the major component of nom ha 50 mg l exhibited nearly no effect on the quenching of 1o2 zhang et al 2021 however the quinone moieties in ha may be a good trap for o 2 kouras hadef et al 2012 which is a major ros in bacterial inactivation as discussed in section 3 3 in addition ha has a strong light absorptivity kohantorabi et al 2019 and may thus cause a shading effect as evidenced by the color change during the experiment with high concentrations of ha 5 20 mg l fig s11 the quenching of o 2 and the shading effect could account for the inactivation inhibition of ha therefore ery based disinfection is more suitable for water matrices with relatively low nom contents the addition of salts including na2so4 nacl cacl2 and mgcl2 10 mm slowed disinfection fig 4f which could be attributed to the higher tolerance of e coli to external oxidative pressure when there were salts maintaining osmotic pressure li et al 2011 the presence of nahco3 accelerated inactivation in the vl ery system nahco3 shows double effects in different inactivation systems slowing inactivation bianco et al 2017 wang et al 2019 xia et al 2017 or accelerating inactivation rommozzi et al 2020 in the vl ery system hco 4 has been proven to accelerate the degradation of organic compounds richardson et al 2000 which can be generated by h2o2 produced by the disproportionation of o 2 hayyan et al 2017 and nahco3 as in eq 6 considering the low salinity and complex salt composition in surface water the salts may not significantly influence the inactivation efficiency 6 h c o 3 h 2 o 2 h c o 4 h 2 o 3 5 solar disinfection under authentic sceneries enhanced e coli inactivation of photosensitized ery in weakly acidic water indicates that people in poor rural areas can use household table vinegar and cheap food coloring to acquire safe drinking water under sunlight by using ery enhanced sodis to test the feasibility of using ery based sodis for bacterial inactivation authentic application experiments were carried out outdoors according to the international bottled water association the suggested ph of bottled water is between 5 0 and 7 0 international bottled water association 2020 therefore ph 5 0 was chosen here for application after disinfection people can drink the water directly without further ph adjustment all five types of water samples have a low organic matter content 1 46 6 41 mg c l and uw has the highest salinity table s1 as displayed in fig 5 a solar irradiation alone causes only 0 5 log cell loss in ql within 60 min while despite sunny or partly cloudy weather adequate disinfection was achieved 6 0 log within 30 min for all tested water samples with 2 5 mg l ery at ph 5 0 the maximum absorbance wavelength of ery 526 nm fig s12 was within the range of green light which has a good cloud penetration ability this may explain the effective inactivation of ery under partly cloudy weather after disinfection photobleaching finished simultaneously fig 5a which can be used as an indicator of adequate disinfection 3 6 comparison of ery based disinfection with other disinfection techniques chlorination fenton and fenton like persulfate based disinfection technologies were selected for comparison with photosensitized ery based disinfection in di water fig 5b collected data from other works are summarized in table s2 photosensitized ery based disinfection with low cost and good performance seems to be more promising than fenton and fenton like disinfection although ery 15 kg is more expensive than persulfate 0 74 kg or h2o2 1 5 kg wacławek et al 2017 the working concentration of ery 2 5 mg l is much lower than that of persulfate 120 476 mg l or h2o2 10 340 mg l table s2 the chemical cost of ery based disinfection is estimated to be 5 6 8 7 100 t drinking water which is cheaper than the 8 81 35 24 100 t drinking water of persulfate based disinfection and cheaper comparable with the 1 53 51 100 t drinking water of h2o2 moreover the k of ery based disinfection is 17 49 min 1 at ph 4 0 much faster than the 0 033 0 6 min 1 of persulfate based disinfection and the 0 033 0 91 min 1 of fenton or fenton like disinfection 4 conclusions high effective e coli inactivation by the vl ery system was achieved with simple ph adjustment the k of e coli inactivation by photosensitized ery had a linear relationship with solution ph in the range of 5 0 7 0 for every 1 unit drop in ph k went up 10 times with the decrease in ph from 7 0 to 4 0 k increased up to 4730 times severe damage to the cell wall and g dna occurred at low ph at ph 5 0 or lower the formed he was conducive to adsorption on the e coli surface and had a higher ros yield than e2 at high ph thus playing a major role in bacterial inactivation at ph 5 0 the inactivation contributions of 1o2 and o 2 produced by photosensitized ery were 56 8 and 43 2 respectively the photobleaching of ery was caused by o 2 but not 1o2 oh played no role in either ery photobleaching or bacterial inactivation ha and salts na2so4 nacl cacl2 and mgcl2 can inhibit the inactivation of the vl ery system while nahco3 showed an acceleration effect ery based sodis exhibited good adaptability to water matrices and weather sunny or partly cloudy with 99 9999 e coli inactivated within 30 min the novel finding of effective g inactivation by photosensitized ery in weakly acidic water can help to promote the application of ery in water disinfection especially for sodis in poor rural areas however the toxicity of potential photobleaching products should be carefully evaluated before large scale applications because of the different buffering capacities of various water matrices ensuring the appropriate acid addition is worth considering although excellent disinfection performance was achieved in the five tested water matrices with relatively low toc contents the applicability and generalizability for various water matrices need to be further examined especially for water matrices with high toc contents ph dependent inactivation may also be applicable for other hydroxyl containing anionic photosensitizers and finding a cheaper safer better adaptability to water matrices and more natural photosensitizer will help to improve photosensitizer enhanced sodis which can be a research

16280,cost effective disinfection technology is urgently needed in poor rural areas erythrosine ery based solar disinfection sodis provides a promising solution because of its effective inactivation of viruses and gram positive bacteria at low cost however the poor gram negative bacteria g e g escherichia coli inactivation of photosensitized ery inhibits its application herein for the first time the protonation of ery was found to greatly enhance its g inactivation and 99 99999 7 0 log of e coli were completely inactivated within only 30 s using 2 5 mg l ery under 200 mw cm2 visible light irradiation the inactivation rate constant k reached 17 5 min 1 at ph 4 0 which was 4730 times higher than that at ph 7 0 at a lower ph more severe cell wall and genomic dna damage was observed a linear correlation between k and monoanionic ery he content was obtained indicating that he rather than dianionic ery e2 participated in the inactivation at ph 5 0 7 0 which was further explained by the higher production of reactive oxygen species and bacterial adsorption of he than e2 both 1o2 and o 2 dominated bacterial inactivation contributing 56 8 and 43 2 respectively o 2 but not 1o2 caused ery photobleaching oh was not involved in either inactivation or photobleaching humic acid and salts nacl na2so4 cacl2 and mgcl2 slightly inhibited inactivation while nahco3 accelerated inactivation complete inactivation 99 9999 of e coli was achieved within 30 min at ph 5 0 in ery based sodis with good adaptation to various water matrices and weather sunny or partly cloudy this work will help to promote the application of ery based disinfection especially for sodis in poor rural areas graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords solar disinfection erythrosine protonation bacterial inactivation radicals 1 introduction because of poverty and shortages of facilities as of 2015 800 million people around the world lacked basic drinking water services world health organization 2017 developing solar disinfection sodis will help to improve drinking water security chu et al 2019 the biggest problem with sodis is the low efficiency towards bacteria and viruses fisher et al 2012 erythrosine ery a food and drug administration fda permitted food coloring with a cheap price 15 kg has great potential to be used as a new cheap water disinfector in sodis because it can kill many pathogens at low concentrations and decompose after disinfection under visible light irradiation ryberg et al 2018 as a photosensitizer ery can activate molecular oxygen and generate various bactericidal reactive oxygen species ros including 1o2 o 2 and oh which is driven by energy and electron transfer processes according to the photosensitization scheme cieplik et al 2018 photosensitized ery has an excellent inactivation towards gram positive bacteria g and viruses such as listeria monocytogenes silva et al 2018 staphylococcus aureus silva et al 2018 silva et al 2019 streptococcus mutans costa et al 2010 romão et al 2018 enterococcus faecalis borba et al 2017 silva et al 2018 and ms2 ryberg et al 2018 for example 99 9999 staphylococcus aureus was inactivated within 5 min by only 0 5 μm ery with a green light emitting diode silva et al 2019 and 99 99 ms2 was inactivated within 5 min by 5 μm ery ryberg et al 2018 other viruses including zika li et al 2018 dengue li et al 2018 and covid 19 bojadzic et al 2021 can also be effectively killed by ery even under dark conditions however compared with its excellent inactivation performance towards viruses and g the inactivation efficiency of gram negative bacteria g by photosensitized ery is rather low rossoni et al 2010 silva et al 2019 yassunaka et al 2015 no e coli cells were killed even when the concentration of ery was up to 50 μm rossoni et al 2010 and 100 μm ery was required to achieve 3 4 log e coli reduction after 30 min of green light irradiation yassunaka et al 2015 high concentrations 50 100 μm of ery are unsuitable for drinking water disinfection because they may not only increase the disinfection cost but also require more time to decompose therefore effective g inactivation with a low concentration of ery is a bottleneck of applying ery in drinking water disinfection the pk a values of the oh and cooh groups in ery are 3 79 and 2 35 respectively batistela et al 2011 which means that ery mainly exists as a dianion e2 in circumneutral ph 5 5 7 4 water the poor g inactivation of ery can likely be attributed to the electrostatic repulsion between the e2 and negatively charged g surfaces and the barrier function of the unique g outer membrane om dahl et al 1989 these two reasons cause inadequate contact of ery with g and weaken the lethality of the produced ros therefore enhancing the contact of ery with g and ros production is crucial to promote g inactivation bacellar et al 2018 li et al 2012 nagata et al 2012 protonation of e2 by simple ph adjustment may be promising to enhance ery cell contact and ros production simultaneously on the one hand protonation of the phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups in ery can reduce the electrostatic repulsion and increase hydrogen bonding between ery molecules and g on the other hand protonation is also expected to promote ros production by ery similar to some other photosensitizers dumas et al 2004 hirakawa et al 2020 mcdonnell et al 2005 radunz et al 2020 it is therefore hypothesized that protonation of e2 by simply lowering the water ph could enhance the g inactivation of photosensitized ery this work aimed to examine the feasibility of overcoming the poor g inactivation of photosensitized ery by simple protonation the relationship between water ph and the g inactivation rate constant k was established the adsorption and ros production modes of e2 and monoanionic ery he were distinguished the roles of various ros in the photoinactivation and photobleaching processes were demonstrated various environmental factors were examined to determine the optimum disinfection conditions of ery based disinfection the feasibility of using ery for effective e coli inactivation in sodis was also tested with authentic water matrices 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals ery was purchased from solarbio china humic acid ha was procured from adamas beta switzerland tert butyl alcohol tba and

experiments were performed in 50 ml of di water containing 2 5 mg l ery the solution ph was adjusted with 0 5 or glacial acetic acid and 0 05 or 2 m naoh for the commercial availability of acetic acid in daily life and the negligible effect of na on disinfection approximately 35 μl of 1 5 109 cfu ml cell suspension was added to the ery solution and the final bacterial concentration was 106 cfu ml the mixture was cultured for 15 min in the dark to achieve adsorption equilibrium before vl exposure a xenon lamp was used as the light source with a filter λ 420 nm and the light intensity was 200 mw

solutions were analyzed with an electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectrometer emxplus bruker germany with the method detailed in supplementary text s1 to determine the roles of ros in photochemical processes excess ros quenchers including 30 mm ffa 25 mm tba and 10 mm tempol were added to quench 1o2 oh and o 2 respectively wang et al 2020 qin et al 2020 zeng et al 2020 the three quenchers are

terephthalate bottles nongfu spring china e coli cells were added 106 cfu ml and cultured in the dark for 15 min before exposure to sunlight on a grassland on the zijingang campus of zhejiang

bacterial colony counting as described in section 2 2 2 7 statistical analysis all experiments were repeated at least three times the results are expressed as means standard deviations statistical significance analyses were performed with one way analysis of variance anova along with tukey s test using origin 2017 normality and variance homogeneity were previously verified p 0 05 was considered statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 e coli inactivation by vl ery at different ph the solution ph remained nearly unchanged during the entire inactivation process as shown in fig s2a within ph 4 0 7 0 vl irradiation or ery treatment alone did not cause cell death fig s2b ph dependent bacterial inactivation was observed in the vl ery system fig 1 a at ph 7 0 only approximately 0 17 log bacteria were killed after 60 min which is consistent with previous studies silva et al 2019 yassunaka et al 2015 at ph 6 0 and 5 5 1 4 and 4 6 log cell losses were observed after 60 min respectively impressively at ph 5 0 6 0 log e coli were completely inactivated within 15 min and this inactivation time was dramatically decreased to 20 s at ph 4 0 even for a higher initial bacterial density 107 cfu ml only 30 s were needed to kill 99 99999 7 0 log of the e coli organic acid anions have been proven to complex metal ions in om increase cell membrane permeability and thus enhance photoinactivation ghate et al 2015 radical conversion can also happen with the addition of ch3coona in which ch2coo is generated as in eq 1 buxton et al 1988 in this work 0 22 7 μm acetate ac was introduced into the system by ph adjustment the effect of ac on disinfection is shown in fig s2c only when the ac concentration was up to 10 mm was an evident enhancement effect observed while 1000 μm or less ac had no significant effect therefore the solution ph rather than the introduced 0 22 7 μm ac accounted for the enhanced disinfection 1 c h 3 c o o o h c h 2 c o o h 2 o the bacterial inactivation curve by the vl ery system was well fitted with the first order kinetics model fig 1a at ph 7 0 the fitted inactivation rate constant k was 0 0037 min 1 while it sharply increased 10 5 20 5 105 and 4730 times reaching 0 0390 0 0760 0 3900 and 17 49 min 1 at ph 6 0 5 5 5 0 and 4 0 respectively within solution ph 5 0 7 0 k had a good linear relationship with ph r2 0 99 eq 2 and it increased approximately 10 times for each 1 unit ph decrease h increases 10 times fig 1b as the ph decreased from 5 0 to 4 0 k increased approximately 45 times this large enhancement could be caused by the generation of neutral ery molecules h2e at ph 4 0 as discussed later the increase in bacterial density 107 cfu ml did not markedly impact the inactivation kinetics as indicated by the comparable k 14 27 min 1 at ph 4 0 2 k 1 0 0 9757 p h 3 612 m i n 1 5 p h 7 live and dead cell staining experiments were carried out to examine cell survival and membrane integrity live cells with intact membranes were stained with syto9 green and dead cells were stained with propidium iodide pi red as shown in fig 1c at the beginning bacterial cells were almost stained green which indicates that they were alive after 20 min at ph 5 0 all the green cells turned red which means that they were all dead fig 1d in contrast at ph 7 0 even after 60 min irradiation approximately half of the bacteria remained alive half green and half red fig 1e sem observations exhibited similar trends as the staining experiment the cells were almost intact at the beginning fig 1f but severely damaged with unclear outlines after 20 min at ph 5 0 fig 1g however even after 60 min at ph 7 0 the cell morphology was nearly intact with a rough surface fig 1h these observations are well fitted with the results of spread plate experiments indicating that the damage to the cell wall at ph 7 0 was much weaker than that at ph 5 0 as displayed in fig 1i the bacterial g dna bands after different treatment times also showed a similar trend the brightened dna stripes were clear at the beginning and remained bright after 60 min at ph 7 0 but almost disappeared after 5 and 20 min at ph 5 0 the average concentration of g dna decreased dramatically in the first 10 s at ph 4 0 from 8134 pg μl to 3680 pg μl while it remained largely stable at ph 6 0 and 7 0 even after 60 min fig s3 at ph 5 0 the concentration of g dna suffered a relatively fast decrease in the first 15 min and a relatively slow decrease in the remaining 45 min this means that limited g dna damage occurred at ph 6 0 and 7 0 but was more severe at lower ph values 4 0 and 5 0 no low molecular weight stripes were observed in gel electrophoresis fig 1i which means no g dna breakage occurred this was further evidenced by capillary electrophoresis fig 1j k in which small dna fragments were not observed it has been reported that dna bands could be broken into small fragments in the so 4 dominated inactivation process wang et al 2019 xia et al 2017 this discrepancy can be explained by the different g dna attack modes of radicals and nonradical 1o2 as discussed later 3 2 enhanced ery adsorption on e coli at low ph to illustrate the mechanism of how h caused such an inactivation difference the adsorption of ery on e coli was first evaluated as shown in fig 2 a the adsorption efficiency dramatically increased when the ph was below 5 5 while at ph 5 5 6 0 or 7 0 there was no measurable adsorption of ery on bacteria indicating increased ery adsorption at low ph adsorption of electronegative ery on e coli would lead to a ζ decrease as shown in fig 2b at ph 7 0 or 6 0 the addition of ery had no significant effect on ζ of e coli while at ph 5 5 5 0 and 4 0 significantly lower ζ values were obtained the molecular structure of ery is shown in fig s4 it has four species at various ph values fig s5 i e e2 he h2e and cationic h3e h3e was not considered in our study because it only appears under extremely acidic conditions pk a 0 batistela et al 2011 h2e only existed at a significant concentration at ph 4 0 fig 2c while e2 and he were the main species at ph 5 0 7 0 compared with e2 the less electronegative he has phenolic hydroxyl groups and thus may form hydrogen bonds with the surface functional groups of bacteria more easily therefore he rather than e2 may account for the increased adsorption at low ph this deduction was confirmed by the same variation trends of he fig 2c and ery adsorption fig 2a with ph in addition the content of he correlated well with k fig 2d at ph 5 0 7 0 as shown in eq 3 although a slight deviation occurred at ph 4 0 this indicates that only he directly participated in e coli inactivation by adsorbing on bacteria in this case ros produced by adsorbed he were closer to e coli than those produced by nonadsorbed e2 and were thus conducive to attack om this distance dependent inactivation difference of ros has also been reported in modified nontronite bactericidal systems xia et al 2020 the positive deviation at ph 4 0 could be attributed to the generated h2e which was supposed to adsorb on the bacteria and kill them 3 k 1 0 0 9866 η 0 7240 m i n 1 5 p h 7 3 3 roles of ros in the photochemical processes 1o2 o 2 and oh were all detected at the investigated ph 4 0 7 0 in the vl ery system fig s6a c 1o2 had the highest production followed by oh and o 2 fig 3 a all ros increased with decreasing ph indicating that the protonation of phenolic hydroxyl groups improved the ros production of ery in previous studies the ros production of some photosensitizers containing hydroxyl and n atoms such as hypericin ehrenberg et al 1998 pyrp v tmpp hirakawa et al 2020 bf2 chelated azadipyrromethenes mcdonnell et al 2005 and dmatmpyp radunz et al 2020 was greatly enhanced by protonation at low ph while excited triplet photosensitizers as ros generators were quenched by photoinduced electron transfer pet at high ph values protonation of hydroxyl groups rather than the n atom likely leads to higher ros production and cell killing because numerous n containing photosensitizers such as methylene blue mb bonneau et al 1975 toluidine blue tbo pottier et al 1975 dmapv arnbjerg et al 2007 ce 6 kardumyan et al 2020 and phthalocyanine beeby et al 2001 ostler et al 2000 exhibit decreased ros production with decreasing ph and the bacterial inactivation performance of mb decreases as the ph decreases from 8 6 8 9 to 7 1 7 6 acher et al 1990 similar to ery hydroxyl containing bodipy and rose bengal also showed a better cell killing performance at a lower ph radunz et al 2020 schäfer et al 2000 it is also notable that reactive red 4 another type of anionic photosensitizer has shown better adsorption on corynebacterium biomass at a lower ph won et al 2005 therefore through enhanced adsorption and ros production protonation may be a universal strategy for hydroxyl containing anionic photosensitizers to improve g inactivation although nonradical 1o2 is often discussed the roles of radicals in ery photochemical processes have usually been ignored in previous studies ishiyama et al 2012 karlsson et al 2017 schäfer et al 2000 ph 5 0 rather than 4 0 was chosen to perform the quenching experiments due to the moderate and measurable disinfection kinetics under this ph condition the solution ph remained nearly unchanged in the tempol and tba quenching systems and decreased slightly in the ffa quenching system from 5 0 to 4 6 a remarkable inhibitory effect was observed by adding ffa or tempol while tba had no effect fig 3b this indicates that 1o2 and o 2 were the main ros involved in inactivation while oh played no role because the 1o2 production rate is proportional to the transient concentration of the photosensitizer arakane et al 1996 and the concentration of ery the photosensitizer in this study at different times is proportional to the integration area under the photobleaching curve of ery fig s7 the integration area can be proportional to the 1o2 production as shown in fig s7 the areas under the photobleaching curves between 0 and 15 min with and without tempol were integrated using origin 2017 to be 15 labelled a1 the green and red shadow area and 8 52 labelled a2 the green shadow area respectively therefore the 1o2 production in the vl ery system with tempol was 1 76 a 1 a 2 times that without tempol since 1o2 and o 2 contributed to 100 6 0 log reduction inactivation within 15 min in the vl ery system without tempol 1o2 could contribute to 99 98 3 8 log reduction inactivation of e coli after the quenching of o 2 by the addition of tempol taking the contributions of 1o2 and o 2 to bacterial inactivation in the vl ery system without adding tempol as n1 and n2 respectively we can obtain 1 76 n1 99 98 and thus n1 56 8 and n2 43 2 therefore the contributions of 1o2 and o 2 were 56 8 and 43 2 respectively the 1o2 produced by o 2 and oh as in eqs 4 5 nosaka and nosaka 2017 is ignored here because it is negligible compared to the 1o2 production of ery 4 o 2 h o 2 h 1 o 2 h 2 o 2 5 o 2 o h 1 o 2 o h 1o2 is a bactericidal ros that can cause lipid peroxidation di mascio et al 2019 and protein crosslinking alarcon et al 2017 the high contribution of 1o2 can be attributed to its relatively long lifetime 3 5 4 0 μs francis et al 1995 kha et al 2020 lindig and rodgers 1979 diffusion distance 100 220 nm di mascio et al 2019 francis et al 1995 redmond and kochevar 2006 and largest production in the vl ery system fig 3a unlike radicals such as oh which is known to cause dna breakage xiao et al 2019 1o2 adds to the c c bonds of dna but does not break the dna chain lafleur et al 1987 nieuwint et al 1985 piette et al 1981 which may explain the absence of g dna fragments in fig 1 i k like 1o2 o 2 also has a relatively long lifetime 0 1 1 ms dichmann et al 2021 although o 2 cannot react with most biological molecules including dna collin 2019 it can be protonated and thus form highly reactive h o 2 pk a 4 8 bielski et al 1985 causing lipid peroxidation aikens and dix 1991 and cell death oh has a very short half life period 1 ns jomova and valko 2011 and diffusion radius 3 nm ali et al 2020 which may have made it impossible to attack om and kill bacteria in this study as shown in fig 3c the addition of tempol completely inhibits photobleaching while ffa and tba fail to inhibit photobleaching which means that o 2 is exclusively responsible for ery photobleaching at ph 5 0 instead of 1o2 as reported karlsson et al 2017 o 2 is highly reactive to halogenated aromatics hayyan et al 2017 men et al 2016 and can replace the halogen atoms in the aromatic ring by nucleophilic replacement hayyan et al 2017 the halogenated aromatic structures of ery may account for the photobleaching effect of o 2 3 4 the effects of environmental factors on inactivation efficiency to determine the best conditions for ery based disinfection the effect of environmental factors on the vl ery system was tested as shown in fig 4 a a higher concentration 5 mg l of ery at ph 5 0 did not show a better inactivation performance which can be explained by the saturated adsorption of he at 2 5 mg l when the concentration decreased from 2 5 to 1 mg l 1 99 log cell loss occurred within 30 min which may be attributed to the decreased amount of adsorbed he on e coli considering both cost and effectiveness comprehensively the optimized ery concentration for inactivation of 106 cfu ml e coli at ph 5 0 was 2 5 mg l as shown in fig 4b c a light intensity below than 200 mw cm2 or a temperature above 30 c in the vl ery system exhibits good inactivation which can be easily achieved in sodis the inhibition of bacterial inactivation at 300 mw cm2 could be caused by the fast photobleaching of ery which was unfavorable to the ros yield karlsson et al 2017 while the higher temperature could lead to higher ros production and thus facilitate inactivation karlsson et al 2017 n2 purging slightly inhibited the inactivation process fig 4d suggesting that no aeration was needed in ery based disinfection the effect of ha on inactivation is displayed in fig 4e as the concentration of ha increased from 0 to 2 5 mg l there was only a small inactivation inhibition with the adequate disinfection time delayed from 15 to 25 min when the concentration of ha increased to 5 20 mg l severe inactivation inhibition was observed with only 1 6 1 9 log cell loss within 30 min natural organic matter nom was reported to have a very weak quenching effect on 1o2 even at a concentration up to 25 mg l brame et al 2014 similarly as the major component of nom ha 50 mg l exhibited nearly no effect on the quenching of 1o2 zhang et al 2021 however the quinone moieties in ha may be a good trap for o 2 kouras hadef et al 2012 which is a major ros in bacterial inactivation as discussed in section 3 3 in addition ha has a strong light absorptivity kohantorabi et al 2019 and may thus cause a shading effect as evidenced by the color change during the experiment with high concentrations of ha 5 20 mg l fig s11 the quenching of o 2 and the shading effect could account for the inactivation inhibition of ha therefore ery based disinfection is more suitable for water matrices with relatively low nom contents the addition of salts including na2so4 nacl cacl2 and mgcl2 10 mm slowed disinfection fig 4f which could be attributed to the higher tolerance of e coli to external oxidative pressure when there were salts maintaining osmotic pressure li et al 2011 the presence of nahco3 accelerated inactivation in the vl ery system nahco3 shows double effects in different inactivation systems slowing inactivation bianco et al 2017 wang et al 2019 xia et al 2017 or accelerating inactivation rommozzi et al 2020 in the vl ery system hco 4 has been proven to accelerate the degradation of organic compounds richardson et al 2000 which can be generated by h2o2 produced by the disproportionation of o 2 hayyan et al 2017 and nahco3 as in eq 6 considering the low salinity and complex salt composition in surface water the salts may not significantly influence the inactivation efficiency 6 h c o 3 h 2 o 2 h c o 4 h 2 o 3 5 solar disinfection under authentic sceneries enhanced e coli inactivation of photosensitized ery in weakly acidic water indicates that people in poor rural areas can use household table vinegar and cheap food coloring to acquire safe drinking water under sunlight by using ery enhanced sodis to test the feasibility of using ery based sodis for bacterial inactivation authentic application experiments were carried out outdoors according to the international bottled water association the suggested ph of bottled water is between 5 0 and 7 0 international bottled water association 2020 therefore ph 5 0 was chosen here for application after disinfection people can drink the water directly without further ph adjustment all five types of water samples have a low organic matter content 1 46 6 41 mg c l and uw has the highest salinity table s1 as displayed in fig 5 a solar irradiation alone causes only 0 5 log cell loss in ql within 60 min while despite sunny or partly cloudy weather adequate disinfection was achieved 6 0 log within 30 min for all tested water samples with 2 5 mg l ery at ph 5 0 the maximum absorbance wavelength of ery 526 nm fig s12 was within the range of green light which has a good cloud penetration ability this may explain the effective inactivation of ery under partly cloudy weather after disinfection photobleaching finished simultaneously fig 5a which can be used as an indicator of adequate disinfection 3 6 comparison of ery based disinfection with other disinfection techniques chlorination fenton and fenton like persulfate based disinfection technologies were selected for comparison with photosensitized ery based disinfection in di water fig 5b collected data from other works are summarized in table s2 photosensitized ery based disinfection with low cost and good performance seems to be more promising than fenton and fenton like disinfection although ery 15 kg is more expensive than persulfate 0 74 kg or h2o2 1 5 kg wacławek et al 2017 the working concentration of ery 2 5 mg l is much lower than that of persulfate 120 476 mg l or h2o2 10 340 mg l table s2 the chemical cost of ery based disinfection is estimated to be 5 6 8 7 100 t drinking water which is cheaper than the 8 81 35 24 100 t drinking water of persulfate based disinfection and cheaper comparable with the 1 53 51 100 t drinking water of h2o2 moreover the k of ery based disinfection is 17 49 min 1 at ph 4 0 much faster than the 0 033 0 6 min 1 of persulfate based disinfection and the 0 033 0 91 min 1 of fenton or fenton like disinfection 4 conclusions high effective e coli inactivation by the vl ery system was achieved with simple ph adjustment the k of e coli inactivation by photosensitized ery had a linear relationship with solution ph in the range of 5 0 7 0 for every 1 unit drop in ph k went up 10 times with the decrease in ph from 7 0 to 4 0 k increased up to 4730 times severe damage to the cell wall and g dna occurred at low ph at ph 5 0 or lower the formed he was conducive to adsorption on the e coli surface and had a higher ros yield than e2 at high ph thus playing a major role in bacterial inactivation at ph 5 0 the inactivation contributions of 1o2 and o 2 produced by photosensitized ery were 56 8 and 43 2 respectively the photobleaching of ery was caused by o 2 but not 1o2 oh played no role in either ery photobleaching or bacterial inactivation ha and salts na2so4 nacl cacl2 and mgcl2 can inhibit the inactivation of the vl ery system while nahco3 showed an acceleration effect ery based sodis exhibited good adaptability to water matrices and weather sunny or partly cloudy with 99 9999 e coli inactivated within 30 min the novel finding of effective g inactivation by photosensitized ery in weakly acidic water can help to promote the application of ery in water disinfection especially for sodis in poor rural areas however the toxicity of potential photobleaching products should be carefully evaluated before large scale applications because of the different buffering capacities of various water matrices ensuring the appropriate acid addition is worth considering although excellent disinfection performance was achieved in the five tested water matrices with relatively low toc contents the applicability and generalizability for various water matrices need to be further examined especially for water matrices with high toc contents ph dependent inactivation may also be applicable for other hydroxyl containing anionic photosensitizers and finding a cheaper safer better adaptability to water matrices and more natural photosensitizer will help to improve photosensitizer enhanced sodis which can be a research

16281,different physicochemical properties between cr vi and phenolic compounds pose serious challenges for the effective treatment of co contamination this study developed an electrodeless high flow microwave atmospheric plasma jet for the single step simultaneous degradation of p nitrophenol pnp and reduction of cr vi following a 15 min treatment with microwave atmospheric pressure plasma the removal efficiency of cr vi and pnp reached 97 5 and 93 6 respectively whereas that of total organic carbon reached 30 2 adding pnp to the solution significantly improved cr vi reduction whereas pnp degradation increased slightly with cr vi the results indicate that the pnp intermediates significantly affected cr vi reduction additionally long lived h2o2 and short lived h aided the reduction of cr vi during plasma treatment the addition of hydroxyl scavengers during treatment implied that o h was largely responsible for pnp oxidation high performance liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy hplc ms revealed that pnp intermediates including p nitrocatechol and 5 nitrobenzene 1 2 3 triol function as cr vi reductants on the basis of the examined intermediate products the potential pnp degradation pathway was investigated the factors that could influence simultaneous dehgradation and reduction including solution ph gas velocity and distance between the plasma outlet and the water surface were researched low ph supports cr vi reduction and the promotion of pnp for cr vi reduction applies to all ph values the degradation of pnp is insensitive to ph values with or without cr vi the optimal gas velocity for pnp degradation and cr vi reduction was revealed to be 6 l min the simultaneous removal of pnp and cr vi benefits from a shorter distance between the plasma outlet and the water s surface graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords environment friendly technology electrodeless atmospheric plasma complex wastewater mutual effects reductive intermediates 1 introduction the development of industrial production technologies has increased the discharge of wastewater into water bodies resulting in environmental hazards and threats to human health chromium is a typical heavy metal wastewater contaminant produced by industries including leather tanning car manufacturing photographic film making and nuclear power plants aksu and gönen 2006 two common oxidation states of chromium cr iii and cr vi exist in the natural environment the toxicity of the cr vi species is over 100 times that of cr iii diao et al 2016a cr vi can produce mutagenic teratogenic and carcinogenic effects in biological systems ishibashi et al 1990 because of its toxicity to living organisms cr vi is listed by the united states environmental protection agency as one of the 129 most critical pollutants krishnani and ayyappan 2006 the most common organic pollutants in industrial wastewater are phenolic compounds including p nitrophenol phenol and 4 chlorophenol these compounds are important raw materials or midst substances for the production of steel explosives paint cork and fiberglass they are also used in the production and recycling of rubber goods the textile industry and for the synthesis of medicines diao et al 2016a krastanov et al 2013 despite their widespread use several organizations and policy documents define many phenolic compounds as priority pollutants the negative impacts of these compounds on the environment and human health necessitate their regulation of drinking water calabrese and edwardj 1991 european union stipulates that the concentration of all phenolic compounds in drinking water is legally restricted to below 0 5 mg l liu et al 2021 additionally some phenolic substances in industrial wastewater co exist with cr vi which greatly increases the risk to human health tripathi and garg 2014 tripathi et al 2011 furthermore simultaneously treating this contamination is complicated by significantly different physicochemical properties between cr vi and phenolic compounds thus a simple and effective technique to resolve co contamination by cr vi and phenolic compounds is urgently required to date multiple techniques have been developed to remove cr vi and phenolic compounds from wastewater including biological treatment bhattacharya et al 2014 ontañon et al 2015 photocatalytic degradation chen et al 2017 mani et al 2015 xie et al 2006 adsorption gupta and balomajumder 2015 2016 fenton like oxidation diao et al 2016b and plasma technology liu 2009 long et al 2021 among these techniques plasma technology is particularly promising on account of its environmentally friendly properties plasma is a partially ionized gas comprising electrons free radicals ions and neutrals different active species can be generated from plasma without introducing the additional chemical reagents or the production of chemical wastes dou et al 2018 strongly oxidative reagents o h o o3 etc are generated by the collision of energetic electrons with background molecules n2 o2 h2o etc vandenbroucke et al 2011 additionally plasma can simultaneously generate reductive species hydrogen peroxide hydrated electron h radicals etc which can promote the removal of oxidizing pollution from wastewater hence plasma technology has significant potential for the single step treatment of co contamination involving heavy metals and toxic organic pollutants previous research has revealed that the simultaneous oxidation of phenol and reduction of cr vi can be realized using contact glow discharge electrolysis liu 2009 the removal efficiency of both pollutants can be enhanced in the presence of each other long et al also reported the simultaneous degradation of phenylic pollutants and reduction of cr vi with dielectric barrier plasma using a cofe2o4 mwnts sponge electrode long et al 2021 in that study the tip discharge effect of cofe2o4 nanowires in the electrode was promoted by the generation of active substances moreover the dielectric barrier plasma demonstrated an excellent synergistic effect that the addition of cr vi significantly enhanced the removal of phenylic pollution however in some plasma systems e g glow discharge plasma and pulsed dc discharge plasma the erosion of the system s electrodes significantly affects the stability of the plasma which results in a reduction of the lifetime of devices hattori et al 2012 additionally electrode erosion leads to the secondary pollution of the processing solution recently microwave excited plasma has become the focus of attention as it does not require the use of electrodes sun et al 2017 moreover when compared with other plasma sources microwave plasma is conducive to producing higher concentrations of active species for chemical reactions on account of its high frequency operation de la fuente et al 2017 accordingly numerous microwave plasma devices have been utilized in wastewater treatment applications an atmospheric pressure ar plasma jet reactor based on a surfatron operating at 2 45 ghz was reported to degrade methylene blue in an aqueous solution garcía et al 2017 additionally the reactor was used to degrade a benzene layer on water casado et al 2020 however in the above studies the plasma did not contact the wastewater surface directly which was costly in terms of energy consumption qian et al used microwave induced ar plasma to degrade fipronil qian et al 2020 however the volume of the processing sample in that study was relatively limited since the inner diameter of the quartz tube was only 1 mm this resulted in a very small plasma solution interfacial area approximately 3 14 mm2 and a low gas flow the present study investigated the simultaneous removal of co contamination by cr vi and phenolic compounds using a homemade electrodeless microwave plasma device with a large plasma solution interface 153 mm2 the atmospheric plasma was generated in a taper waveguide and flowed out to lick the surface of an aqueous solution directly the microwave was generated by a low cost oven magnetron and was coupled directly inside the waveguide to produce stable plasma the output frequency of the oven magnetron was stabilized using the injection locking technique the mutual promotion of the simultaneous removal of cr vi and pnp was observed experimentally the reduction of cr vi and the degradation of pnp were evaluated according to different parameters including the ph values of the solution the velocity of the carrier gas and the distance between the plasma outlet and the interface an analysis of the chemical species during degradation was conducted using high resolution mass spectrometry ms and a plausible reduction and degradation mechanism was revealed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials this study used analytical grade chemicals that were utilized as purchased without further purification pnp purity 95 was obtained from aladdin biochemical technology co ltd china chromate k2cr2o7 naoh sulfuric acid h2so4 and isopropanol were supplied by kelong chemical reagent co ltd china 2 2 microwave atmospheric plasma device fig 1 presents a schematic illustration of the homemade microwave plasma reactor used in this study for the degradation of aqueous pnp and reduction of cr vi microwave plasma was generated inside a quartz tube with a 14 mm inner diameter which was installed inside a taper waveguide in order to obtain high electric field with the same incident microwave power the narrow sides of this waveguide were compressed moon et al 2002 the microwave leakage was considered at the initial designing stage of the taper waveguide two cutoff waveguides were designed and connected to the taper waveguide to avoid microwave leakage as shown in fig s1 ar gas was introduced into the tube in which the absorbed microwave energy generated atmospheric pressure ar plasma then the plasma was blown out to lick the surface of the treated solution the flow rate of the discharge gas was controlled using a mass flow controller ketan kt c4z a 50 ml water cooling jacketed cylindrical glass vessel was placed under the end of the quartz tube the inner and outer diameters of the reactor were 4 0 and 5 0 cm respectively the height of the glass cylinder portion was 4 5 cm as fig s2 in supporting information shows microwave power 2 442 ghz was produced by a low cost magnetron in conjunction with the injection locking technique which was used to ensure a stable plasma jet the frequency in a free running magnetron is naturally random and could interfere with the stability of the generated plasma jet reportedly the injection locking technique is powerful enough to lock the frequency liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2016a zhang et al 2016b thus in the current study an external microwave source derived from a solid state source with a power of approximately 2 w was injected into a magnetron to lock its frequency during the treatment the incident and reflected microwave power which was measured by a microwave power meter av2433 were 280 w and 30 w respectively fig s3 in supporting information presents the frequency spectra before and after the injection locking process a stabilized frequency can help to generate a stabilized plasma jet with a long length de la fuente et al 2017 rummel and grotjohn 2002 2 3 experimental methods mixed solutions of cr vi and pnp in 50 ml batches were firstly treated by the setup shown in fig 1 then the concentration of pnp was fixed while the concentration of cr vi was adjusted to reveal the effect of cr vi on the degradation of pnp similarly the concentration of cr vi was fixed while the concentration of pnp was adjusted to reveal the effect of pnp on the reduction of cr vi to reveal the mechanism of the simultaneous degradation and mutual promotion cr vi reduction in plasma treated deionized water and pnp solution were also carried comparatively at last the effects of different parameters on removal efficiency including the gas flow rate the distance between the plasma outlet and the water surface and the ph of the mixed solution were investigated experimentally h2so4 naoh was added to the solution to adjust the ph from 3 to 11 2 4 analytical methods a maya2000pro spectrometer ocean optics was used to analyze the emission spectroscopy of the plasma the remaining concentrations of cr vi were analyzed using the diphenylcarbazide method on a general t6s uv vis spectrophotometer tang et al 2014 see s1 in supporting information for the specific steps h2o2 was quantified by adding potassium titanium iv oxalate a yellow orange titanium iv peroxide complex with a maximum absorbance at 400 nm formed in the processed solution sellers 1980 a quantitative analysis of pnp was conducted using high performance liquid chromatography hplc the specific analytical procedures for pnp are described in s2 of supporting information the degradation intermediates of pnp were analyzed using hplc ms and the specific analytical procedures are described in s3 of supporting information the calculation of the efficiency of pnp degradation cr vi reduction or the total organic carbon toc is described in s4 of supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 optical emission spectroscopy spectra of the microwave plasma fig 2 illustrates the optical emission spectroscopy oes spectra of the ar plasma jet before plasma treatment the spectra exhibit well defined peaks in the range of 696 850 nm due to the ar emission line the collision between excited ar atoms and water molecules in the ambient region led to the formation of oh and h where the ar atoms acted as energy carriers garcía et al 2017 1 ar h 2 o ar oh h moreover the generation of o h and h resulted from the interaction of electrons and uv photons with water molecules in the gas or gas liquid interface as follows benetoli et al 2012 liu 2009 2 e h 2 o e oh h 3 e h 2 o 2 e oh h 4 e h 2 o oh h 5 uv h 2 o oh h 6 e h 2 o 2 e h 2 o 7 h 2 o nh 2 o n oh h 3 o n 1 h oh has the highest oxidizing potential of 2 8 v and is instrumental in the degradation of organic pollutants attri et al 2016 simultaneously the generated h is a strong reducing agent e h 2 o h 2 30 v that provides the possibility of removing pollutants via reductive pathways neta 1972 the peak of singlet oxygen at 777 nm was also observed in the spectrum singlet oxygen o may be generated from the strong interaction between plasma particles and o2 molecules in the surrounding air bansode et al 2017 it is one of the key species for degrading the organic molecules in an aqueous solution bansode et al 2017 malik et al 2001 some of the impact reactions are presented in eqs 8 and 9 malik et al 2001 8 e o 2 o o e 9 e o 2 o o 2 e the above results confirm the generation of various radical species which indicate that microwave plasma has the potential to oxidize and reduce pollutants in an aqueous solution 3 2 simultaneous detoxification of cr vi and pnp the feasibility of the detoxification of cr vi and pnp by the microwave plasma was investigated using a mixed solution of cr vi and pnp the initial pnp and cr vi concentrations were 100 and 30 mg l respectively with plasma the removal efficiency for cr vi pnp and toc was measured after every 3 min of processing as shown in fig 3 after 3 min the cr vi removal efficiency reached 34 2 this increased as the processing time was extended and reached a maximum of 96 1 after 15 min simultaneously the removal efficiency variation of pnp was almost the same as that of cr vi and after a 15 min processing period it reached 94 0 to minimize the impact of temperature variation on the reaction a water cooling cylindrical glass vessel which has an interlayer filled with flowing water was used to hold the solution the corresponding variation of temperature of the mixed solution during treatment was measured and demonstrated in fig s4 the microwave plasma resulted in a very slight rise of the solution temperature from 11 c to 24 c due to the application of the water cooling glass vessel in order to find out the effect of the tiny temperature rise on degradation reduction contrast experiments without microwave plasma were carried out with solution temperature maintained at 24 c the results are demonstrated in fig s5 notably the concentrations of cr vi and pnp remained unchanged during the process which indicated that the tiny temperature variation does not contribute to the simultaneous degradation and reduction another important parameter when assessing the degradation of organic compounds is toc which is a nonspecific indicator related to the mineralization of wastewater this study found that the removal efficiency of toc increased commensurately with treatment time up to a maximum of 30 2 after a 15 min treatment the high toc removal efficiency indicates that pnp was well mineralized specifically during plasma treatment pnp is reduced gradually into shorter carbon chains and is further degraded into cox h2o and other organic ions to determine the mutual influence of cr vi and pnp on their co removal this study conducted detoxification experiments using a mixed solution containing various initial concentrations of pnp and cr vi fig 4 illustrates the removal efficiencies additionally the effect of the addition of pnp on the removal of cr vi was investigated as shown in figs 4 a and b the initial cr vi concentration was fixed at 30 mg l whereas the initial concentration of pnp increased from 0 to 150 mg l fig 4 a shows that the removal efficiency of cr vi was just 30 9 after 15 min of treatment without pnp in the solution interestingly the addition of pnp to the solution caused a significant improvement in the reduction of cr vi when the initial pnp concentration reached 150 mg l the removal efficiency increased to 99 3 theoretically plasma can generate both o h and h in the contact area with water o h reacts with pnp whereas h reduces cr vi according to the following reaction liu 2009 10 h cr vi cr v h 11 cr v cr v cr iv cr vi 12 cr v cr iv cr iii cr vi the reduction of cr vi from eqs 10 12 is as follows 13 h cr vi cr iii 3 h therefore because of the reduced recombination probability of oh and h the degradation of phenolic compounds and the reduction of cr vi were improved in the mixed solution furthermore the reaction rate constant of oh with pnp is 1 2 1010 m 1 s 1 oturan et al 2000 which is approximately 10 times the rate constant for the reaction of radical oh with cr iii and cr v the improvements in the reduction of cr vi may result from the consumption of a large number of oh by pnp which inhibits the following re oxidation of cr iii and cr v 14 oh cr iii cr iv oh 3 8 10 8 m 1 s 1 298 k 15 oh cr v cr vi oh 1 5 10 9 m 1 s 1 298 k the above factors help to clarify the improvement in cr vi reduction after the addition of pnp however further analysis is required to determine the main contribution the concentration of pnp in the solution was detected simultaneously and the results are presented in fig 4 b after a 15 min processing period over 85 of the pnp had been degraded when the initial concentration of pnp increased from 50 to 150 mg l the removal efficiency of pnp decreased from 99 3 to 89 1 respectively when these results are compared with previously reported plasma systems or methods for the simultaneous removal of cr vi and phenolic substances chen et al 2017 liu 2009 long et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 it is clear that the microwave plasma exhibited a stronger ability for degrading phenolic substances the average removal mass of the phenolic substance pnp per minute per liter reached 9 50 mg as table s1 in supporting information shows this outperforms other systems for the simultaneous removal of cr vi and phenolic substances this phenomenon could be attributed to the much higher proportion of electrons in microwave plasma i e it has a higher electron density when compared with other plasma sources which results in a higher concentration of active species for the chemical reactions of pnp degradation such as o h de la fuente et al 2017 this study also investigated the effect of the addition of cr vi on the removal of pnp as figs 4 c and d show for this experiment the initial concentration of pnp was fixed at 150 mg l whereas the initial concentration of cr vi was increased from 0 to 120 mg l it is noted from fig 4 d that there was a slight improvement in the degradation of pnp as the initial concentration of cr vi was increased when the initial concentration of cr vi was increased from 0 to 120 mg l the degradation efficiency of pnp increased from 88 8 to 95 0 as fig 4 c reveals the removal efficiency of cr vi increased as its initial concentration decreased at a fixed initial pnp concentration the removal efficiency of cr vi reached 99 3 at an initial cr vi concentration of 30 mg l with the presence of pnp in the initial solution in terms of the effect of cr vi on the degradation of pnp the above experimental results indicate that the addition of cr vi has a slightly positive effect on the degradation of pnp cr vi consumed a large number of h which reduced the probability of o h and h combination more o h was produced to degrade pnp in the solution consequently this increased the removal efficiency of the organic pollutants which is consistent with previous studies liu 2009 long et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 however in the present study the improvement in pnp degradation was not obvious the active species for chemical reactions at the gas liquid interface e g o h generated by the microwave plasma occurred in very high concentrations de la fuente et al 2017 there was only a slight increase in o h due to the consumption of h compared with that produced by the microwave plasma thus the consumption of h by cr vi did not significantly improve the degradation efficiency of pnp interestingly the above results reveal that the improvement in the removal of cr vi or pnp led by the addition of the other solvent was very distinctive there was an increase of over threefold in the reduction efficiency of cr vi from 30 9 to 96 1 with the addition of 100 mg l of phenolic compound pnp to the sole cr vi solution 30 mg l however compared with the sole pnp solution the degradation efficiency of pnp increased by just 6 2 from 88 8 to 95 0 even when the cr vi concentration reached 120 mg l following the theory that pnp and cr vi reduce the probability of o h and h combination the improvements in pnp and cr vi would be comparable 3 3 mechanism of simultaneous cr vi reduction and pnp degradation 3 3 1 reduction of cr vi led by plasma treated pnp solution and water to identify the major contributor to the significant improvement in the reduction of cr vi after the addition of pnp four groups of experiments were conducted to investigate cr vi with different media as shown in fig 5 table 1 presents the details of the experimental conditions the reduction of cr vi was completed in a three step process as detailed in s5 of supporting information in group a cr vi was added to plasma treated deionized water to observe any reaction between the products and cr vi the experimental results reveal that the plasma treated deionized water reduced 15 1 of the cr vi in the first three minutes during the next 12 min the reduction efficiency increased slowly to 20 9 in plasma treated deionized water hydrogen peroxide h2o2 is a common aqueous reactive species produced by plasma chen et al 2018 locke and shih 2011 it is produced by the combined reaction of hydroxide radicals o h in the bulk water and the gas water interface as follows kanazawa et al 2011 16 oh oh h 2 o 2 the long lived h2o2 diffuses into the bulk and reduces cr vi under acidic conditions as given in chandana et al 2015a ke et al 2011 17 2 hcro 4 3 h 2 o 2 8 h 2 c r 3 3 o 2 8 h 2 o hence plasma treated deionized water can reduce cr vi fig 4 b shows the corresponding changes in h2o2 concentration after the reduction of cr vi after a 15 min plasma treatment the h2o2 concentration in the deionized water was 48 7 mg l this decreased to 17 1 mg l after reacting with cr vi for 15 min this significant decrease in h2o2 concentration following the reaction between cr vi and the plasma treated deionized water further confirms that the produced h2o2 reacted with cr vi in group b sole cr vi in deionized water underwent direct plasma treatment for 15 min however after three minutes of treatment a cr vi reduction efficiency of only 5 6 was achieved which is much less than that obtained in group a using treated deionized water however a smooth reduction in cr vi continued over the next 12 min and the reduction efficiency gradually increased after 6 min the reduction efficiency of cr vi during plasma treatment without pnp in the solution equaled that of the plasma treated deionized water and subsequently surpassed it as can be seen in fig 5 b 17 9 mg l of h2o2 was detected in the cr vi solution following plasma treatment group b in this group the h2o2 concentration after plasma treatment is significantly less than with plasma treated deionized water 48 7 mg l and is very close to that after the reaction between plasma treated deionized water and cr vi 17 1 mg l these results are reasonable since h2o2 is the primary long lived contributor to the reduction of cr vi in plasma treatments without the addition of pnp compared with group a the continuous reduction in group b is attributed to the continuous production of reduction species including long lived h2o2 and short lived h during sole plasma treatment wang and jiang 2008 compared with the reduction by plasma treated deionized water in group a the slightly higher reduction efficiency during sole plasma treatment in group b may be attributed to the additional contribution of short lived h cr vi was reduced by hydrogen atoms h and no h was present in the plasma treated deionized water because of its recombination with o h or other h once it formed in the absence of cr vi 18 h oh h 2 o 19 h h h 2 in group c cr vi was added to the plasma treated pnp solution interestingly there was a sharp reduction in cr vi after reaction times of 3 and 15 min the reduction efficiency in the treated pnp solution reached 68 7 and 83 2 respectively whereas the reduction efficiency was only 15 1 and 20 9 in the treated deionized water group a respectively the corresponding concentration of h2o2 in the plasma treated pnp solution was 46 5 mg l which is similar to the results for the plasma treated deionized water 48 7 mg l this outcome indicates that the addition of pnp to the solution did not affect the generation of h2o2 simultaneously in group c following the reaction between cr vi and the plasma treated pnp solution the concentration of h2o2 decreased by only 19 5 mg l from 46 5 to 27 0 mg l whereas there was a 31 6 mg l reduction from 48 7 to 17 1 mg l in group a the slight decline in h2o2 and the significant improvement in the reduction of cr vi indicate that h2o2 was not the main contributor when cr vi was reduced in the plasma treated pnp solution thus the intermediates of the plasma treated pnp must have contributed significantly to the reduction of cr vi in group d the cr vi solution was treated directly by microwave plasma with pnp in the solution a comparison of the red and black lines in fig 5 a reveals that the reduction efficiency of cr vi when reacting with the treated pnp solution black line was highest in the first 3 min as the treatment time was extended the cr vi reduction efficiency in the plasma treated mixed solution red line gradually increased and surpassed that of the reaction between cr vi and the plasma treated pnp solution black line after 9 min these findings suggest that the intermediates of pnp played a key role in the reduction of cr vi at the start of the reduction experiment in group c the plasma treated pnp solution had the highest concentration of pnp degradation intermediates and consequently the highest reduction rate as the experiment progressed the intermediates of the plasma treated mixed cr vi pnp solution increased in group d thus there was a continuous increase in the reduction efficiency of cr vi similar to the process in the plasma treated sole cr vi solution group b the short lived h also contributed to the reduction of cr vi the reduction efficiency of the plasma treated mixed solution group d exceeded that of the treated pnp solution group c which may be attributed partly to the contribution of short lived h moreover the continuous consumption of the intermediates may result in a higher total production of pnp degraded intermediates which may also contribute to the final higher levels of cr vi reduction in group d 3 3 2 effect of hydroxyl scavengers on simultaneous reduction and degradation eqs 1 7 show that microwave plasma produces significant quantities of in solution hydroxyl radicals among them o h is an oxidizing species that play a vital role in the degradation of pnp wang et al 2020 the intermediates of pnp degradation significantly affect the reduction of cr vi simultaneously o h reoxidize the reduced cr iii to higher states as indicated by eqs 14 and 15 anderson and farhataziz 1963 additionally the hydroxyl radicals consume hydrogen atoms via eq 18 which adversely affects the reduction of cr vi therefore o h is of significant importance in the simultaneous degradation of pnp and reduction of cr vi although the mechanism by which it occurs is complicated to determine the weight of hydroxyl radicals this study added isopropanol a well known hydroxyl radical scavenger to the mixed solution before plasma treatment honorio et al 2020 after its addition a clear inhibitory effect on the removal efficiency of both pnp and cr vi was observed see fig 6 there was a decrease in removal efficiency as the concentration of isopropanol increased this inhibition of pnp degradation was apparent since o h is the main active species for pnp degradation the results for the inhibition of pnp degradation were similar to those reported in previous studies in which the addition of isopropanol scavenged o h radicals generated by microwave plasma and hindered the degradation of pnp wang et al 2020 wang et al 2015 interestingly the reduction of cr vi was impeded significantly by the addition of isopropanol this could be attributed mainly to the fact that the inhibition of pnp degradation led to the decline of pnp intermediates thus these intermediates could reduce less cr vi this phenomenon is consistent with the results shown in fig 5 which indicate that pnp intermediates were significant in the reduction of cr vi in this study s microwave plasma system fig 6 shows that the inhibitory effect on the reduction of cr vi was disproportional to that for pnp degradation there was a stronger inhibition on pnp degradation than for cr vi with isopropanol concentrations of 50 and 100 mmol l the degradation efficiency of pnp decreased by 54 8 and 72 2 respectively whereas the reduction of cr vi decreased by 26 2 and 53 0 respectively with the addition of the same volumes of isopropanol this phenomenon could be attributed to the following besides the reduction of pnp degraded intermediates after the addition of the hydroxyl radical scavenger the combination of o h and h eq 18 was inhibited thus the amount of h was increased the reduced levels of pnp degraded intermediates inhibited the reduction of cr vi whereas the increased amount of h promoted the reduction of cr vi thus after the addition of the hydroxyl radical scavenger the inhibition of cr vi reduction was marginally lower than that of pnp degradation 3 3 3 possible pathway of pnp degradation to elucidate the degradation pathway of pnp this study used hplc ms to investigate the compounds produced during treatment table s2 in supporting information contains details of the detected degradation intermediates of pnp and based on these results fig 7 presents the potential pathway for the degradation of pnp pnp degradation occurred in three stages first the pnp molecules were attacked by o h radicals which resulted in the formation of hydroxylated pnp molecules in the molecular structure of pnp the electron donating substituent the phenolic hydroxyl group increased the electron densities at the ortho and para positions whereas the electron withdrawing substituent the no2 group was strongly deactivating and meta directing the ortho positions were attacked by o h which resulted in the formation of p nitrocatechol and 5 nitrobenzene 1 2 3 triol the para positions can also be attacked by the o h accompanied by the loss of the no2 group the second stage involved the products of ring opening reactions during this stage products were formed in solution including muconic acid succinic acid 2 oxomalonic acid and 2 hydroxymalonic acid finally these products of ring opening reactions were further mineralized into inorganic molecules e g co2 h2o no2 and no3 the variations in toc during the process confirmed the occurrence of mineralization see fig 3 the above discussion reveals that various polyphenols such as p nitrocatechol and 5 nitrobenzene 1 2 3 triol were generated during the plasma treatment these polyphenols may function as the reductants of cr vi since the abundant phenolic hydroxyl groups in polyphenols particularly the ortho phenolic hydroxyl groups have strong reducibility liu et al 2020 liu 2017 this result further clarifies the mechanism of cr vi reduction whereby pnp intermediates exert a significant effect on the reduction of cr vi 3 4 effect of working parameters on removal efficiency in wastewater treatment ph is a significant parameter fig 8 presents the reduction of cr vi and the degradation of pnp by microwave plasma under solutions with different ph values the figure shows that under acidic conditions the removal efficiency of cr vi was higher than that under neutral or basic conditions both with and without pnp when the initial ph of the solution was increased from 3 to 11 there was a decrease in the reduction efficiency of cr vi from 78 8 to 22 7 see fig 8 a with the addition of pnp the reduction efficiencies of cr vi showed a similar trend however when pnp was present the reduction efficiencies were much higher than without pnp for all ph values accordingly it is considered that pnp significantly enhances the removal of cr vi irrespective of ph value based on the above discussion it can be concluded that the reductive species for cr vi reduction in the liquid phase are the intermediates of pnp h and h2o2 at a ph of 6 hcro4 constitutes the majority of cr vi species whereas the major species is cro4 2 with ph 6 the oxidability of hcro4 is much stronger e0 hcro4 cr3 0 94 v ph 3 0 than cro4 2 e0 cro4 2 cr oh 3 0 56 v ph 7 0 which indicates that under an acidic condition cr vi is reduced more easily than under neutral or basic conditions zhang et al 2018 furthermore h2o2 is produced in abundance during plasma treatment chandana et al 2015b the standard electrode potential of h2o2 is 0 56 v which is lower than that of cr vi 1 08 v at ph 2 0 ke et al 2011 liu et al 2011 thus cr vi can be reduced to cr iii by h2o2 produced in an acidic medium eq 17 previous studies have reported the reduction rate of the reaction to be strongly dependent on the ph of the solution which decreases with increasing ph van niekerk et al 2007 theoretically acidic conditions should result in a higher cr vi reduction rate than under neutral or basic conditions this assumption is consistent with the experimental results presented in fig 8 a according to fig 8 b there was a marginal decrease in the removal efficiency of pnp as the initial ph increased interestingly there was no strong relationship between the removal efficiencies of pnp with or without cr vi and the ph level of the solution when the initial ph increased from 3 to 11 the removal efficiency of pnp in the presence of cr vi following 9 min s treatment decreased only by 10 7 from 83 8 to 73 1 which is comparable with the result for the absence of cr vi after 9 min s treatment the removal efficiency of pnp in the absence of cr vi decreased by 7 7 from 80 4 to 72 7 previous studies have shown the oxidation capacity of o h to decrease with increasing ph the oxidizing potential of o h radicals was shown to drop from 2 70 v at a ph of 3 0 to 2 34 v at a ph of 9 0 tang et al 2009 however compared with other plasma sources high frequency microwave plasma has higher electron densities and energies de la fuente et al 2017 in the microwave plasma system presented in the current paper the concentration of hydroxyl radicals near the plasma solution interface was very high which led to the degradation of nearly all the pnp at the interface consequently the main influence on the degradation of pnp was the diffusion rate from the bulk solution chen et al 2019 rather than the ph level or the addition of cr vi this study also investigated the effect of the flow rate of ar 4 12 l min on the simultaneous oxidation of pnp and the reduction of cr vi see fig s6 in support information notably an ar flow rate of 6 l min produced the highest removal efficiency for both pnp and cr vi when the ar flow rate exceeded 6 l min the removal efficiency of both pnp and cr vi remained almost unchanged besides experimental results revealed that the oxidation of pnp and the reduction of cr vi negatively correlated with the distance between the plasma outlet and the water s surface 5 30 mm see fig s7 in support information the related descriptions are given in s6 and s7 to exam the scale up possibility the volume of the mixed solution to be treated was magnified 20 times to 1 l simultaneous degradation of pnp and reduction of cr vi was also achieved with extended treatment time the results and detailed discussion are demonstrated in fig s7 and s8 in supporting information respectively after 300 min s treatment the efficiency of pnp degradation and cr vi reduction were 81 1 and 94 7 respectively if the processing time increased to 720 min neither pnp nor cr vi could be detected in the treated solution 4 conclusion as far as the authors are aware we are the first to use an electrodeless microwave atmospheric pressure plasma jet for the simultaneous removal of cr vi and pnp the experimental results demonstrated high efficiency in the fast simultaneous removal of cr vi and pnp the removal efficiencies of cr vi and pnp in the mixed solution were 96 1 and 94 0 respectively the measured toc removal efficiency revealed that after a 15 min treatment approximately 30 2 of the pnp had been mineralized the addition of pnp significantly enhanced the removal of cr vi whereas the addition of cr vi slightly enhanced the removal of pnp based on the reducibility of the plasma treated pnp solution and the reductive intermediates of pnp including various polyphenols detected by hplc ms it was confirmed that the pnp intermediates produced during this study s microwave plasma treatment were mainly responsible for the reduction of cr vi additionally the study proposed a possible pathway for pnp degradation the experimental results suggest that long lived h2o2 and other short lived reductive species e g h also contribute to the reduction of cr vi some key factors that could influence the simultaneous removal of pnp and cr vi were also investigated the reduction efficiency of cr vi decreased as the solution s ph increased whereas the degradation of pnp remained largely unaffected the improvement in the reduction of cr vi with the addition of pnp was found to be valid across all the ph values tested gas velocity was found to slightly affect the co removal of cr vi and pnp and the optimal ar flow rate was defined at 6 l min the degradation efficiency of pnp and the reduction efficiency of cr vi were both confirmed to decrease as the distance between the plasma outlet and the water surface increased this research and its findings provide the possibility of a fast efficient single step treatment for wastewater contaminated by organic pollutants and heavy metals further research could expand the categories of co contamination pollutants and the concept of using

16281,different physicochemical properties between cr vi and phenolic compounds pose serious challenges for the effective treatment of co contamination this study developed an electrodeless high flow microwave atmospheric plasma jet for the single step simultaneous degradation of p nitrophenol pnp and reduction of cr vi following a 15 min treatment with microwave atmospheric pressure plasma the removal efficiency of cr vi and pnp reached 97 5 and 93 6 respectively whereas that of total organic carbon reached 30 2 adding pnp to the solution significantly improved cr vi reduction whereas pnp degradation increased slightly with cr vi the results indicate that the pnp intermediates significantly affected cr vi reduction additionally long lived h2o2 and short lived h aided the reduction of cr vi during plasma treatment the addition of hydroxyl scavengers during treatment implied that o h was largely responsible for pnp oxidation high performance liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy hplc ms revealed that pnp intermediates including p nitrocatechol and 5 nitrobenzene 1 2 3 triol function as cr vi reductants on the basis of the examined intermediate products the potential pnp degradation pathway was investigated the factors that could influence simultaneous dehgradation and reduction including solution ph gas velocity and distance between the plasma outlet and the water surface were researched low ph supports cr vi reduction and the promotion of pnp for cr vi reduction applies to all ph values the degradation of pnp is insensitive to ph values with or without cr vi the optimal gas velocity for pnp degradation and cr vi reduction was revealed to be 6 l min the simultaneous removal of pnp and cr vi benefits from a shorter distance between the plasma outlet and the water s surface graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords environment friendly technology electrodeless atmospheric plasma complex wastewater mutual effects reductive intermediates 1 introduction the development of industrial production technologies has increased the discharge of wastewater into water bodies resulting in environmental hazards and threats to human health chromium is a typical heavy metal wastewater contaminant produced by industries including leather tanning car manufacturing photographic film making and nuclear power plants aksu and gönen 2006 two common oxidation states of chromium cr iii and cr vi exist in the natural environment the toxicity of the cr vi species is over 100 times that of cr iii diao et al 2016a cr vi can produce mutagenic teratogenic and carcinogenic effects in biological systems ishibashi et al 1990 because of its toxicity to living organisms cr vi is listed by the united states environmental protection agency as one of the 129 most critical pollutants krishnani and ayyappan 2006 the most common organic pollutants in industrial wastewater are phenolic compounds including p nitrophenol phenol and 4 chlorophenol these compounds are important raw materials or midst substances for the production of steel explosives paint cork and fiberglass they are also used in the production and recycling of rubber goods the textile industry and for the synthesis of medicines diao et al 2016a krastanov et al 2013 despite their widespread use several organizations and policy documents define many phenolic compounds as priority pollutants the negative impacts of these compounds on the environment and human health necessitate their regulation of drinking water calabrese and edwardj 1991 european union stipulates that the concentration of all phenolic compounds in drinking water is legally restricted to below 0 5 mg l liu et al 2021 additionally some phenolic substances in industrial wastewater co exist with cr vi which greatly increases the risk to human health tripathi and garg 2014 tripathi et al 2011 furthermore simultaneously treating this contamination is complicated by significantly different physicochemical properties between cr vi and phenolic compounds thus a simple and effective technique to resolve co contamination by cr vi and phenolic compounds is urgently required to date multiple techniques have been developed to remove cr vi and phenolic compounds from wastewater including biological treatment bhattacharya et al 2014 ontañon et al 2015 photocatalytic degradation chen et al 2017 mani et al 2015 xie et al 2006 adsorption gupta and balomajumder 2015 2016 fenton like oxidation diao et al 2016b and plasma technology liu 2009 long et al 2021 among these techniques plasma technology is particularly promising on account of its environmentally friendly properties plasma is a partially ionized gas comprising electrons free radicals ions and neutrals different active species can be generated from plasma without introducing the additional chemical reagents or the production of chemical wastes dou et al 2018 strongly oxidative reagents o h o o3 etc are generated by the collision of energetic electrons with background molecules n2 o2 h2o etc vandenbroucke et al 2011 additionally plasma can simultaneously generate reductive species hydrogen peroxide hydrated electron h radicals etc which can promote the removal of oxidizing pollution from wastewater hence plasma technology has significant potential for the single step treatment of co contamination involving heavy metals and toxic organic pollutants previous research has revealed that the simultaneous oxidation of phenol and reduction of cr vi can be realized using contact glow discharge electrolysis liu 2009 the removal efficiency of both pollutants can be enhanced in the presence of each other long et al also reported the simultaneous degradation of phenylic pollutants and reduction of cr vi with dielectric barrier plasma using a cofe2o4 mwnts sponge electrode long et al 2021 in that study the tip discharge effect of cofe2o4 nanowires in the electrode was promoted by the generation of active substances moreover the dielectric barrier plasma demonstrated an excellent synergistic effect that the addition of cr vi significantly enhanced the removal of phenylic pollution however in some plasma systems e g glow discharge plasma and pulsed dc discharge plasma the erosion of the system s electrodes significantly affects the stability of the plasma which results in a reduction of the lifetime of devices hattori et al 2012 additionally electrode erosion leads to the secondary pollution of the processing solution recently microwave excited plasma has become the focus of attention as it does not require the use of electrodes sun et al 2017 moreover when compared with other plasma sources microwave plasma is conducive to producing higher concentrations of active species for chemical reactions on account of its high frequency operation de la fuente et al 2017 accordingly numerous microwave plasma devices have been utilized in wastewater treatment applications an atmospheric pressure ar plasma jet reactor based on a surfatron operating at 2 45 ghz was reported to degrade methylene blue in an aqueous solution garcía et al 2017 additionally the reactor was used to degrade a benzene layer on water casado et al 2020 however in the above studies the plasma did not contact the wastewater surface directly which was costly in terms of energy consumption qian et al used microwave induced ar plasma to degrade fipronil qian et al 2020 however the volume of the processing sample in that study was relatively limited since the inner diameter of the quartz tube was only 1 mm this resulted in a very small plasma solution interfacial area approximately 3 14 mm2 and a low gas flow the present study investigated the simultaneous removal of co contamination by cr vi and phenolic compounds using a homemade electrodeless microwave plasma device with a large plasma solution interface 153 mm2 the atmospheric plasma was generated in a taper waveguide and flowed out to lick the surface of an aqueous solution directly the microwave was generated by a low cost oven magnetron and was coupled directly inside the waveguide to produce stable plasma the output frequency of the oven magnetron was stabilized using the injection locking technique the mutual promotion of the simultaneous removal of cr vi and pnp was observed experimentally the reduction of cr vi and the degradation of pnp were evaluated according to different parameters including the ph values of the solution the velocity of the carrier gas and the distance between the plasma outlet and the interface an analysis of the chemical species during degradation was conducted using high resolution mass spectrometry ms and a plausible reduction and degradation mechanism was revealed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials this study used analytical grade chemicals that were utilized as purchased without further purification pnp purity 95 was obtained from aladdin biochemical technology co ltd china chromate k2cr2o7 naoh sulfuric acid h2so4 and isopropanol were supplied by kelong chemical reagent co ltd china 2 2 microwave atmospheric plasma device fig 1 presents a schematic illustration of the homemade microwave plasma reactor used in this study for the degradation of aqueous pnp and reduction of cr vi microwave plasma was generated inside a quartz tube with a 14 mm inner diameter which was installed inside a taper waveguide in order to obtain high electric field with the same incident microwave power the narrow sides of this waveguide were compressed moon et al 2002 the microwave leakage was considered at the initial designing stage of the taper waveguide two cutoff waveguides were designed and connected to the taper waveguide to avoid microwave leakage as shown in fig s1 ar gas was introduced into the tube in which the absorbed microwave energy generated atmospheric pressure ar plasma then the plasma was blown out to lick the surface of the treated solution the flow rate of the discharge gas was controlled using a mass flow controller ketan kt c4z a 50 ml water cooling jacketed cylindrical glass vessel was placed under the end of the quartz tube the inner and outer diameters of the reactor were 4 0 and 5 0 cm respectively the height of the glass cylinder portion was 4 5 cm as fig s2 in supporting information shows microwave power 2 442 ghz was produced by a low cost magnetron in conjunction with the injection locking technique which was used to ensure a stable plasma jet the frequency in a free running magnetron is naturally random and could interfere with the stability of the generated plasma jet reportedly the injection locking technique is powerful enough to lock the frequency liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2016a zhang et al 2016b thus in the current study an external microwave source derived from a solid state source with a power of approximately 2 w was injected into a magnetron to lock its frequency during the treatment the incident and reflected microwave power which was measured by a microwave power meter av2433 were 280 w and 30 w respectively fig s3 in supporting information presents the frequency spectra before and after the injection locking process a stabilized frequency can help to generate a stabilized plasma jet with a long length de la fuente et al 2017 rummel and grotjohn 2002 2 3 experimental methods mixed solutions of cr vi and pnp in 50 ml batches were firstly treated by the setup shown in fig 1 then the concentration of pnp was fixed while the concentration of cr vi was adjusted to reveal the effect of cr vi on the degradation of pnp similarly the concentration of cr vi was fixed while the concentration of pnp was adjusted to reveal the effect of pnp on the reduction of cr vi to reveal the mechanism of the simultaneous degradation and mutual promotion cr vi reduction in plasma treated deionized water and pnp solution were also carried comparatively at last the effects of different parameters on removal efficiency including the gas flow rate the distance between the plasma outlet and the water surface and the ph of the mixed solution were investigated experimentally h2so4 naoh was added to the solution to adjust the ph from 3 to 11 2 4 analytical methods a maya2000pro spectrometer ocean optics was used to analyze the emission spectroscopy of the plasma the remaining concentrations of cr vi were analyzed using the diphenylcarbazide method on a general t6s uv vis spectrophotometer tang et al 2014 see s1 in supporting information for the specific steps h2o2 was quantified by adding potassium titanium iv oxalate a yellow orange titanium iv peroxide complex with a maximum absorbance at 400 nm formed in the processed solution sellers 1980 a quantitative analysis of pnp was conducted using high performance liquid chromatography hplc the specific analytical procedures for pnp are described in s2 of supporting information the degradation intermediates of pnp were analyzed using hplc ms and the specific analytical procedures are described in s3 of supporting information the calculation of the efficiency of pnp degradation cr vi reduction or the total organic carbon toc is described in s4 of supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 optical emission spectroscopy spectra of the microwave plasma fig 2 illustrates the optical emission spectroscopy oes spectra of the ar plasma jet before plasma treatment the spectra exhibit well defined peaks in the range of 696 850 nm due to the ar emission line the collision between excited ar atoms and water molecules in the ambient region led to the formation of oh and h where the ar atoms acted as energy carriers garcía et al 2017 1 ar h 2 o ar oh h moreover the generation of o h and h resulted from the interaction of electrons and uv photons with water molecules in the gas or gas liquid interface as follows benetoli et al 2012 liu 2009 2 e h 2 o e oh h 3 e h 2 o 2 e oh h 4 e h 2 o oh h 5 uv h 2 o oh h 6 e h 2 o 2 e h 2 o 7 h 2 o nh 2 o n oh h 3 o n 1 h oh has the highest oxidizing potential of 2 8 v and is instrumental in the degradation of organic pollutants attri et al 2016 simultaneously the generated h is a strong reducing agent e h 2 o h 2 30 v that provides the possibility of removing pollutants via reductive pathways neta 1972 the peak of singlet oxygen at 777 nm was also observed in the spectrum singlet oxygen o may be generated from the strong interaction between plasma particles and o2 molecules in the surrounding air bansode et al 2017 it is one of the key species for degrading the organic molecules in an aqueous solution bansode et al 2017 malik et al 2001 some of the impact reactions are presented in eqs 8 and 9 malik et al 2001 8 e o 2 o o e 9 e o 2 o o 2 e the above results confirm the generation of various radical species which indicate that microwave plasma has the potential to oxidize and reduce pollutants in an aqueous solution 3 2 simultaneous detoxification of cr vi and pnp the feasibility of the detoxification of cr vi and pnp by the microwave plasma was investigated using a mixed solution of cr vi and pnp the initial pnp and cr vi concentrations were 100 and 30 mg l respectively with plasma the removal efficiency for cr vi pnp and toc was measured after every 3 min of processing as shown in fig 3 after 3 min the cr vi removal efficiency reached 34 2 this increased as the processing time was extended and reached a maximum of 96 1 after 15 min simultaneously the removal efficiency variation of pnp was almost the same as that of cr vi and after a 15 min processing period it reached 94 0 to minimize the impact of temperature variation on the reaction a water cooling cylindrical glass vessel which has an interlayer filled with flowing water was used to hold the solution the corresponding variation of temperature of the mixed solution during treatment was measured and demonstrated in fig s4 the microwave plasma resulted in a very slight rise of the solution temperature from 11 c to 24 c due to the application of the water cooling glass vessel in order to find out the effect of the tiny temperature rise on degradation reduction contrast experiments without microwave plasma were carried out with solution temperature maintained at 24 c the results are demonstrated in fig s5 notably the concentrations of cr vi and pnp remained unchanged during the process which indicated that the tiny temperature variation does not contribute to the simultaneous degradation and reduction another important parameter when assessing the degradation of organic compounds is toc which is a nonspecific indicator related to the mineralization of wastewater this study found that the removal efficiency of toc increased commensurately with treatment time up to a maximum of 30 2 after a 15 min treatment the high toc removal efficiency indicates that pnp was well mineralized specifically during plasma treatment pnp is reduced gradually into shorter carbon chains and is further degraded into cox h2o and other organic ions to determine the mutual influence of cr vi and pnp on their co removal this study conducted detoxification experiments using a mixed solution containing various initial concentrations of pnp and cr vi fig 4 illustrates the removal efficiencies additionally the effect of the addition of pnp on the removal of cr vi was investigated as shown in figs 4 a and b the initial cr vi concentration was fixed at 30 mg l whereas the initial concentration of pnp increased from 0 to 150 mg l fig 4 a shows that the removal efficiency of cr vi was just 30 9 after 15 min of treatment without pnp in the solution interestingly the addition of pnp to the solution caused a significant improvement in the reduction of cr vi when the initial pnp concentration reached 150 mg l the removal efficiency increased to 99 3 theoretically plasma can generate both o h and h in the contact area with water o h reacts with pnp whereas h reduces cr vi according to the following reaction liu 2009 10 h cr vi cr v h 11 cr v cr v cr iv cr vi 12 cr v cr iv cr iii cr vi the reduction of cr vi from eqs 10 12 is as follows 13 h cr vi cr iii 3 h therefore because of the reduced recombination probability of oh and h the degradation of phenolic compounds and the reduction of cr vi were improved in the mixed solution furthermore the reaction rate constant of oh with pnp is 1 2 1010 m 1 s 1 oturan et al 2000 which is approximately 10 times the rate constant for the reaction of radical oh with cr iii and cr v the improvements in the reduction of cr vi may result from the consumption of a large number of oh by pnp which inhibits the following re oxidation of cr iii and cr v 14 oh cr iii cr iv oh 3 8 10 8 m 1 s 1 298 k 15 oh cr v cr vi oh 1 5 10 9 m 1 s 1 298 k the above factors help to clarify the improvement in cr vi reduction after the addition of pnp however further analysis is required to determine the main contribution the concentration of pnp in the solution was detected simultaneously and the results are presented in fig 4 b after a 15 min processing period over 85 of the pnp had been degraded when the initial concentration of pnp increased from 50 to 150 mg l the removal efficiency of pnp decreased from 99 3 to 89 1 respectively when these results are compared with previously reported plasma systems or methods for the simultaneous removal of cr vi and phenolic substances chen et al 2017 liu 2009 long et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 it is clear that the microwave plasma exhibited a stronger ability for degrading phenolic substances the average removal mass of the phenolic substance pnp per minute per liter reached 9 50 mg as table s1 in supporting information shows this outperforms other systems for the simultaneous removal of cr vi and phenolic substances this phenomenon could be attributed to the much higher proportion of electrons in microwave plasma i e it has a higher electron density when compared with other plasma sources which results in a higher concentration of active species for the chemical reactions of pnp degradation such as o h de la fuente et al 2017 this study also investigated the effect of the addition of cr vi on the removal of pnp as figs 4 c and d show for this experiment the initial concentration of pnp was fixed at 150 mg l whereas the initial concentration of cr vi was increased from 0 to 120 mg l it is noted from fig 4 d that there was a slight improvement in the degradation of pnp as the initial concentration of cr vi was increased when the initial concentration of cr vi was increased from 0 to 120 mg l the degradation efficiency of pnp increased from 88 8 to 95 0 as fig 4 c reveals the removal efficiency of cr vi increased as its initial concentration decreased at a fixed initial pnp concentration the removal efficiency of cr vi reached 99 3 at an initial cr vi concentration of 30 mg l with the presence of pnp in the initial solution in terms of the effect of cr vi on the degradation of pnp the above experimental results indicate that the addition of cr vi has a slightly positive effect on the degradation of pnp cr vi consumed a large number of h which reduced the probability of o h and h combination more o h was produced to degrade pnp in the solution consequently this increased the removal efficiency of the organic pollutants which is consistent with previous studies liu 2009 long et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 however in the present study the improvement in pnp degradation was not obvious the active species for chemical reactions at the gas liquid interface e g o h generated by the microwave plasma occurred in very high concentrations de la fuente et al 2017 there was only a slight increase in o h due to the consumption of h compared with that produced by the microwave plasma thus the consumption of h by cr vi did not significantly improve the degradation efficiency of pnp interestingly the above results reveal that the improvement in the removal of cr vi or pnp led by the addition of the other solvent was very distinctive there was an increase of over threefold in the reduction efficiency of cr vi from 30 9 to 96 1 with the addition of 100 mg l of phenolic compound pnp to the sole cr vi solution 30 mg l however compared with the sole pnp solution the degradation efficiency of pnp increased by just 6 2 from 88 8 to 95 0 even when the cr vi concentration reached 120 mg l following the theory that pnp and cr vi reduce the probability of o h and h combination the improvements in pnp and cr vi would be comparable 3 3 mechanism of simultaneous cr vi reduction and pnp degradation 3 3 1 reduction of cr vi led by plasma treated pnp solution and water to identify the major contributor to the significant improvement in the reduction of cr vi after the addition of pnp four groups of experiments were conducted to investigate cr vi with different media as shown in fig 5 table 1 presents the details of the experimental conditions the reduction of cr vi was completed in a three step process as detailed in s5 of supporting information in group a cr vi was added to plasma treated deionized water to observe any reaction between the products and cr vi the experimental results reveal that the plasma treated deionized water reduced 15 1 of the cr vi in the first three minutes during the next 12 min the reduction efficiency increased slowly to 20 9 in plasma treated deionized water hydrogen peroxide h2o2 is a common aqueous reactive species produced by plasma chen et al 2018 locke and shih 2011 it is produced by the combined reaction of hydroxide radicals o h in the bulk water and the gas water interface as follows kanazawa et al 2011 16 oh oh h 2 o 2 the long lived h2o2 diffuses into the bulk and reduces cr vi under acidic conditions as given in chandana et al 2015a ke et al 2011 17 2 hcro 4 3 h 2 o 2 8 h 2 c r 3 3 o 2 8 h 2 o hence plasma treated deionized water can reduce cr vi fig 4 b shows the corresponding changes in h2o2 concentration after the reduction of cr vi after a 15 min plasma treatment the h2o2 concentration in the deionized water was 48 7 mg l this decreased to 17 1 mg l after reacting with cr vi for 15 min this significant decrease in h2o2 concentration following the reaction between cr vi and the plasma treated deionized water further confirms that the produced h2o2 reacted with cr vi in group b sole cr vi in deionized water underwent direct plasma treatment for 15 min however after three minutes of treatment a cr vi reduction efficiency of only 5 6 was achieved which is much less than that obtained in group a using treated deionized water however a smooth reduction in cr vi continued over the next 12 min and the reduction efficiency gradually increased after 6 min the reduction efficiency of cr vi during plasma treatment without pnp in the solution equaled that of the plasma treated deionized water and subsequently surpassed it as can be seen in fig 5 b 17 9 mg l of h2o2 was detected in the cr vi solution following plasma treatment group b in this group the h2o2 concentration after plasma treatment is significantly less than with plasma treated deionized water 48 7 mg l and is very close to that after the reaction between plasma treated deionized water and cr vi 17 1 mg l these results are reasonable since h2o2 is the primary long lived contributor to the reduction of cr vi in plasma treatments without the addition of pnp compared with group a the continuous reduction in group b is attributed to the continuous production of reduction species including long lived h2o2 and short lived h during sole plasma treatment wang and jiang 2008 compared with the reduction by plasma treated deionized water in group a the slightly higher reduction efficiency during sole plasma treatment in group b may be attributed to the additional contribution of short lived h cr vi was reduced by hydrogen atoms h and no h was present in the plasma treated deionized water because of its recombination with o h or other h once it formed in the absence of cr vi 18 h oh h 2 o 19 h h h 2 in group c cr vi was added to the plasma treated pnp solution interestingly there was a sharp reduction in cr vi after reaction times of 3 and 15 min the reduction efficiency in the treated pnp solution reached 68 7 and 83 2 respectively whereas the reduction efficiency was only 15 1 and 20 9 in the treated deionized water group a respectively the corresponding concentration of h2o2 in the plasma treated pnp solution was 46 5 mg l which is similar to the results for the plasma treated deionized water 48 7 mg l this outcome indicates that the addition of pnp to the solution did not affect the generation of h2o2 simultaneously in group c following the reaction between cr vi and the plasma treated pnp solution the concentration of h2o2 decreased by only 19 5 mg l from 46 5 to 27 0 mg l whereas there was a 31 6 mg l reduction from 48 7 to 17 1 mg l in group a the slight decline in h2o2 and the significant improvement in the reduction of cr vi indicate that h2o2 was not the main contributor when cr vi was reduced in the plasma treated pnp solution thus the intermediates of the plasma treated pnp must have contributed significantly to the reduction of cr vi in group d the cr vi solution was treated directly by microwave plasma with pnp in the solution a comparison of the red and black lines in fig 5 a reveals that the reduction efficiency of cr vi when reacting with the treated pnp solution black line was highest in the first 3 min as the treatment time was extended the cr vi reduction efficiency in the plasma treated mixed solution red line gradually increased and surpassed that of the reaction between cr vi and the plasma treated pnp solution black line after 9 min these findings suggest that the intermediates of pnp played a key role in the reduction of cr vi at the start of the reduction experiment in group c the plasma treated pnp solution had the highest concentration of pnp degradation intermediates and consequently the highest reduction rate as the experiment progressed the intermediates of the plasma treated mixed cr vi pnp solution increased in group d thus there was a continuous increase in the reduction efficiency of cr vi similar to the process in the plasma treated sole cr vi solution group b the short lived h also contributed to the reduction of cr vi the reduction efficiency of the plasma treated mixed solution group d exceeded that of the treated pnp solution group c which may be attributed partly to the contribution of short lived h moreover the continuous consumption of the intermediates may result in a higher total production of pnp degraded intermediates which may also contribute to the final higher levels of cr vi reduction in group d 3 3 2 effect of hydroxyl scavengers on simultaneous reduction and degradation eqs 1 7 show that microwave plasma produces significant quantities of in solution hydroxyl radicals among them o h is an oxidizing species that play a vital role in the degradation of pnp wang et al 2020 the intermediates of pnp degradation significantly affect the reduction of cr vi simultaneously o h reoxidize the reduced cr iii to higher states as indicated by eqs 14 and 15 anderson and farhataziz 1963 additionally the hydroxyl radicals consume hydrogen atoms via eq 18 which adversely affects the reduction of cr vi therefore o h is of significant importance in the simultaneous degradation of pnp and reduction of cr vi although the mechanism by which it occurs is complicated to determine the weight of hydroxyl radicals this study added isopropanol a well known hydroxyl radical scavenger to the mixed solution before plasma treatment honorio et al 2020 after its addition a clear inhibitory effect on the removal efficiency of both pnp and cr vi was observed see fig 6 there was a decrease in removal efficiency as the concentration of isopropanol increased this inhibition of pnp degradation was apparent since o h is the main active species for pnp degradation the results for the inhibition of pnp degradation were similar to those reported in previous studies in which the addition of isopropanol scavenged o h radicals generated by microwave plasma and hindered the degradation of pnp wang et al 2020 wang et al 2015 interestingly the reduction of cr vi was impeded significantly by the addition of isopropanol this could be attributed mainly to the fact that the inhibition of pnp degradation led to the decline of pnp intermediates thus these intermediates could reduce less cr vi this phenomenon is consistent with the results shown in fig 5 which indicate that pnp intermediates were significant in the reduction of cr vi in this study s microwave plasma system fig 6 shows that the inhibitory effect on the reduction of cr vi was disproportional to that for pnp degradation there was a stronger inhibition on pnp degradation than for cr vi with isopropanol concentrations of 50 and 100 mmol l the degradation efficiency of pnp decreased by 54 8 and 72 2 respectively whereas the reduction of cr vi decreased by 26 2 and 53 0 respectively with the addition of the same volumes of isopropanol this phenomenon could be attributed to the following besides the reduction of pnp degraded intermediates after the addition of the hydroxyl radical scavenger the combination of o h and h eq 18 was inhibited thus the amount of h was increased the reduced levels of pnp degraded intermediates inhibited the reduction of cr vi whereas the increased amount of h promoted the reduction of cr vi thus after the addition of the hydroxyl radical scavenger the inhibition of cr vi reduction was marginally lower than that of pnp degradation 3 3 3 possible pathway of pnp degradation to elucidate the degradation pathway of pnp this study used hplc ms to investigate the compounds produced during treatment table s2 in supporting information contains details of the detected degradation intermediates of pnp and based on these results fig 7 presents the potential pathway for the degradation of pnp pnp degradation occurred in three stages first the pnp molecules were attacked by o h radicals which resulted in the formation of hydroxylated pnp molecules in the molecular structure of pnp the electron donating substituent the phenolic hydroxyl group increased the electron densities at the ortho and para positions whereas the electron withdrawing substituent the no2 group was strongly deactivating and meta directing the ortho positions were attacked by o h which resulted in the formation of p nitrocatechol and 5 nitrobenzene 1 2 3 triol the para positions can also be attacked by the o h accompanied by the loss of the no2 group the second stage involved the products of ring opening reactions during this stage products were formed in solution including muconic acid succinic acid 2 oxomalonic acid and 2 hydroxymalonic acid finally these products of ring opening reactions were further mineralized into inorganic molecules e g co2 h2o no2 and no3 the variations in toc during the process confirmed the occurrence of mineralization see fig 3 the above discussion reveals that various polyphenols such as p nitrocatechol and 5 nitrobenzene 1 2 3 triol were generated during the plasma treatment these polyphenols may function as the reductants of cr vi since the abundant phenolic hydroxyl groups in polyphenols particularly the ortho phenolic hydroxyl groups have strong reducibility liu et al 2020 liu 2017 this result further clarifies the mechanism of cr vi reduction whereby pnp intermediates exert a significant effect on the reduction of cr vi 3 4 effect of working parameters on removal efficiency in wastewater treatment ph is a significant parameter fig 8 presents the reduction of cr vi and the degradation of pnp by microwave plasma under solutions with different ph values the figure shows that under acidic conditions the removal efficiency of cr vi was higher than that under neutral or basic conditions both with and without pnp when the initial ph of the solution was increased from 3 to 11 there was a decrease in the reduction efficiency of cr vi from 78 8 to 22 7 see fig 8 a with the addition of pnp the reduction efficiencies of cr vi showed a similar trend however when pnp was present the reduction efficiencies were much higher than without pnp for all ph values accordingly it is considered that pnp significantly enhances the removal of cr vi irrespective of ph value based on the above discussion it can be concluded that the reductive species for cr vi reduction in the liquid phase are the intermediates of pnp h and h2o2 at a ph of 6 hcro4 constitutes the majority of cr vi species whereas the major species is cro4 2 with ph 6 the oxidability of hcro4 is much stronger e0 hcro4 cr3 0 94 v ph 3 0 than cro4 2 e0 cro4 2 cr oh 3 0 56 v ph 7 0 which indicates that under an acidic condition cr vi is reduced more easily than under neutral or basic conditions zhang et al 2018 furthermore h2o2 is produced in abundance during plasma treatment chandana et al 2015b the standard electrode potential of h2o2 is 0 56 v which is lower than that of cr vi 1 08 v at ph 2 0 ke et al 2011 liu et al 2011 thus cr vi can be reduced to cr iii by h2o2 produced in an acidic medium eq 17 previous studies have reported the reduction rate of the reaction to be strongly dependent on the ph of the solution which decreases with increasing ph van niekerk et al 2007 theoretically acidic conditions should result in a higher cr vi reduction rate than under neutral or basic conditions this assumption is consistent with the experimental results presented in fig 8 a according to fig 8 b there was a marginal decrease in the removal efficiency of pnp as the initial ph increased interestingly there was no strong relationship between the removal efficiencies of pnp with or without cr vi and the ph level of the solution when the initial ph increased from 3 to 11 the removal efficiency of pnp in the presence of cr vi following 9 min s treatment decreased only by 10 7 from 83 8 to 73 1 which is comparable with the result for the absence of cr vi after 9 min s treatment the removal efficiency of pnp in the absence of cr vi decreased by 7 7 from 80 4 to 72 7 previous studies have shown the oxidation capacity of o h to decrease with increasing ph the oxidizing potential of o h radicals was shown to drop from 2 70 v at a ph of 3 0 to 2 34 v at a ph of 9 0 tang et al 2009 however compared with other plasma sources high frequency microwave plasma has higher electron densities and energies de la fuente et al 2017 in the microwave plasma system presented in the current paper the concentration of hydroxyl radicals near the plasma solution interface was very high which led to the degradation of nearly all the pnp at the interface consequently the main influence on the degradation of pnp was the diffusion rate from the bulk solution chen et al 2019 rather than the ph level or the addition of cr vi this study also investigated the effect of the flow rate of ar 4 12 l min on the simultaneous oxidation of pnp and the reduction of cr vi see fig s6 in support information notably an ar flow rate of 6 l min produced the highest removal efficiency for both pnp and cr vi when the ar flow rate exceeded 6 l min the removal efficiency of both pnp and cr vi remained almost unchanged besides experimental results revealed that the oxidation of pnp and the reduction of cr vi negatively correlated with the distance between the plasma outlet and the water s surface 5 30 mm see fig s7 in support information the related descriptions are given in s6 and s7 to exam the scale up possibility the volume of the mixed solution to be treated was magnified 20 times to 1 l simultaneous degradation of pnp and reduction of cr vi was also achieved with extended treatment time the results and detailed discussion are demonstrated in fig s7 and s8 in supporting information respectively after 300 min s treatment the efficiency of pnp degradation and cr vi reduction were 81 1 and 94 7 respectively if the processing time increased to 720 min neither pnp nor cr vi could be detected in the treated solution 4 conclusion as far as the authors are aware we are the first to use an electrodeless microwave atmospheric pressure plasma jet for the simultaneous removal of cr vi and pnp the experimental results demonstrated high efficiency in the fast simultaneous removal of cr vi and pnp the removal efficiencies of cr vi and pnp in the mixed solution were 96 1 and 94 0 respectively the measured toc removal efficiency revealed that after a 15 min treatment approximately 30 2 of the pnp had been mineralized the addition of pnp significantly enhanced the removal of cr vi whereas the addition of cr vi slightly enhanced the removal of pnp based on the reducibility of the plasma treated pnp solution and the reductive intermediates of pnp including various polyphenols detected by hplc ms it was confirmed that the pnp intermediates produced during this study s microwave plasma treatment were mainly responsible for the reduction of cr vi additionally the study proposed a possible pathway for pnp degradation the experimental results suggest that long lived h2o2 and other short lived reductive species e g h also contribute to the reduction of cr vi some key factors that could influence the simultaneous removal of pnp and cr vi were also investigated the reduction efficiency of cr vi decreased as the solution s ph increased whereas the degradation of pnp remained largely unaffected the improvement in the reduction of cr vi with the addition of pnp was found to be valid across all the ph values tested gas velocity was found to slightly affect the co removal of cr vi and pnp and the optimal ar flow rate was defined at 6 l min the degradation efficiency of pnp and the reduction efficiency of cr vi were both confirmed to decrease as the distance between the plasma outlet and the water surface increased this research and its findings provide the possibility of a fast efficient single step treatment for wastewater contaminated by organic pollutants and heavy metals further research could expand the categories of co contamination pollutants and the concept of using intermediates in the treatment of wastewater with complex components could also be explored declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

16282,traditional runoff control measures ignore the spatial imbalance of regional pressures thereby failing to achieve a site specific placement for green and grey infrastructure simultaneously a multi criterion decision making framework for runoff control infrastructure spatial planning was therefore developed in this study the pressure state response framework was applied to creatively match the pressure induced adjustment demands with the infrastructure effectiveness the pressures were quantified from the perspective of environment economy and ecology on a grid scale states were considered as the relative priority of regional pressure adjustment demand in multiple perspectives responses were presented as state targeted green and grey infrastructure placement multi perspective effectiveness of different green and grey infrastructure was simultaneously evaluated at an effective scale of controlling 1 m3 s runoff for comparison methods such as data mining hydrological model simulation and remote sensing inversion were combined to quantify the regional pressures the capital investment and ecological impact of infrastructures were quantified from a life cycle perspective a case study was carried out in wuhan china the study area was clustered by gridded pressure into three regions in region ⅰ ecological and environmental pressure were of higher weight in region ⅱ the environmental pressure was dominant in region ⅲ the ecological pressure took precedence over the environmental and economic constraints the area ratios of the region ⅰ ⅱ and ⅲ were 43 36 and 21 respectively the result indicated a synergy and spatial heterogeneity of multi perspective pressures and further demonstrating that expert experience tends to fail to weigh the multi function of green and grey infrastructures for coping with the pressures results also stated that green infrastructures were more acceptable in areas that aspire to achieve simultaneous runoff control and ecological improvement the decision making framework developed in this study can maximize the overall performance by providing targeted infrastructure placement solutions graphical abstract image graphical

urban development and natural endowments need to be balanced when dealing with threats from flooding resource depletion and ecological degradation effective mitigation of regional pressures requires targeted infrastructure implementation kuller et al 2019 ronchi et al 2020 the benefits of green and grey runoff control infrastructures are extended from an environmental point of view to the economic and ecological perspective liu et al 2021b teixeira et al 2021 and their multiple benefits are highly localized meerow and newell 2017 specifically the performance of the infrastructure depends on where and to what extent benefits are gained zhang and chui 2018 spatial analysis of the multifunctional suitability of infrastructure has been extensively carried out ronchi et al 2020 venter et al 2021 however the research gap exists as follows on the one hand the subjective preference of managers is carried out to identify the priority areas for infrastructure placement jia et al 2015 tran et al 2020 while ignoring the local multi perspective pressure on the other hand only green infrastructures are considered ronchi et al 2020 venter et al 2021 while the grey infrastructures which have been proven to be cost friendly and effective in some areas dong et al 2017 liu et al 2021b are overlooked in spatial planning simultaneously with green infrastructure multifunctional trade offs are crucial in the spatial planning of infrastructure garcía et al 2020 to cope with the complex multi criteria decision making problem a pressure state response psr framework was applied in which pressure and target placement of infrastructures were consistently considered by systematical indices tammy et al 2011 the framework has been widely used to propose adaptive decision making solutions for water resources management and infrastructure placement kaur et al 2020 spanò et al 2017 zare et al 2019 a gap however still exists in developing a spatial decision making framework for both green and grey infrastructure and addressing regional pressure from multiple perspectives trade offs between regional economic development and nature conservation exist in urban management processes di matteo et al 2019 rasmussen et al 2021 as for environmental pressure high and early runoff peaks trigger flooding and pose a risk to residential safety and economic development badrzadeh et al 2015 simultaneously non point source pollutants cause environmental degradation of water bodies gasperi et al 2010 runoff quantity and quality control have been identified as key aspects of urban management zhang et al 2020 but previous studies have rarely considered the spatial heterogeneity of pressure adjustment demands and lacked targeted runoff control strategies in terms of economic perspective the challenges of limited economic investment inadequate land use and ageing infrastructure are faced during the urban expansion rasmussen et al 2021 inevitably restricting the construction and effectiveness of infrastructure previous studies have failed to realize a quantitative match between local economic status and infrastructure lifecycle stages investment and also the extent of financial support and economic pressure is not included in the decision making process for infrastructure cost benefit trade offs di matteo et al 2019 jia et al 2015 from the ecological perspective the concept of ecosystem service value is applied to evaluate the regional ecological pressure costanza et al 1998 it refers to the capital value of the services that humans derive from ecosystems including the elimination of waste the supply of material and energy and the provision of sustainability and comfort for inhabitants de groot et al 2012 these factors are localized by some researchers taking into account expert advice and residents understanding garcía et al 2020 xie et al 2015 the mismatch between urban development and ecological endowments simultaneously leads to an uneven spatial distribution of ecosystem pressures kassouri 2021 the pressures from the environmental economic ecological perspective present synergy and spatial heterogeneity making a hierarchical

surface infiltration and detention controlling runoff in a more flexible and resilient manner li and davis 2016 zhang and chui 2018 the ecological benefits of green infrastructure in terms of landscape aesthetics heat island effect mitigation and energy savings in buildings have been widely discussed teixeira et al 2021 wu et al 2021 grey infrastructures are traditional stormwater

investment bisinella de faria et al 2015 liu et al 2021b green grey infrastructure coupled systems tend to have high resilience dong et al 2017 coupling optimization of green and grey infrastructures is often designed to achieve system objectives alves et al 2019 bakhshipour et al 2019 but the lack of analysis of the suitability of specific types of infrastructure weakens the interpretability of the scheme trade offs between capital investment and runoff control function have been more frequently discussed in previous studies alves et al 2019 jia et al 2015 but in most studies the investment analysis has been placed on construction stage rather than the life cycle stages including operation and maintenance stage in addition although ecological impacts have also been evaluated currently dai et al 2021 teixeira et al 2021 these evaluations lack systematicity considerations together with environmental and economic effectiveness trade offs are necessary between green and grey infrastructure when aiming to achieve environmental economic and ecological goals simultaneously di matteo et al 2019 liu et al 2021b a quantitative framework that matches the environmental economic ecological effectiveness of infrastructure with the regional pressure adjustment demands contributes to targeted infrastructure spatial planning thereby maximizing the overall performance considering the limitations of existing research a psr framework was applied in this study to develop a multi criteria spatial decision making strategy for the targeted placement of green and grey runoff control infrastructures specifically pressures were quantified from the perspective of environmental economic and ecological on a grid scale by hydrological model and data mining methods states were considered as the relative priority of regional pressure adjustment demand in multiple perspectives and were compared and hierarchically calculated into weight values responses were presented as state targeted green and grey infrastructure placements the performance rank of infrastructure was obtained by summarizing the weighted infrastructure effectiveness in multiple perspectives thus achieving spatial planning and the targeted suggestions for zoning infrastructure placement 2 methods and data 2 1 study area wuhan is the capital of hubei province and is located in the middle of china the total area of wuhan is 8569 2 km2 this study focused on the developed zone which covers 2357 5 km2 and the area ratio of water body green land include farmland forest and grassland and impervious

census in 2019 the permanent residents of wuhan were 11 2 million with 9 0 million urban residents accounting for 80 of the total population 2 2 methodology to maximize the benefits of runoff control infrastructures the psr framework was applied and a quantitative multi criteria spatial decision making strategy for targeted infrastructure placement was developed relative data acquisition sources were listed in supplementary information si table a 1 the study was carried out with the following steps as shown in fig 2 the steps after clustering were illustrated by cluster1 i pressure attributes

identification of state 2 3 1 regional environmental pressure for the quantification of regional flooding pressure the soil and water assessment tool swat was applied to calculate the required runoff volume reduction rate in each grid parameters for swat were gathered from previous studies in the same region of wuhan mu 2019 yang 2018 the 10 year return period design storm was calculated following the local design storm intensity formula and then used as input data to simulate runoff wmwb 2013 the warning water level and the average water level in flood season of different water bodies are set based on historical monitoring data as shown in si fig b 1 the rise of receiving water level was simply calculated by dividing the runoff volume by the water surface area in conjunction with the flow path the runoff control pressures of the receiving water bodies were traced upwards to each gird the required runoff volume reduction rate was calculated by eq 1 1 r r v r i v r u n o f f s w a t e r

module in envi software to remove the atmospheric noises then two key water quality indicators total suspend solid tss and total phosphorus tp were selected for their both local importance and good correlation with remotely sensed imagery gao et al 2015 jiang et al 2021 the optical relationships between the water quality indicators and remote sensing data were extracted from field experiments in

regional economic pressure in terms of regional economic pressure the land value represents the opportunity cost of land occupied by infrastructure regional gross domestic product gdp is related to the financial support that the government can provide for infrastructure equipment and material assets and economic point of interest poi data on public activities business activities and transportation activities can attribute the intensity of economic activity the public activities factor was described by the density of park school pharmacy hospital and bank the business activities factor was described by the density of hotels restaurants supermarkets shopping malls the transportation activities factor was described by the density of highway entrances bus stops toll gates and parking lots usually high value for land and economic activities limits the application of high investment infrastructure during the stages of onsite construction and transportation operation and maintenance however high gdp values normally guarantee for high investment infrastructure in the equipment and material assets stage the source of land value gdp data and poi data were listed in si table a 1 2 3 3 regional ecological pressure regional ecological pressure was represented by the ecological service values from a monetized perspective calculate as si b 2 the quantification of ecological service value was calculated by multiplying the different land use areas and the value per unit area equivalent factor of each land use as shown in si table b 1 peng et al 2021 xie et al 2015 the ecological service values of each 1km2 grid were calculated the values in the aspects of water resources supply climate regulation atmospheric pollution regulation water purification species conservation and landscape aesthetic were considered as factors to detect regional ecological pressures 2 3 4 identification of state cluster grids characterized by multi perspective pressure were clustered to identify the state firstly pressures were normalized for comparison secondly the k means method was applied for grid clustering ferraro 2021 finally the average values of normalized criteria were hierarchically integrated as weight which was summed to 1 thus the regional state was identified high values for flooding pressure water pollution pressure land value and economic activity sub criteria means high pressure and were normalized by eq 4 conversely high values for regional gdp water resources supply climate regulation atmospheric purification water purification species conservation and landscape aesthetic indicated abundant resources and low pressure and were normalized by eq 5 4 x a x i x m i n x m a x x m i n 5 x b x m a x x i x m a x x m i n where x a and

verified to ensure reliability si c 1 c 2 the 10 year return period intensity storm was designed wmwb 2013 and used as input precipitation data to simulate runoff to compare the runoff volume control function different types of green infrastructures were each simulated individually in swmm the infrastructure s effective scale was defined as the scale required to fully capture 1m3 s runoff runoff control curves of different infrastructures were shown in si c figure c 3 where a larger scale implied a weaker control function per unit scale the runoff control function of grey infrastructure was derived from the measured values of the local engineering projects hanhua 2009 li et al 2016 sun 2019 zeng and xie 2021 as shown in si c 2 1 2 runoff water quality control function of infrastructures

capital investment indices were quantified by the life cycle cost evaluation method for the stages of onsite construction and transportation equipment and material assets operation and maintenance costs and ecological impact were normalized to the functional unit in their life span as shown in si c table c 2 for quantitative comparison infrastructure investments were normalized at a uniform

identification of multi perspectives regional pressure 3 1 1 regional environmental pressure the storage capacity and service area of receiving water bodies show spatial heterogeneity which contributes to the spatial variation of the regional runoff control urgency as shown in fig 3 a a runoff reduction pressure of up to approximately 30 was identified along the eastern and southwestern banks of the yangtze river this is in accordance with the waterlogging points distribution described in existing studies liu et al 2021a rising water levels in receiving water bodies during the flood season as shown in si fig b 1 topping off the outflow from the drainage system accompanied by the restriction of the warning water level both lead to regional drainage pressure a residual runoff storage capacity of up to approximately 50 was identified in the northwestern bank of the yangtze river and was mapped in fig 3 a a residual runoff storage capacity indicated that in situ storage of runoff was implementable on these grids and an effective strategy to release pressure in the eastern and southwestern banks of the yangtze river is to vacate the lake in advance of the flood season and reserve sufficient space for storage accordingly a spatially diverted runoff regulation scheme was detected whereby runoff in the high pressure grid was suggested to be channelled to the urban periphery or the northwestern bank of the yangtze river with light pressure for adjustment the uneven spatial distribution of land use and water self purification capacity induced the spatial heterogeneity of water polluted status as illustrated in fig 3 b the tss concentration in related waters ranged from 18 9 mg l to 33 3 mg l from a spatial perspective the tss concentration of the river is above 27 0 mg l which is higher than that of the lakes in wuhan this is mainly attributed to the higher fluidity which prevented tss to deposit in rivers than lakes the concentration of tp in related waters is under 0 2 mg l in the mainstream of rivers the tp concentration is approximately 15 lower than that of lakes this also can be attributed to the higher fluidity and self purification ability of rivers compared to lakes previous studies ignored the natural runoff regulation endowments while implementing an indiscriminate runoff adjustment strategy throughout the region di matteo et al 2019 the identification of spatial heterogeneity of runoff quantity and quality pressure further proved that a targeted runoff control infrastructure contributes to maximizing the systematical effectiveness 3 1 2 regional economic condition the uneven spatial distribution of the opportunity cost of land occupation local financial support and the economic activity dynamics constrained investment in the life cycle stages of infrastructures as shown in fig 4 a b the areas with higher land value were closely distributed around the yangtze river similarly the higher grid gdp was also closely concentrated in the high urbanized areas represented by a high ratio of impervious underlying high land value areas were more dispersed than high gdp areas which was due to the expansion of population and urbanization gdp high value areas also showed a greater density around water bodies which indicated that socio economic development activities were largely dependant on the water system as shown in fig 4 c poi data were analysed to characterize the heat of human related socioeconomic activities the trend envelope areas which were obtained by directional distribution tool in arcgis software and covered 90 of poi ratio of public activities business activities and transportation activities were about 1 1 7 2 9 this indicated the public activities in wuhan are more concentrated while the transportation activities showed the extensive property the ratio of the long and short axes of the trend envelope for public business and transportation activities were 1 1 1 1 4 1 and 1 5 1 respectively the results indicated that the yangtze river is certainly the main carrier for wuhan s business and transportation in previous infrastructure optimization programs economic factors were considered only in terms of cost di matteo et al 2019 wang et al 2016 ignoring the impact of regional land values financial surplus and activity dynamics on the various stages of infrastructure development the multi perspective description of economic pressures helped to propose constraints for different stages in the infrastructure life cycle investment and thus to develop targeted runoff control strategies 3 1 3 ecological resource distribution ecological service values showed spatial unevenness which differs greatly from the pressure distribution of the economy and environment water resources supply climate regulation and landscape aesthetic benefits were presented here as typical ecological value evaluation factors while atmospheric purification water purification and species conservation which followed a similar trend were placed in the si fig b 5 as shown in fig 5 and si fig b 5 water resources supply capacity was abundant in the vicinity of water bodies value for local climate regulation atmospheric purification water purification species conservation and landscape aesthetic was higher in the urban periphery where higher vegetation cover contributed to a strong ecological resilience and adjustment capacity the ecological pressure in the urban periphery was also reduced due to the lower density of human activities and the less release of pollutants green infrastructure has been proven by many studies to have a compensatory value on ecosystems liu et al 2016 teixeira et al 2021 however previous infrastructure optimization schemes failed to simultaneously trade off the effectiveness of ecosystem pressure alleviation with runoff control and cost savings teixeira et al 2021 wang et al 2016 which may lead to the construction of some infrastructure increasing the pressure on the ecosystem the unevenness of regional ecological pressure put forward targeted requirements for infrastructure placement 3 2 quantitative assessment of green and grey infrastructure multi perspective effectiveness a quantitative comparison of green and grey infrastructure runoff control functions was achieved by identifying the effective scale of infrastructure under this constraint a larger effective scale meant a weaker unitary runoff control function and vice versa as shown in table 2 st ri br had the top three runoff volume control functions the ability of rf was lower because it was constrained by the regional reuse water usage br and ri had the strongest pollutant remove function in both green and grey infrastructures respectively higher cost implied greater economic pressure at the specific life cycle stage and suggested the infrastructure should be built in an area with correspondingly lower economic sensitivity as shown in table 3 the major contributors to different infrastructures cost were at distinct stages due to their structural and functional diversity ri was the highest investment infrastructure with a total cost 13 8 times higher than the lowest pumping station for br gr vs pp and st equipment assets occupied the dominant part of the capital investment for rp ri and rf maintenance and operation stages cost most in the life cycle runoff control strategies with high ecological impact were suggested to be implemented in areas with lower ecological pressure as shown in table 4 the total ecological impact of ri was the highest 11 4 times higher than the lowest impact of br habitat alteration impact was mostly from rf which took 28 8 proportion and it should be mitigated in areas of low aesthetic landscape value ri impact most in the aspects of se fpm gw we wrc and it took 51 1 41 9 52 6 37 0 and 46 1 ecological impacts respectively which meant it was more tolerated in a region with higher species conservation value greater atmospheric purification ability higher climate adjustment function and with higher water purification and water resource supply capacity rf was the most ecological friendly infrastructure in the aspects of ha se fpm gw we green and grey infrastructures coupled systems have been proved to have high resilience dong et al 2017 and can realize system objectives alves et al 2019 bakhshipour et al 2019 however only the systemic results were focused on by previous studies which were poorly interpretable and failed to evaluate the regional suitability of specific types of infrastructure quantitative evaluation of the green and grey infrastructure in a uniform system made it possible for multi perspective effectiveness comparison it is also a prerequisite for simultaneous spatial decision making for green and grey infrastructures 3 3 state identification and adaptive decision making of infrastructures 3 3 1 state identification driven by pressures the distribution of clustered state regions indicated the spatial heterogeneity of the multi perspective pressures best cluster performance minimum sum of squared errors sse was obtained when the grids were clustered into three categories as shown in fig 6 the region ⅰ took 43 of the research area and was mainly located in a part of the high urbanized areas and the urban periphery a large proportion of water bodies were classified in region ⅰ the region ⅱ which took 36 of the research area was located in the transitional area between the high urbanized region and urban periphery and suffered intensive runoff quantity or quality control pressure moreover the ecological resources were more abundant the region ⅲ was partly located in the high urbanized areas and partly located in the southeastern banks of the yangtze river where ecological resources were scarce the synergistic effect of multiple pressures resulted in a distributed region location the pressures in each cluster were integrated as weights to represent the priority of the adjustment demands and the characteristic of each cluster was shown in fig 7 in region ⅰ ecological and environmental criteria were of high weight and urgently demanded to be adjusted the weight values were both 0 4 while the economic pressure was relatively less in terms of sub criteria the pressure of different ecological factors occupied similar importance the demand for runoff water quantity control was the most critical aspect for environmental criteria took 64 pressure and more investment was suggested to cope with the pressure of equipment acquisition took 67 pressure in region ⅱ the environmental criterion was the dominant urgent pressure factor the weight value was 0 5 and needed to be given primary consideration in infrastructure placements followed by the constraints of regional economic pressure and then ecological pressure as for sub criteria the runoff quantity control should be considered with higher priority took about 65 importance financial expenditure pressure was given the highest weight in economic pressure attributes and water resources shortage was the most essential factor to be considered in maintaining the ecological conditions in region ⅲ the ecological criterion the weight value was 0 5 took precedence over the environmental and economic constraints which indicated the urgency of relieving ecological pressure the six sub criteria of ecological services were under roughly equal pressure the constraints of financial expenditure pressures were emphasized in the economic components took 66 importance and the control of runoff quality occupied a more important position than quantity notably in region ⅰ part of the high urbanized areas presented the same adjustment state as the urban periphery that is economic constraints were less important than environmental and ecological criteria this finding was driven by two mechanisms the first was that the markedly high environmental and ecological pressures in high urbanized areas trivialize economic pressures the second was that low economic dynamism in the urban periphery eliminated the corresponding criteria importance in region ⅱ a state was presented where the adjustment urgency for runoff control took precedence over economic savings followed by ecological conservation the region ⅲ was partly located in the areas with abundant financial support but scarce ecological resources and partly located in the area with low economic sensitivity and relatively poor ecological resources either way regional ecological pressure was identified to be a key indicator restricting infrastructure construction in region ⅲ the result indicated a synergy of environmental economic social criteria that is the same adjustment urgency state may be driven by different combinations of pressures this situation inevitably exceeds the managers perception further demonstrating the need for the quantitative multi criteria spatial decision making framework of infrastructure expert experience and stakeholder preference are often used to weigh the different criteria in previous studies jia et al 2015 tran et al 2020 experience tends to fail in quantifying the weights when dealing with systems that incorporate multi perspective pressures the quantified pressure provides the possibility of criteria comparison to analyse the priority of adjustment urgency namely the weight as shown in this study the contest of multi perspective pressures showed strong regional characteristics and spatial heterogeneity which move beyond empirical judgement this finding indicated the considerable requirement of the quantitative multi criteria spatial decision making framework for infrastructure 3 3 2 adaptive decision making of green and grey infrastructures performance rank of infrastructure was obtained by summarizing the weighted multi effectiveness thus achieving spatial planning and the targeted suggestions for zoning infrastructure placement as shown in fig 8 br was the most preferred infrastructure in region i and its superiority lied in the high runoff control capacity and low ecological impact st was the first choice in region ii caused by its superior runoff control efficiency and its low cost at life cycle stages rp was the most superior infrastructure in region ⅲ because it achieved efficient runoff control in an ecologically low impact and economically friendly manner in summary green infrastructure ranked top in region i where ecological and environmental pressure alleviation were of high priority simultaneously grey infrastructure ranked top in region ii and region ⅲ where ecological or environmental pressure alleviation was of high priority grey infrastructures ranked up from urban periphery to the high urbanized areas while green infrastructures were more preferred in urban periphery and urban core areas this suggested that green infrastructures were more acceptable in areas that aspire to achieve simultaneous runoff control and ecological improvement grey infrastructure performed either high runoff control functions or minor ecological impact but lacked the advantage of balancing environmental economic ecological effectiveness previous studies failed to provide the targeted requirement for multi function of infrastructure according to regional pressure dai et al 2021 di matteo et al 2019 this study demonstrated that green infrastructure tended to exhibit comprehensive effectiveness of the environmental economic ecological perspective while grey infrastructure presented outstanding benefits in a single perspective thereby the identification of spatial pressures will guide the targeted emphasis on specific functions of green and grey infrastructures to maximize performance 3 4 limitations and further work a quantitative multi criteria spatial decision making framework for infrastructure planning was established in this study deficiencies in previous studies such as the lack of quantitively identifying pressure in multi perspective garcía et al 2020 rasmussen et al 2021 the inability to hierarchically evaluate green and grey infrastructure in a uniformed system dai et al 2021 teixeira et al 2021 and the difficulty of matching regional status with infrastructure effectiveness di matteo et al 2019 ronchi et al 2020 were remedied to some extent however some limitations remain for example supplementary field monitoring data are essential to support the development of localized inversion models for studies carried out in other regions monetization of ecological services is an intuitive approach rather than a necessity the assessment of regional ecological pressure can also be carried out in combination with data on aspects such as localized water and atmospheric environmental capacity to improve the resilience of urban management it is necessary to integrate elements such as urbanization and climate change into the framework thus making dynamic decision making possible the pressure exerted by combined system overflows csos on urban drainage systems and receiving water bodies cannot be ignored this study only analysed the compensatory demands of runoff control infrastructure on regional integrated water pollution pressure runoff control pressure mitigation is emphasized by infrastructure the spatial heterogeneity of csos distribution may affect the spatial distribution of runoff pressure and thus affect the decision making and placement of runoff control infrastructures for more accurate identification of runoff control pressure the csos should be quantified and considered as a pressure element in further studies in addition the multi criteria decision making process was carried out in this study meaning that the suitable rank was obtained and the infrastructures were compared independently studies on infrastructure coupled effectiveness and the scale configuration corresponding to the regional state were not available yet these factors are recommended for subsequent studies 4 conclusion a pressure driven multi criteria decision making framework for infrastructure spatial planning was developed in this study specifically we obtained the following important progress through a case study for a metropolis wuhan city in central china 1 a runoff reduction pressure of up to approximately 30 was identified along the certain areas tss concentration of rivers was higher than that of lakes the tp concentration in revers is approximately 15 lower than that of lakes the economically sensitive areas were distributed in the high urbanized areas the ecological compensation capacity was high in the urban periphery regional pressures from multiple perspectives showed spatial heterogeneity 2 bioretention facilities br and rainwater interception treatment facilities ri both performed well in runoff control ri has the highest capital investment and the largest ecological impact costing approximately 13 8 times more than the rainwater pumping station which was the least expensive option ri has an approximately 11 4 times larger ecological impact than the br which had the least impact 3 green infrastructures were more acceptable in areas that aspire to achieve simultaneous runoff control and ecological improvement grey infrastructure performed either high runoff control functions or minor ecological impact but lacked the advantage of balancing effectiveness thus the infrastructure performance can be

16282,traditional runoff control measures ignore the spatial imbalance of regional pressures thereby failing to achieve a site specific placement for green and grey infrastructure simultaneously a multi criterion decision making framework for runoff control infrastructure spatial planning was therefore developed in this study the pressure state response framework was applied to creatively match the pressure induced adjustment demands with the infrastructure effectiveness the pressures were quantified from the perspective of environment economy and ecology on a grid scale states were considered as the relative priority of regional pressure adjustment demand in multiple perspectives responses were presented as state targeted green and grey infrastructure placement multi perspective effectiveness of different green and grey infrastructure was simultaneously evaluated at an effective scale of controlling 1 m3 s runoff for comparison methods such as data mining hydrological model simulation and remote sensing inversion were combined to quantify the regional pressures the capital investment and ecological impact of infrastructures were quantified from a life cycle perspective a case study was carried out in wuhan china the study area was clustered by gridded pressure into three regions in region ⅰ ecological and environmental pressure were of higher weight in region ⅱ the environmental pressure was dominant in region ⅲ the ecological pressure took precedence over the environmental and economic constraints the area ratios of the region ⅰ ⅱ and ⅲ were 43 36 and 21 respectively the result indicated a synergy and spatial heterogeneity of multi perspective pressures and further demonstrating that expert experience tends to fail to weigh the multi function of green and grey infrastructures for coping with the pressures results also stated that green infrastructures were more acceptable in areas that aspire to achieve simultaneous runoff control and ecological improvement the decision making framework developed in this study can maximize the overall performance by providing targeted infrastructure placement solutions graphical abstract image graphical

urban development and natural endowments need to be balanced when dealing with threats from flooding resource depletion and ecological degradation effective mitigation of regional pressures requires targeted infrastructure implementation kuller et al 2019 ronchi et al 2020 the benefits of green and grey runoff control infrastructures are extended from an environmental point of view to the economic and ecological perspective liu et al 2021b teixeira et al 2021 and their multiple benefits are highly localized meerow and newell 2017 specifically the performance of the infrastructure depends on where and to what extent benefits are gained zhang and chui 2018 spatial analysis of the multifunctional suitability of infrastructure has been extensively carried out ronchi et al 2020 venter et al 2021 however the research gap exists as follows on the one hand the subjective preference of managers is carried out to identify the priority areas for infrastructure placement jia et al 2015 tran et al 2020 while ignoring the local multi perspective pressure on the other hand only green infrastructures are considered ronchi et al 2020 venter et al 2021 while the grey infrastructures which have been proven to be cost friendly and effective in some areas dong et al 2017 liu et al 2021b are overlooked in spatial planning simultaneously with green infrastructure multifunctional trade offs are crucial in the spatial planning of infrastructure garcía et al 2020 to cope with the complex multi criteria decision making problem a pressure state response psr framework was applied in which pressure and target placement of infrastructures were consistently considered by systematical indices tammy et al 2011 the framework has been widely used to propose adaptive decision making solutions for water resources management and infrastructure placement kaur et al 2020 spanò et al 2017 zare et al 2019 a gap however still exists in developing a spatial decision making framework for both green and grey infrastructure and addressing regional pressure from multiple perspectives trade offs between regional economic development and nature conservation exist in urban management processes di matteo et al 2019 rasmussen et al 2021 as for environmental pressure high and early runoff peaks trigger flooding and pose a risk to residential safety and economic development badrzadeh et al 2015 simultaneously non point source pollutants cause environmental degradation of water bodies gasperi et al 2010 runoff quantity and quality control have been identified as key aspects of urban management zhang et al 2020 but previous studies have rarely considered the spatial heterogeneity of pressure adjustment demands and lacked targeted runoff control strategies in terms of economic perspective the challenges of limited economic investment inadequate land use and ageing infrastructure are faced during the urban expansion rasmussen et al 2021 inevitably restricting the construction and effectiveness of infrastructure previous studies have failed to realize a quantitative match between local economic status and infrastructure lifecycle stages investment and also the extent of financial support and economic pressure is not included in the decision making process for infrastructure cost benefit trade offs di matteo et al 2019 jia et al 2015 from the ecological perspective the concept of ecosystem service value is applied to evaluate the regional ecological pressure costanza et al 1998 it refers to the capital value of the services that humans derive from ecosystems including the elimination of waste the supply of material and energy and the provision of sustainability and comfort for inhabitants de groot et al 2012 these factors are localized by some researchers taking into account expert advice and residents understanding garcía et al 2020 xie et al 2015 the mismatch between urban development and ecological endowments simultaneously leads to an uneven spatial distribution of ecosystem pressures kassouri 2021 the pressures from the environmental economic ecological perspective present synergy and spatial heterogeneity making a hierarchical and quantitative description essential to identifying a regional state in terms of the effectiveness of runoff control infrastructure source orientated green infrastructure increases underlying surface infiltration and detention controlling runoff in a more flexible and resilient manner li and davis 2016 zhang and chui 2018 the ecological benefits of green infrastructure in terms of landscape aesthetics heat island effect mitigation and energy savings in buildings have been widely discussed teixeira et al 2021 wu et al 2021 grey infrastructures are traditional stormwater management strategies that achieve regional targets through rapid drainage and centralized treatment dong et al 2017 liu et al 2021b and they have a clearer asset life depreciation and return on investment bisinella de faria et al 2015 liu et al 2021b green grey infrastructure coupled systems tend to have high resilience dong et al 2017 coupling optimization of green and grey infrastructures is often designed to achieve system objectives alves et al 2019 bakhshipour et al 2019 but the lack of analysis of the suitability of specific types of infrastructure weakens the interpretability of the scheme trade offs between capital investment and runoff control function have been more frequently discussed in previous studies alves et al 2019 jia et al 2015 but in most studies the investment analysis has been placed on construction stage rather than the life cycle stages including operation and maintenance stage in addition although ecological impacts have also been evaluated currently dai et al 2021 teixeira et al 2021 these evaluations lack systematicity considerations together with environmental and economic effectiveness trade offs are necessary between green and grey infrastructure when aiming to achieve environmental economic and ecological goals simultaneously di matteo et al 2019 liu et al 2021b a quantitative framework that matches the environmental economic ecological effectiveness of infrastructure with the regional pressure adjustment demands contributes to targeted infrastructure spatial planning thereby maximizing the overall performance considering the limitations of existing research a psr framework was applied in this study to develop a multi criteria spatial decision making strategy for the targeted placement of green and grey runoff control infrastructures specifically pressures were quantified from the perspective of environmental economic and ecological on a grid scale by hydrological model and data mining methods states were considered as the relative priority of regional pressure adjustment demand in multiple perspectives and were compared and hierarchically calculated into weight values responses were presented as state targeted green and grey infrastructure placements the performance rank of infrastructure was obtained by summarizing the weighted infrastructure effectiveness in multiple perspectives thus achieving spatial planning and the targeted suggestions for zoning infrastructure placement 2 methods and data 2 1 study area wuhan is the capital of hubei province and is located in the middle of china the total area of wuhan is 8569 2 km2 this study focused on the developed zone which covers 2357 5 km2 and the area ratio of water body green land include farmland forest and grassland and impervious surface are about 11 35 and 54 respectively as shown in fig 1 the study area is an urbanized region that is relatively developed and with a lower increase in urbanization rate less than 0 3 in 2019 in addition the drainage pipe network diversion system retrofit has been completed in the study area the combined sewer system had transferred to a separate sewer system wuhan lies in the middle reaches of the yangtze river the annual rainfall in wuhan was 1 150 mm 1 450 mm during the recent 10 years mainly from june to august accounting for about 40 of the annual rainfall according to the latest census in 2019 the permanent residents of wuhan were 11 2 million with 9 0 million urban residents accounting for 80 of the total population 2 2 methodology to maximize the benefits of runoff control infrastructures the psr framework was applied and a quantitative multi criteria spatial decision making strategy for targeted infrastructure placement was developed relative data acquisition sources were listed in supplementary information si table a 1 the study was carried out with the following steps as shown in fig 2 the steps after clustering were illustrated by cluster1 i pressure attributes of environment economy ecology were quantified by data mining method hydrological model simulation and remote sensing inversion methods on the 1km2 grid scale pressures were then normalized to 0 1 intervals for comparison ii the regional state was identified by clustering grids the normalized multi perspective pressures in each cluster were compared and the average value of each index was hierarchically integrated as the weight value that was summed to 1 iii environmental economic ecological effectiveness of different infrastructure was detected by the hydrological model and life cycle analysis methods the effectiveness was also normalized to 0 1 intervals for comparison iv overall performance of infrastructure was obtained by summarizing the weighted normalized multi effectiveness and performance ranks were presented for targeted spatial decision making of infrastructures the key concepts in the framework were defined as follows pressure regional scarcity degree in environment economy and ecology state the relative priority of regional pressure adjustment demand in environment economy and ecology response multi criteria decision making for runoff control infrastructure placement considering both suitability for a given state and effectiveness of infrastructure adjustment demand the urgency to alleviate the scarcity of the resource effectiveness inherent characteristics of infrastructure such as runoff control function cost and ecological impact weight the weighting factor showing the relative importance of a normalized pressure which summed to 1 performance sum of weighted effectiveness relating to environment economic and ecology multi perspective in environmental economic and ecological terms 2 3 quantification of pressures and identification of state 2 3 1 regional environmental pressure for the quantification of regional flooding pressure the soil and water assessment tool swat was applied to calculate the required runoff volume reduction rate in each grid parameters for swat were gathered from previous studies in the same region of wuhan mu 2019 yang 2018 the 10 year return period design storm was calculated following the local design storm intensity formula and then used as input data to simulate runoff wmwb 2013 the warning water level and the average water level in flood season of different water bodies are set based on historical monitoring data as shown in si fig b 1 the rise of receiving water level was simply calculated by dividing the runoff volume by the water surface area in conjunction with the flow path the runoff control pressures of the receiving water bodies were traced upwards to each gird the required runoff volume reduction rate was calculated by eq 1 1 r r v r i v r u n o f f s w a t e r l f s l w s w a t e r ω g r i d i v r u n o f f where r r v r i is the required runoff volume reduction rate of the i th grid v r u n o f f is the runoff volume which is simulated by swat model s w a t e r is the surface area of receiving water body l f s is the average water level in flood season l w is the warning water level of the corresponding receiving water ω g r i d i is the ratio of the runoff yield of the i th grid to the total runoff yield amount of the basin water pollution pressure was represented by key water quality indicators in corresponding receiving water bodies of each grid which were updated inversed from 30m resolution landsat8 satellite imagery in this study the remotely sensed imagery gained from landsat8 was firstly corrected using flaash atmospheric correction module in envi software to remove the atmospheric noises then two key water quality indicators total suspend solid tss and total phosphorus tp were selected for their both local importance and good correlation with remotely sensed imagery gao et al 2015 jiang et al 2021 the optical relationships between the water quality indicators and remote sensing data were extracted from field experiments in previous studies as eq 2 3 and these formulas had been calibrated and validated by actual monitoring data in the research site qiao xiaojing 2013 ting 2018 2 y t s s 14 801 6 152 ln b b l u e 0 074 ln

regional economic pressure in terms of regional economic pressure the land value represents the opportunity cost of land occupied by infrastructure regional gross domestic product gdp is related to the financial support that the government can provide for infrastructure equipment and material assets and economic point of interest poi data on public activities business activities and transportation activities can attribute the intensity of economic activity the public activities factor was described by the density of park school pharmacy hospital and bank the business activities factor was described by the density of hotels restaurants supermarkets shopping malls the transportation activities factor was described by the density of highway entrances bus stops toll gates and parking lots usually high value for land and economic activities limits the application of high investment infrastructure during the stages of onsite construction and transportation operation and maintenance however high gdp values normally guarantee for high investment infrastructure in the equipment and material assets stage the source of land value gdp data and poi data were listed in si table a 1 2 3 3 regional ecological pressure regional ecological pressure was represented by the ecological service values from a monetized perspective calculate as si b 2 the quantification of ecological service value was calculated by multiplying the different land use areas and the value per unit area equivalent factor of each land use as shown in si table b 1 peng et al 2021 xie et al 2015 the ecological service values of each 1km2 grid were calculated the values in the aspects of water resources supply climate regulation atmospheric pollution regulation water purification species conservation and landscape aesthetic were considered as factors to detect regional ecological pressures 2 3 4 identification of state cluster grids characterized by multi perspective pressure were clustered to identify the state firstly pressures were normalized for comparison secondly the k means method was applied for grid clustering ferraro 2021 finally the average values of normalized criteria were hierarchically integrated as weight which was summed to 1 thus the regional state was identified high values for flooding pressure water pollution pressure land value and economic activity sub criteria means high pressure and were normalized by eq 4 conversely high values for regional gdp water resources supply climate regulation atmospheric purification water purification species conservation and landscape aesthetic indicated abundant resources and low pressure and were normalized by eq 5 4 x a x i x m i n x m a x x m i n 5 x b x m a x x i x m a x x m i n where x a and x b is the normalized value x i is the value of criteria factor x m a x and x m i n are the maximum and the minimum value of these factors respectively grids were clustered by the k means method it has the advantages of fast convergence reliable clustering effect and high interpretability ferraro 2021 sub criteria values were used as distance features between vectors the number of categories is determined when the minimum sum of squared errors sse eq 6 is achieved 6 sse x i z j i i 1 n j 1 k x i z j i 2 where x i is a normalized pressure criterion in each grid z j i was the cluster centre point data n was the number of data k was the number of clusters weights ω i were hierarchically calculated by the average values of normalized pressure criteria n p i with eq 7 7 ω i n p i i 1 11 n p

considered in this study includes bioretention br green roof gr vegetative swale vs and permeable pavement pp typical grey infrastructures covered include rainwater pump station rp storage tank st rainwater interception treatment facility ri and reuse facility rf ri represents the facility that intercepted the runoff and transported it to a wastewater treatment plant rf represented the onsite rainwater reuse facility for the determination of infrastructure runoff control effectiveness the stormwater management model swmm was applied the simulation parameters for swmm were calibrated and verified to ensure reliability si c 1 c 2 the 10 year return period intensity storm was designed wmwb 2013 and used as input precipitation data to simulate runoff to compare the runoff volume control function different types of green infrastructures were each simulated individually in swmm the infrastructure s effective scale was defined as the scale required to fully capture 1m3 s runoff runoff control curves of different infrastructures were shown in si c figure c 3 where a larger scale implied a weaker control function per unit scale the runoff control function of grey infrastructure was derived from the measured values of the local engineering projects hanhua 2009 li et al 2016 sun 2019 zeng and xie 2021 as shown in si c 2 1 2 runoff water quality control function of infrastructures was reviewed from previous studies eckart et al 2017 gong et al 2020 liu et al 2019 mai and huang 2021 yang et al 2021 2 4 2 quantification of infrastructure economic and ecological effectiveness capital investment indices were quantified by the life cycle cost evaluation method for the stages of onsite construction and transportation equipment and material assets operation and maintenance costs and ecological impact were normalized to the functional unit in their life span as shown in si c table c 2 for quantitative comparison infrastructure investments were normalized at a uniform capacity 1 m³ s by diving by the effective scale as eq 8 the related structural substances and prices were gathered from the local engineering project and procurement website li et al 2016 sun 2019 wurcb 2019 and were listed in table 1 8 c i u n i t a r y cs lp es lgp mos lep es where c i u n i t a r y is the capital investment of infrastructure that controls 1m3 s runoff and was monetized in

respectively lp lgp and lep are the land and transport costs local goods price and the local labour and energy price respectively es denotes the effective scale ecological indices were considered from the life cycle perspective and were quantified and nondimensionalized by per capita global impact by the simapro software sleeswijk et al 2008 which is commercial software with a well established and reliable database pre sustainability 2012 the ecological impact of infrastructures was normalized to the capacity of controlling 1m3 s runoff and was divided by the effective scale as eq 9 the quantified factors covered habitat alteration ha species extinction se fine particulate matter fpm global warming gw water eutrophication we and water resource consumption wrc the substance inputs

green and grey infrastructure substances inventory were innovatively and simultaneously listed to estimate their life cycle ecological impact and the cost as shown in table 1 and the major proportion of ecological impact and cost were explored 2 5 pressure driven infrastructure adaptive rank multi perspective effectiveness of unitary infrastructure was normalized to 0 1 intervals for comparison the high value of runoff control indices implied better effectiveness normalized by eq 10 while the low value of the capital investment and ecological impact indices performed better effectiveness normalized by eq 11 overall performance of infrastructure was obtained by summarizing the weighted normalized multi effectiveness as eq 12 and performance ranks were applied for targeted spatial

identification of multi perspectives regional pressure 3 1 1 regional environmental pressure the storage capacity and service area of receiving water bodies show spatial heterogeneity which contributes to the spatial variation of the regional runoff control urgency as shown in fig 3 a a runoff reduction pressure of up to approximately 30 was identified along the eastern and southwestern banks of the yangtze river this is in accordance with the waterlogging points distribution described in existing studies liu et al 2021a rising water levels in receiving water bodies during the flood season as shown in si fig b 1 topping off the outflow from the drainage system accompanied by the restriction of the warning water level both lead to regional drainage pressure a residual runoff storage capacity of up to approximately 50 was identified in the northwestern bank of the yangtze river and was mapped in fig 3 a a residual runoff storage capacity indicated that in situ storage of runoff was implementable on these grids and an effective strategy to release pressure in the eastern and southwestern banks of the yangtze river is to vacate the lake in advance of the flood season and reserve sufficient space for storage accordingly a spatially diverted runoff regulation scheme was detected whereby runoff in the high pressure grid was suggested to be channelled to the urban periphery or the northwestern bank of the yangtze river with light pressure for adjustment the uneven spatial distribution of land use and water self purification capacity induced the spatial heterogeneity of water polluted status as illustrated in fig 3 b the tss concentration in related waters ranged from 18 9 mg l to 33 3 mg l from a spatial perspective the tss concentration of the river is above 27 0 mg l which is higher than that of the lakes in wuhan this is mainly attributed to the higher fluidity which prevented tss to deposit in rivers than lakes the concentration of tp in related waters is under 0 2 mg l in the mainstream of rivers the tp concentration is approximately 15 lower than that of lakes this also can be attributed to the higher fluidity and self purification ability of rivers compared to lakes previous studies ignored the natural runoff regulation endowments while implementing an indiscriminate runoff adjustment strategy throughout the region di matteo et al 2019 the identification of spatial heterogeneity of runoff quantity and quality pressure further proved that a targeted runoff control infrastructure contributes to maximizing the systematical effectiveness 3 1 2 regional economic condition the uneven spatial distribution of the opportunity cost of land occupation local financial support and the economic activity dynamics constrained investment in the life cycle stages of infrastructures as shown in fig 4 a b the areas with higher land value were closely distributed around the yangtze river similarly the higher grid gdp was also closely concentrated in the high urbanized areas represented by a high ratio of impervious underlying high land value areas were more dispersed than high gdp areas which was due to the expansion of population and urbanization gdp high value areas also showed a greater density around water bodies which indicated that socio economic development activities were largely dependant on the water system as shown in fig 4 c poi data were analysed to characterize the heat of human related socioeconomic activities the trend envelope areas which were obtained by directional distribution tool in arcgis software and covered 90 of poi ratio of public activities business activities and transportation activities were about 1 1 7 2 9 this indicated the public activities in wuhan are more concentrated while the transportation activities showed the extensive property the ratio of the long and short axes of the trend envelope for public business and transportation activities were 1 1 1 1 4 1 and 1 5 1 respectively the results indicated that the yangtze river is certainly the main carrier for wuhan s business and transportation in previous infrastructure optimization programs economic factors were considered only in terms of cost di matteo et al 2019 wang et al 2016 ignoring the impact of regional land values financial surplus and activity dynamics on the various stages of infrastructure development the multi perspective description of economic pressures helped to propose constraints for different stages in the infrastructure life cycle investment and thus to develop targeted runoff control strategies 3 1 3 ecological resource distribution ecological service values showed spatial unevenness which differs greatly from the pressure distribution of the economy and environment water resources supply climate regulation and landscape aesthetic benefits were presented here as typical ecological value evaluation factors while atmospheric purification water purification and species conservation which followed a similar trend were placed in the si fig b 5 as shown in fig 5 and si fig b 5 water resources supply capacity was abundant in the vicinity of water bodies value for local climate regulation atmospheric purification water purification species conservation and landscape aesthetic was higher in the urban periphery where higher vegetation cover contributed to a strong ecological resilience and adjustment capacity the ecological pressure in the urban periphery was also reduced due to the lower density of human activities and the less release of pollutants green infrastructure has been proven by many studies to have a compensatory value on ecosystems liu et al 2016 teixeira et al 2021 however previous infrastructure optimization schemes failed to simultaneously trade off the effectiveness of ecosystem pressure alleviation with runoff control and cost savings teixeira et al 2021 wang et al 2016 which may lead to the construction of some infrastructure increasing the pressure on the ecosystem the unevenness of regional ecological pressure put forward targeted requirements for infrastructure placement 3 2 quantitative assessment of green and grey infrastructure multi perspective effectiveness a quantitative comparison of green and grey infrastructure runoff control functions was achieved by identifying the effective scale of infrastructure under this constraint a larger effective scale meant a weaker unitary runoff control function and vice versa as shown in table 2 st ri br had the top three runoff volume control functions the ability of rf was lower because it was constrained by the regional reuse water usage br and ri had the strongest pollutant remove function in both green and grey infrastructures respectively higher cost implied greater economic pressure at the specific life cycle stage and suggested the infrastructure should be built in an area with correspondingly lower economic sensitivity as shown in table 3 the major contributors to different infrastructures cost were at distinct stages due to their structural and functional diversity ri was the highest investment infrastructure with a total cost 13 8 times higher than the lowest pumping station for br gr vs pp and st equipment assets occupied the dominant part of the capital investment for rp ri and rf maintenance and operation stages cost most in the life cycle runoff control strategies with high ecological impact were suggested to be implemented in areas with lower ecological pressure as shown in table 4 the total ecological impact of ri was the highest 11 4 times higher than the lowest impact of br habitat alteration impact was mostly from rf which took 28 8 proportion and it should be mitigated in areas of low aesthetic landscape value ri impact most in the aspects of se fpm gw we wrc and it took 51 1 41 9 52 6 37 0 and 46 1 ecological impacts respectively which meant it was more tolerated in a region with higher species conservation value greater atmospheric purification ability higher climate adjustment function and with higher water purification and water resource supply capacity rf was the most ecological friendly infrastructure in the aspects of ha se fpm gw we green and grey infrastructures coupled systems have been proved to have high resilience dong et al 2017 and can realize system objectives alves et al 2019 bakhshipour et al 2019 however only the systemic results were focused on by previous studies which were poorly interpretable and failed to evaluate the regional suitability of specific types of infrastructure quantitative evaluation of the green and grey infrastructure in a uniform system made it possible for multi perspective effectiveness comparison it is also a prerequisite for simultaneous spatial decision making for green and grey infrastructures 3 3 state identification and adaptive decision making of infrastructures 3 3 1 state identification driven by pressures the distribution of clustered state regions indicated the spatial heterogeneity of the multi perspective pressures best cluster performance minimum sum of squared errors sse was obtained when the grids were clustered into three categories as shown in fig 6 the region ⅰ took 43 of the research area and was mainly located in a part of the high urbanized areas and the urban periphery a large proportion of water bodies were classified in region ⅰ the region ⅱ which took 36 of the research area was located in the transitional area between the high urbanized region and urban periphery and suffered intensive runoff quantity or quality control pressure moreover the ecological resources were more abundant the region ⅲ was partly located in the high urbanized areas and partly located in the southeastern banks of the yangtze river where ecological resources were scarce the synergistic effect of multiple pressures resulted in a distributed region location the pressures in each cluster were integrated as weights to represent the priority of the adjustment demands and the characteristic of each cluster was shown in fig 7 in region ⅰ ecological and environmental criteria were of high weight and urgently demanded to be adjusted the weight values were both 0 4 while the economic pressure was relatively less in terms of sub criteria the pressure of different ecological factors occupied similar importance the demand for runoff water quantity control was the most critical aspect for environmental criteria took 64 pressure and more investment was suggested to cope with the pressure of equipment acquisition took 67 pressure in region ⅱ the environmental criterion was the dominant urgent pressure factor the weight value was 0 5 and needed to be given primary consideration in infrastructure placements followed by the constraints of regional economic pressure and then ecological pressure as for sub criteria the runoff quantity control should be considered with higher priority took about 65 importance financial expenditure pressure was given the highest weight in economic pressure attributes and water resources shortage was the most essential factor to be considered in maintaining the ecological conditions in region ⅲ the ecological criterion the weight value was 0 5 took precedence over the environmental and economic constraints which indicated the urgency of relieving ecological pressure the six sub criteria of ecological services were under roughly equal pressure the constraints of financial expenditure pressures were emphasized in the economic components took 66 importance and the control of runoff quality occupied a more important position than quantity notably in region ⅰ part of the high urbanized areas presented the same adjustment state as the urban periphery that is economic constraints were less important than environmental and ecological criteria this finding was driven by two mechanisms the first was that the markedly high environmental and ecological pressures in high urbanized areas trivialize economic pressures the second was that low economic dynamism in the urban periphery eliminated the corresponding criteria importance in region ⅱ a state was presented where the adjustment urgency for runoff control took precedence over economic savings followed by ecological conservation the region ⅲ was partly located in the areas with abundant financial support but scarce ecological resources and partly located in the area with low economic sensitivity and relatively poor ecological resources either way regional ecological pressure was identified to be a key indicator restricting infrastructure construction in region ⅲ the result indicated a synergy of environmental economic social criteria that is the same adjustment urgency state may be driven by different combinations of pressures this situation inevitably exceeds the managers perception further demonstrating the need for the quantitative multi criteria spatial decision making framework of infrastructure expert experience and stakeholder preference are often used to weigh the different criteria in previous studies jia et al 2015 tran et al 2020 experience tends to fail in quantifying the weights when dealing with systems that incorporate multi perspective pressures the quantified pressure provides the possibility of criteria comparison to analyse the priority of adjustment urgency namely the weight as shown in this study the contest of multi perspective pressures showed strong regional characteristics and spatial heterogeneity which move beyond empirical judgement this finding indicated the considerable requirement of the quantitative multi criteria spatial decision making framework for infrastructure 3 3 2 adaptive decision making of green and grey infrastructures performance rank of infrastructure was obtained by summarizing the weighted multi effectiveness thus achieving spatial planning and the targeted suggestions for zoning infrastructure placement as shown in fig 8 br was the most preferred infrastructure in region i and its superiority lied in the high runoff control capacity and low ecological impact st was the first choice in region ii caused by its superior runoff control efficiency and its low cost at life cycle stages rp was the most superior infrastructure in region ⅲ because it achieved efficient runoff control in an ecologically low impact and economically friendly manner in summary green infrastructure ranked top in region i where ecological and environmental pressure alleviation were of high priority simultaneously grey infrastructure ranked top in region ii and region ⅲ where ecological or environmental pressure alleviation was of high priority grey infrastructures ranked up from urban periphery to the high urbanized areas while green infrastructures were more preferred in urban periphery and urban core areas this suggested that green infrastructures were more acceptable in areas that aspire to achieve simultaneous runoff control and ecological improvement grey infrastructure performed either high runoff control functions or minor ecological impact but lacked the advantage of balancing environmental economic ecological effectiveness previous studies failed to provide the targeted requirement for multi function of infrastructure according to regional pressure dai et al 2021 di matteo et al 2019 this study demonstrated that green infrastructure tended to exhibit comprehensive effectiveness of the environmental economic ecological perspective while grey infrastructure presented outstanding benefits in a single perspective thereby the identification of spatial pressures will guide the targeted emphasis on specific functions of green and grey infrastructures to maximize performance 3 4 limitations and further work a quantitative multi criteria spatial decision making framework for infrastructure planning was established in this study deficiencies in previous studies such as the lack of quantitively identifying pressure in multi perspective garcía et al 2020 rasmussen et al 2021 the inability to hierarchically evaluate green and grey infrastructure in a uniformed system dai et al 2021 teixeira et al 2021 and the difficulty of matching regional status with infrastructure effectiveness di matteo et al 2019 ronchi et al 2020 were remedied to some extent however some limitations remain for example supplementary field monitoring data are essential to support the development of localized inversion models for studies carried out in other regions monetization of ecological services is an intuitive approach rather than a necessity the assessment of regional ecological pressure can also be carried out in combination with data on aspects such as localized water and atmospheric environmental capacity to improve the resilience of urban management it is necessary to integrate elements such as urbanization and climate change into the framework thus making dynamic decision making possible the pressure exerted by combined system overflows csos on urban drainage systems and receiving water bodies cannot be ignored this study only analysed the compensatory demands of runoff control infrastructure on regional integrated water pollution pressure runoff control pressure mitigation is emphasized by infrastructure the spatial heterogeneity of csos distribution may affect the spatial distribution of runoff pressure and thus affect the decision making and placement of runoff control infrastructures for more accurate identification of runoff control pressure the csos should be quantified and considered as a pressure element in further studies in addition the multi criteria decision making process was carried out in this study meaning that the suitable rank was obtained and the infrastructures were compared independently studies on infrastructure coupled effectiveness and the scale configuration corresponding to the regional state were not available yet these factors are recommended for subsequent studies 4 conclusion a pressure driven multi criteria decision making framework for infrastructure spatial planning was developed in this study specifically we obtained the following important progress through a case study for a metropolis wuhan city in central china 1 a runoff reduction pressure of up to approximately 30 was identified along the certain areas tss concentration of rivers was higher than that of lakes the tp concentration in revers is approximately 15 lower than that of lakes the economically sensitive areas were distributed in the high urbanized areas the ecological compensation capacity was high in the urban periphery regional pressures from multiple perspectives showed spatial heterogeneity 2 bioretention facilities br and rainwater interception treatment facilities ri both performed well in runoff control ri has the highest capital investment and the largest ecological impact costing approximately 13 8 times more than the rainwater pumping station which was the least expensive option ri has an approximately 11 4 times larger ecological impact than the br which had the least impact 3 green infrastructures were more acceptable in areas that aspire to achieve simultaneous runoff control and ecological improvement grey infrastructure performed either high runoff control functions or minor ecological impact but lacked the advantage of balancing effectiveness thus the infrastructure performance can be

16283,excessive ammonia has an inhibitory effect on anaerobic granular sludge angs when treating industrial wastewater with high concentration of ammonia and organic matters the addition of conductive materials has been widely reported to improve the angs activity which has the potential to alleviate the ammonia inhibition in this study the addition of magnetite was carried out to enhance the activity of angs in uasb reactor then the response of angs to different ammonia levels was investigated results showed that magnetite facilitated the enrichment of methanosaeta and clostridium sensu stricto 1 under the ammonia stress up to 5 g tan l it was interesting that methanosaeta was better retained abundance of 45 8 and the abundance of ammonia resistant clostridium sensu stricto 1 increased to 34 3 in presence of magnetite rt qpcr analysis revealed that methanosaeta could maintain metabolically active for counteracting the ammonia inhibition along with the higher transcription of genes encoding for co2 dependent pathway the electron transport activity and atp content of angs were 1 25 2 12 and 1 23 2 56 folds higher than those in the control group respectively in addition the angs could maintain the stability of structure because methanosaeta was the skeleton of angs as a result the analysis of enzyme activity showed that the overall methanogenic metabolism was more active thus ensured the effective operation of uasb reactor this study provided the scientific understanding about the role of magnetite to alleviate the ammonia inhibition and had important implications for stable treatment and recycling of industrial wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ammonia inhibition magnetite anaerobic granular sludge angs energy metabolism methanosaeta methanogenic pathways 1 introduction anaerobic granular sludge angs process has been widely applied to treating high organic wastewater due to its advantages of high volume loading long biomass retention and effective bioenergy recovery but is still confronted with the stress of many toxicants chen et al 2014 van lier et al 2015 thereinto ammonia at a high concentration is usually worthy of attention and the total ammonia nitrogen tan concentration of 2 48 5 6 g l was reported to reduce half of the biogas production in angs reactors florentino et al 2019 rajagopal et al 2013 ammonia nitrogen exists as ammonium ion nh4 and free ammonia fa in equilibrium depending on the ph and temperature of the solution lü et al 2016 it is noted that fa is primarily responsible for cell inhibition because of its passive permeability chen et al 2014 intracellularly part of fa will be protonated and transformed to nh4 and the cells have to consume extra energy to maintain the proton balance by driving potassium pump thus microbial activity is reduced chen et al 2008 in addition intracellular nh4 also directly inhibits some specific enzyme activities kayhanian 1999 rajagopal et al 2013 in anaerobic system different microbial individuals tolerated different levels of ammonia toxicity and different syntrophic communities had different responses to tan concentrations lü et al 2016 rajagopal et al 2013 for bacterial communities several species belonging to firmicutes especially clostridium species were found to be active under ammonia stress chen et al 2018 lee et al 2019 yan et al 2020 zeb et al 2019 for methanogenic archaeal communities a consensus seems to be achieved that hydrogenotrophic methanogens were more resistant than aceticlastic methanogens to ammonia chen et al 2008 2014 for alleviating ammonia inhibition acclimation was usually adopted to enrich ammonia resistant microbes and some researchers explored to add microbial agents capable of syntrophic acetate oxidation sao and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis hm e g clostridium ultunense with methanoculleus spp or syntrophaceticus schinkii tepidanaerobacter acetatoxydans and c ultunense with methanoculleus spp chen et al 2014 lü et al 2016 however the above approaches were usually of limited effectiveness and acetate still accumulated because the occurrence of saohm was restricted by interspecies hydrogen transfer iht stams and plugge 2009 direct interspecies electron transfer diet is a newly discovered electron transport model as a superior alternative to iht and adding conductive materials cms e g magnetite biochar and granular activated carbon etc has been proved as an effective way to stimulate diet lovley 2017 currently adding cms has also been found to alleviate ammonia inhibition and methanosarcina or methanosaete was reported to serve as the dominating methanogenic contributor florentino et al 2019 luo et al 2015 lee et al 2019 lü et al 2016 among methanogenic archaea methanosaeta harundinacea methanosarcina barkeri and methanosarcina mazei were the most thoroughly studied diet partners in the co culture with geobacter species holmes et al 2017 rotaru et al 2014 it is coincident that methanosarcina species is also resistant to ammonia due to its aggregated structure of cocci or macro cysts lü et al 2013 however methanosaete as the core species of angs for its filamentous and windable characteristics is vulnerable to ammonia yan et al 2020 zeb et al 2019 our group previously reported that adding magnetite enriched electroactive volatile fatty acids vfas oxidizers and methanosaete and synergistically accelerated the formation of angs wang et al 2019a 2020a however the effectiveness of magnetite addition and the response of angs to ammonia stress are underreported in addition the diet mechanism under ammonia stress is still ambiguous there was even a contradiction that adding magnetite was found to only up regulate aceticlastic methanogenesis am pathway rather than co2 reduction pathway under ammonia stress which indicated that diet was not improved wang et al 2020b yan et al 2020 therefore it is necessary to further clarify the response of methanogenic metabolism in presence of magnetite to ammonia stress this study systematically explored the response of methanogenic granules enhanced by magnetite to the ammonia stress in up flow anaerobic sludge bed uasb reactors firstly the effectiveness of adding magnetite against different ammonia levels was evaluated secondly the changes in physicochemical characteristics electron transfer ability and key enzyme activities of angs with without magnetite were analyzed finally the succession of microbes was identified by quantitative pcr qpcr and high throughput sequencing analysis meanwhile the methanogenic metabolism of methanosaete under ammonia stress was focused by reverse transcriptase quantitative pcr rt qpcr 2 materials and methods 2 1 setup and operation of reactors two identical uasb reactors with a volume of 7 5 l and a height of 65 cm were built thereinto r1 was added with 10 g fe l micron magnetite and r2 was set as the control group the synthetic wastewater used sucrose as a carbon source and the components of synthetic wastewater along with the composition of trace elements were listed in detail in supplementary material table s1 s2 the inoculated sludge was collected from a municipal wastewater treatment plant hangzhou china as reported in our previous study wang et al 2019a the micron magnetite fe3o4 98 2 70 0 01 μm average size purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china was used and the x ray diffraction pattern polycrystal x ray diffractometer of rigaku dmax 2550pc japan of sludge mixed with magnetite was shown in fig s1 before ammonia inhibition experiments both uasb reactors had been operated in parallel under mesophilic conditions 35 2 c for 180 days with the organic loading rate olr of 10 kg cod m3 d and hydraulic retention time hrt of 24 d wang et al 2019a based on literature and field researches the excessive ammonia was usually released from the fermentation of protein or urea and abundant in landfill leachate 1 5 g tan l sludge thermal hydrolysate 0 77 2 64 g tan l livestock wastewater 0 3 3 5 g tan l dairy wastewater 1 2 2 2 g tan l etc li et al 2021 pang et al 2020 wilson et al 2012 in this study the additional nh4cl was manually added into the influent to control a certain tan concentration based on the mass of nh4 the whole operation was divided into four stages stage ⅰ from day 1 to 30 with 0 321 g tan l stage ⅱ from day 31 to 60 with 1 5 g tan l stage ⅲ from day 61 to 90 with 3 0 g tan l stage ⅳ from day 91 to 150 with 5 0 g tan l both reactors were operated continuously for 148 days with the same olr and hrt mentioned above 2 2 analysis of liquid and gas samples the chemical oxygen demand cod tan and ph of liquid were measured following standard methods chen et al 2018 and the fa concentration was calculated according to chen et al 2008 the biogas production was recorded by a gas flowmeter under the condition of 35 c and 1 bar the vfas concentration and biogas component mainly ch4 co2 and h2 were measured by a gas chromatography 7890a agilent usa using a flame ionization detector and a thermal conductivity detector 2 3 analysis of sludge characteristics the granule size distribution and average granule size of angs were assayed using a dynamic image analyzer qicpic sympatec germany xu et al 2021 the intensity of angs represented as the integrity coefficient ic was determined following wang et al 2019b the angs samples at the end of operation were observed by a scanning electron microscope sem hitachi su 8010 japan the pore size distribution of angs was determined by a mercury intrusion method xu et al 2021 and the permeability was calculated according to darcy s law the activity of electron transfer system ets of angs was determined by the 2 p iodophenyl 3 p nitrophenyl 5 phenyltetrazolium chloride electron transport system int ets method yin et al 2018 and adenosine triphosphate atp in angs was determined according to zhao et al 2020 the extraction of extracellular polymeric substances eps from angs was carried out following a heating method and polysaccharides ps and proteins pn in eps were quantified for further analyzing the changes of eps components three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem combined with parallel factor parafac analysis were conducted the eps samples were also electrochemically characterized using a cyclic voltammetry cv method and a differential pulse voltammetry dpv method by an electrochemical workstation chi660e huachen china wang et al 2019b ye et al 2018 in addition to further identify electroactive components of eps the electronic absorption spectra were obtained by ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer uv 2600 shimadzu japan with a diffuse transmission mode wang et al 2020b all the detailed procedures related to eps extraction and analysis were shown in supplementary material 2 4 analysis of enzyme activities in this study the activity of key enzymes in methanogenic degradation of sucrose including α glucosidase α glu phosphotransbutyrylase ptb butyrate kinase bk coa transferase coat phosphotransacetylase pta acetate kinase ak c type cytochromes cyts c coenzyme f420 cof420 and coenzyme m com were determined the enzyme linked immunoassay double antibody methods were applied and the detailed procedures were conducted according to the previous study wang et al 2020a 2 5 analysis of quantitative pcr and microbial community the total dna was extracted from homogenous sludge samples in four stages day 28 58 88 and 148 wang et al 2018 to determine the bacterial and archaeal populations qpcr was conducted to detect the gene copies of extracted dna with the primer pairs 806f 5 attagatacccsbgtagtcc 3 and 915r 5 gtgctcccccgccaattcct 3 for archaea 340f 5 tcctacgggaggcagcagt 3 and 515r 5 cgtattaccgcggctgctggcac 3 for bacteria the detailed procedures were performed according to chen et al 2018 and there were

sequences were provided in the supplementary material table s4 and the detailed procedures were previously described as liu et al 2019 2 7 data analysis t test was conducted to determine the significance of results by spss spss 17 0 p 0 05 meant 95 significant level and p 0 01 meant 99 significant level 3 results 3 1 performance of uasb reactors 3 1 1 cod removal as shown in fig 1 a cod removal efficiency of r1 and r2 was 98 6 0 3 and 91 8 0 8 respectively in stage ⅰ which indicated that adding magnetite could improve cod removal performance when reactors were operating normally when adding 1 5 g l excessive tan cod removal efficiency of r1 was barely affected whereas that in r2 decreased to 87 9 1 3 when tan concentration increased to 3 g l r1 was only slightly inhibited and still had a higher cod removal efficiency of 92 3 1 2 while the performance of r2 was relatively inefficient with a lower cod removal efficiency of 79 4 2 2 as the ammonia level further increased 5 g tan l the cod removal efficiency of r1 could be maintained at 87 6 1 6 for the long term operation of the next 60 days in contrast r2 suffered serious performance deterioration and its cod removal efficiency was only 56 8 5 1 the results indicated that r1 was robust under ammonia stress but r2 was relatively vulnerable to ammonia 3 1 2 biogas production and components biogas production results were similar to cod removal efficiency fig 1 b during four stages biogas production of r1 was 0 52 0 02 0 49 0 01 0 45 0 01 and 0 43 0 01 m3 kg cod respectively adding magnetite could always ensure effective biogas production under ammonia stress in contrast biogas production of r2 was seriously inhibited as the ammonia level increased and eventually arrived at a stagnant state meanwhile methane content in biogas from r1 was also less affected and eventually maintained at 58 9 2 2 whereas that from r2 continued to decrease and ended at only 17 9 5 fig s2 the h2 partial pressure in biogas was also detected fig s2 and rose with the increase of tan concentration in both reactors nevertheless the h2 partial pressure in r1 was always lower than that in r2 indicating that adding magnetite could alleviate the accumulation of h2 3 1 3 variations of ph vfas and fa the influent ph of both reactors was relatively stable but effluent ph differed in four stages fig 1 c during stage ⅰ the effluent of r1 and r2 had similar ph 7 18 0 09 and 7 14 0 05 respectively which favored the growth of methanogens during stage ⅱ the ph of r1 barely changed while the ph of r2 decreased to 6 93 0 12 in anaerobic system the vfas accumulation caused by the metabolic imbalance between acidogenesis and methanogenesis is the reason for ph drop in stage ⅱ more vfas especially propionate and butyrate accumulated in r2 442 1 41 1 mg l than those in r1 101 8 8 1 mg l fig 2 d when tan concentration increased to 3 g l the ph of r1 decreased but was still neutral 7 07 0 07 however the effluent of r2 was slightly acidic ph of 6 51 0 09 and the accumulated vfas reached 1176 9 127 1 mg l along with the further increase of ammonia level the ph of r1 decreased to 6 83 0 07 but was still in a range suitable for the growth of methanogens in contrast r2 suffered serious acidification ph of 5 24 0 44 and the accumulated vfas reached 4125 6 358 8 mg l fa as the main inhibitor in tan was also calculated fig s3 fa concentration in r1 and r2 was similar in stage ⅰ as the tan level increased fa concentration in r2 was always lower than that in r1 due to the lower ph the ph control was a strategy to reduce the fa production instead the ph in this study was passively decreased which indicated that the syntrophic microbes might be more susceptible to fa in r2 3 2 physicochemical characteristics of methanogenic granules 3 2 1 granular size and intensity after the previous cultivation wang et al 2019a the angs in r1 had a higher average granule size 1 03 mm and ic 0 65 0 005 in stage ⅰ fig 2 a b under ammonia stress the angs in r1 could always remain stable in the last three stages the average granule size was 1 49 1 21 and 1 39 mm respectively and the large granules of 1 2 mm and 2 mm always accounted for the larger proportions 47 2 64 9 meanwhile the granule intensity in r1 was always higher in contrast the average granule size in r2 showed a downward trend with a decrease from 0 91 to 0 7 mm and the proportion of large granules also declined moreover the ic of granules in r2 decreased from 0 61 0 004 to 0 44 0 02 3 2 2 granular pore and permeability the granule pore was an important structural parameter and a supporting condition for internal mass transfer of angs liu et al 2010 in this study capillary pores size between 0 1 µm and 1 mm were dominant 99 in all granule samples fig 2 c in r1 the granule pore distribution was relatively less affected and small granule pores of 0 5 µm and 5 50 µm always accounted for the larger proportion 55 in four stages as for r2 the granule pores of 0 5 µm were barely detected the proportion of 5 50 µm granule pores was always lower even decreased from 40 5 to 23 9 as the tan level increased it was also observed from the sem images that the angs structure in r1 was tight while that in r2 was loose under ammonia stress simultaneously more filamentous microbes were aggregated on the surface of angs in r1 while those were barely observed in r2 fig s4 it was reported that the capillary force in capillary pores increased with the decrease of pore size an et al 2016 when the pumping and pushing effect caused by hydraulic pressure was stronger than capillary force the convective mass transfer occurred liu et al 2010 the granule permeability could characterize the ease of convective mass transfer xu et al 2021 its value in r1 was always lower than that in r2 fig 2 d the result indicated that the convective mass transfer efficiency of angs in r1 was relatively lower than that in r2 3 2 3 eps components of methanogenic granules eps were secretory high molecular organic substances containing mainly pn and ps pn was rich in hydrophobic functional groups which was conducive to the stability of granules liu et al 2004 during the first three stages the secreted pn in r1 was always higher than those in r2 fig s5 a moreover the pn ps in r1 was 2 13 2 12 and 1 48 respectively always higher than those in r2 the secretion of eps showed no obvious response to increasing tan except for that in the last stage during stage ⅳ pn and ps content in r2 increased sharply to 68 9 0 22 and 67 5 0 56 mg gvss respectively which might be caused by lysis of cells and incomplete degradation of sucrose liu et al 2004 for further understanding eps components 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy combined with parafac analysis were applied fig s5 b there were three main fluorescent components including tryptophan and protein like substances humic acid like substances as well as cof420 fig s6 thereinto tryptophan and protein like substances were beneficial to the stability of angs wang et al 2019b which intensity in r1 was always higher than that in r2 humic acid like substances were reported to mediate microbial extracellular electron transport eet wang et al 2019b but their intensity had no obvious difference between r1 and r2 cof420 was an important intracellular coenzyme involved in co2 dependent methanogenesis it could be regarded as an indicator of cell lysis that cof420 was detected extracellularly during stage ⅳ the intensity of cof420 in r2 increased sharply and was much higher than that in r1 3 3 activity analysis of methanogenic granules 3 3 1 ets activity and atp content in granules ets activity is an important indicator to determine microbial respiration rate zhao et al 2020 as shown in fig 3 a the int ets activity was always maintained at a high level in r1 which was 104 5 3 7 112 6 3 102 8 3 and 99 3 3 9 mg gtss h respectively in four stages in contrast the int ets activity showed a downward trend in r2 with a decrease from 98 4 8 8 to 46 9 3 6 mg gtss h the higher int ets activity in r1 might be attributed to the reinforcement of eet zhao et al 2020 the microbial respiration process is always associated with atp formation which is the universal energy currency in cells the atp content of angs in r1 was 41 9 2 7 40 4 3 7 36 6 1 8 and 32 5 3 9 mmol g while that in r2 was 34 2 2 9 29 3 6 26 5 2 4 and 12 7 1 8 mmol g respectively in four stages fig 3 b the higher energy metabolism level might be conducive to counteract ammonia stress in r1 3 3 2 redox activity of eps cv curves of sludge eps from both reactors in stage ⅰ and ⅳ were shown in fig 4 a under ammonia stress cv curves became more rectangular and their area increased which indicated an increased capacitance of eps ye et al 2018 more importantly it was observed that cv curves in r1 had redox peaks around 0 4 v versus ag agcl unless otherwise whereas those in r2 were barely detected for better understanding the redox characteristics of eps the more sensitive dpv method was applied fig 4 c d there was a pair of redox peaks with the potentials of 386 mv cathodic and 420 mv anodic in r1 which was ascribed to flavins okamoto et al 2013 it was worth mentioning that the peak currents were 2 53 µa anodic and 2 21 µa cathodic in stage ⅳ higher than those 1 9 µa and 2 18 µa in stage ⅰ in addition through uv vis spectra a higher concentration of cyts c was determined in r1 fig 4 b xiao et al 2017 the results indicated that adding magnetite could improve redox activity of eps by enriching extracellular flavins and cyts c and the redox activity could be well maintained under ammonia stress 3 3 3 key enzyme activities of angs enzyme activity is a direct indicator reflecting the metabolic ability of angs as shown in fig 5 the key enzyme activities involved in the methanogenic degradation of sucrose in stage ⅰ and ⅳ were determined thereinto α glu was responsible for catalyzing sucrose hydrolysis ptb and bk were involved in butyrate fermentation coat was involved in propionate fermentation pta and ak were involved in acetogenisis cyts c could reflect the electron transfer activity cof420 was involved in co2 dependent methanogenesis and com was required in the last step of all methanogenic pathways wang et al 2020a the activity of the enzymes mentioned above decreased by 0 76 13 5 and 40 7 6 8 18 3 and 3 8 2 2 7 3 and 17 3 respectively in r1 while decreased by 39 1 34 7 and 84 5 39 2 62 7 and 18 8 78 8 102 9 and 96 6 in r2 respectively in general the activity of all enzymes detected in both reactors decreased under ammonia stress but those were only slightly inhibited in r1 which was in accordance with the performance of reactors in addition the enzyme activities related to methanogenesis were more inhibited than those related to acidogenesis in r2 which indicated the metabolic imbalance between acidogenesis and methanogenesis under ammonia stress 3 4 analysis of sludge microbial community 3 4 1 archaea communities of angs the gene copies of archaea and bacteria in both reactors were determined table s3 thereinto archaea were more sensitive to ammonia with a decreasing proportion from 38 1 0 4 to 29 2 1 in r1 and from 29 1 0 6 to 12 6 0 9 in r2 fig 6 a nevertheless the archaeal proportions in r1 were always higher than those in r2 methanosaeta and methanobacterium were the dominate methanogenic archaea before ammonia inhibition adding magnetite could enrich methanosaeta under ammonia stress the abundance of methanosaeta generally decreased in both reactors however methanosaeta was still dominated in r1 with 45 8 abundance in stage ⅳ as for r2 the abundance of methanosaeta decreased to 34 1 and the hydrogenotrophic methanobacterium accounted for the largest proportion of 56 8 in stage ⅳ it was determined that adding magnetite contributed to the retention of methanosaeta species under ammonia stress in addition methanosarcina 17 5 of abundance was also detected in the presence of magnetite in stage ⅳ 3 4 2 bacterial communities of angs the bacterial communities at the genus level were shown in fig 6 b clostridium sensu stricto 1 belonging to firmicutes chen et al 2018 was dominated in this study as tan concentration increased the abundance of clostridium sensu stricto 1 increased from 17 8 to 34 3 in r1 and from 5 4 to 23 1 in r2 respectively it was noted that the abundance of clostridium sensu stricto 1 in r1 was always higher than that in r2 lactococcus belonging to firmicutes was a fermentative bacteria and always abundant in dairy wastewater pang et al 2020 the higher abundance of lactococcus indicated more efficient fermentative performance in r1 3 5 rt qpcr analysis for methanosaeta considering the dominance of methanosaeta and the difference in changes of its abundance between r1 and r2 it was necessary to gain insight into its intrinsic metabolism methanosaeta was capable of am meanwhile methanosaeta species have been demonstrated to contain a complete genome coding for co2 dependent pathway but could only utilize exogenous electrons directly instead of hydrogen or formate due to the lack of membrane bound hydrogenase complexes holmes et al 2017 as shown in fig 7 adding magnetite could increase the activity of methanosaeta all genes detected were more actively expressed in r1 than those in r2 under ammonia stress the gene expression also responded in r1 the acs and chda genes from acetate decarboxylation process were relatively less transcribed in stage ⅳ compared to those in stage ⅰ however the mtd and mer genes coding for co2 reduction process lei et al 2019 were still maintained abundant in stage ⅳ in addition fpo coding for f420h2 dehydrogenase complex and hdrabc coding for soluble electron bifurcating heterodisulfide complex were also actively expressed in stage ⅳ fpo and hdrabc were reported to play an important role in methanosaeta concilii grown via diet holmes et al 2017 lei et al 2019 in contrast in situ expression of all genes detected in r2 was inhibited under ammonia stress 4 discussion 4 1 inhibition of methanogenic granules by ammonia as well known microbes would secret more eps for self protection during disturbances such as overload or some toxicants campo et al 2016 liu et al 2004 however ammonia toxicity was unique in that it could directly disturb cell energy metabolism chen et al 2008 in r2 the electron transport activity and atp content in angs decreased under ammonia stress fig 3 which was not in favor of eps secretion liu et al 2004 instead cells would grow slowly die and even lyse due to lack of energy proven by more intracellular substances detected extracellularly in stage ⅳ fig s5 b according to microbial analysis the archaeal population gradually decreased and the loss of methanosaeta was severe in r2 under ammonia stress fig 6 a methanosaeta was the skeleton of angs and its loss directly led to structural damage and loosening of angs fig 2 c s4 in addition the increase of hydrophilic ps content in eps was not conducive to the stability of angs in r2 fig s5 a therefore the angs in r2 became easily disintegrated and the sludge concentration decreased significantly under ammonia stress table s5 several studies have reported that hm pathway dominated in anaerobic system under ammonia stress chen et al 2014 wang et al 2020b hydrogenotrophic methanobacterium gradually substituted methanosaeta in r2 fig 6 a however the decreased cof420 activity indicated that hm pathway was still inhibited by ammonia in r2 fig 5 it could be speculated that methanobacterium was also inhibited though not as much as methanosaeta under the high olr condition the inefficient methanobacterium could not consume hydrogen molecules timely fig s2 furthermore the increase of hydrogen partial pressure inhibited acetogenisis in thermodynamics as a result vfas especially propionate and butyrate accumulated and biogas production was at a stagnant state in r2 fig 1 4 2 robust methanogenic granules enhanced by magnetite 4 2 1 potential mechanism of adding magnetite to resist the ammonia inhibition compared to the structural damage and loosening of angs in r2 addition of magnetite could facilitate the enrichment of methanosaeta and secretion of eps fig 6 s5 and the angs in r1 could always maintain the stability of structure under ammonia stress fig 2 together with the permeability data fig 2 d the convective mass transfer efficiency of angs in r1 was relatively lower than that in r2 it was reported that methanosaeta in the inner biofilm could be protected from ammonia by outer biofilm on the surface of biochar due to the limited mass transfer lü et al 2016 however in the present study the microbes inside the granules that were not exposed to excessive ammonia could also not acquire enough substrates and nutrients in addition under the long term high ammonia operating conditions the ammonia concentration inside granule pores might be exactly the same as that in the bulk liquid due to concentration diffusion therefore mass transfer limitation had little effect in alleviating ammonia inhibition therefore it was raised the question why the addition of magnetite could enhance the retention of methanosaeta under ammonia stress fig 6 a in the present study the improved electrochemical activity of eps suggested the stronger eet ability of angs fig 4 in addition the more actively expressed genes for co2 dependent methanogenesis were an indicator for the enhancement of diet involved in methanosaeta fig 7 as a matter of fact the standard gibbs free energy of co2 dependent methanogenesis 135 6 kj mol was much higher than that of am pathway 31 0 kj mol wang et al 2020b it was reported that methanosaeta harundinacea grew faster through diet based syntropism with geobacter metallireducens than that grew solely with acetate rotaru et al 2014 zhao et al 2020 also found that the energy metabolism of methanosaeta species was more active with more v a type atpase genes detected in anaerobic sludge when ethanol was used to induce diet under ammonia stress it was interesting that the genes coding for am pathway were relatively less transcribed while those coding for co2 dependent pathway were still actively expressed fig 7 combined with the higher electron transport activity and more atp concentration of angs fig 3 it could be proposed that methanosaeta could improve its own metabolic activity by co2 dependent pathway in the presence of magnetite and more energy was obtained to resist ammonia inhibition 4 2 2 methanogenic metabolism enhanced by magnetite under the ammonia stress recently several studies have reported that adding magnetite mainly facilitated the enrichment of methanosarcina under ammonia stress lee et al 2019 wang et al 2020b yan et al 2020 the ammonia resistant methanosarcina was metabolically versatile including am and co2 dependent methanogenesis de vrieze et al 2012 it seemed that methanosarcina should be more competitive than methanosaeta under ammonia stress however the abundance of methanosarcina was much lower than that of methanosaeta in stage ⅳ fig 6 a the reasons behind might be the relatively lower substrate affinity and activity of methanosarcina de vrieze et al 2012 it was reported that methanosaeta was the pioneer and methanosarcina was the rearguard for methanogenic degradation of acetate in biochar added batch reactors lü et al 2016 in the continuous reactor of this study it was the methanosaeta as the dominant methanogenic contributor and methanosarcina as the assistant methanogenic contributor ensuring efficient methanogenesis under the high ammonia and organic condition another point worthy of discussion was that the enhancement on am via the addition of magnetite was always highlighted under ammonia stress wang et al 2020b yan et al 2020 indeed am was essential for the contribution of about 70 methane production in anaerobic reactors van lier et al 2015 in the present study the am activity was also higher in r1 than that in r2 as evidenced by the higher abundance of methanosaeta and its more transcribed genes coding for am fig 6 a 7 however according to the discussion in 4 1 1 iht was the primary limited step of the methanogenic reaction chain under the high ammonia and organic condition clostridium sensu stricto 1 was an iron reducing bacterium which was also resistant to ammonia lee et al 2019 yan et al 2020 reported that adding magnetite could enrich clostridium sensu stricto 1 when treating high ammonia sludge thermal hydrolysate in r1 more abundant clostridium sensu stricto 1 was also detected fig 6 b the robust syntrophism between clostridium sensu stricto 1 and methanosaeta might alleviate the blockage of iht and the overall methanogenic metabolism of sucrose was maintained more active under ammonia stress fig 5 nevertheless the diet process between clostridium sensu stricto 1 and methanosaeta needs to be further demonstrated in the co culture system in summary anaerobic treatment of high ammonia and organic wastewater showed great advantages for bioenergy recovery which could also serve as a pretreatment for energy efficient anammox adding magnetite was a simple and robust strategy to improve the energy metabolism of angs for counteracting ammonia inhibition and selectively enrich ammonia resistant microbes which contributed to the efficient operation of the process and promotion of carbon neutral development of wastewater treatment 5 conclusions addition of magnetite could improve the microbial energy metabolism accelerate proliferation of microbial cells especially methanosaeta and secretion of eps and the formed angs could maintain the structural stability under ammonia stress the methanosaeta was metabolically active via co2 dependent pathway to counteract the ammonia inhibition thus could be better retained abundance of 45 8 meanwhile the ammonia resistant clostridium sensu stricto 1 was enriched in presence of magnetite the robust syntrophism between clostridium sensu stricto 1 and methanosaeta scavenged the blockage of iht as a result the electron transport activity and atp content were always higher and the overall methanogenic metabolism of sucrose was maintained active under the ammonia stress declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

16283,excessive ammonia has an inhibitory effect on anaerobic granular sludge angs when treating industrial wastewater with high concentration of ammonia and organic matters the addition of conductive materials has been widely reported to improve the angs activity which has the potential to alleviate the ammonia inhibition in this study the addition of magnetite was carried out to enhance the activity of angs in uasb reactor then the response of angs to different ammonia levels was investigated results showed that magnetite facilitated the enrichment of methanosaeta and clostridium sensu stricto 1 under the ammonia stress up to 5 g tan l it was interesting that methanosaeta was better retained abundance of 45 8 and the abundance of ammonia resistant clostridium sensu stricto 1 increased to 34 3 in presence of magnetite rt qpcr analysis revealed that methanosaeta could maintain metabolically active for counteracting the ammonia inhibition along with the higher transcription of genes encoding for co2 dependent pathway the electron transport activity and atp content of angs were 1 25 2 12 and 1 23 2 56 folds higher than those in the control group respectively in addition the angs could maintain the stability of structure because methanosaeta was the skeleton of angs as a result the analysis of enzyme activity showed that the overall methanogenic metabolism was more active thus ensured the effective operation of uasb reactor this study provided the scientific understanding about the role of magnetite to alleviate the ammonia inhibition and had important implications for stable treatment and recycling of industrial wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ammonia inhibition magnetite anaerobic granular sludge angs energy metabolism methanosaeta methanogenic pathways 1 introduction anaerobic granular sludge angs process has been widely applied to treating high organic wastewater due to its advantages of high volume loading long biomass retention and effective bioenergy recovery but is still confronted with the stress of many toxicants chen et al 2014 van lier et al 2015 thereinto ammonia at a high concentration is usually worthy of attention and the total ammonia nitrogen tan concentration of 2 48 5 6 g l was reported to reduce half of the biogas production in angs reactors florentino et al 2019 rajagopal et al 2013 ammonia nitrogen exists as ammonium ion nh4 and free ammonia fa in equilibrium depending on the ph and temperature of the solution lü et al 2016 it is noted that fa is primarily responsible for cell inhibition because of its passive permeability chen et al 2014 intracellularly part of fa will be protonated and transformed to nh4 and the cells have to consume extra energy to maintain the proton balance by driving potassium pump thus microbial activity is reduced chen et al 2008 in addition intracellular nh4 also directly inhibits some specific enzyme activities kayhanian 1999 rajagopal et al 2013 in anaerobic system different microbial individuals tolerated different levels of ammonia toxicity and different syntrophic communities had different responses to tan concentrations lü et al 2016 rajagopal et al 2013 for bacterial communities several species belonging to firmicutes especially clostridium species were found to be active under ammonia stress chen et al 2018 lee et al 2019 yan et al 2020 zeb et al 2019 for methanogenic archaeal communities a consensus seems to be achieved that hydrogenotrophic methanogens were more resistant than aceticlastic methanogens to ammonia chen et al 2008 2014 for alleviating ammonia inhibition acclimation was usually adopted to enrich ammonia resistant microbes and some researchers explored to add microbial agents capable of syntrophic acetate oxidation sao and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis hm e g clostridium ultunense with methanoculleus spp or syntrophaceticus schinkii tepidanaerobacter acetatoxydans and c ultunense with methanoculleus spp chen et al 2014 lü et al 2016 however the above approaches were usually of limited effectiveness and acetate still accumulated because the occurrence of saohm was restricted by interspecies hydrogen transfer iht stams and plugge 2009 direct interspecies electron transfer diet is a newly discovered electron transport model as a superior alternative to iht and adding conductive materials cms e g magnetite biochar and granular activated carbon etc has been proved as an effective way to stimulate diet lovley 2017 currently adding cms has also been found to alleviate ammonia inhibition and methanosarcina or methanosaete was reported to serve as the dominating methanogenic contributor florentino et al 2019 luo et al 2015 lee et al 2019 lü et al 2016 among methanogenic archaea methanosaeta harundinacea methanosarcina barkeri and methanosarcina mazei were the most thoroughly studied diet partners in the co culture with geobacter species holmes et al 2017 rotaru et al 2014 it is coincident that methanosarcina species is also resistant to ammonia due to its aggregated structure of cocci or macro cysts lü et al 2013 however methanosaete as the core species of angs for its filamentous and windable characteristics is vulnerable to ammonia yan et al 2020 zeb et al 2019 our group previously reported that adding magnetite enriched electroactive volatile fatty acids vfas oxidizers and methanosaete and synergistically accelerated the formation of angs wang et al 2019a 2020a however the effectiveness of magnetite addition and the response of angs to ammonia stress are underreported in addition the diet mechanism under ammonia stress is still ambiguous there was even a contradiction that adding magnetite was found to only up regulate aceticlastic methanogenesis am pathway rather than co2 reduction pathway under ammonia stress which indicated that diet was not improved wang et al 2020b yan et al 2020 therefore it is necessary to further clarify the response of methanogenic metabolism in presence of magnetite to ammonia stress this study systematically explored the response of methanogenic granules enhanced by magnetite to the ammonia stress in up flow anaerobic sludge bed uasb reactors firstly the effectiveness of adding magnetite against different ammonia levels was evaluated secondly the changes in physicochemical characteristics electron transfer ability and key enzyme activities of angs with without magnetite were analyzed finally the succession of microbes was identified by quantitative pcr qpcr and high throughput sequencing analysis meanwhile the methanogenic metabolism of methanosaete under ammonia stress was focused by reverse transcriptase quantitative pcr rt qpcr 2 materials and methods 2 1 setup and operation of reactors two identical uasb reactors with a volume of 7 5 l and a height of 65 cm were built thereinto r1 was added with 10 g fe l micron magnetite and r2 was set as the control group the synthetic wastewater used sucrose as a carbon source and the components of synthetic wastewater along with the composition of trace elements were listed in detail in supplementary material table s1 s2 the inoculated sludge was collected from a municipal wastewater treatment plant hangzhou china as reported in our previous study wang et al 2019a the micron magnetite fe3o4 98 2 70 0 01 μm average size purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china was used and the x ray diffraction pattern polycrystal x ray diffractometer of rigaku dmax 2550pc japan of sludge mixed with magnetite was shown in fig s1 before ammonia inhibition experiments both uasb reactors had been operated in parallel under mesophilic conditions 35 2 c for 180 days with the organic loading rate olr of 10 kg cod m3 d and hydraulic retention time hrt of 24 d wang et al 2019a based on literature and field researches the excessive ammonia was usually released from the fermentation of protein or urea and abundant in landfill leachate 1 5 g tan l sludge thermal hydrolysate 0 77 2 64 g tan l livestock wastewater 0 3 3 5 g tan l dairy wastewater 1 2 2 2 g tan l etc li et al 2021 pang et al 2020 wilson et al 2012 in this study the additional nh4cl was manually added into the influent to control a certain tan concentration based on the mass of nh4 the whole operation was divided into four stages stage ⅰ from day 1 to 30 with 0 321 g tan l stage ⅱ from day 31 to 60 with 1 5 g tan l stage ⅲ from day 61 to 90 with 3 0 g tan l stage ⅳ from day 91 to 150 with 5 0 g tan l both reactors were operated continuously for 148 days with the same olr and hrt mentioned above 2 2 analysis of liquid and gas samples the chemical oxygen demand cod tan and ph of liquid were measured following standard methods chen et al 2018 and the fa concentration was calculated according to chen et al 2008 the biogas production was recorded by a gas flowmeter under the condition of 35 c and 1 bar the vfas concentration and biogas component mainly ch4 co2 and h2 were measured by a gas chromatography 7890a agilent usa using a flame ionization detector and a thermal conductivity detector 2 3 analysis of sludge characteristics the granule size distribution and average granule size of angs were assayed using a dynamic image analyzer qicpic sympatec germany xu et al 2021 the intensity of angs represented as the integrity coefficient ic was determined following wang et al 2019b the angs samples at the end of operation were observed by a scanning electron microscope sem hitachi su 8010 japan the pore size distribution of angs was determined by a mercury intrusion method xu et al 2021 and the permeability was calculated according to darcy s law the activity of electron transfer system ets of angs was determined by the 2 p iodophenyl 3 p nitrophenyl 5 phenyltetrazolium chloride electron transport system int ets method yin et al 2018 and adenosine triphosphate atp in angs was determined according to zhao et al 2020 the extraction of extracellular polymeric substances eps from angs was carried out following a heating method and polysaccharides ps and proteins pn in eps were quantified for further analyzing the changes of eps components three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem combined with parallel factor parafac analysis were conducted the eps samples were also electrochemically characterized using a cyclic voltammetry cv method and a differential pulse voltammetry dpv method by an electrochemical workstation chi660e huachen china wang et al 2019b ye et al 2018 in addition to further identify electroactive components of eps the electronic absorption spectra were obtained by ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer uv 2600 shimadzu japan with a diffuse transmission mode wang et al 2020b all the detailed procedures related to eps extraction and analysis were shown in supplementary material 2 4 analysis of enzyme activities in this study the activity of key enzymes in methanogenic degradation of sucrose including α glucosidase α glu phosphotransbutyrylase ptb butyrate kinase bk coa transferase coat phosphotransacetylase pta acetate kinase ak c type cytochromes cyts c coenzyme f420 cof420 and coenzyme m com were determined the enzyme linked immunoassay double antibody methods were applied and the detailed procedures were conducted according to the previous study wang et al 2020a 2 5 analysis of quantitative pcr and microbial community the total dna was extracted from homogenous sludge samples in four stages day 28 58 88 and 148 wang et

gtgctcccccgccaattcct 3 for archaea 340f 5 tcctacgggaggcagcagt 3 and 515r 5 cgtattaccgcggctgctggcac 3 for bacteria the detailed procedures were performed according to chen et al 2018 and there were three technical duplications the extracted dna samples were further analyzed to explore the succession of microbial communities in this study the specific primers were designed to amplify the v3 v4

day 28 and 148 after rna quality control complementary dna cdna was synthesized by reverse transcription using a primescript rt reagent kit the synthesized cdna was used as a template for qpcr and

sequences were provided in the supplementary material table s4 and the detailed procedures were previously described as liu et al 2019 2 7 data analysis t test was conducted to determine the significance of results by spss spss 17 0 p 0 05 meant 95 significant level and p 0 01 meant 99 significant level 3 results 3 1 performance of uasb reactors 3 1 1 cod removal as shown in fig 1 a cod removal efficiency of r1 and r2 was 98 6 0 3 and 91 8 0 8 respectively in stage ⅰ which indicated that adding magnetite could improve cod removal performance when reactors were operating normally when adding 1 5 g l excessive tan cod removal efficiency of r1 was barely affected whereas that in r2 decreased to 87 9 1 3 when tan concentration increased to 3 g l r1 was only slightly inhibited and still had a higher cod removal efficiency of 92 3 1 2 while the performance of r2 was relatively inefficient with a lower cod removal efficiency of 79 4 2 2 as the ammonia level further increased 5 g tan l the cod removal efficiency of r1 could be maintained at 87 6 1 6 for the long term operation of the next 60 days in contrast r2 suffered serious performance deterioration and its cod removal efficiency was only 56 8 5 1 the results indicated that r1 was robust under ammonia stress but r2 was relatively vulnerable to ammonia 3 1 2 biogas production and components biogas production results were similar to cod removal efficiency fig 1 b during four stages biogas production of r1 was 0 52 0 02 0 49 0 01 0 45 0 01 and 0 43 0 01 m3 kg cod respectively adding magnetite could always ensure effective biogas production under ammonia stress in contrast biogas production of r2 was seriously inhibited as the ammonia level increased and eventually arrived at a stagnant state meanwhile methane content in biogas from r1 was also less affected and eventually maintained at 58 9 2 2 whereas that from r2 continued to decrease and ended at only 17 9 5 fig s2 the h2 partial pressure in biogas was also detected fig s2 and rose with the increase of tan concentration in both reactors nevertheless the h2 partial pressure in r1 was always lower than that in r2 indicating that adding magnetite could alleviate the accumulation of h2 3 1 3 variations of ph vfas and fa the influent ph of both reactors was relatively stable but effluent ph differed in four stages fig 1 c during stage ⅰ the effluent of r1 and r2 had similar ph 7 18 0 09 and 7 14 0 05 respectively which favored the growth of methanogens during stage ⅱ the ph of r1 barely changed while the ph of r2 decreased to 6 93 0 12 in anaerobic system the vfas accumulation caused by the metabolic imbalance between acidogenesis and methanogenesis is the reason for ph drop in stage ⅱ more vfas especially propionate and butyrate accumulated in r2 442 1 41 1 mg l than those in r1 101 8 8 1 mg l fig 2 d when tan concentration increased to 3 g l the ph of r1 decreased but was still neutral 7 07 0 07 however the effluent of r2 was slightly acidic ph of 6 51 0 09 and the accumulated vfas reached 1176 9 127 1 mg l along with the further increase of ammonia level the ph of r1 decreased to 6 83 0 07 but was still in a range suitable for the growth of methanogens in contrast r2 suffered serious acidification ph of 5 24 0 44 and the accumulated vfas reached 4125 6 358 8 mg l fa as the main inhibitor in tan was also calculated fig s3 fa concentration in r1 and r2 was similar in stage ⅰ as the tan level increased fa concentration in r2 was always lower than that in r1 due to the lower ph the ph control was a strategy to reduce the fa production instead the ph in this study was passively decreased which indicated that the syntrophic microbes might be more susceptible to fa in r2 3 2 physicochemical characteristics of methanogenic granules 3 2 1 granular size and intensity after the previous cultivation wang et al 2019a the angs in r1 had a higher average granule size 1 03 mm and ic 0 65 0 005 in stage ⅰ fig 2 a b under ammonia stress the angs in r1 could always remain stable in the last three stages the average granule size was 1 49 1 21 and 1 39 mm respectively and the large granules of 1 2 mm and 2 mm always accounted for the larger proportions 47 2 64 9 meanwhile the granule intensity in r1 was always higher in contrast the average granule size in r2 showed a downward trend with a decrease from 0 91 to 0 7 mm and the proportion of large granules also declined moreover the ic of granules in r2 decreased from 0 61 0 004 to 0 44 0 02 3 2 2 granular pore and permeability the granule pore was an important structural parameter and a supporting condition for internal mass transfer of angs liu et al 2010 in this study capillary pores size between 0 1 µm and 1 mm were dominant 99 in all granule samples fig 2 c in r1 the granule pore distribution was relatively less affected and small granule pores of 0 5 µm and 5 50 µm always accounted for the larger proportion 55 in four stages as for r2 the granule pores of 0 5 µm were barely detected the proportion of 5 50 µm granule pores was always lower even decreased from 40 5 to 23 9 as the tan level increased it was also observed from the sem images that the angs structure in r1 was tight while that in r2 was loose under ammonia stress simultaneously more filamentous microbes were aggregated on the surface of angs in r1 while those were barely observed in r2 fig s4 it was reported that the capillary force in capillary pores increased with the decrease of pore size an et al 2016 when the pumping and pushing effect caused by hydraulic pressure was stronger than capillary force the convective mass transfer occurred liu et al 2010 the granule permeability could characterize the ease of convective mass transfer xu et al 2021 its value in r1 was always lower than that in r2 fig 2 d the result indicated that the convective mass transfer efficiency of angs in r1 was relatively lower than that in r2 3 2 3 eps components of methanogenic granules eps were secretory high molecular organic substances containing mainly pn and ps pn was rich in hydrophobic functional groups which was conducive to the stability of granules liu et al 2004 during the first three stages the secreted pn in r1 was always higher than those in r2 fig s5 a moreover the pn ps in r1 was 2 13 2 12 and 1 48 respectively always higher than those in r2 the secretion of eps showed no obvious response to increasing tan except for that in the last stage during stage ⅳ pn and ps content in r2 increased sharply to 68 9 0 22 and 67 5 0 56 mg gvss respectively which might be caused by lysis of cells and incomplete degradation of sucrose liu et al 2004 for further understanding eps components 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy combined with parafac analysis were applied fig s5 b there were three main fluorescent components including tryptophan and protein like substances humic acid like substances as well as cof420 fig s6 thereinto tryptophan and protein like substances were beneficial to the stability of angs wang et al 2019b which intensity in r1 was always higher than that in r2 humic acid like substances were reported to mediate microbial extracellular electron transport eet wang et al 2019b but their intensity had no obvious difference between r1 and r2 cof420 was an important intracellular coenzyme involved in co2 dependent methanogenesis it could be regarded as an indicator of cell lysis that cof420 was detected extracellularly during stage ⅳ the intensity of cof420 in r2 increased sharply and was much higher than that in r1 3 3 activity analysis of methanogenic granules 3 3 1 ets activity and atp content in granules ets activity is an important indicator to determine microbial respiration rate zhao et al 2020 as shown in fig 3 a the int ets activity was always maintained at a high level in r1 which was 104 5 3 7 112 6 3 102 8 3 and 99 3 3 9 mg gtss h respectively in four stages in contrast the int ets activity showed a downward trend in r2 with a decrease from 98 4 8 8 to 46 9 3 6 mg gtss h the higher int ets activity in r1 might be attributed to the reinforcement of eet zhao et al 2020 the microbial respiration process is always associated with atp formation which is the universal energy currency in cells the atp content of angs in r1 was 41 9 2 7 40 4 3 7 36 6 1 8 and 32 5 3 9 mmol g while that in r2 was 34 2 2 9 29 3 6 26 5 2 4 and 12 7 1 8 mmol g respectively in four stages fig 3 b the higher energy metabolism level might be conducive to counteract ammonia stress in r1 3 3 2 redox activity of eps cv curves of sludge eps from both reactors in stage ⅰ and ⅳ were shown in fig 4 a under ammonia stress cv curves became more rectangular and their area increased which indicated an increased capacitance of eps ye et al 2018 more importantly it was observed that cv curves in r1 had redox peaks around 0 4 v versus ag agcl unless otherwise whereas those in r2 were barely detected for better understanding the redox characteristics of eps the more sensitive dpv method was applied fig 4 c d there was a pair of redox peaks with the potentials of 386 mv cathodic and 420 mv anodic in r1 which was ascribed to flavins okamoto et al 2013 it was worth mentioning that the peak currents were 2 53 µa anodic and 2 21 µa cathodic in stage ⅳ higher than those 1 9 µa and 2 18 µa in stage ⅰ in addition through uv vis spectra a higher concentration of cyts c was determined in r1 fig 4 b xiao et al 2017 the results indicated that adding magnetite could improve redox activity of eps by enriching extracellular flavins and cyts c and the redox activity could be well maintained under ammonia stress 3 3 3 key enzyme activities of angs enzyme activity is a direct indicator reflecting the metabolic ability of angs as shown in fig 5 the key enzyme activities involved in the methanogenic degradation of sucrose in stage ⅰ and ⅳ were determined thereinto α glu was responsible for catalyzing sucrose hydrolysis ptb and bk were involved in butyrate fermentation coat was involved in propionate fermentation pta and ak were involved in acetogenisis cyts c could reflect the electron transfer activity cof420 was involved in co2 dependent methanogenesis and com was required in the last step of all methanogenic pathways wang et al 2020a the activity of the enzymes mentioned above decreased by 0 76 13 5 and 40 7 6 8 18 3 and 3 8 2 2 7 3 and 17 3 respectively in r1 while decreased by 39 1 34 7 and 84 5 39 2 62 7 and 18 8 78 8 102 9 and 96 6 in r2 respectively in general the activity of all enzymes detected in both reactors decreased under ammonia stress but those were only slightly inhibited in r1 which was in accordance with the performance of reactors in addition the enzyme activities related to methanogenesis were more inhibited than those related to acidogenesis in r2 which indicated the metabolic imbalance between acidogenesis and methanogenesis under ammonia stress 3 4 analysis of sludge microbial community 3 4 1 archaea communities of angs the gene copies of archaea and bacteria in both reactors were determined table s3 thereinto archaea were more sensitive to ammonia with a decreasing proportion from 38 1 0 4 to 29 2 1 in r1 and from 29 1 0 6 to 12 6 0 9 in r2 fig 6 a nevertheless the archaeal proportions in r1 were always higher than those in r2 methanosaeta and methanobacterium were the dominate methanogenic archaea before ammonia inhibition adding magnetite could enrich methanosaeta under ammonia stress the abundance of methanosaeta generally decreased in both reactors however methanosaeta was still dominated in r1 with 45 8 abundance in stage ⅳ as for r2 the abundance of methanosaeta decreased to 34 1 and the hydrogenotrophic methanobacterium accounted for the largest proportion of 56 8 in stage ⅳ it was determined that adding magnetite contributed to the retention of methanosaeta species under ammonia stress in addition methanosarcina 17 5 of abundance was also detected in the presence of magnetite in stage ⅳ 3 4 2 bacterial communities of angs the bacterial communities at the genus level were shown in fig 6 b clostridium sensu stricto 1 belonging to firmicutes chen et al 2018 was dominated in this study as tan concentration increased the abundance of clostridium sensu stricto 1 increased from 17 8 to 34 3 in r1 and from 5 4 to 23 1 in r2 respectively it was noted that the abundance of clostridium sensu stricto 1 in r1 was always higher than that in r2 lactococcus belonging to firmicutes was a fermentative bacteria and always abundant in dairy wastewater pang et al 2020 the higher abundance of lactococcus indicated more efficient fermentative performance in r1 3 5 rt qpcr analysis for methanosaeta considering the dominance of methanosaeta and the difference in changes of its abundance between r1 and r2 it was necessary to gain insight into its intrinsic metabolism methanosaeta was capable of am meanwhile methanosaeta species have been demonstrated to contain a complete genome coding for co2 dependent pathway but could only utilize exogenous electrons directly instead of hydrogen or formate due to the lack of membrane bound hydrogenase complexes holmes et al 2017 as shown in fig 7 adding magnetite could increase the activity of methanosaeta all genes detected were more actively expressed in r1 than those in r2 under ammonia stress the gene expression also responded in r1 the acs and chda genes from acetate decarboxylation process were relatively less transcribed in stage ⅳ compared to those in stage ⅰ however the mtd and mer genes coding for co2 reduction process lei et al 2019 were still maintained abundant in stage ⅳ in addition fpo coding for f420h2 dehydrogenase complex and hdrabc coding for soluble electron bifurcating heterodisulfide complex were also actively expressed in stage ⅳ fpo and hdrabc were reported to play an important role in methanosaeta concilii grown via diet holmes et al 2017 lei et al 2019 in contrast in situ expression of all genes detected in r2 was inhibited under ammonia stress 4 discussion 4 1 inhibition of methanogenic granules by ammonia as well known microbes would secret more eps for self protection during disturbances such as overload or some toxicants campo et al 2016 liu et al 2004 however ammonia toxicity was unique in that it could directly disturb cell energy metabolism chen et al 2008 in r2 the electron transport activity and atp content in angs decreased under ammonia stress fig 3 which was not in favor of eps secretion liu et al 2004 instead cells would grow slowly die and even lyse due to lack of energy proven by more intracellular substances detected extracellularly in stage ⅳ fig s5 b according to microbial analysis the archaeal population gradually decreased and the loss of methanosaeta was severe in r2 under ammonia stress fig 6 a methanosaeta was the skeleton of angs and its loss directly led to structural damage and loosening of angs fig 2 c s4 in addition the increase of hydrophilic ps content in eps was not conducive to the stability of angs in r2 fig s5 a therefore the angs in r2 became easily disintegrated and the sludge concentration decreased significantly under ammonia stress table s5 several studies have reported that hm pathway dominated in anaerobic system under ammonia stress chen et al 2014 wang et al 2020b hydrogenotrophic methanobacterium gradually substituted methanosaeta in r2 fig 6 a however the decreased cof420 activity indicated that hm pathway was still inhibited by ammonia in r2 fig 5 it could be speculated that methanobacterium was also inhibited though not as much as methanosaeta under the high olr condition the inefficient methanobacterium could not consume hydrogen molecules timely fig s2 furthermore the increase of hydrogen partial pressure inhibited acetogenisis in thermodynamics as a result vfas especially propionate and butyrate accumulated and biogas production was at a stagnant state in r2 fig 1 4 2 robust methanogenic granules enhanced by magnetite 4 2 1 potential mechanism of adding magnetite to resist the ammonia inhibition compared to the structural damage and loosening of angs in r2 addition of magnetite could facilitate the enrichment of methanosaeta and secretion of eps fig 6 s5 and the angs in r1 could always maintain the stability of structure under ammonia stress fig 2 together with the permeability data fig 2 d the convective mass transfer efficiency of angs in r1 was relatively lower than that in r2 it was reported that methanosaeta in the inner biofilm could be protected from ammonia by outer biofilm on the surface of biochar due to the limited mass transfer lü et al 2016 however in the present study the microbes inside the granules that were not exposed to excessive ammonia could also not acquire enough substrates and nutrients in addition under the long term high ammonia operating conditions the ammonia concentration inside granule pores might be exactly the same as that in the bulk liquid due to concentration diffusion therefore mass transfer limitation had little effect in alleviating ammonia inhibition therefore it was raised the question why the addition of magnetite could enhance the retention of methanosaeta under ammonia stress fig 6 a in the present study the improved electrochemical activity of eps suggested the stronger eet ability of angs fig 4 in addition the more actively expressed genes for co2 dependent methanogenesis were an indicator for the enhancement of diet involved in methanosaeta fig 7 as a matter of fact the standard gibbs free energy of co2 dependent methanogenesis 135 6 kj mol was much higher than that of am pathway 31 0 kj mol wang et al 2020b it was reported that methanosaeta harundinacea grew faster through diet based syntropism with geobacter metallireducens than that grew solely with acetate rotaru et al 2014 zhao et al 2020 also found that the energy metabolism of methanosaeta species was more active with more v a type atpase genes detected in anaerobic sludge when ethanol was used to induce diet under ammonia stress it was interesting that the genes coding for am pathway were relatively less transcribed while those coding for co2 dependent pathway were still actively expressed fig 7 combined with the higher electron transport activity and more atp concentration of angs fig 3 it could be proposed that methanosaeta could improve its own metabolic activity by co2 dependent pathway in the presence of magnetite and more energy was obtained to resist ammonia inhibition 4 2 2 methanogenic metabolism enhanced by magnetite under the ammonia stress recently several studies have reported that adding magnetite mainly facilitated the enrichment of methanosarcina under ammonia stress lee et al 2019 wang et al 2020b yan et al 2020 the ammonia resistant methanosarcina was metabolically versatile including am and co2 dependent methanogenesis de vrieze et al 2012 it seemed that methanosarcina should be more competitive than methanosaeta under ammonia stress however the abundance of methanosarcina was much lower than that of methanosaeta in stage ⅳ fig 6 a the reasons behind might be the relatively lower substrate affinity and activity of methanosarcina de vrieze et al 2012 it was reported that methanosaeta was the pioneer and methanosarcina was the rearguard for methanogenic degradation of acetate in biochar added batch reactors lü et al 2016 in the continuous reactor of this study it was the methanosaeta as the dominant methanogenic contributor and methanosarcina as the assistant methanogenic contributor ensuring efficient methanogenesis under the high ammonia and organic condition another point worthy of discussion was that the enhancement on am via the addition of magnetite was always highlighted under ammonia stress wang et al 2020b yan et al 2020 indeed am was essential for the contribution of about 70 methane production in anaerobic reactors van lier et al 2015 in the present study the am activity was also higher in r1 than that in r2 as evidenced by the higher abundance of methanosaeta and its more transcribed genes coding for am fig 6 a 7 however according to the discussion in 4 1 1 iht was the primary limited step of the methanogenic reaction chain under the high ammonia and organic condition clostridium sensu stricto 1 was an iron reducing bacterium which was also resistant to ammonia lee et al 2019 yan et al 2020 reported that adding magnetite could enrich clostridium sensu stricto 1 when treating high ammonia sludge thermal hydrolysate in r1 more abundant clostridium sensu stricto 1 was also detected fig 6 b the robust syntrophism between clostridium sensu stricto 1 and methanosaeta might alleviate the blockage of iht and the overall methanogenic metabolism of sucrose was maintained more active under ammonia stress fig 5 nevertheless the diet process between clostridium sensu stricto 1 and methanosaeta needs to be further demonstrated in the co culture system in summary anaerobic treatment of high ammonia and organic wastewater showed great advantages for bioenergy recovery which could also serve as a pretreatment for energy efficient anammox adding magnetite was a simple and robust strategy to improve the energy metabolism of angs for counteracting ammonia inhibition and selectively enrich ammonia resistant microbes which contributed to the efficient operation of the process and promotion of carbon neutral development of wastewater treatment 5 conclusions addition of magnetite could improve the microbial energy metabolism accelerate proliferation of microbial cells especially methanosaeta and secretion of eps and the formed angs could maintain the structural stability under ammonia stress the methanosaeta was metabolically active via co2 dependent pathway to counteract the ammonia inhibition thus could be better retained abundance of 45 8 meanwhile the ammonia resistant clostridium sensu stricto 1 was enriched in presence of magnetite the robust syntrophism between clostridium sensu stricto 1 and methanosaeta scavenged the blockage of iht as a result the electron transport activity and atp content were always higher and the overall methanogenic metabolism of sucrose was maintained active under the ammonia stress declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

16284,cyanobacteria harmful blooms can represent a major risk for public health due to potential release of toxins and other noxious compounds in the water a continuous and high resolution monitoring of the cyanobacteria population is required due to their rapid dynamics which has been increasingly done using in situ fluorescence of phycocyanin f pc and chlorophyll a f chl a appropriate in situ fluorometers calibration is essential because f pc and f chl a are affected by biotic and abiotic factors including species composition measurement of f pc and f chl a in mixed species assemblages during different growth phases representative of most field conditions has received little attention we hypothesized that f pc and f chl a of mixed assemblages of cyanobacteria may be accurately estimated if taxa composition and fluorescence characteristics are known we also hypothesized that species with different morphologies would have different fluorescence per unit cell and biomass we tested these hypotheses in a controlled culture experiment in which photosynthetic pigment fluorescence chemical pigment extraction optical density and microscopic enumeration of four common cyanobacteria species aphanocapsa sp microcystis aeruginosa dolichospermum circinale and raphidiopsis raciborskii were quantified both monocultures and mixed cultures were monitored from exponential to late stationary growth phases the sum of fluorescence of individual species calculated for mixed samples was not significantly different than measured fluorescence of mixed cultures estimated and measured f pc and f chl a of mixed cultures had higher correlations and smaller absolute median errors when estimations were based on fluorescence per biomass instead of fluorescence per cell largest errors were overestimations of measured fluorescence for species with different morphologies fluorescence per cell was significantly different among most species while fluorescence per unit biomass was not indicating that conversion of fluorescence to biomass reduces species specific bias this study presents new information on the effect of species composition on cyanobacteria fluorescence best practices of deployment and operation of fluorometers and data driven models supporting in situ fluorometers calibration are discussed as suitable solutions to minimize taxa specific bias in fluorescence estimates graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cyanobacteria monitoring fluorescence sensors cyanohabs water resources management water quality 1 introduction monitoring cyanobacteria populations in waterbodies is important to water managers because these microorganisms impair water use under certain conditions water quality deterioration due to cyanobacteria occurs when they grow rapidly and form harmful algal blooms cyanohabs these blooms can impact drinking water supply and recreational users due to the presence of toxins and other noxious compounds heisler et al 2008 because cyanohabs can vary spatially and temporally comprehensive management of water resources requires rapid and continuous in situ monitoring of the cyanobacterial populations dubelaar et al 2004 recent advances in cyanobacteria monitoring technologies include acoustic methods ostrovsky et al 2018 high frequency cytometry thyssen et al 2008 remote sensing yan et al 2018b and in situ fluorescence sensors bertone et al 2018 these technologies can provide lower cost and higher spatial and temporal capability compared with traditional monitoring methodologies such as microscopic

accurate conversion of f pc to cell density and or biomass is required if water managers wish to use a sensor s rapid estimates to support decision making relating to water quality risks under field conditions a range of species with different sizes and shapes often co exist e g gallego et al 2019 thus accurate conversion of f pc to cells or biomass should not be limited to single species therefore this study aimed to address the limited amount of studies investigating fluorescence of multiple cyanobacteria species assemblages throughout their growth phases the aims of this study were as follows i to quantify variation in f pc among four ubiquitous cyanobacteria species throughout their growth phases ii to compare fluorescence readings among species with different characteristics i e morphology and cell size and iii to compare fluorescence readings between monocultures and mixed species cultures we hypothesized the following i f pc varies significantly within each species at different growth phases exponential and late stationary ii species with different morphologies single cells or trichome have different f pc to biomass ratios iii f pc of cyanobacteria can be accurately estimated if the species composition and individual species fluorescence per unit biomass are known 2 materials and methods 2 1 cyanobacteria cultures the four cyanobacterial species assessed in this experiment table 1 were selected because they have been shown to frequently dominate cyanohabs in drinking reservoirs in australia burford and o donohue 2006 rousso et al 2022 and are distributed globally harke et al 2016 li et al 2016 sidelev et al 2020 paerl and huisman 2009 the species were isolated from different locations table 1 and were cultured and maintained at the australian rivers institute griffith university stock cultures of all species were maintained in modified joworski s medium jm andersen 2005 except d circinale which was maintained in blue green medium bg 11 rippka et al 1979 because this species did not grow in modified jm all cultures were grown at a temperature of 28 c under a light intensity of 20 μmol photons m 2 s 1 from a cool white light source led on a 12 12 h light to dark cycle cultures were gently shaken manually three times per week during growth the period taken to grow the cultures is henceforth referred to as the biomass accumulation phase 2 2 experimental design and methods from stock cultures each species was cultured in triplicate for 30 days i e biomass accumulation phase on day 1 of the biomass accumulation phase

biomass accumulation phase and during the experiment section 2 2 during the experiment od750 from monocultures was used to estimate the cell density and biomass of the individual species which facilitated the calculation of volumes of each replicate to obtain mixed samples with equal proportions of each species in terms of biomass or cell density 2 2 2 cell enumeration and biomass calculation subsamples 1 ml from cultures fixed with lugol s solution were enumerated using a sedgewick rafter counting chamber and counted microscopically under an inverted microscope with a 200x

capture the small cells ten ml of acetone 90 were added to the filters which were sonicated twice using a probe sonicator branson connecticut usa for 30 seconds s with a 30 s interval between each sonication sonication was done on ice after first cutting up the filters sonication extracts were filtered through gf f filters to remove filters and cellular debris and measured at 664 and 750 nm using a shimadzu uv vis spectrophotometer uv1800 equipped with a 3 5 ml quartz cell cuvette spectrosil 10 mm path length the spectrophotometer baseline for c chl a measurement was set using acetone 90

supplementary material d m aeruginosa and r raciborskii had higher ratios of od750 to biomass in the late stationary phase than during exponential phase while aphanocapsa sp and d circinale showed higher od750 to biomass in the exponential phase than in the late stationary phase the variability in the od750 and biomass correlations between growth phases were consistent with the changes in average biomass per cell of each species table 2 for m aeruginosa and r raciborskii average biomass per cell increased between the two growth phases and for d circinale it decreased aphanocapsa sp cells were too small for individual size measurements thus a reference constant biomass per cell measured previously bertone et al 2019 was used 3 3 correlations between pigment concentration

phases table 3 m aeruginosa had the most variability for all unitary fluorescence ratios among growth phases with consistently higher ratios in the exponential phase compared to stationary and or late stationary phases r raciborskii only showed decreases in fluorescence per unit biomass between exponential and late stationary phases in contrast d circinale had overall increases in pigment fluorescence per unit biomass and per unit cell except for f pc per unit cell which did not vary significantly between growth phases aphanocapsa sp had the least variability among growth phases with increases measured only for f chl a per unit cell between exponential and stationary phases mixed samples with single cell species had significant differences between all unitary fluorescence ratios while mixed samples comprised by trichomes only had significant differences for f chl a per cell interestingly none of the monocultures besides m aeruginosa showed f pc per f chl a with significant differences among growth phases while both morphology based mixed samples did 3 5 estimation of mixed sample fluorescence based on assemblage composition estimated see section 2 4 and measured f chl a and f pc of mixed samples were not statistically different f chl a estimates had higher r2 values and lower median absolute percentage errors than f pc estimates using biomass instead of cell density for f chl a and f pc estimates resulted in considerably stronger correlations between estimates and measurements fig 7 and slightly smaller median absolute percentage errors fig 8 both estimation methods i e based on biomass or cell density resulted in low overall absolute percentage errors fig 8 absolute median percentage error using biomass f chl a 6 f pc 7 5 was lower than cell density based estimations f chl a 7 5 f pc 11 absolute percentage errors were significantly different depending on the type of mixed sample fig 8 largest errors were overestimations from mixed samples comprised by large species for both f chl a and f pc fig 7 median absolute percentage errors of f chl a and f pc for morphology based samples were always lower ranging from 4 to 9 than samples comprising all species or large species ranging from 11 to 38 5 the absolute percentage errors were significantly different between estimation methods i e biomass or cell density based in samples containing all species f chl a and f pc and larger species f chl a estimates from morphology based mixed samples were not statistically different according to the method used median absolute percentage error for f chl a estimates in samples including all species and only large species were significantly higher when cell density all species error 19 5 large species 34 5 was used instead of biomass all species error 8 5 large species error 6 similarly median absolute percentage error of f pc estimates from samples comprised by all species was significantly higher for cell density based estimations all species error 38 5 compared to biomass based estimates all species error 15 the median absolute percentage error of f pc large species estimates was also higher for cell density 34 than biomass based estimates 10 5 however the difference was not statistically significant 4 discussion 4 1 fluorescence characteristics of single and mixed species assemblages phycocyanin and chlorophyll a fluorescence measured with the sensor were highly correlated with the respective measures based on conventional chemical methods consistent with the intended use of fluorometers to provide rapid quantification of cyanobacteria populations the correlation coefficient values were higher for individual species than for mixed assemblages again consistent with previous research bertone et al 2019 however in our experiment aphanocapsa sp f pc and f chl were highly correlated with c chl a and c pc respectively which contradicts previous findings pemberton et al 2007 seppälä et al 2007 that suggest strong disagreement between in situ picocyanobacteria quantification using either chemical pigment extraction or fluorescence the fluorescence of mixed species assemblages used in the laboratory in our study more representative of field conditions had r2 values with chemically extracted pigments between 0 54 and 0 89 where coefficient values decreased as the number of species increased and the morphology was more diverse it is important to acknowledge that chemical pigment extraction is also prone to errors ritchie 2006 which may be larger than errors in fluorescence estimates in some cases bertone et al 2019 phycocyanin and chlorophyll fluorescence per cell differed among species species with larger cell sizes had higher fluorescence per cell because cell pigment quota has been shown to be proportional to cell volume brient et al 2008 m aeruginosa had lower f pc and f chl a per cell from exponential to late stationary phases as also reported by chang et al 2012 which contrasted with slight increases measured by bertone et al 2019 r raciborskii also had decreased fluorescence per cell between exponential and late stationary phases in contrast to findings by bertone et al 2019 of an increase in fluorescence per cell during the growth phase for this species aphanocapsa sp f chl a per cell increased during the growth phase in our experiment while f pc per cell did not vary significantly bertone et al 2019 found aphanocapsa sp f chl a and f pc per cell increased from exponential to late stationary growth phase d circinale f pc and f chl a per cell increased between exponential and late stationary phases contrasting with chang et al 2012 who measured a decrease our findings together with those from previous studies indicate that fluorescence per cell is highly variable within and between species primarily because pigment content varies according to cell size which in turn varies with the species its growth stage and nutritional status lea smith et al 2016 most previous studies have assessed fluorescence per cell instead of per unit biomass bertone et al 2019 chang et al 2012 ziegmann et al 2010 our results indicate that fluorescence per unit biomass is consistent among most species despite variable cell size and morphology e g aphanocapsa sp d circinale and r raciborskii had similar f pc mg 1 and f chl a mg 1 similarities in fluorescence per unit biomass among species suggests that conversions of pigment fluorescence to biomass or biovolume may result in a reduced bias if species composition is uncertain nevertheless fluorescence per unit biomass can still vary among species and growth stages as observed in m aeruginosa in our experiment which showed higher fluorescence per unit biomass than other species and that significantly decreased throughout the growth phase in general fluorescence of mixed cyanobacteria assemblages was accurately estimated as the sum of fluorescence of constituent individual species but in some cases estimation resulted in large errors when compared to measurements the largest errors occurred when using fluorescence per cell to estimate the fluorescence of mixed assemblages of species with different morphologies bertone et al 2019 reported underestimation of the fluorescence of mixed samples when using the sum of individual species fluorescence whereas macário et al 2015 did not report large discrepancies between measured and estimated fluorescence conversion of raw fluorescence to cell density in field conditions where multiple cyanobacterial species often co exist amorim et al 2020 rousso et al 2021 zamyadi et al 2021 will be subject to large errors cyanohab management guidelines based on f pc have been proposed macário et al 2015 but its implementation is hindered by the lack of standardization and intercalibration among commercial fluorescence sensors brient et al 2008 hodges et al 2018 lee et al 1995 a limitation of this study was that species were cultured in the laboratory which can result in changes to their morphology from that observed in field conditions for instance colony formation is common for aphanocapsa sp and m aeruginosa in field conditions but was not observed in our laboratory experiments resulting in challenges for extrapolating laboratory findings to in situ monitoring another limitation of the present study is that cell size may have influenced the comparison between single cells and trichomes in mixed samples given that the assessed single cell species aphanocapsa sp and m aeruginosa have smaller cell sizes than the assessed species with trichomes d circinale and r raciborskii additionally other commercial in situ fluorescence probes may yield different f pc and f chl a absolute estimates due to differences in design and measuring methods future studies should compare the solitary and colonial forms of a species provided colony formation can be achieved under laboratory conditions using fluorescence probes from different manufacturers 4 2 implications for field monitoring and water resources management high frequency fluorescence sensors provide an opportunity to improve the understanding prediction and management of waterbodies particularly those at risk from cyanohabs rode et al 2016 however caution should be exercised when employing these devices because a range of factors see bertone et al 2018 for a review including species composition may interfere with the readings and lead to erroneous interpretations our results in line with previous research bertone et al 2019 bowling et al 2016 chang et al 2012 hodges et al 2018 macário et al 2015 ziegmann et al 2010 indicate that species composition bias in fluorescence estimates can be compensated for by targeted calibration automated and fast correction of in situ systems for this bias is limited because identification of cyanobacterial species still relies on traditional microscopic enumeration however recent modeling efforts including machine learning and numerical models see rousso et al 2020 for a review of applications have shown that the dominant species in a cyanobacteria assemblage may be predicted from environmental conditions e g water quality meteorology or hydrodynamics some parameters e g water temperature dissolved oxygen nitrate and dissolved organic matter can be monitored in near real time which may allow their use as predictors of cyanobacterial species dominance combining these models with species specific calibration may help to compensate for species composition bias in fluorescence estimates in near real time rousso et al 2019 bias from species composition is only one of the factors that needs to be considered for the successful implementation of fluorescence sensors for cyanohab management consistent protocols for fluorescence sensor operation comprehensive monitoring plans and effective management and use of data post hoc are required comprehensive monitoring plans should employ several monitoring technologies in an attempt to complement the intrinsic limitations of each monitoring method simis et al 2007 for the effective implementation of fluorescence sensors for cyanobacteria and phytoplankton management we propose considering six general guidelines first standardized operational practices e g device maintenance cleaning power supply probe positioning and hazard protection must be strictly followed to ensure continuous and representative supply of raw data from fluorescence sensors mcbride rose 2018 fluorescence sensors are prone to fouling drift and malfunction resulting in measurements that are not representative despite appropriate calibration second several other optically active variables may interfere with fluorescence measurements see bertone et al 2018 for a review and these should be part of a routine monitoring program third monitoring using higher taxa precision methods e g microscopy is still required for identifying key phytoplankton species including cyanobacteria fourth the integration of multiple sources of data is required to the correlate environmental conditions with site specific triggers for cyanobacterial species dominance understanding site specific cyanobacterial dynamics is crucial to identify key factors that may interfere with fluorescence sensor output and in order to design adequate calibration tests sampling campaigns should be optimised in time and space to ground truth fluorescence sensor estimates and species targeted management responses zamyadi et al 2012 zamyadi et al 2013 the development of statistical compensation models for potential sources of bias in cyanobacteria fluorescence and validation using site specific data is the fifth guideline to be considered these compensation models should target outputs that are applicable to water quality guidelines recently updated to biomass or biovolume units chorus welker 2021 finally high frequency calibrated cyanobacteria estimates should have appropriate post hoc use aiming to support proactive cyanohabs management examples of efficient use of data post hoc include the development and validation of short term forecasting e g early warning systems or long term predictive e g scenario analysis some machine learning and numerical models based on fluorescence estimates have recently been developed to forecast cyanohab occurrence elliott 2012 ndong et al 2014 xiao et al 2017 predict dominant species cao et al 2016 fadel et al 2017 and understand the main drivers for cyanobacteria succession shan et al 2019 wei et al 2001 exemplifying the potential of high frequency data in improving these models hamilton et al 2015 rousso et al 2020 species specific calibration of fluorescence sensors must be part of an integrated management plan that considers account site specific characteristics e g dominant taxa interferences and supports informed decision making 5 conclusion controlled experiments were performed to assess differences in fluorescence of phycocyanin f pc and chlorophyll a f chl a among four cyanobacterial species with differing morphologies and cell size throughout their growth phase and in single and mixed species assemblages the findings indicate that i f pc and f chl a varied significantly for each species throughout its growth phase ii species with different morphologies have different f pc and f chl a characteristics and iii cyanobacteria fluorescence in assemblages could be accurately estimated from the fluorescence characteristics of monocultures despite potential for errors these findings highlight that caution should be exercised when interpreting fluorescence sensor readings without adequate species specific calibration strong correlations between sensor fluorescence and conventional phytoplankton quantification methods were only achieved after species specific compensation conversion from raw fluorescence units to biomass or biovolume should be performed to minimize bias due to variability in cell size among species species specific calibration is only one of several factors that should be considered when employing fluorescence sensors in an operational framework associated with water resources management and integration with standardized operational protocols site specific characterization and data analysis tools are required despite

16284,cyanobacteria harmful blooms can represent a major risk for public health due to potential release of toxins and other noxious compounds in the water a continuous and high resolution monitoring of the cyanobacteria population is required due to their rapid dynamics which has been increasingly done using in situ fluorescence of phycocyanin f pc and chlorophyll a f chl a appropriate in situ fluorometers calibration is essential because f pc and f chl a are affected by biotic and abiotic factors including species composition measurement of f pc and f chl a in mixed species assemblages during different growth phases representative of most field conditions has received little attention we hypothesized that f pc and f chl a of mixed assemblages of cyanobacteria may be accurately estimated if taxa composition and fluorescence characteristics are known we also hypothesized that species with different morphologies would have different fluorescence per unit cell and biomass we tested these hypotheses in a controlled culture experiment in which photosynthetic pigment fluorescence chemical pigment extraction optical density and microscopic enumeration of four common cyanobacteria species aphanocapsa sp microcystis aeruginosa dolichospermum circinale and raphidiopsis raciborskii were quantified both monocultures and mixed cultures were monitored from exponential to late stationary growth phases the sum of fluorescence of individual species calculated for mixed samples was not significantly different than measured fluorescence of mixed cultures estimated and measured f pc and f chl a of mixed cultures had higher correlations and smaller absolute median errors when estimations were based on fluorescence per biomass instead of fluorescence per cell largest errors were overestimations of measured fluorescence for species with different morphologies fluorescence per cell was significantly different among most species while fluorescence per unit biomass was not indicating that conversion of fluorescence to biomass reduces species specific bias this study presents new information on the effect of species composition on cyanobacteria fluorescence best practices of deployment and operation of fluorometers and data driven models supporting in situ fluorometers calibration are discussed as suitable solutions to minimize taxa specific bias in

cyanobacteria populations in waterbodies is important to water managers because these microorganisms impair water use under certain conditions water quality deterioration due to cyanobacteria occurs when they grow rapidly and form harmful algal blooms cyanohabs these blooms can impact drinking water supply and recreational users due to the presence of toxins and other noxious compounds heisler et al 2008 because cyanohabs can vary spatially and temporally comprehensive management of water resources requires rapid and continuous in situ monitoring of the cyanobacterial populations dubelaar et

accurate conversion of f pc to cell density and or biomass is required if water managers wish to use a sensor s rapid estimates to support decision making relating to water quality risks under field conditions a range of species with different sizes and shapes often co exist e g gallego et al 2019 thus accurate conversion of f pc to cells or biomass should not be limited to single species therefore this study aimed to address the limited amount of studies investigating fluorescence of multiple cyanobacteria species assemblages throughout their growth phases the aims of this study were as follows i to quantify variation in f pc among four ubiquitous cyanobacteria species throughout their growth phases ii to compare fluorescence readings among species with different characteristics i e morphology and cell size and iii to compare fluorescence readings between monocultures and mixed species cultures we hypothesized the following i f pc varies significantly within each species at different growth phases exponential and late stationary ii species with different morphologies single cells or trichome have different f pc to biomass ratios iii f pc of cyanobacteria can be accurately estimated if the species composition and individual species fluorescence per unit biomass are known 2 materials and methods 2 1 cyanobacteria cultures the four cyanobacterial species

australian rivers institute griffith university stock cultures of all species were maintained in modified joworski s medium jm andersen 2005 except d circinale which was maintained in blue green

light source led on a 12 12 h light to dark cycle cultures were gently shaken manually three times per week during growth the period taken to grow the cultures is henceforth referred to as the biomass accumulation phase 2 2 experimental design and methods from stock cultures each species was cultured in triplicate for 30 days i e biomass accumulation phase on day 1 of the biomass accumulation phase

biomass accumulation phase and during the experiment section 2 2 during the experiment od750 from monocultures was used to estimate the cell density and biomass of the individual species which facilitated the calculation of volumes of each replicate to obtain mixed samples with equal proportions of each species in terms of biomass or cell density 2 2 2 cell enumeration and biomass

emission wavelength 685 20 nm ysi 2020 baseline measurements were set using ultrapure milli q water as blank samples were placed in dark opaque flexible tubes for one minute before sampling to avoid light interferences rousso et al 2021 a minimum sample volume of 50 ml was required to allow a complete submersion of the sensor and avoid interferences from the bottom of the tubes the sensor was immersed into the sample for 1 minute and kept in the dark before the f chl a and f pc values in raw fluorescence units rfu stabilized and the instantaneous value was recorded in between samples the sensor was rinsed twice with milli q water sartorius and dried to ensure reliability concomitantly with f chl a and f pc measurements water temperature was measured using a water temperature probe

supplementary material d m aeruginosa and r raciborskii had higher ratios of od750 to biomass in the late stationary phase than during exponential phase while aphanocapsa sp and d circinale showed higher od750 to biomass in the exponential phase than in the late stationary phase the variability in the od750 and biomass correlations between growth phases were consistent with the changes in average biomass per cell of each species table 2 for m aeruginosa and r raciborskii average biomass per cell increased between the two growth phases and for d circinale it decreased aphanocapsa sp cells were too small for individual size measurements thus a reference constant biomass per cell measured previously bertone et al 2019 was used 3 3 correlations between pigment concentration fluorescence sensor cell density and biomass c pc and c chl a determined on the basis of chemical methods had relatively high correlations with f pc and f chl a measured with the sensor r2 0 80 and 0

phases table 3 m aeruginosa had the most variability for all unitary fluorescence ratios among growth phases with consistently higher ratios in the exponential phase compared to stationary and or late stationary phases r raciborskii only showed decreases in fluorescence per unit biomass between exponential and late stationary phases in contrast d circinale had overall increases in pigment fluorescence per unit biomass and per unit cell except for f pc per unit cell which did not vary significantly between growth phases aphanocapsa sp had the least variability among growth phases with increases measured only for f chl a per unit cell between exponential and stationary phases mixed samples with single cell species had significant differences between all unitary fluorescence ratios while mixed samples comprised by trichomes only had significant differences for f chl a per cell interestingly none of the monocultures besides m aeruginosa showed f pc per f chl a with significant differences among growth phases while both morphology based mixed samples did 3 5 estimation of mixed sample fluorescence based on assemblage composition estimated see section 2 4 and measured f chl a and f pc of mixed samples were not statistically different f chl a estimates had higher r2 values and lower median absolute percentage errors than f pc estimates using biomass instead of cell density for f chl a and f pc estimates resulted in considerably stronger correlations between estimates and measurements fig 7 and slightly smaller median absolute percentage errors fig 8 both estimation methods i e based on biomass or cell density resulted in low overall absolute percentage errors fig 8 absolute median percentage error using biomass f chl a 6 f pc 7 5 was lower than cell density based estimations f chl a 7 5 f pc 11 absolute percentage errors were significantly different depending on the type of mixed sample fig 8 largest errors were overestimations from mixed samples comprised by large species for both f chl a and f pc fig 7 median absolute percentage errors of f chl a and f pc for morphology based samples were always lower ranging from 4 to 9 than samples comprising all species or large species ranging from 11 to 38 5 the absolute percentage errors were significantly different between estimation methods i e biomass or cell density based in samples containing all species f chl a and f pc and larger species f chl a estimates from morphology based mixed samples were not statistically different according to the method used median absolute percentage error for f chl a estimates in samples including all species and only large species were significantly higher when cell density all species error 19 5 large species 34 5 was used instead of biomass all species error 8 5 large species error 6 similarly median absolute percentage error of f pc estimates from samples comprised by all species was significantly higher for cell density based estimations all species error 38 5 compared to biomass based estimates all species error 15 the median absolute percentage error of f pc large species estimates was also higher for cell density 34 than biomass based estimates 10 5 however the difference was not statistically significant 4 discussion 4 1 fluorescence characteristics of single and mixed species assemblages phycocyanin and chlorophyll a fluorescence measured with the sensor were highly correlated with the respective measures based on conventional chemical methods consistent with the intended use of fluorometers to provide rapid quantification of cyanobacteria populations the correlation coefficient values were higher for individual species than for mixed assemblages again consistent with previous research bertone et al 2019 however in our experiment aphanocapsa sp f pc and f chl were highly correlated with c chl a and c pc respectively which contradicts previous findings pemberton et al 2007 seppälä et al 2007 that suggest strong disagreement between in situ picocyanobacteria quantification using either chemical pigment extraction or fluorescence the fluorescence of mixed species assemblages used in the laboratory in our study more representative of field conditions had r2 values with chemically extracted pigments between 0 54 and 0 89 where coefficient values decreased as the number of species increased and the morphology was more diverse it is important to acknowledge that chemical pigment extraction is also prone to errors ritchie 2006 which may be larger than errors in fluorescence estimates in some cases bertone et al 2019 phycocyanin and chlorophyll fluorescence per cell differed among species species with larger cell sizes had higher fluorescence per cell because cell pigment quota has been shown to be proportional to cell volume brient et al 2008 m aeruginosa had lower f pc and f chl a per cell from exponential to late stationary phases as also reported by chang et al 2012 which contrasted with slight increases measured by bertone et al 2019 r raciborskii also had decreased fluorescence per cell between exponential and late stationary phases in contrast to findings by bertone et al 2019 of an increase in fluorescence per cell during the growth phase for this species aphanocapsa sp f chl a per cell increased during the growth phase in our experiment while f pc per cell did not vary significantly bertone et al 2019 found aphanocapsa sp f chl a and f pc per cell increased from exponential to late stationary growth phase d circinale f pc and f chl a per cell increased between exponential and late stationary phases contrasting with chang et al 2012 who measured a decrease our findings together with those from previous studies indicate that fluorescence per cell is highly variable within and between species primarily because pigment content varies according to cell size which in turn varies with the species its growth stage and nutritional status lea smith et al 2016 most previous studies have assessed fluorescence per cell instead of per unit biomass bertone et al 2019 chang et al 2012 ziegmann et al 2010 our results indicate that fluorescence per unit biomass is consistent among most species despite variable cell size and morphology e g aphanocapsa sp d circinale and r raciborskii had similar f pc mg 1 and f chl a mg 1 similarities in fluorescence per unit biomass among species suggests that conversions of pigment fluorescence to biomass or biovolume may result in a reduced bias if species composition is uncertain nevertheless fluorescence per unit biomass can still vary among species and growth stages as observed in m aeruginosa in our experiment which showed higher fluorescence per unit biomass than other species and that significantly decreased throughout the growth phase in general fluorescence of mixed cyanobacteria assemblages was accurately estimated as the sum of fluorescence of constituent individual species but in some cases estimation resulted in large errors when compared to measurements the largest errors occurred when using fluorescence per cell to estimate the fluorescence of mixed assemblages of species with different morphologies bertone et al 2019 reported underestimation of the fluorescence of mixed samples when using the sum of individual species fluorescence whereas macário et al 2015 did not report large discrepancies between measured and estimated fluorescence conversion of raw fluorescence to cell density in field conditions where multiple cyanobacterial species often co exist amorim et al 2020 rousso et al 2021 zamyadi et al 2021 will be subject to large errors cyanohab management guidelines based on f pc have been proposed macário et al 2015 but its implementation is hindered by the lack of standardization and intercalibration among commercial fluorescence sensors brient et al 2008 hodges et al 2018 lee et al 1995 a limitation of this study was that species were cultured in the laboratory which can result in changes to their morphology from that observed in field conditions for instance colony formation is common for aphanocapsa sp and m aeruginosa in field conditions but was not observed in our laboratory experiments resulting in challenges for extrapolating laboratory findings to in situ monitoring another limitation of the present study is that cell size may have influenced the comparison between single cells and trichomes in mixed samples given that the assessed single cell species aphanocapsa sp and m aeruginosa have smaller cell sizes than the assessed species with trichomes d circinale and r raciborskii additionally other commercial in situ fluorescence probes may yield different f pc and f chl a absolute estimates due to differences in design and measuring methods future studies should compare the solitary and colonial forms of a species provided colony formation can be achieved under laboratory conditions using fluorescence probes from different manufacturers 4 2 implications for field monitoring and water resources management high frequency fluorescence sensors provide an opportunity to improve the understanding prediction and management of waterbodies particularly those at risk from cyanohabs rode et al 2016 however caution should be exercised when employing these devices because a range of factors see bertone et al 2018 for a review including species composition may interfere with the readings and lead to erroneous interpretations our results in line with previous research bertone et al 2019 bowling et al 2016 chang et al 2012 hodges et al 2018 macário et al 2015 ziegmann et al 2010 indicate that species composition bias in fluorescence estimates can be compensated for by targeted calibration automated and fast correction of in situ systems for this bias is limited because identification of cyanobacterial species still relies on traditional microscopic enumeration however recent modeling efforts including machine learning and numerical models see rousso et al 2020 for a review of applications have shown that the dominant species in a cyanobacteria assemblage may be predicted from environmental conditions e g water quality meteorology or hydrodynamics some parameters e g water temperature dissolved oxygen nitrate and dissolved organic matter can be monitored in near real time which may allow their use as predictors of cyanobacterial species dominance combining these models with species specific calibration may help to compensate for species composition bias in fluorescence estimates in near real time rousso et al 2019 bias from species composition is only one of the factors that needs to be considered for the successful implementation of fluorescence sensors for cyanohab management consistent protocols for fluorescence sensor operation comprehensive monitoring plans and effective management and use of data post hoc are required comprehensive monitoring plans should employ several monitoring technologies in an attempt to complement the intrinsic limitations of each monitoring method simis et al 2007 for the effective implementation of fluorescence sensors for cyanobacteria and phytoplankton management we propose considering six general guidelines first standardized operational practices e g device maintenance cleaning power supply probe positioning and hazard protection must be strictly followed to ensure continuous and representative supply of raw data from fluorescence sensors mcbride rose 2018 fluorescence sensors are prone to fouling drift and malfunction resulting in measurements that are not representative despite appropriate calibration second several other optically active variables may interfere with fluorescence measurements see bertone et al 2018 for a review and these should be part of a routine monitoring program third monitoring using higher taxa precision methods e g microscopy is still required for identifying key phytoplankton species including cyanobacteria fourth the integration of multiple sources of data is required to the correlate environmental conditions with site specific triggers for cyanobacterial species dominance understanding site specific cyanobacterial dynamics is crucial to identify key factors that may interfere with fluorescence sensor output and in order to design adequate calibration tests sampling campaigns should be optimised in time and space to ground truth fluorescence sensor estimates and species targeted management responses zamyadi et al 2012 zamyadi et al 2013 the development of statistical compensation models for potential sources of bias in cyanobacteria fluorescence and validation using site specific data is the fifth guideline to be considered these compensation models should target outputs that are applicable to water quality guidelines recently updated to biomass or biovolume units chorus welker 2021 finally high frequency calibrated cyanobacteria estimates should have appropriate post hoc use aiming to support proactive cyanohabs management examples of efficient use of data post hoc include the development and validation of short term forecasting e g early warning systems or long term predictive e g scenario analysis some machine learning and numerical models based on fluorescence estimates have recently been developed to forecast cyanohab occurrence elliott 2012 ndong et al 2014 xiao et al 2017 predict dominant species cao et al 2016 fadel et al 2017 and understand the main drivers for cyanobacteria succession shan et al 2019 wei et al 2001 exemplifying the potential of high frequency data in improving these models hamilton et al 2015 rousso et al 2020 species specific calibration of fluorescence sensors must be part of an integrated management plan that considers account site specific characteristics e g dominant taxa interferences and supports informed decision making 5 conclusion controlled experiments were performed to assess differences in fluorescence of phycocyanin f pc and chlorophyll a f chl a among four cyanobacterial species with differing morphologies and cell size throughout their growth phase and in single and mixed species assemblages the findings indicate that i f pc and f chl a varied significantly for each species throughout its growth phase ii species with different morphologies have different f pc and f chl a characteristics and iii cyanobacteria fluorescence in assemblages could be accurately estimated from the fluorescence characteristics of monocultures despite potential for errors these findings highlight that caution should be exercised when interpreting fluorescence sensor readings without adequate species specific calibration strong correlations between sensor fluorescence and conventional phytoplankton quantification methods were only achieved after species specific compensation conversion from raw fluorescence units to biomass or biovolume should be performed to minimize bias due to variability in cell size among species species specific calibration is only one of several factors that should be considered when employing fluorescence sensors in an operational framework associated with water resources management and integration with standardized operational protocols site specific characterization and data analysis tools are required despite
