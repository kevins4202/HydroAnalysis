18310,every member of the ecological community is connected via a network of vital and complex relationships called the web of life to elucidate the ecological network and interactions among producers consumers and decomposers in the daechung reservoir korea during cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms cyanohab especially those involving microcystis we investigated the diversity and compositions of the cyanobacterial 16s rrna gene including the genotypes of microcystis cpcba igs gene non cyanobacterial 16s and eukaryotic 18s communities through high throughput sequencing microcystis blooms were divided into the summer major bloom and autumn minor bloom with different dominant genotypes of microcystis network analysis demonstrated that the modules involved in the different phases of the microcystis blooms were categorized into the pre bloom bloom post bloom and non bloom groups at all sampling stations in addition the non cyanobacterial components of each group were classified while the same group showed similarity across all stations suggesting that microcystis and other microbes were highly interdependent and organized into cyanohab related module units importantly the microcystis genotype based sub network uncovered that pirellula pseudanabaena and vampirovibrionales preferred to interact with specific microcystis genotypes in the summer major bloom than with other genotypes in the autumn minor bloom while the copepod skistodiaptomus exhibited the opposite pattern in conclusion the transition patterns of cyanohab related modules and their key components could be crucial in the succession of microcystis genotypes and to enhance the understanding of microbial ecology in an aquatic environment graphical abstract image 1 keywords cyanohab microcystis genotype non cyanobacterial community eukaryotic community cyanohab related module 1 introduction microbes consist of viruses bacteria archaea and eukaryotes that generate diverse ecological relationships in complex ecosystems coyte et al 2015 through these interactions the microbes can overcome their weaknesses and revitalize their strengths faust and raes 2012 in a freshwater ecosystem a harmful algal bloom is one of the most important environmental issues heisler et al 2008 in particular the cyanobacteria microcystis dolichospermum formerly anabaena and pseudanabaena form cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms cyanohab that cause serious problems for both the environment and human health by disrupting food web dynamics creating hypoxic zones and producing toxins paerl and otten 2013 m aeruginosa is one of the most common freshwater cyanohab species worldwide including in south korea srivastava et al 2015 since our study area daechung reservoir exclusively suffers from a microcystis bloom almost every year including in 2017 cyanohab in this study refers only to the microcystis bloom the species that cause cyanohab do not live alone in aquatic ecosystems but consistently interact with various microorganisms in a variety of ways ranging from predator prey to mutualistic interactions cyanobacteria can provide a favorable environment for microbes by producing oxygen and cyanobacteria derived substances such as extracellular polysaccharides eps rossi and de philippis 2015 heterotrophic bacteria can produce bacterial cell derived substances such as nutrients and microelements for cyanobacteria by decomposing organic polymers into small molecules that can be readily used by cyanobacteria li et al 2011 wang et al 2016 grazing effects on cyanobacteria by eukaryotic protists such as ciliates copepods and rotifers also represent major interrelationships during bloom periods dryden and wright 1987 liu et al 2012 recently many studies have revealed a close association between heterotrophic bacteria and cyanobacteria liu et al 2019b louati et al 2015 niu et al 2011 woodhouse et al 2018 niu et al 2011 reported that the bacterial community compositions shifted with fixed patterns during phytoplankton bloom periods showing that the succession of phytoplankton communities significantly influences the bacterial communities the interactions between cyanobacteria and bacteria could be based on the degradation of dissolved organic matter and the recycling of nutrients louati et al 2015 in the case of eukaryotes the co occurrence patterns among the eukaryotic community are not consistent but vary significantly during the phytoplankton bloom period liu et al 2019a in addition the cooperation of rare planktonic eukaryotes contributes to the stability and resilience of the microbial community during cyanohab xue et al 2018 these interactions play a crucial role in the algal proliferation and degradation processes in an aquatic ecosystem moreover many researchers have focused on the diversity and composition of microcystis genotypes and found that the temporal variation in them was significantly correlated with nutrient concentrations guan et al 2018 furthermore the shift of microcystis genotypes resulted in different microcystin production wang et al 2013 therefore revealing the microbial interactions between producers mainly cyanobacteria consumers mainly eukaryotes and decomposers mainly heterotrophic bacteria is important for understanding the hidden underlying mechanisms of cyanohab because ecosystems are more complex and diverse than our expectations the results obtained from the co culture experiments are not able to precisely reflect the real interactions between bloom forming species and the surrounding microbes in a complex ecosystem with an increasing amount of information such as microbial community data generated by next generation sequencing and advanced computational techniques biological association networks are becoming a fundamental tool for the investigation of high throughput data in biology faust and raes 2012 the power and usefulness of biological association networks originate from their ability to extract new information from ecological interactions organizations keystone organisms i e connectors and hubs and their responses to environmental variables that can not be revealed by conventional techniques among the various network analysis techniques extended local similarity analysis elsa is one of the most powerful methods for uncovering statistically significant local and even potentially time delayed association patterns in time series data beyond conventional correlation analyses xia et al 2011 elsa has been used to investigate a broad range of microbial interactions in various environments including soil thomas and cébron 2016 marine chow et al 2014 and freshwater yang et al 2018 for instance yang et al 2018 revealed that the influence of interspecific associations was greater on the phytoplankton community and ecological network than the extrinsic effects of environmental factors to understand the complex interactions between producers consumers and decomposers during cyanohab samples were collected weekly from the daechung reservoir korea and the diversity and composition of the cyanobacterial including genotypes of microcystis non cyanobacterial and eukaryotic communities were investigated using high throughput sequencing to our knowledge this is the first study to combine these three major components and interpret microbial modular structures during cyanohab the daechung reservoir is a large branch type reservoir gross storage capacity of 1490 mm3 where serious cyanobacterial blooms have been observed every year since the end of the 1980s ahn et al 2002 oh et al 2007 srivastava et al 2015 it is the most important water resource in daejeon city and the chungcheong province and supplies water to over 4 million people for drinking agricultural and industrial use in this study data were combined including biophysicochemical characteristics and microbial community compositions and merged into an association network for each sampling site then the transition patterns of major modules were categorized into group units to understand the complex interactions between producers consumers and decomposers during cyanohab here the following questions are addressed how do non cyanobacteria bacterial community composition nc bcc and eukaryotic community composition ecc vary seasonally with different microcystis genotypes and microcystin congeners at different nutrient concentrations are there any recurrent modules with a pattern associated with cyanohab cyanohab related modules and finally which groups are key factors in these cyanohab related modules 2 methods 2 1 sample collection and water quality analysis freshwater samples were collected on a weekly basis from 19 june 2017 to 10 october 2017 at the water surface from three sites chuso hoenam and janggye in the daechung reservoir korea fig s1 resulting in 16 total time points and 48 total samples water temperature ph dissolved oxygen do and conductivity were measured at the sampling sites using a multi parameter water quality probe 6600eds ysi usa tables s1 s2 and s3 turbidity was measured using an instrument

eclipse ti s nikon corp tokyo japan the microscopic images were acquired with a digital camera ds ri2 nikon corp tokyo japan 2 2 microbial community composition including bacteria eukaryotes and genotypes of microcystis for the microbial community analysis 2 l water samples were collected and stored in a cooler until filtration filtration and dna extraction were processed according to the method described in our previous report chun et al 2019 the bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified using a universal bacterial primer set 341f 805r 341f cctacgggnggcwgcag 805r gactachvgggtatctaatcc which targets the v3 v4 region of the 16s rrna gene herlemann et al 2011 the eukaryotic 18s rrna gene was amplified using a universal eukaryotic primer set v8f 1510r v8f ataacaggtctgtgatgccct 1510r ccttcygcaggttcacctac which targets the v8 v9 region of the 18s rrna gene bradley et al 2016 to investigate the genotypes of microcystis the gene sequences of the intergenic spacer igs between cpcb and cpca cpcba igs the phycocyanin locus of the photosynthetic apparatus in cyanobacteria were selected with a primer set cpc57f cpc356r cpc57f aacctatgtagctttaggagtacc cpc356r cttaagaaacgaccttgagaatc kim et al 2010 this primer set was designed to identify both toxic and non toxic microcystis genotypes but not other cyanobacteria and has been used for microcystis genotype analysis guan et al 2018 wang et al 2013 pcr amplification purification and quantification were performed according to the method described in our previous report chun et al 2019 miseq version 3 chemistry illumina was used for paired end reads sequencing reactions and sequenced using a miseq 2 300 bp reads from the macrogen corporation seoul south korea the resulting raw sequences of 16s and 18s rrna genes were processed using mothur version 1 39 1 schloss et al 2009 according to the miseq standard operating procedure accessed date 5 june 2018 http www mothur org wiki miseq sop with some modifications kozich et al 2013 briefly low quality sequences were removed from the analysis when they contained ambiguous characters contained more than two mismatches to the forward primer or one mismatch to the barcode or were less than 300 bp or more than 500 bp in length the latest silva database release 132 was used to align and classify the sequences quast et al 2013 furthermore the taxass 16s rrna database and pipeline were used for nc bcc classification rohwer et al 2018 accessed 12 october 2019 after classifying the sequences chloroplast and mitochondria sequences were removed from the dataset eukaryotic organisms have intragenomic variability generally 1 variation that can potentially overestimate diversity from 18s rrna gene surveys gong et al 2013 therefore to avoid this problem a similarity cutoff of 98 was used to assign the same operational taxonomic unit otu for eukaryotes behnke et al 2011 and a 99 cutoff for bacteria edgar 2018 in addition otus that comprised only singletons doubletons and tripletons were not subjected to further analyses furthermore the 16s rrna gene sequence data sets were split into two partitions the cyanobacteria and non cyanobacterial groups based on the silva database s phylum classification of the 16s rrna gene to investigate sequence variants at a single nucleotide in the cpcba igs gene amplicon sequence variants asvs of the cpcba igs gene were calculated through dada2 version 1 8 according to the pipeline tutorial 1 8 accessed date 14 october 2018 https benjjneb github io dada2 tutorial 1 8 html in r callahan et al 2016 each asv of the cpcba igs gene was defined as each different microcystis genotype in this study the phylogenic tree of cpcba igs was constructed using a neighbor joining saitou and nei 1987 algorithm in mega 6 tamura et al 2013 and the bootstrap values were calculated from 1000 replications reference sequences were collected by blasting against the available cpcba igs gene sequences from the national center for biotechnology information ncbi public database the sum of the relative abundance of the cpcba igs gene was normalized to the relative abundance of the microcystis otu for further analysis the raw sequences and accompanying metadata are available in the sequence read archive sra of the ncbi under the project accession number prjna509704 2 3 microbial association network and topological features to investigate the relationships among cyanobacteria genotypes of microcystis non cyanobacterial groups eukaryotes and environmental variables three microbial association networks were constructed for the three sampling sites using elsa xia et al 2011 only otus that met the following thresholds for each given data set were considered 1 detected in 30 of samples and 2 a relative proportion of 0 1 for at least one day p values were estimated using a mixed approach the q value false discovery rate was calculated to estimate the likelihood of false positives both p and q values were calculated using the elsa command lsa compute only positive correlations that had both a p and q value 0 001 were selected for further analyses the network was visualized using the open source software cytoscape 3 5 1 shannon et al 2003 network topological features were calculated using the networkanalyzer plugin in cytoscape and r software package igraph assenov et al 2007 csardi and nepusz 2006 random undirected networks of equal size in terms of the number of nodes and edges were calculated using the erdős rényi model using the network randomizer plugin in cytoscape the small world coefficient sw is defined as sw clustering coefficient c cr characteristic path length l lr r represents parameters from a random network table 1 to build a sub network the three networks were combined into one network the microbial recurrent association network mran according to the method described by chun et al 2019 and the sub network was extracted from mran 2 4 module calculation transition patterns of modules and groups the modules were identified using the louvain algorithm in r software package igraph csardi and nepusz 2006 blondel et al 2008 to calculate the transition patterns of the major modules the relative abundance of otus except environmental parameters microcystis otus and genotypes in each module were normalized using feature scaling after normalization normalized otus in each module were averaged together to calculate the transition patterns of each module chun et al 2019 then a dendrogram was constructed based on the transition patterns of the major modules using ward s method as implemented in the function hclust of the r package version 3 4 0 r core team 2017 to separate the major modules into several categories we defined these categories as group finally we compared each group with the relative abundance of microcystis otu in the total bacterial community to identify the bloom group post bloom group pre bloom group and non bloom group 2 5 different topological roles of individual nodes and statistical analysis to identify the topological roles of each node in the microbial network we calculated within module degree z i and among module connectivity p i guimera and amaral 2005 according to the threshold values of z i and p i described in olesen et al 2007 the nodes were divided into peripherals module hubs connectors and network hubs all statistical analyses were performed using the r package version 3 4 0 r core team 2017 we used non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis with bray curtis distances to ordinate the samples based on their dissimilarity in nc bcc and ecc using the metamds function in vegan oksanen et al 2013 differences in taxonomic composition among the different bloom periods were tested using permanova with 999 permutations using the vegan function adonis the assemblage environment major cyanobacterial otus relationships were examined by fitting vectors onto the ordination space using the vegan function envfit the significance of the fitted vectors was assessed using a permutation procedure permutation 999 3 results 3 1 biophysicochemical characteristics biophysicochemical characteristics data for each sampling site are shown in tables s1 s2 and s3 the water temperature increased up to 32 9 33 7 c on 7 august and decreased to below 25 c on 10 october during the sampling periods the concentration of chl a reached its maximum value of 54 6 74 6 μg l when the microcystis bloom occurred fig 1 a both do and ph increased during the bloom period among the nutrients concentrations of tn ranged from 0 42 to 2 19 mg l fig 6a while those of tdn and no3 n ranged from 0 34 to 2 13 and 0 22 1 71 mg l respectively the tp ranged from 0 009 to 0 107 mg l fig 6b concentrations of geosmin significantly increased up to 534 ng l at the hoenam station during july 10 24 furthermore the concentration of mc was approximately three times higher in the bloom period than in the post bloom period fig 6c the maximum concentrations of the mc rr and lr were 0 34 and 0 24 μg l respectively while that of mc yr was 0 12 μg l 3 2 cyanobacterial non cyanobacterial and eukaryotic community composition a total of 3213 otus were clustered at 99 similarity for bacteria 3017 otus were assigned to non cyanobacterial groups and 196 otus to cyanobacteria the proportions of cyanobacteria varied over the sampling stations and period ranging from 2 7 to 56 1 in the total bacterial community fig 1a since the top seven most abundant cyanobacterial otus occupied approximately 85 of the total cyanobacterial community we defined these cyanobacterial otus as major cyanobacteria in this study microcystis otu0002 cyanobium otu0003 and 0004 pseudanabaena otu0005 and otu0014 dolichospermum formerly anabaena otu0008 and aerosakkonema otu0013 the relative abundance of microcystis otu0002 significantly correlated with the cell number of microcystis spearman correlation ρ 0 882 p 0 0001 n 48 tables s4 s5 and s6 from an otu perspective a total of 12 otus were assigned to microcystis and otu0002 dominated 99 9 of the microcystis relative abundance to identify the diversity of the microcystis genotype genotype analysis was performed for microcystis using dada2 with the genotypes of the cpcba igs gene a total of 118 genotypes of microcystis were observed and their transition patterns were clear during the sampling period microscopic images also showed the coexistence of several microcystis morphotypes during the sampling period fig s6a different microcystis genotypes dominated during different periods cpc asv001 003 and 004 dominated from the middle of june to late august defined as summer major bloom while cpc asv002 dominated in september defined as autumn minor bloom fig 1b since cell concentrations of microcystis during the summer major bloom were much higher than during the autumn minor bloom the summer major bloom was defined as the microcystis bloom period the period prior to this as the pre bloom period and that after this as the post bloom period therefore the autumn minor bloom was observed in the post bloom period the average cell concentration of microcystis was approximately 110 000 cells ml 1 during the bloom period but 1000 and 7000 cells ml 1 in the pre bloom and post bloom period respectively tables s4 s5 and s6 the relative abundance of dolichospermum otu0008 and concentration of geosmin were significantly increased together at the hoenam station from 10 to 24 july fig 1a and table s2 pseudanabaena appeared simultaneously with microcystis r 0 81 p 0 001 fig s6b microscopic images obtained from the daechung reservoir also confirmed the epiphytic characteristic of these two cyanobacterial species figs s6b and d furthermore pseudanabaena otu was more closely correlated with cpc asv006 in all three stations recurrence 3 3 in case of cyanobium sp two otus continuously dominated the cyanobacterial population during the sampling period at the chuso and janggye stations the nc bcc changed dramatically during the outbreak and decline of the microcystis bloom at the class level alphaproteobacteria bacteroidetes and actinobacteria dominated in the non cyanobacteriabacterial communities during the sampling period fig 1c during the microcystis bloom period the relative abundances of acetobacterales caulobacterales chloroflexales cytophagales methylacidiphilales opb56 pirellulales and solibacterales in nc bcc were significantly higher compared to the non bloom period p 0 005 while the abundance of the ld12 tribe alfv a decreased to 0 04 3 2 from 42 7 51 6 of the nc bcc in the same period fig s2 a total of 2126 eukaryotic otus were clustered at 98 similarity for eukaryotes similar to nc bcc the ecc also varied considerably in the microcystis bloom period the eccs mainly comprised phytoplankton copepods ciliates and rotifers fig 1d cryptomonadales especially cryptomonas and teleaulax continuously dominated the eukaryotic phytoplankton communities 12 7 6 2 throughout the sampling period while chlamydomonadales especially volvox increased temporarily at the chuso and janggye stations however cyanobacteria continuously dominated phytoplankton communities 80 0 25 5 tables s4 s5 and s6 therefore cyanohab especially those formed by microcystis was focused on in this study the abundance of calanoida a major copepod 21 6 20 1 increased during the bloom periods fig s3 ciliophora known as a ciliate was dominated by the spirotrichea especially halteria rimostrombidium and strombidium and the conthreep group colpodea oligohymenophorea nassophorea prostomatea plagiopylea and phyllopharyngea given the large variation in the relative abundance of the nc bcc and ecc across samples we analyzed multidimensional scaling to seek environmental tables s1 s2 and s3 and biological variables that acted as potential drivers in reshaping the nc bcc and ecc after fitting the environmental and biological variables onto the nmds ordination we found that ph cpc asv001 cod microcystis otu0002 and cpc asv006 were significantly related to the two nmds axes of the nc bcc ordination r 2 0 5 p 0 001 while temperature cod and cpc asv001 were significantly related to the two nmds axes of the ecc ordination r 2 0 5 p 0 001 fig s4 and table s7 the nc bcc and ecc were segregated into the pre bloom bloom and post bloom periods permanova nc bcc pseudo f 5 28 df 3 p 0 001 ecc pseudo f 2 15 df 3 p 0 001 3 3 topological features of the networks and modular structure to construct an association network 335 bacterial otus 229 eukaryotic otus ten microcystis genotypes and 19 environmental variables were selected three different networks were constructed from different sampling stations using elsa fig 2 the topological features of the networks are summarized in table 1 briefly each node has an average of 3 43 9 68 links according to the different stations modularity was higher compared to their random network the average clustering coefficient c higher values of which indicate communities are well connected among each other and characteristic path length l the average shortest path between all pairs of species in the three networks were higher than those of their erdős rényi random networks accordingly the sw values the higher values of which indicate more small worldliness of the network were greater than 1 suggesting that these networks have small world properties each association network from the three sampling stations was composed of six to nine major modules which occupied 77 85 of the total nodes in each association network tables 1 and s8 3 4 transition patterns of modules and group characteristics the dendrogram separated the transition patterns of the major modules cyanohab related modules into four groups that were related to the rise and fall of the microcystis bloom fig 3 a the transition patterns of modules i and v at the chuso station c i and c v module i at the hoenam station h i and modules i and iv at the janggye station j i and j iv showed similar patterns of the relative abundance of the microcystis otu we defined these modules as bloom group fig 3e in contrast the patterns of module iii at the chuso station c iii module ii at the hoenam station h ii and module ix at the janggye station j ix were opposite to the patterns of the bloom group fig 3c these modules were defined as the non bloom group the normalized proportions of several modules increased in the post bloom period defined as post bloom group fig 3d while other modules increased in the pre bloom period defined as pre bloom group fig 3b the components of the nc bcc varied largely in the different groups but showed a certain consensus among the different stations fig 4 b d except for the pre bloom group fig 4a for example the alfviii lineage acetobacterales pnecb lineage betaproteobacteriales cytophagales and methylacidiphilales were identified as specific members in the bloom group fig 4d in the case of the ecc ciliate conthreep mainly oligohymenophorea were the dominant ciliate in the bloom group while chlamydomonadales was a major group at the janggye station fig 4h in the non bloom group the ld12 tribe alfv a and spirotrichea were the dominant groups in the nc bcc and ecc respectively fig 4b and f in addition several otus assigned to the aci a and aci b lineage frankiales were observed in the non bloom group furthermore the aci c lineage frankiales opitutales and phycisphaerales were specific components of the nc bcc in the post bloom group fig 4c the baci and baciv lineage chitinophagales were found in both the pre bloom group and non bloom group the aci a lineage was also a dominant group in the pre bloom group at hoenam and janggye stations while the opb56 chthoniobacterales and betiv lineage betaproteobacteriales were specific components at the chuso hoenam and janggye stations respectively fig 4a 3 5 topological roles and interconnections of microbes for the major cyanobacteria and microcystis genotypes to evaluate the potential importance of individual nodes during the microcystis bloom period z i and p i were calculated almost all nodes 97 were assigned to peripheral nodes but only 1 of the nodes were module hubs and connectors respectively fig s5 large proportions of connectors 40 and module hubs 20 were directly linked to microcystis otu or genotypes to explore the detailed relationships between the major cyanobacteria and other microbes the major cyanobacterial otus and their directly linked path length 1 microbes were selected to form a sub network fig 5 a major cyanobacteria were also tightly coupled with one another such as microcystis and pseudanabaena in all three stations recurrence 3 3 in addition several microbes e g microscillaceae burkholderiaceae sm2d12 rickettsiales etc were directly linked to more than one major cyanobacteria among them four otus were assigned to connectors labrys aci c2 lineage vorticella and unidentified burkholderiaceae the microscillaceae otu was assigned to a module hub however the 16s rrna gene sequence similarities of the microscillaceae otus were lower than 92 with the type species of the microscillaceae notably six otus which were assigned to the microscillaceae vampirovibrionales burkholderiaceae and ns9 marine group were directly linked to microcystis more than twice in three different networks recurrence 2 3 the sub network showed that mc lr and rr were connected to the microcystis otu fig 5a furthermore to investigate the microbial interactions between the genotypes of microcystis and other microbes another sub network with microbes that were directly connected to the major microcystis genotypes was constructed fig 5b the sub network showed highly dynamic interconnections table s9 among them eight otus were assigned to the connectors and three otus were assigned to module hubs cpc asv001 cpc asv003 cpc asv004 and cpc asv006 major genotypes in the summer major bloom were tightly connected with each other recurrence 2 3 and clustered into the summer major bloom cluster with several microbes while cpc asv002 and cpc asv009 major genotypes in the autumn minor bloom cluster were coupled solidly and constructed a relatively small network compared to the summer major bloom cluster microscillaceae roseomonas alfviii and burkholderiaceae appeared repeatedly in the summer major bloom cluster in detail pirellula and blastopirellula were closely correlated with the microcystis otu and the specific genotypes of microcystis copepod skistodiaptomus was directly correlated to cpc asv002 lacibacter and the cl500 29 marine group were connected with cpc asv001 in a delay correlation recurrence 2 3 1 week lag unclassified vampirovibrionales otu0066 was correlated to the microcystis otu repeatedly recurrence 2 3 and several dominant microcystis genotypes in the summer major bloom fig 5 the sub network showed that mc lr rr and yr were involved in the summer major bloom cluster rather than the autumn minor bloom cluster fig 5b 3 6 interconnections between the nutrients microcystins and microbes to explore the microbial responses against the different nutrients and mc concentrations a sub network was extracted that consisted of direct links path length 1 between microbes and these parameters fig 6d no direct links were observed within nutrient concentrations and microcystis genotypes fig 6d however tp was connected to several bacterial otus including connector bacteria which were linked with microcystis genotypes among these bacteria the bacii a lineage flavobacterium connected both the tdp and microcystis genotype nitrogen compounds formed an independent network with the baci lineage chitinophagales aci a and aci b lineage otus mcs correlated with a wide variety of microbes including the alphai cluster rhizobiales burkholderiaceae flavo a1 flavobacteriales oligoflexaceae and silanimonas xanthomonadaceae fig 6d most of the microbes correlated with mcs were also correlated with microcystis genotypes in addition bradymonadales and opb56 showed delayed correlations with mcs 4 discussion 4 1 cyanobacterial community dynamics and biophysicochemical characteristics microcystis blooms occur annually in the daechung reservoir srivastava et al 2015 ahn et al 2011 oh et al 2001 many studies have revealed that multiple ecotypes of microcystis coexist in environments by focusing on the intra specific levels and their diverse physiological characteristics guan et al 2018 wang et al 2013 wilson et al 2005 yoshida et al 2008 this study is the first to perform a genotype analysis of the microcystis genotypes based on the cpcba igs genes using next generation sequencing our results show that only one microcystis otu 16s rrna gene based community data was predominant at the sampling sites but there were several different microcystis genotypes that dominated at different times figs s6a and c furthermore two major genotypes of microcystis were identical 100 similarity to clones analyzed in our previous study that were obtained from the same study sites fig s7 kim et al 2006 indicating that the dominant genotypes did not change in the daechung reservoir water temperature is an important environmental factor for the alternating succession of microcystis species imai et al 2008 the summer major bloom and autumn minor bloom appeared from july to august 29 7 1 8 c and in september 26 5 0 7 c respectively bozarth et al 2010 also observed two types of bloom peaks in mid july and early september which accompanied the microcystis population turnover in the copco reservoir in the usa therefore the optimum temperatures for different microcystis genotypes could be different and seem to cause a shift in the major genotypes in addition the co occurrence patterns of minor genotypes also differed across the bloom period suggesting that the physiological characteristics of these genotypes were different depending on the bloom stages strains of microcystis can be divided into two categories toxic and non toxic microcystis based on their ability to produce cyclic heptapeptide hepatotoxins called microcystins mcs three variants of mc lr rr and yr are the most abundant in microcystis fastner et al 1999 the results of this study suggest that the major genotypes of the summer major bloom could be assigned to toxic microcystis especially cpc asv004 006 008 009 while the major genotypes of the autumn minor bloom especially cpc asv002 could be non toxic microcystis genotype cpc asv006 correlated more strongly to mc lr than to mc rr or mc yr implying that each microcystis genotype has a different production potential for specific mc congeners figs 5b and 6d as the summer major bloom occurred high levels of mcs were maintained fig 6c which would naturally lead to an increase in mc degrading microorganisms some of the species from burkholderiaceae rhizobiales and xanthomonadaceae have been reported as mc degrading bacteria rapala et al 2005 yang et al 2014 zhu et al 2016 in addition silanimonas has been isolated in toxic microcystis cultures chun et al 2017 however most of the bacteria that correlated with mc defy isolation from the environment therefore the results from this study may be used as a hint for discovering mc degrading microorganisms and finding novel mc degradation mechanisms furthermore ozonation chlorination and oxidation based water treatment processes have been described to remove mc hitzfeld et al 2000 most technologies face challenges for scaling up including high costs and optimum efficiencies hitzfeld et al 2000 since the results of this study showed that mcs were mainly linked with the summer major bloom the mc removal technology should primarily be more focused here microcystis colonies could provide favorable microenvironments for other cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria brunberg 1999 pseudanabaena mucicola could be epiphytic on microcystis colonies and co occurred during the bloom periods agha et al 2016 vasconcelos et al 2011 agha et al 2016 revealed that interactions between pseudanabaena and microcystis are dynamic neutral to antagonistic and depend on different microcystis strains the results of this study also suggested that the relationship between pseudanabaena and microcystis could be genotype specific the order vampirovibrionales consists of non photosynthetic cyanobacteria class melainabacteria which are known as predatory bacteria soo et al 2015 vampirovibrio chlorellavorus adheres to the surface of green alga chlorella vulgaris by specific attachment structures and destroys its prey parasites are dependent on their hosts but negative correlations are not found often at daily to weekly timescales due to relatively low mortality berdjeb et al 2018 the recurrent correlation recurrence 2 3 between vampirovibrionales otu and microcystis suggests that the unclassified strain of vampirovibrionales could be one of the important predatory bacteria of microcystis 4 2 microbial interactions within the cyanohab related modules and group the effect of protists zooplankton predatory bacteria and viruses are a major factor that contributes to mortality and the succession of microcystis harke et al 2016 a large amount of microcystis biomass could be lysed by predator prey interactions or cellular senescence during the bloom phase cytophagales is already known as an obligate parasite of freshwater cyanobacteria daft and stewart 1971 and the unclassified vampirovibrionales otu0066 was suggested as the predatory bacteria of microcystis in this study previous studies have shown that ciliate especially oligohymenophorea had a strong ability to graze the cells of microcystis dryden and wright 1987 liu et al 2012 these groups were found in the bloom group and were presumed to mediate predator prey interactions wu and hahn 2006 suggested that the biomass of phytoplankton could influence the succession of the pnecb lineage the relative abundance of pnecb bacteria did not correlate with microcystis in this study even though pnecb bacteria was one of the dominant groups in the bloom group this result suggests that the pnecb lineage could interact with microcystis related microbes but not with microcystis directly the non bloom group showed an opposite pattern compared to the bloom group fig 3 the major components of the non bloom group were similar across the stations and the ld12 tribe alfv a the freshwater sibling of the marine sar11 clade was the most dominant group fig 4b however little is known regarding the ecophysiological properties of the ld12 tribe the genomic characteristics of freshwater ld12 revealed that it has an aerobic chemoorganoheterotrophic lifestyle thriving in oligotrophic media with simple carbon compounds and it likely depends on reduced organosulfur compounds and ammonium as its sulfur and nitrogen sources respectively henson et al 2018 a higher microcystis cell density could accompany a higher concentration of organic matters high toc and cod released by microcystis itself or by bacteria that degrade microcystis derived photosynthates resulting in a more eutrophic condition therefore it was inadequate for the ld12 tribe to dominate during the bloom period the post bloom group consisted of at least two modules at each station fig 3d as major components of the post bloom group fig 4c the bacii a lineage flavobacteriales is known as an organic scavenger and degrader of polymers such as cellulose and chitin kirchman 2002 and high proportions of flavobacteria appear during or after a period of high productivity in eutrophic lakes eiler and bertilsson 2007 newton et al 2011 consistent with our results berry et al 2017 also reported that the aci a and aci b lineages decreased during microcystis dominant cyanohab in lake erie while aci c increased phylogenetically aci a and aci b lineages were closer to each other compared with the aci c lineage ghylin et al 2014 in addition aci c isolates shared 70 74 of the genomic sequence with several aci a isolates kang et al 2017 they reported that the aci c lineage had different genomic characteristics such as carbon metabolism and nucleotide biosynthesis compared with the aci a lineage it was assumed that these genomic features of the aci lineage could be the underlying reason for the niche partitioning of this group during the bloom period unlike other groups the pre bloom group showed a significant difference in the components between the stations fig 4a the origins of the water at the chuso and janggye stations main stream are different and the hoenam station is affected by merged water flow from the chuso and janggye areas fig s1 which could be one of the reasons for the microbial differences in the pre bloom group in addition the pre bloom group was also coupled with different cyanobacteria for instance the h v module showed a similar trend with the proliferation of dolichospermum in july prior to the microcystis bloom figs 1a and 3b chthoniobacterales dominated the h v module suggesting that a specific group of chthoniobacterales could interact with dolichospermum fig 4a these results suggest that the pre bloom group is mainly affected by site specific environments and the proliferation of other cyanobacteria seasonal succession of distinct sets of microbes i e microbial modules had important roles in the proliferation maintenance and degradation of microcystis in this study a modular organization of species interactions would benefit the dynamic stability of the communities grilli et al 2016 therefore they could be presumed to perform ecological functions by working together as a microbial module unit which could not be done alone 4 3 detailed interactions between cyanobacteria and microbes pirellula is a free living bacterium but is also attached to filamentous algae and cyanobacteria by a holdfast clum et al 2009 suggesting that this bacterial group could attach strongly to the surface of microcystis and mediate the coordination of microbial interactions in the phycosphere uncultured microscillaceae otus were also repeatedly correlated to the microcystis otu and genotypes implying a tight interaction therefore further studies should be carried out to isolate these groups and investigate the interaction mechanisms between them and microcystis the sub network of the microcystis genotypes was more complex than the sub network of the major cyanobacteria for instance although the vampirovibrionales pirellula blastopirellula and roseomonas otus were connected to the microcystis otu these otus were connected only to the genotypes of microcystis in the summer major bloom rather than in the autumn minor bloom fig 5b in contrast the copepod skistodiaptomus e otu0001 was connected to the autumn minor bloom cluster rather than the summer major bloom cluster indicating that grazing by copepod skistodiaptomus could be one of the reasons for the short and small proliferation of microcystis during the post bloom period the differentiation between the summer major bloom and autumn minor bloom could be explained by the different microbial interconnections within the microbial network therefore the microcystis genotype sub network could provide a new perspective for a more detailed and precise understanding of the microbial interactions during the microcystis bloom module hubs are responsible for the interactions within the module while connectors are responsible for the interactions between modules previous works have indicated that the damage to module hubs and connectors might cause a collapse of the module and even a disintegration of the global network structure guimera and amaral 2005 olesen et al 2007 around 100 microbes were assigned to the bloom group but only around 40 microbes connected to microcystis at each station approximately 10 of the otus which were directly linked with the microcystis genotypes or otu were assigned to connectors or module hubs fig 5 it suggests that microcystis could cooperate with the microbes included in the bloom group primarily through an indirect connection between the connector module hub microbes and other microbes for instance the connector bacterium labrys was linked to two major microcystis genotypes in the bloom group the genus labrys has been isolated from different environments such as freshwater rhizosphere root nodules and sediment nguyen et al 2015 recently passari et al 2016 isolated labrys sp from the endophytic bacterial community of a plant endophytic bacteria colonize within a plant usually exchanging nutrition with the host and also protecting the host against pathogens by producing a variety of lytic enzymes it suggests that this connector bacterium could have a similar role as endophytic bacteria in the mucilage of microcystis during the bloom periods importantly some otus repeatedly linked to microcystis in this study showed 99 similarity with those found in other aquatic ecosystems where microcystis causes algal blooms table s10 the occurrence of the same bacteria not only in the daechung reservoir but also in other countries suggests that the microcystis bloom requires common bacteria firmly connected in an identical module unit therefore it was concluded that cyanohab associated nc bcc are considerably conserved across the world and they could be fundamental biological elements for the rise and fall of the microcystis bloom 5 conclusion to our knowledge this is the first study on microbial modular structures that includes the genotypes of microcystis non cyanobacterial groups and eukaryotes using elsa based network analysis next generation sequencing and genotype analysis revealed that microcystis a major primary producer consisted of diverse genotypes during different phases of the bloom and they interacted with various microbes microcystis blooms were divided into summer major bloom and autumn minor bloom with different toxin concentration and different dominant genotypes of microcystis the differentiation between the summer major bloom and autumn minor bloom could be explained by the temperature and the different microbial interconnections within the microbial network moreover reliable and repeated cyanohab related modules were identified by investigating the interrelationship within the microbial food web in a eutrophic reservoir during the microcystis bloom cyanohab related modules were categorized into the pre bloom bloom post bloom and non bloom groups mainly consisting of non cyanobacterial groups these microbes had key roles in the formation maintenance and decline of the microcystis bloom in particular the alfviii acetobacterales pnecb betaproteobacteriales bacii a flavobacteriales and aci c frankiales lineages might be involved in mutualistic interactions while vampirovibrionales cytophagales and oligohymenophorea might be involved in interactions such as parasitism or predation overall the succession of the microcystis genotypes was found to be regulated by both bottom up and top down controls in terms of cyanohab related modules therefore the diversity of the microcystis genotype and cyanohab related modules provides the fundamental basis for understanding the biological mechanisms behind the cyanohab declaration of competing interest the

18310,every member of the ecological community is connected via a network of vital and complex relationships called the web of life to elucidate the ecological network and interactions among producers consumers and decomposers in the daechung reservoir korea during cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms cyanohab especially those involving microcystis we investigated the diversity and compositions of the cyanobacterial 16s rrna gene including the genotypes of microcystis cpcba igs gene non cyanobacterial 16s and eukaryotic 18s communities through high throughput sequencing microcystis blooms were divided into the summer major bloom and autumn minor bloom with different dominant genotypes of microcystis network analysis demonstrated that the modules involved in the different phases of the microcystis blooms were categorized into the pre bloom bloom post bloom and non bloom groups at all sampling stations in addition the non cyanobacterial components of each group were classified while the same group showed similarity across all stations suggesting that microcystis and other microbes were highly interdependent and organized into cyanohab related module units importantly the microcystis genotype based sub network uncovered that pirellula pseudanabaena and vampirovibrionales preferred to interact with specific microcystis genotypes in the summer major bloom than with other genotypes in the autumn minor bloom while the copepod skistodiaptomus exhibited the opposite pattern in conclusion the transition patterns of cyanohab related modules and their key components could be crucial in the succession of microcystis genotypes and to enhance the understanding of microbial ecology in an aquatic environment graphical abstract image 1 keywords cyanohab microcystis genotype non cyanobacterial community eukaryotic community cyanohab related module 1 introduction microbes consist of viruses bacteria archaea and eukaryotes that generate diverse ecological relationships in complex ecosystems coyte et al 2015 through these interactions the microbes can overcome their weaknesses and revitalize their strengths faust and raes 2012 in a freshwater ecosystem a harmful algal bloom is one of the most important environmental issues heisler et al 2008 in particular the cyanobacteria microcystis dolichospermum formerly anabaena and pseudanabaena form cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms cyanohab that cause serious problems for both the environment and human health by disrupting food web dynamics creating hypoxic zones and producing toxins paerl and otten 2013 m aeruginosa is one of the most common freshwater cyanohab species worldwide including in south korea srivastava et al 2015 since our study area daechung reservoir exclusively suffers from a microcystis bloom almost every year including in 2017 cyanohab in this study refers only to the microcystis bloom the species that cause cyanohab do not live alone in aquatic ecosystems but consistently interact with various microorganisms in a variety of ways ranging from predator prey to mutualistic interactions cyanobacteria can provide a favorable environment for microbes by producing oxygen and cyanobacteria derived substances such as extracellular polysaccharides eps rossi and de philippis 2015 heterotrophic bacteria can produce bacterial cell derived substances such as nutrients and microelements for cyanobacteria by decomposing organic polymers into small molecules that can be readily used by cyanobacteria li et al 2011 wang et al 2016 grazing effects on cyanobacteria by eukaryotic protists such as ciliates copepods and rotifers also represent major interrelationships during bloom periods dryden and wright 1987 liu et al 2012 recently many studies have revealed a close association between heterotrophic bacteria and cyanobacteria liu et al 2019b louati et al 2015 niu et al 2011 woodhouse et al 2018 niu et al 2011 reported that the bacterial community compositions shifted with fixed patterns during phytoplankton bloom periods showing that the succession of phytoplankton communities significantly influences the bacterial communities the interactions between cyanobacteria and bacteria could be based on the degradation of dissolved organic matter and the recycling of nutrients louati et al 2015 in the case of eukaryotes the co occurrence patterns among the eukaryotic community are not consistent but vary significantly during the phytoplankton bloom period liu et al 2019a in addition the cooperation of rare planktonic eukaryotes contributes to the stability and resilience of the microbial community during cyanohab xue et al 2018 these interactions play a crucial role in the algal proliferation and degradation processes in an aquatic ecosystem moreover many researchers have focused on the diversity and composition of microcystis genotypes and found that the temporal variation in them was significantly correlated with nutrient concentrations guan et al 2018 furthermore the shift of microcystis genotypes resulted in different microcystin production wang et al 2013 therefore revealing the microbial interactions between producers mainly cyanobacteria consumers mainly eukaryotes and decomposers mainly heterotrophic bacteria is important for understanding the hidden underlying mechanisms of cyanohab because ecosystems are more complex and diverse than our expectations the results obtained from the co culture experiments are not able to precisely reflect the real interactions between bloom forming species and the surrounding microbes in a complex ecosystem with an increasing amount of information such as microbial community data generated by next generation sequencing and advanced computational techniques biological association networks are becoming a fundamental tool for the investigation of high throughput data in biology faust and raes 2012 the power and usefulness of biological association networks originate from their ability to extract new information from ecological interactions organizations keystone organisms i e connectors and hubs and their responses to environmental variables that can not be revealed by conventional techniques among the various network analysis techniques extended local similarity analysis elsa is one of the most powerful methods for uncovering statistically significant local and even potentially time delayed association patterns in time series data beyond conventional correlation analyses xia et al 2011 elsa has been used to investigate a broad range of microbial interactions in various environments including soil thomas and cébron 2016 marine chow et al 2014 and freshwater yang et al 2018 for instance yang et al 2018 revealed that the influence of interspecific associations was greater on the phytoplankton community and ecological network than the extrinsic effects of environmental factors to understand the complex interactions between producers consumers and decomposers during cyanohab samples were collected weekly from the daechung reservoir korea and the diversity and composition of the cyanobacterial including genotypes of microcystis non cyanobacterial and eukaryotic communities were investigated using high throughput sequencing to our knowledge this is the first study to combine these three major components and interpret microbial modular structures during cyanohab the daechung reservoir is a large branch type reservoir gross storage capacity of 1490 mm3 where serious cyanobacterial blooms have been observed every year since the end of the 1980s ahn et al 2002 oh et al 2007 srivastava et al 2015 it is the most important water resource in daejeon city and the chungcheong province and supplies water to over 4 million people for drinking agricultural and industrial use in this study data were combined including biophysicochemical characteristics and microbial community compositions and merged into an association network for each sampling site then the transition patterns of major modules were categorized into group units to understand the complex interactions between producers consumers and decomposers during cyanohab here the following questions are addressed how do non cyanobacteria bacterial community composition nc bcc and eukaryotic community composition ecc vary seasonally with different microcystis genotypes and microcystin congeners at different nutrient concentrations are there any recurrent modules with a pattern associated with cyanohab cyanohab related modules and finally which groups are key factors in these cyanohab related modules 2 methods 2 1 sample collection and water quality analysis freshwater samples were collected on a weekly basis from 19 june 2017

genotypes of microcystis for the microbial community analysis 2 l water samples were collected and stored in a cooler until filtration filtration and dna extraction were processed according to the method described in our previous report chun et al 2019 the bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified using a universal bacterial primer set 341f 805r 341f cctacgggnggcwgcag 805r gactachvgggtatctaatcc which targets the v3 v4 region of the 16s rrna gene herlemann et al 2011 the eukaryotic 18s rrna gene was amplified using a universal eukaryotic primer set v8f 1510r v8f ataacaggtctgtgatgccct 1510r ccttcygcaggttcacctac which targets the v8 v9 region of the 18s rrna gene bradley et al 2016 to investigate the genotypes of microcystis the gene sequences of the intergenic spacer igs between cpcb and cpca cpcba igs the phycocyanin locus of the photosynthetic apparatus in cyanobacteria were selected with a primer set cpc57f cpc356r cpc57f aacctatgtagctttaggagtacc cpc356r cttaagaaacgaccttgagaatc kim et al 2010 this primer set was designed to identify both toxic and non toxic microcystis genotypes but not other cyanobacteria and has been used for microcystis genotype analysis guan et al 2018 wang et al 2013 pcr amplification purification and quantification were performed according to the method described in our previous report chun et al 2019 miseq version 3 chemistry illumina was used for paired end reads sequencing reactions and sequenced using a miseq 2 300 bp reads from the macrogen corporation seoul south korea the resulting raw sequences of 16s and 18s rrna genes were processed using mothur version 1 39 1 schloss et al 2009 according to the miseq standard operating procedure accessed date 5 june 2018 http www mothur org wiki miseq sop with some modifications kozich et al 2013 briefly low quality sequences were removed from the analysis when they contained ambiguous characters contained more than two mismatches to the forward primer or one mismatch to the barcode or were less than 300 bp or more than 500 bp in length the latest silva database release 132 was used to align and classify the sequences quast et al 2013 furthermore the taxass 16s rrna database and pipeline were used for nc bcc classification rohwer et al 2018 accessed 12 october 2019 after classifying the sequences chloroplast and mitochondria sequences were removed from the dataset eukaryotic organisms have intragenomic variability generally 1 variation that can potentially overestimate diversity from 18s rrna gene surveys gong et al 2013 therefore to avoid this problem a similarity cutoff of 98 was used to assign the same operational taxonomic unit otu for eukaryotes behnke et al 2011 and a 99 cutoff for bacteria edgar 2018 in addition otus that comprised only singletons doubletons and tripletons were not subjected to further analyses furthermore the 16s rrna gene sequence data sets were split into two partitions the cyanobacteria and non cyanobacterial groups based on the silva database s phylum classification of the 16s rrna gene to investigate sequence variants at a single nucleotide in the cpcba igs gene amplicon sequence variants asvs of the cpcba igs gene were calculated through dada2 version 1 8 according to the pipeline tutorial 1 8 accessed date 14 october 2018 https benjjneb github io dada2 tutorial 1 8 html in r callahan et al 2016 each asv of the cpcba igs gene was defined as each different microcystis genotype in this study the phylogenic tree of cpcba igs was constructed using a neighbor joining saitou and nei 1987 algorithm in mega 6 tamura et al 2013 and the bootstrap values were calculated from 1000 replications reference sequences were collected by blasting against the available cpcba igs gene sequences from the national center for biotechnology information ncbi public database the sum of the relative abundance of the cpcba igs gene was normalized to the relative abundance of the microcystis otu for further analysis the raw sequences and accompanying metadata are available in the sequence read archive sra of the ncbi under the project accession number prjna509704 2 3 microbial association network and topological features to investigate the relationships among cyanobacteria genotypes of microcystis non cyanobacterial groups eukaryotes and environmental variables three microbial association networks were constructed for the three sampling sites using elsa xia et al 2011 only otus that met the following thresholds for each given data set were considered 1 detected in 30 of samples and 2 a relative proportion of 0 1 for at least one day p values were estimated using a mixed approach the q value false discovery rate was calculated to estimate the likelihood of false positives both p and q values were calculated using the elsa command lsa compute only positive correlations that had both a p and q value 0 001 were selected for further analyses the network was visualized using the open source software cytoscape 3 5 1 shannon et al 2003 network topological features were calculated using the networkanalyzer plugin in cytoscape and r software package igraph assenov et al 2007 csardi and nepusz 2006 random undirected networks of equal size in terms of the number of nodes and edges were calculated using the erdős rényi model using the network randomizer plugin in cytoscape the small world coefficient sw is defined as sw clustering coefficient c cr characteristic path length l lr r represents parameters from a random network table 1 to build a sub network the three networks were combined into one network the microbial recurrent association network mran according to the method described by chun et al 2019 and the sub network was extracted from mran 2 4 module calculation transition patterns of modules and groups the modules were identified using the louvain algorithm in r software package igraph csardi and nepusz 2006 blondel et al 2008 to calculate the transition patterns of the major modules the relative abundance of otus except environmental parameters microcystis otus and genotypes in each module were normalized using feature scaling after normalization normalized otus in each module were averaged together to calculate the transition patterns of each module chun et al 2019 then a dendrogram was constructed based on the transition patterns of the major modules using ward s method as implemented in the function hclust of the r package version 3 4 0 r core team 2017 to separate the major modules into several categories we defined these categories as group finally we compared each group with the relative abundance of microcystis otu in the total bacterial community to identify the bloom group post bloom group pre bloom group and non bloom group 2 5 different topological roles of individual nodes and statistical analysis to identify the topological roles of each node in the microbial network we calculated within module degree z i and among module connectivity p i guimera and amaral 2005 according to the threshold values of z i and p i described in olesen et al 2007 the nodes were divided into peripherals module hubs connectors and network hubs all statistical analyses were performed using the r package version 3 4 0 r core team 2017 we used non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis with bray curtis distances to ordinate the samples based on their dissimilarity in nc bcc and ecc using the metamds function in vegan oksanen et al 2013 differences in taxonomic composition among the different bloom periods were tested using permanova with 999 permutations using the vegan function adonis the assemblage environment major cyanobacterial otus relationships were examined by fitting vectors onto the ordination space using the vegan function envfit the significance of the fitted vectors was assessed using a permutation procedure permutation 999 3 results 3 1 biophysicochemical characteristics biophysicochemical characteristics data for each sampling site are shown in tables s1 s2 and s3 the water temperature increased up to 32 9 33 7 c on 7 august and decreased to below 25 c on 10 october during the sampling periods the concentration of chl a reached its maximum value of 54 6 74 6 μg l when the microcystis bloom occurred fig 1 a both do and ph increased during the bloom period among the nutrients concentrations of tn ranged from 0 42 to 2 19 mg l fig 6a while those of tdn and no3 n ranged from 0 34 to 2 13 and 0 22 1 71 mg l respectively the tp ranged from 0 009 to 0 107 mg l fig 6b concentrations of geosmin significantly increased up to 534 ng l at the hoenam station during july 10 24 furthermore the concentration of mc was approximately three times higher in the bloom period than in the post bloom period fig 6c the maximum concentrations of the mc rr and lr were 0 34 and 0 24 μg l respectively while that of mc yr was 0 12 μg l 3 2 cyanobacterial non cyanobacterial and eukaryotic community composition a total of 3213 otus were clustered at 99 similarity for bacteria 3017 otus were assigned to non cyanobacterial groups and 196 otus to cyanobacteria the proportions of cyanobacteria varied over the sampling stations and period ranging from 2 7 to 56 1 in the total bacterial community fig 1a since the top seven most abundant cyanobacterial otus occupied approximately 85 of the total cyanobacterial community we defined these cyanobacterial otus as major cyanobacteria in this study microcystis otu0002 cyanobium otu0003 and 0004 pseudanabaena otu0005 and otu0014 dolichospermum formerly anabaena otu0008 and aerosakkonema otu0013 the relative abundance of microcystis otu0002 significantly correlated with the cell number of microcystis spearman correlation ρ 0 882 p 0 0001 n 48 tables s4 s5 and s6 from an otu perspective a total of 12 otus were assigned to microcystis and otu0002 dominated 99 9 of the microcystis relative abundance to identify the diversity of the microcystis genotype genotype analysis was performed for microcystis using dada2 with the genotypes of the cpcba igs gene a total of 118 genotypes of microcystis were observed and their transition patterns were clear during the sampling period microscopic images also showed the coexistence of several microcystis morphotypes during the sampling period fig s6a different microcystis genotypes dominated during different periods cpc asv001 003 and 004 dominated from the middle of june to late august defined as summer major bloom while cpc asv002 dominated in september defined as autumn minor bloom fig 1b since cell concentrations of microcystis during the summer major bloom were much higher than during the autumn minor bloom the summer major bloom was defined as the microcystis bloom period the period prior to this as the pre bloom period and that after this as the post bloom period therefore the autumn minor bloom was observed in the post bloom period the average cell concentration of microcystis was approximately 110 000 cells ml 1 during the bloom period but 1000 and 7000 cells ml 1 in the pre bloom and post bloom period respectively tables s4 s5 and s6 the relative abundance of dolichospermum otu0008 and concentration of geosmin were significantly increased together at the hoenam station from 10 to 24 july fig 1a and table s2 pseudanabaena appeared simultaneously with microcystis r 0 81 p 0 001 fig s6b microscopic images obtained from the daechung reservoir also confirmed the epiphytic characteristic of these two cyanobacterial species figs s6b and d furthermore pseudanabaena otu was more closely correlated with cpc asv006 in all three stations recurrence 3 3 in case of cyanobium sp two otus continuously dominated the cyanobacterial population during the sampling period at the chuso and janggye stations the nc bcc changed dramatically during the outbreak and decline of the microcystis bloom at the class level alphaproteobacteria bacteroidetes and actinobacteria dominated in the non cyanobacteriabacterial communities during the sampling period fig 1c during the microcystis bloom period the relative abundances of acetobacterales caulobacterales chloroflexales cytophagales methylacidiphilales opb56 pirellulales and solibacterales in nc bcc were significantly higher compared to the non bloom period p 0 005 while the abundance of the ld12 tribe alfv a decreased to 0 04 3 2 from 42 7 51 6 of the nc bcc in the same period fig s2 a total of 2126 eukaryotic otus were clustered at 98 similarity for eukaryotes similar to nc bcc the ecc also varied considerably in the microcystis bloom period the eccs mainly comprised phytoplankton copepods ciliates and rotifers fig 1d cryptomonadales especially cryptomonas and teleaulax continuously dominated the eukaryotic phytoplankton communities 12 7 6 2 throughout the sampling period while chlamydomonadales especially volvox increased temporarily at the chuso and janggye stations however cyanobacteria continuously dominated phytoplankton communities 80 0 25 5 tables s4 s5 and s6 therefore cyanohab especially those formed by microcystis was focused on in this study the abundance of calanoida a major copepod 21 6 20 1 increased during the bloom periods fig s3 ciliophora known as a ciliate was dominated by the spirotrichea especially halteria rimostrombidium and strombidium and the conthreep group colpodea oligohymenophorea nassophorea prostomatea plagiopylea and phyllopharyngea given the large variation in the relative abundance of the nc bcc and ecc across samples we analyzed multidimensional scaling to seek environmental tables s1 s2 and s3 and biological variables that acted as potential drivers in reshaping the nc bcc and ecc after fitting the environmental and biological variables onto the nmds ordination we found that ph cpc asv001 cod microcystis otu0002 and cpc asv006 were significantly related to the two nmds axes of the nc bcc ordination r 2 0 5 p 0 001 while temperature cod and cpc asv001 were significantly related to the two nmds axes of the ecc ordination r 2 0 5 p 0 001 fig s4 and table s7 the nc bcc and ecc were

sampling stations using elsa fig 2 the topological features of the networks are summarized in table 1 briefly each node has an average of 3 43 9 68 links according to the different stations modularity was higher compared to their random network the average clustering coefficient c higher values of which indicate communities are well connected among each other and characteristic path length l the average shortest path between all pairs of species in the three networks were higher than those of their erdős rényi random networks accordingly the sw values the higher values of which indicate more small worldliness of the network were greater than 1 suggesting that these networks have small world properties each association network from the three sampling stations was composed of six to nine major modules which occupied 77 85 of the total nodes in each association network tables 1 and s8 3 4 transition patterns of modules and group characteristics the dendrogram separated the transition patterns of the major modules cyanohab related modules into four groups that were related to the rise and fall of the microcystis bloom fig 3 a the transition patterns of modules i and v at the chuso station c i and c v module i at the hoenam station h i and modules i and iv at the janggye station j i and j iv showed similar patterns of the relative abundance of the microcystis otu we defined these modules as bloom group fig 3e in contrast the patterns of module iii at the chuso station c iii module ii at the hoenam station h ii and module ix at the janggye station j ix were opposite to the patterns of the bloom group fig 3c these modules were defined as the non bloom group the normalized proportions of several modules increased in the post bloom period defined as post bloom group fig 3d while other modules increased in the pre bloom period defined as pre bloom group fig 3b the components of the nc bcc varied largely in the different groups but showed a certain consensus among the different stations fig 4 b d except for the pre bloom group fig 4a for example the alfviii lineage acetobacterales pnecb lineage betaproteobacteriales cytophagales and methylacidiphilales were identified as specific members in the bloom group fig 4d in the case of the ecc ciliate conthreep mainly oligohymenophorea were the dominant ciliate in the bloom group while chlamydomonadales was a major group at the janggye station fig 4h in the non bloom group the ld12 tribe alfv a and spirotrichea were the dominant groups in the nc bcc and ecc respectively fig 4b and f in addition several otus assigned to the aci a and aci b lineage frankiales were observed in the non bloom group furthermore the aci c lineage frankiales opitutales and phycisphaerales were specific components of the nc bcc in the post bloom group fig 4c the baci and baciv lineage chitinophagales were found in both the pre bloom group and non bloom group the aci a lineage was also a dominant group in the pre bloom group at hoenam and janggye stations while the opb56 chthoniobacterales and betiv lineage betaproteobacteriales were specific components at the chuso hoenam and janggye stations respectively fig 4a 3 5 topological roles and interconnections of microbes for the major cyanobacteria and microcystis genotypes to evaluate the potential importance of individual nodes during the microcystis bloom period z i and p i were calculated almost all nodes 97 were assigned to peripheral nodes but only 1 of the nodes were module hubs and connectors respectively fig s5 large proportions of connectors 40 and module hubs 20 were directly linked to microcystis otu or genotypes to explore the detailed relationships between the major cyanobacteria and other microbes the major cyanobacterial otus and their directly linked path length 1 microbes were selected to form a sub network fig 5 a major cyanobacteria were also tightly coupled with one another such as microcystis and pseudanabaena in all three stations recurrence 3 3 in addition several microbes e g microscillaceae burkholderiaceae sm2d12 rickettsiales etc were directly linked to more than one major cyanobacteria among them four otus were assigned to connectors labrys aci c2 lineage vorticella and unidentified burkholderiaceae the microscillaceae otu was assigned to a module hub however the 16s rrna gene sequence similarities of the microscillaceae otus were lower than 92 with the type species of the microscillaceae notably six otus which were assigned to the microscillaceae vampirovibrionales burkholderiaceae and ns9 marine group were directly linked to microcystis more than twice in three different networks recurrence 2 3 the sub network showed that mc lr and rr were connected to the microcystis otu fig 5a furthermore to investigate the microbial interactions between the genotypes of microcystis and other microbes another sub network with microbes that were directly connected to the major microcystis genotypes was constructed fig 5b the sub network showed highly dynamic interconnections table s9 among them eight otus were assigned to the connectors and three otus were assigned to module hubs cpc asv001 cpc asv003 cpc asv004 and cpc asv006 major genotypes in the summer major bloom were tightly connected with each other recurrence 2 3 and clustered into the summer major bloom cluster with several microbes while cpc asv002 and cpc asv009 major genotypes in the autumn minor bloom cluster were coupled solidly and constructed a relatively small network compared to the summer major bloom cluster microscillaceae roseomonas alfviii and burkholderiaceae appeared repeatedly in the summer major bloom cluster in detail pirellula and blastopirellula were closely correlated with the microcystis otu and the specific genotypes of microcystis copepod skistodiaptomus was directly correlated to cpc asv002 lacibacter and the cl500 29 marine group were connected with cpc asv001 in a delay correlation recurrence 2 3 1 week lag unclassified vampirovibrionales otu0066 was correlated to the microcystis otu repeatedly recurrence 2 3 and several dominant microcystis genotypes in the summer major bloom fig 5 the sub network showed that mc lr rr and yr were involved in the summer major bloom cluster rather than the autumn minor bloom cluster fig 5b 3 6 interconnections between the nutrients microcystins and microbes to explore the microbial responses against the different nutrients and mc concentrations a sub network was extracted that consisted of direct links path length 1 between microbes and these parameters fig 6d no direct links were observed within nutrient concentrations and microcystis genotypes fig 6d however tp was connected to several bacterial otus including connector bacteria which were linked with microcystis genotypes among these bacteria the bacii a lineage flavobacterium connected both the tdp and microcystis genotype nitrogen compounds formed an independent network with the baci lineage chitinophagales aci a and aci b lineage otus mcs correlated with a wide variety of microbes including the alphai cluster rhizobiales burkholderiaceae flavo a1 flavobacteriales oligoflexaceae and silanimonas xanthomonadaceae fig 6d most of the microbes correlated with mcs were also correlated with microcystis genotypes in addition bradymonadales and opb56 showed delayed correlations with mcs 4 discussion 4 1 cyanobacterial community dynamics and biophysicochemical characteristics microcystis blooms occur annually in the daechung reservoir srivastava et al 2015 ahn et al 2011 oh et al 2001 many studies have revealed that multiple ecotypes of microcystis coexist in environments by focusing on the intra specific levels and their diverse physiological characteristics guan et al 2018 wang et al 2013 wilson et al 2005 yoshida et al 2008 this study is the first to perform a genotype analysis of the microcystis genotypes based on the cpcba igs genes using next generation sequencing our results show that only one microcystis otu 16s rrna gene based community data was predominant at the sampling sites but there were several different microcystis genotypes that dominated at different times figs s6a and c furthermore two major genotypes of microcystis were identical 100 similarity to clones analyzed in our previous study that were obtained from the same study sites fig s7 kim et al 2006 indicating that the dominant genotypes did not change in the daechung reservoir water temperature is an important environmental factor for the alternating succession of microcystis species imai et al 2008 the summer major bloom and autumn minor bloom appeared from july to august 29 7 1 8 c and in september 26 5 0 7 c respectively bozarth et al 2010 also observed two types of bloom peaks in mid july and early september which accompanied the microcystis population turnover in the copco reservoir in the usa therefore the optimum temperatures for different microcystis genotypes could be different and seem to cause a shift in the major genotypes in addition the co occurrence patterns of minor genotypes also differed across the bloom period suggesting that the physiological characteristics of these genotypes were different depending on the bloom stages strains of microcystis can be divided into two categories toxic and non toxic microcystis based on their ability to produce cyclic heptapeptide hepatotoxins called microcystins mcs three variants of mc lr rr and yr are the most abundant in microcystis fastner et al 1999 the results of this study suggest that the major genotypes of the summer major bloom could be assigned to toxic microcystis especially cpc asv004 006 008 009 while the major genotypes of the autumn minor bloom especially cpc asv002 could be non toxic microcystis genotype cpc asv006 correlated more strongly to mc lr than to mc rr or mc yr implying that each microcystis genotype has a different production potential for specific mc congeners figs 5b and 6d as the summer major bloom occurred high levels of mcs were maintained fig 6c which would naturally lead to an increase in mc degrading microorganisms some of the species from burkholderiaceae rhizobiales and xanthomonadaceae have been reported as mc degrading bacteria rapala et al 2005 yang et al 2014 zhu et al 2016 in addition silanimonas has been isolated in toxic microcystis cultures chun et al 2017 however most of the bacteria that correlated with mc defy isolation from the environment therefore the results from this study may be used as a hint for discovering mc degrading microorganisms and finding novel mc degradation mechanisms furthermore ozonation chlorination and oxidation based water treatment processes have been described to remove mc hitzfeld et al 2000 most technologies face challenges for scaling up including high costs and optimum efficiencies hitzfeld et al 2000 since the results of this study showed that mcs were mainly linked with the summer major bloom the mc removal technology should primarily be more focused here microcystis colonies could provide favorable microenvironments for other cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria brunberg 1999 pseudanabaena mucicola could be epiphytic on microcystis colonies and co occurred during the bloom periods agha et al 2016 vasconcelos et al 2011 agha et al 2016 revealed that interactions between pseudanabaena and microcystis are dynamic neutral to antagonistic and depend on different microcystis strains the results of this study also suggested that the relationship between pseudanabaena and microcystis could be genotype specific the order vampirovibrionales consists of non photosynthetic cyanobacteria class melainabacteria which are known as predatory bacteria soo et al 2015 vampirovibrio chlorellavorus adheres to the surface of green alga chlorella vulgaris by specific attachment structures and destroys its prey parasites are dependent on their hosts but negative correlations are not found often at daily to weekly timescales due to relatively low mortality berdjeb et al 2018 the recurrent correlation recurrence 2 3 between vampirovibrionales otu and microcystis suggests that the unclassified strain of vampirovibrionales could be one of the important predatory bacteria of microcystis 4 2 microbial interactions within the cyanohab related modules and group the effect of protists zooplankton predatory bacteria and viruses are a major factor that contributes to mortality and the succession of microcystis harke et al 2016 a large amount of microcystis biomass could be lysed by predator prey interactions or cellular senescence during the bloom phase cytophagales is already known as an obligate parasite of freshwater cyanobacteria daft and stewart 1971 and the unclassified vampirovibrionales otu0066 was suggested as the predatory bacteria of microcystis in this study previous studies have shown that ciliate especially oligohymenophorea had a strong ability to graze the cells of microcystis dryden and wright 1987 liu et al 2012 these groups were found in the bloom group and were presumed to mediate predator prey interactions wu and hahn 2006 suggested that the biomass of phytoplankton could influence the succession of the pnecb lineage the relative abundance of pnecb bacteria did not correlate with microcystis in this study even though pnecb bacteria was one of the dominant groups in the bloom group this result suggests that the pnecb lineage could interact with microcystis related microbes but not with microcystis directly the non bloom group showed an opposite pattern compared to the bloom group fig 3 the major components of the non bloom group were similar across the stations and the ld12 tribe alfv a the freshwater sibling of the marine sar11 clade was the most dominant group fig 4b however little is known regarding the ecophysiological properties of the ld12 tribe the genomic characteristics of freshwater ld12 revealed that it has an aerobic chemoorganoheterotrophic lifestyle thriving in oligotrophic media with simple carbon compounds and it likely depends on reduced organosulfur compounds and ammonium as its sulfur and nitrogen sources respectively henson et al 2018 a higher microcystis cell density could accompany a higher concentration of organic matters high toc and cod released by microcystis itself or by bacteria that degrade microcystis derived photosynthates resulting in a more eutrophic condition therefore it was inadequate for the ld12 tribe to dominate during the bloom period the post bloom group consisted of at least two modules at each station fig 3d as major components of the post bloom group fig 4c the bacii a lineage flavobacteriales is known as an organic scavenger and degrader of polymers such as cellulose and chitin kirchman 2002 and high proportions of flavobacteria appear during or after a period of high productivity in eutrophic lakes eiler and bertilsson 2007 newton et al 2011 consistent with our results berry et al 2017 also reported that the aci a and aci b lineages decreased during microcystis dominant cyanohab in lake erie while aci c increased phylogenetically aci a and aci b lineages were closer to each other compared with the aci c lineage ghylin et al 2014 in addition aci c isolates shared 70 74 of the genomic sequence with several aci a isolates kang et al 2017 they reported that the aci c lineage had different genomic characteristics such as carbon metabolism and nucleotide biosynthesis compared with the aci a lineage it was assumed that these genomic features of the aci lineage could be the underlying reason for the niche partitioning of this group during the bloom period unlike other groups the pre bloom group showed a significant difference in the components between the stations fig 4a the origins of the water at the chuso and janggye stations main stream are different and the hoenam station is affected by merged water flow from the chuso and janggye areas fig s1 which could be one of the reasons for the microbial differences in the pre bloom group in addition the pre bloom group was also coupled with different cyanobacteria for instance the h v module showed a similar trend with the proliferation of dolichospermum in july prior to the microcystis bloom figs 1a and 3b chthoniobacterales dominated the h v module suggesting that a specific group of chthoniobacterales could interact with dolichospermum fig 4a these results suggest that the pre bloom group is mainly affected by site specific environments and the proliferation of other cyanobacteria seasonal succession of distinct sets of microbes i e microbial modules had important roles in the proliferation maintenance and degradation of microcystis in this study a modular organization of species interactions would benefit the dynamic stability of the communities grilli et al 2016 therefore they could be presumed to perform ecological functions by working together as a microbial module unit which could not be done alone 4 3 detailed interactions between cyanobacteria and microbes pirellula is a free living bacterium but is also attached to filamentous algae and cyanobacteria by a holdfast clum et al 2009 suggesting that this bacterial group could attach strongly to the surface of microcystis and mediate the coordination of microbial interactions in the phycosphere uncultured microscillaceae otus were also repeatedly correlated to the microcystis otu and genotypes implying a tight interaction therefore further studies should be carried out to isolate these groups and investigate the interaction mechanisms between them and microcystis the sub network of the microcystis genotypes was more complex than the sub network of the major cyanobacteria for instance although the vampirovibrionales pirellula blastopirellula and roseomonas otus were connected to the microcystis otu these otus were connected only to the genotypes of microcystis in the summer major bloom rather than in the autumn minor bloom fig 5b in contrast the copepod skistodiaptomus e otu0001 was connected to the autumn minor bloom cluster rather than the summer major bloom cluster indicating that grazing by copepod skistodiaptomus could be one of the reasons for the short and small proliferation of microcystis during the post bloom period the differentiation between the summer major bloom and autumn minor bloom could be explained by the different microbial interconnections within the microbial network therefore the microcystis genotype sub network could provide a new perspective for a more detailed and precise understanding of the microbial interactions during the microcystis bloom module hubs are responsible for the interactions within the module while connectors are responsible for the interactions between modules previous works have indicated that the damage to module hubs and connectors might cause a collapse of the module and even a disintegration of the global network structure guimera and amaral 2005 olesen et al 2007 around 100 microbes were assigned to the bloom group but only around 40 microbes connected to microcystis at each station approximately 10 of the otus which were directly linked with the microcystis genotypes or otu were assigned to connectors or module hubs fig 5 it suggests that microcystis could cooperate with the microbes included in the bloom group primarily through an indirect connection between the connector module hub microbes and other microbes for instance the connector bacterium labrys was linked to two major microcystis genotypes in the bloom group the genus labrys has been isolated from different environments such as freshwater rhizosphere root nodules and sediment nguyen et al 2015 recently passari et al 2016 isolated labrys sp from the endophytic bacterial community of a plant endophytic bacteria colonize within a plant usually exchanging nutrition with the host and also protecting the host against pathogens by producing a variety of lytic enzymes it suggests that this connector bacterium could have a similar role as endophytic bacteria in the mucilage of microcystis during the bloom periods importantly some otus repeatedly linked to microcystis in this study showed 99 similarity with those found in other aquatic ecosystems where microcystis causes algal blooms table s10 the occurrence of the same bacteria not only in the daechung reservoir but also in other countries suggests that the microcystis bloom requires common bacteria firmly connected in an identical module unit therefore it was concluded that cyanohab associated nc bcc are considerably conserved across the world and they could be fundamental biological elements for the rise and fall of the microcystis bloom 5 conclusion to our knowledge this is the first study on microbial modular structures that includes the genotypes of microcystis non cyanobacterial groups and eukaryotes using elsa based network analysis next generation sequencing and genotype analysis revealed that microcystis a major primary producer consisted of diverse genotypes during different phases of the bloom and they interacted with various microbes microcystis blooms were divided into summer major bloom and autumn minor bloom with different toxin concentration and different dominant genotypes of microcystis the differentiation between the summer major bloom and autumn minor bloom could be explained by the temperature and the different microbial interconnections within the microbial network moreover reliable and repeated cyanohab related modules were identified by investigating the interrelationship within the microbial food web in a eutrophic reservoir during the microcystis bloom cyanohab related modules were categorized into the pre bloom bloom post bloom and non bloom groups mainly consisting of non cyanobacterial groups these microbes had key roles in the formation maintenance and decline of the microcystis bloom in particular the alfviii acetobacterales pnecb betaproteobacteriales bacii a flavobacteriales and aci c frankiales lineages might be involved in mutualistic interactions while vampirovibrionales cytophagales and oligohymenophorea might be involved in interactions such as parasitism or predation overall the succession of the microcystis genotypes was found to be regulated by both bottom up and top down controls in terms of cyanohab related modules therefore the diversity of the microcystis genotype and cyanohab related modules provides the fundamental basis for understanding the biological mechanisms behind the cyanohab declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments this research was

18311,bioretention systems are efficient at removing particulates metals and hydrocarbons from stormwater runoff however managing dissolved nitrogen n species dissolved organic n nh4 no2 no3 is a challenge for these systems this paper reports the results of a long term field study comparing n removal of 1 a modified bioretention system that included an internal water storage zone containing wood chips to promote denitrification and 2 a conventional bioretention system the systems were studied without and with plants under varying hydraulic loading rates hlrs and antecedent dry conditions adcs both bioretention designs were efficient at removing nh4 83 modified 74 conventional while removal of nox no2 n no3 n was significantly higher in the modified system 81 modified 29 conventional results show that the addition of an internal water storage zone promotes denitrification resulting in lower effluent tn concentrations 0 75 mg l modified 1 60 mg l conventional the lowest hlr studied

studies adcs between 0 and 13 days did not significantly affect doc export or tn removal a short term study with florida friendly vegetation indicated that tn removal performance was enhanced in the conventional bioretention system this field study provides promising results for improving dissolved n removal by modifying bioretention systems to include an internal water storage zone containing wood chips keywords biological nutrient removal nitrogen urbanization green stormwater infrastructure low impact development stormwater bmp 1 introduction it is estimated that by 2050 20 of the earth s population will face impaired water quality from excessive nutrients e g nitrogen n and phosphorus p including algal blooms eutrophication dead zones and drinking water contamination paerl and paul 2012 veolia and ifpri 2015 in the united states u s stormwater runoff is the largest diffused source of anthropogenic urban pollution of dissolved n and p dressing et al 2016 veolia and ifpri 2015 accordingly with an increase in urbanization there is a need to integrate low impact development technologies into the urban landscape that not only mitigate wet weather flooding events but also manage nutrient pollution luell et al 2011 the use of low impact development or what is most commonly referred to as green stormwater infrastructure is a promising way to manage stormwater low impact development aims to restore the natural hydrology of a site to predevelopment conditions by mimicking natural process such as infiltration and evapotranspiration manage stormwater close to the source and improve water quality ahammed 2017 bioretention systems are also commonly referred to as biofiltration systems rain gardens or bioswales for their similarities in appearance and construction conventional bioretention systems consist of a depression in the land underlain with mulch and well drained media such as vegetated soil sand and or gravel layers ahiablame et al 2012 they can be constructed from locally available materials have the ability to reduce stormwater runoff volume by storing and infiltrating runoff have a smaller footprint than other stormwater control measures such as wet or dry ponds increase the biodiversity of a site and are aesthetically pleasing ahammed 2017 in addition bioretention systems are efficient at removing many pollutants of concern for example suspended solids hydrocarbons fecal indicator bacteria davis et al 2009 p bratieres et al 2008 li and davis 2016 and heavy metals hatt et al 2009 however nox no3 no2 is reported to leach from conventional bioretention systems resulting in poor total nitrogen tn removal a wide range of tn removal efficiencies have been reported between 630 and 46 bratieres et al 2008 collins et al 2010 jiang et al 2015 lefevre et al 2015 in these systems the porous topsoil and sandy layer promotes adsorption of ammonium nh4 ammonification and nitrification due to aerobic conditions collins et al 2010 however removal of no3 requires denitrifying conditions with both anoxic conditions and the presence of an electron donor one way to improve management of dissolved n species is by modifying the drainage configuration of a bioretention system to incorporate an internal water storage zone iwsz i e a submerged zone or saturated zone that includes a solid organic carbon source as an electron donor e g wood chips to promote denitrification this configuration will be referred to as a modified bioretention system hereinafter in this paper lopez ponnada et al 2017 the fully submerged bottom layer promotes the development of anoxic conditions favorable for denitrifying bacteria that use no3 as their terminal electron acceptor for respiration for example wang et al 2018 performed a laboratory study on a bioretention system with a relatively high influent no3 concentration compared with typical urban runoff the authors reported that the inclusion of an iwsz increased removal efficiencies for no3 23 62 and tn 35 73 when compared to a conventional system that did not contain an iwsz furthermore other laboratory studies reported an increase in no3 and tn removal performance when wood chips are incorporated into the iwsz layer kim et al 2003 lynn et al 2015a peterson et al 2015 types of electron donors used in media for denitrifying bioreactors include hardwood and softwood chips sawdust maize cobs green waste wheat straw compost newspapers and elemental sulfur lopez ponnada et al 2017 lynn et al 2015a evaluated the use of eucalyptus wood chips a hardwood mixed with various media for the iwsz their results indicated that a mixture of gravel and wood chips 2 1 vol vol resulted in greater no3 removal and lower export of dissolved organic carbon doc when compared to using only sand or wood chips several urban and agricultural studies have investigated the field performance of modified bioretention systems ergas et al 2010 hsieh and davis 2005 luell et al 2011 ergas et al 2010 studied a modified bioretention system with hardwood chips treating dairy farm runoff in temperate northeastern u s influent concentrations were high relative to urban stormwater runoff yet the system achieved greater than 88 tn mass removal efficiency with effluent tn concentrations below 10 mg l other field studies of modified bioretention system have included employing an iwsz without a solid carbon source brown and hunt 2011 davis 2007 hsieh and davis 2005 hunt et al 2006 willard et al 2017 in some instances nox leaching was observed brown and hunt 2011 hunt et al 2006 li et al 2014 passeport et al 2009 willard et al 2017 however an evaluation of the performance of a field scale stormwater bioretention system that incorporates a permanently saturated iwsz containing wood chips has not yet been reported in addition while the presence of plants in a bioretention system is encouraged to provide an aesthetic element and increase biodiversity they may also improve water quality this is because plants have been shown to assist in nutrient uptake enrich the microbial community in the rhizosphere improve infiltration and hydraulic conductivity and prevent clogging muerdter et al 2018 read et al 2008 suggested that to improve n removal denitrification is a more permanent n removal pathway than uptake of n by plants however lucas and greenway 2011 demonstrated that n removal by plant uptake was the most apparent and quantifiable process with annual n uptake ranging from 51 to 65 g m2 yr the latter value was observed for mature systems with plants other bioretention studies have reported higher tn removal when plants were present although most of these studies were conventional systems and only a few studies have been carried out with modified systems barrett et al 2013 goh et al 2017 henderson et al 2007 lucas and greenway 2011 payne et al 2014 reported that tn removal improved in planted modified bioretention columns compared with conventional systems or unplanted columns twenty native australian plant species were used and the researchers found that plants were not critical for tn removal during the wet period during the dry period however the presence of an iwsz assisted in maintaining higher soil moisture to support plant survivability as a result plant nutrient uptake and microbial processes were enhanced between storm events the number of dry days in between storm events referred to as antecedent dry conditions adc has also been shown to impact tn removal in bioretention systems lynn et al 2015b longer adcs contribute to wood chip dissolution increasing the doc concentration in the iwsz pore water and increasing the rate of heterotrophic denitrification improved no3 removal has been observed in the modified systems with long adcs compared to periods with frequent storm events i e shorter adcs lynn et al 2015b however little is known about the influence of adc on conventional and modified bioretention systems under field conditions in this study we investigated the n removal performance of side by side field scale conventional and modified bioretention systems the systems were acclimated for two years prior to start of our field experiments after which n removal performance was investigated in unplanted year 3 and planted year 4 systems the overall goal of this study was to evaluate the n removal performance in the field of a conventional and modified bioretention system under different conditions the study specifically investigated the role of 1 varying hydraulic loading rates 2 varying adcs and 3 presence of plants on n mass removal efficiency in a conventional and modified bioretention system a detailed analysis of the fate of dissolved nitrogen species organic n nh4 nox and tn and dissolved organic carbon doc during the storm events allowed us to investigate the transient performance of these systems to the best of our knowledge this is the first long term field comparison of a stormwater bioretention system incorporating a permanently saturated iwsz layer containing wood chips and a conventional system many innovative technologies developed in the laboratory are known to not be implemented full scale because adoption of a new technology depends on time and resource intensive cycles of testing and validation mihelcic et al 2017 it is hoped the promising results of this study will lead to more widespread adoption of bioretention systems for nitrogen management of stormwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site one conventional and one modified field scale bioretention system were operated side by side in east tampa fl stormwater from east tampa drains to mckay bay an embayment of tampa bay and a u s estuary of national concern where n is a limiting nutrient media profiles and specifications for both systems are provided in fig 1 and table 1 the modified bioretention system was 122 cm length 45 7 cm width and 97 cm height and was composed of the following media materials from top to bottom a 2 cm of pea gravel as a mulch layer b 30 cm sand layer c 30 cm iwsz layer consisting of one part eucalyptus wood chips and two parts brown river rock by volume resulting in a porosity of 0 42 lynn et al 2015b d 5 cm brown river rock and e a 30 cm limestone under drain layer the conventional system was the same except it did not contain the 30 cm iwsz layer and was only 67 cm in height in between the sand and pea gravel layers a drainage filter fabric soil separator model 36150ssf 6 was installed to prevent movement of the sand into the under drain layer the filter fabric was added after we observed sand in the underdrain and effluent samples however the filter fabric could potentially be a site for excess biofilm growth and lead to clogging both systems were encased underground in a wooden frame made of 5 cm x 10 cm wood beams with an impermeable 45 mil geomembrane liner the liner aided in effluent sample collection from both systems and also aided in retaining water in the 71 l iwsz on the surface flexible garden lawn plastic edging vigoro model 8748v was used on the perimeter of each bioretention cell to delineate them keep the mulch pea gravel in place prevent influent stormwater from running off to the sides and allow for ponding of water during high hydraulic loading rate hlr events the under drain layer of both systems included a 10 cm diameter perforated pvc pipe to discharge effluent by gravity to an unlined underground trench and ultimately to groundwater for the modified system the under drain pipe had an upturned elbow raised to the top of the iwsz layer to maintain saturated anoxic conditions required for denitrification kim et al 2003 the systems were originally installed in november of 2013 and acclimated in the field for two years before running the experimental storm events described here 2 2 synthetic stormwater composition synthetic stormwater with n levels reported in other studies of urban runoff was used as the influent during controlled storm events harper and baker 2007 yang and toor 2017 the synthetic stormwater consisted of tap water with added potassium nitrate ammonium chloride and ground live oak quercus virginiana tree leaf extract described below to achieve 1 mg l of nh4 n 1 mg l of no3 n and 1 mg l of dissolved organic n don the tap water was stored in 210 l rain barrel drums at the field site for 24 h prior to each storm event to allow the chlorine to dissipate extract from ground live oak leaves was used to represent the dissolved organic nitrogen compounds that would normally be present in urban runoff as a result of dissolution of leaf litter and other organic materials the dried leaves were ground using a coffee grinder mr coffee model ids55 rb for approximately 1 min nine grams of ground tree leaves were then added to a nylon mesh bag 7 6 cm 10 2 cm dollar tree sku 975579 and sealed with drawstrings to form a tea bag the tea bag was placed into a 1 l bottle with 800 ml of di water mixed and left to steep overnight the extract was then added to the synthetic stormwater at a rate of 3 8 ml l to achieve the target dissolved org n concentration of 1 mg l 2 3 experimental field program the bioretention systems were operated in two phases table 2 without plants referred to as phase i and with plants referred to as phase ii and at varying hlr storm duration and adcs storm events in phase i were conducted in triplicate while storm events in phase ii were conducted in duplicate phase i ran from january to july 2016 using hlrs cm h of 4 1 6 9 and 13 9 with respective hydraulic retention times hrt for the iwsz of 3 1 1 9 and 0 9 h respectively these hrts were calculated based on an iwsz porosity of 0 42 hlrs were selected to compare with results from two previous bench scale studies davis et al 2006 lynn et al 2015b the hlrs were maintained using a peristaltic pump cole palmer masterflex l s model 07528 10 with easy load ii pump drives model 77200 50 that applied synthetic stormwater from the rain barrels to the surface of the bioretention systems the influent was applied through perforated tubing that ran across the middle of each cell on the longest side to provide an even distribution of the water on the surface of both systems the systems were exposed to actual stormwater runoff from the site mainly runoff from a building roof and environmental conditions for two full years prior to the start of the field experiments field conditions are important in analyzing the performance of these systems since with the change in seasons and time they change the materials and microbiome the diverse microbial community of the system compared to laboratory scaled systems ashoori et al 2019 pinto et al 2014 for the purpose of this study and based on observations if the amount of natural rainfall during a day was less than 1 9 cm it was counted as a dry day for calculation of adc this is the amount of precipitation that if falling directly over the modified bioretention cell would replace 15 of the volume within the iwsz a usgs rain gauge 275917082222500 near the field site provided precipitation data in phase ii march to august 2017 each bioretention system was planted with five plants after which each phase i hlr storm event was repeated in duplicate to test the effect of plants on n removal performance for both systems tests referred to as se1 p se6 p in table 2 native florida friendly plants were utilized four dwarf pentas pentas lanceolate two 1 quart size pots and two 1 pint size pots and one blue daze evolvulus glomeratus 1 quart size pot where planted 6 inches deep in each bioretention cell phase ii storm events used hlrs of 4 1 cm h 6 9 cm h and 13 9 cm h table 2 tracer studies before and after phase i and phase ii were conducted to assess changes in the hydraulics of each system over the study period data not shown this allowed us to observe whether the plants and their roots could have affected system hydraulics over the course of the study 2 4 sampling and water quality analyses a 200 ml water sample of the inflow and outflow was collected at each sampling event at pre determined time intervals every 20 or 30 min depending on the storm event and placed in acid washed high density polyethylene plastic bottles bottles were immediately placed in a cooler containing ice packs and transported to the laboratory after each field experiment samples were then filtered through 0 45 μm pore diameter membrane filters and refrigerated according to standard methods apha et al 2017 each water sample was tested for dissolved nitrogen species total ammonia nitrogen tan nh3 nh4 nitrate nitrite no x n no2 no3 and total n tn a subset of samples was tested for total dissolved organic carbon doc nox n and tan were measured by the gas diffusion conductivity method using a timberline ammonia analyzer timberline instruments boulder co tn was measured using two methods for se 1 se 7 and for se 3 p se 4 p tn was measured with hach tn test kits tnt plus 826 method loveland co thereafter tn and doc samples were measured with a shimadzu toc v csh total organic carbon total nitrogen analyzer shimadzu scientific instruments columbia md the method detection limit for tn was 0 03 mg n l and 0 11 mg toc l for the shimadzu instrument 0 7 mg n l for the hach tn test kits and 0 014 mg n l for nox n tan for the ammonia analyzer don was calculated by subtracting total inorganic nitrogen tin from tn on site temperature measurements of the influent and effluent water samples were made with a waterproof digital thermometer fisher scientific u s a detailed quality assurance project plan was developed that included calibration with standards duplicates blanks and determination of method detection limits for all analytes 2 5 data analysis weighted influent and effluent concentrations were used to determine the mass removal efficiency we were not able to measure the flow rate out of the system and assumed the flow rate out of our lined system was equal to the flow rate in however moisture losses were not taken into account modeling the flow regimes through the cells using hydrus 1d porous media software supported this assumption data not shown pc progress 2019 statistical analysis was conducted using microsoft excel and the jmp pro 13 2 1 statistical software package sas institute cary nc one way analysis of variance anova test with a significance threshold set at 95 α value of 0 05 was used to determine significance of n removal between the two systems and groups of data a pearson correlation and density ellipse fit with a confidence level of 95 were used to determine linear correlations between two variables box and whisker plots were used to show the distribution of the removal of n species and doc as affected by different variables 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall performance of conventional and modified systems average influent and effluent concentrations for all n species and doc for both the conventional and modified systems over the entire study are shown in fig 2 information on removal efficiencies for each storm event for tan nox n and tn along with hlr storm duration adc and number of pore volumes replaced in the iwsz are shown in table 2 lower effluent n species concentrations were achieved in the modified bioretention system compared with the conventional system fig 2 on average 3 12 mg n l of tn was introduced to both systems at a constant hlr for storm events that ranged from 2 to 6 h the weighted average effluent tn concentration for the modified system 0 74 mg n l was significantly lower than for the conventional system 1 54 mg n l p value 0 001 significantly lower effluent concentrations of tan p value 0 0014 and nox p value 0 001 were also observed in the modified bioretention system effluent compared with the conventional system nox export effluent concentrations higher than influent concentrations was observed only twice in the conventional system whereas the modified system always provided nox removal showing the effect of the iwsz where denitrification occurs greater tan removal in the modified system may indicate enhanced nitrification in aerobic regions of the iwsz due to transport of oxygen during storm events in addition the modified system provided more stable effluent n species concentrations than the conventional system throughout the entire experimental program note smaller standard deviations in fig 2 although the conventional system investigated in this study achieved lower overall n removal than the modified system the results were promising better than field results in prior studies even during phase i when the system was unplanted bratieres et al 2008 collins et al 2010 jiang et al 2015 lefevre et al 2015 lucas and greenway 2011 in particular nox removal in the conventional system when planted was higher 55 compared to other conventional systems in the literature 766 35 davis et al 2006 dietz and clausen 2005 hatt et al 2009 hsieh and davis 2005 line and hunt 2009 the design of the conventional system encased with an impermeable liner and with only a horizontal underdrain as the outlet may have resulted in fully saturated portions of the bioretention cell during and right after a storm event providing anoxic conditions for denitrification in addition denitrification in anoxic microsites in media aggregates occurs naturally during periods of high precipitation havlin 2013 parkin et al 1987 although no wood chips were included in the conventional system design doc was introduced in the influent an average of approximately 4 mg c l from the ground tree leaves used as a source of don in addition organic carbon from decaying vegetation or animal excrement e g cats dogs and chickens were observed at the site were likely carried into these anoxic zones during natural storm events or in between storm events the use of a liner and underdrain in conventional bioretention systems has the potential to reduce n contamination of the effluent to the groundwater even without inclusion of an iwsz containing wood chips the subtropical temperature at the field site and warmer influent temperatures may also have contributed to the high n removal observed with an average effluent water sample temperature of 28 c 1 9 c for both systems compared to other field studies in colder climates lefevre et al 2015 ergas et al 2010 studied a modified bioretention system in northeastern connecticut u s treating agricultural runoff and documented poor performance in early spring when temperatures were cooler than later in the year with warmer temperatures microbial activity for nitrification in soils is optimal at temperatures within 20 35 c manka et al 2016 russell et al 2002 hydrolysis of the wood chips solubilizes the organic carbon and makes doc bioavailable for denitrifying bacteria wang and chu 2016 however export of doc is not desirable export of doc was detected during four out of eight storm events for the modified and three out of eight storm events for the conventional system doc export never exceeded more than 4 5 mg c l above the average influent doc concentration however although average effluent doc concentrations in the modified system 4 0 mg c l were higher than those of the conventional system 3 4 mg c l these differences were not significant p value 0 56 the field systems in this study were installed for two years before the experiments were conducted which allowed sufficient time for the systems to stabilize and prevented leaching of doc and don at the magnitude typically encountered in new systems bench scale modified bioretention systems with short acclimation periods from a few days to months reported initial doc and toc values ranging from 50 to 114 mg c l 10 to 50 times higher than what we observed in the field igielski et al 2019 lynn et al 2015b peterson et al 2015 subramaniam et al 2015 calculations of denitrification kinetics in modified bioretention systems or other denitrifying bioreactors that use organic media can however be misleading if the systems have not reached stabilization subramaniam et al 2015 who had a two week stabilization period observed that as the system aged toc concentrations decreased reaching a second phase of stabilization a bench scale study conducted in our laboratory lynn et al 2015b tested a 45 cm deep iwsz layer with the same media as in this study s field system and reported higher effluent tkn nox tn and doc concentrations for storm events with similar hlr of 6 9 and 13 0 cm h export of tkn and doc in the laboratory study was attributed to the dissolution of wood chips in the iwsz similarly peterson et al 2015 studied a 70 cm iwsz at bench scale more than twice as deep as our iwsz although they achieved tn and no3 removals of 60 and 82 respectively they observed an export of tkn attributed also to the wood chips overall the field modified bioretention system with the shorter 30 cm iwsz was more efficient at removing tkn and nox than modified bioretention systems studied in the laboratory possible reasons for the improved efficiency may be because the two year operation period before the start of the field experiments provided sufficient time for the wood chips to acclimate and stabilize or the presence of a more diverse community of microorganisms at the field site a meta analysis of 57 denitrifying bioreactors revealed that denitrification rates dropped significantly after the systems were in operation for a year but then stabilized addy et al 2016 that meta analysis supports the observation made by other shorter duration studies therefore when natural organic materials are used as denitrification substrates it is important to conduct long term studies as hydrolysis of the wood chips and denitrification rates change over time robertson et al 2008 3 2 effect of hlr on bioretention system performance typical n species concentration profiles during phase i unplanted for both conventional and modified bioretention systems are shown in fig 3 for high hlr se 11 13 9 cm h and fig 4 for low hlr se 10 4 1 cm h at high hlr the modified bioretention maintained low effluent n concentrations 0 5 mg n l for approximately the first hour of the storm event as the initial pore water was flushed out with the incoming stormwater fig 3b after the pore water was flushed out concentrations of all n species slowly increased until about 2 h when effluent tn concentrations remained constant between 2 1 and 2 6 mg n l below the influent concentration of 3 8 mg n l in comparison the conventional bioretention cell s n concentrations increased rapidly within the first hour and remained above 2 5 mg n l after 1 5 h by the end of the storm event from 3 5 to 4 h the effluent tn concentrations in the conventional system were approximately the same as the influent at the lower hlr storm event of 4 1 cm h fig 4a and b effluent tn concentrations in the modified system were below 0 5 mg n l for the duration of the 6 h storm event when approximately one iwsz pore volume was flushed out for the conventional system after 1 5 h tn concentrations began to increase and then remained constant at approximately 2 mg n l for the duration of the storm event in the modified system effluent tn concentrations remained below 0 5 mg n l from 30 min to the end of the 6 h storm event the presence of the iwsz in the modified system resulted in longer retention of the stormwater resulting in better treatment efficiency summary data showing the effect of hlr on tan don nox and tn removal for all storm events for the conventional and modified systems are shown in fig 5 tn removal for both systems was significantly higher p value 0 05 at the lower 4 1 cm h hlr compared with the higher hlr of 13 9 cm h tn removal for the modified system in phase i during the low hlr events can reach 90 while at the higher hlr the tn removal was reduced to 52 in contrast the conventional system in phase i achieved much lower tn removal 59 during the low hlr which decreased to 14 for the high hlr for the modified system mean tn removal rate over all storm events were 0 21 g m2 hr ranging between 0 08 and 0 42 during operation and as normalized to the cell area tn removal rate was calculated by multiplying the change in weighted concentrations influent effluent with the hlr for each storm event although hlr had no significant effect on nox in the conventional system p value 0 05 in the modified system nox removal decreased significantly p 0 0003 as hlr increased from 4 1 to 13 9 cm h in contrast tn removal fig 5d was significantly lower as hlr increased from 4 1 to 13 9 cm h for both systems p 0 003 for the conventional and p 0 0007 for the modified system whereas the increase of hlr from 4 1 to 6 9 cm h was found to not be significant for either system p value 0 05 the increase of hlr from 6 9 to 13 9 cm h was determined to be significant p 0 0003 for the modified system but not for the conventional system the effect of hlr on doc is shown in fig 6 for both systems note that doc data is only available for eight storm events se 13 14 and se1 p se6 p doc export was slightly higher for both systems at higher hlr 6 9 and 13 9 cm h however these differences were not statistically significant p value 0 05 as discussed previously effluent doc concentrations were higher than influent concentrations for several storm events lynn et al 2015a performed a microcosm study using the same iwsz medium and reported a doc dissolution rate of 4 9 10 3 mg doc g wood h this suggests that increased effluent doc concentrations should be observed at longer hrt i e lower hlr but this was not observed in this study designing modified bioretention systems to receive stormwater runoff at relatively low hlr can maximize n removal as was shown in prior studies igielski et al 2019 lopez ponnada et al 2017 lucas and greenway 2011 this makes bioretention systems an ideal low impact development option to capture and treat small storm events that would contribute lower hlr s another way this could be achieved is if bioretention systems are included in stormwater control retrofit projects in a treatment train with wet or dry ponds where the flow rate into the bioretention system can be regulated or in optimized stormwater systems with flow regulators that are adjusted based on expected precipitation 3 3 effect of antecedent dry conditions on performance prior laboratory studies kim et al 2003 lynn et al 2015b smith 2008 have observed a positive correlation of nox removal with increasing adc days the detention time of the remaining stormwater in the iwsz the phenomenon was attributed to providing greater time for hydrolysis of the wood chips that contribute bioavailable organic carbon required to drive denitrification lynn et al 2015b doc is either degraded or flushed out during a storm event and time is required for doc to become bioavailable for the next storm event recent laboratory studies show how increased adc directly impacts n removal more specifically nox igielski et al 2019 lynn et al 2015b subramaniam et al 2015 however in our field study adc was not statistically correlated with increased nox or tn removal from the treated stormwater in either the conventional or modified system a linear regression of adc with nox removal resulted in a low r2 value of 0 0008 and a pearson correlation coefficient of 0 07 a linear regression of adc with tn removal also resulted in a low r2 value of 0 0075 and a pearson correlation coefficient of 0 092 doc concentrations in the pore water of the iwsz for eight storm events representing initial conditions before the start of a storm event were found to not be correlated with increasing adc r2 0 0006 and pearson correlation coefficient 0 35 data were examined for a subset of storm events where at least one iwsz pore volume was replaced in the prior storm event which would be a significant amount of runoff the results still did not show a clear relationship of increased in n removal with increased adc the success of the modified system in removing nox is evident even after back to back storm events i e adc 0 days this contrasts with prior studies that showed that longer adcs increased stormwater contact time and doc dissolution resulting in increased n removal igielski et al 2019 in this study the average initial doc concentration in the iwsz pore water was 3 5 mg c l and the average influent stormwater doc was 4 0 mg c l it was likely that this was sufficient for denitrifying the relatively low nox concentrations entering the iwsz in addition effluent doc concentrations were 4 0 mg c l indicating that doc did not limit denitrification even though we did not observe the same clear relationships as observed in laboratory studies designers may still want to size bioretention systems based on the contact time which includes adc the success of the modified bioretention system at low adc compared to prior laboratory studies may also have been due to favorable field conditions such as warmer ambient temperatures in addition laboratory studies can single out adc as a controlled variable while in this field study variations in soil moisture temperature percentage of the iwsz flushed from the previous storm event and influent n concentrations from natural storm events influenced the results although contact time is important for removal of n adc in terms of days did not significantly impact n removal in this study therefore more research is needed at field scale including measurements of readily biodegradable doc and dissolved oxygen analysis of microbial communities present in the iwsz to provide insights into the effect of adc on n removal and minimum pore water contact time in the iwsz required for a target n removal objective 3 4 effect of plants on performance the range of nox and tn removal for both the modified and conventional systems in phases i unplanted and ii planted is shown in fig 7 mean mass nox removal efficiency increased for the planted systems compared with unplanted systems for both modified from 78 to 88 and conventional bioretention from 15 to 54 however these differences were not statistically significant p 0 3542 for modified and p 0 1650 for the conventional tn removal followed similar patterns fig 7b tn removal was not significantly higher when the systems were planted p 0 32 for modified and p 0 128 for the conventional prior bioretention studies reported significantly higher n removal when plants were included and demonstrated the importance of plant species selection for increasing n removal lucas and greenway 2011 payne et al 2014 zhang et al 2010 note that phase ii was a short term study 6 months and plants did not have an opportunity to become established in the soil in addition the low lying florida friendly plants were selected by community members for their flowers and aesthetic appeal and ability to attract butterflies the selected plants are considered low primary productivity and therefore n removal was not significantly enhanced by inclusion of the plants less variability in nox and tn removal was observed for both systems during phase ii planted compared with phase i unplanted standard deviations for the percent removal in the planted systems were much lower than for the unplanted systems standard deviation for nox removal in the modified system was 24 of the mean when unplanted and decreased to 7 when planted decomposition of vegetation and organic matter during drying and wetting cycles between storm events releases doc to the water holden 2005 and may substantially increase nitrate removal rates maxwell et al 2019 for the modified bioretention likewise for the conventional system standard deviation for nox removal decreased from 70 of the mean in the unplanted system to 17 for the planted system when planted there was no nox export from the conventional system as was observed on two occasions during phase i fig 7a when planted average effluent concentrations for tan in the modified were lower and for the conventional nox concentrations were lower in both systems plants enhanced denitrification due to readily available carbon in the rhizosphere from root exudates and sloughed off root tissue havlin 2013 even if the sand layer is well oxygenated compared to the anoxic conditions of the iwsz layer the microbiome of the rhizosphere allows for denitrifiers to exist near plant roots and thrive in anoxic microsites where oxygen diffusion is reduced havlin 2013 this may explain the enhanced denitrification observed in the planted conventional system 4 conclusions this research assessed the performance of field scale conventional and modified bioretention systems to achieve n removal under varying hlr adc and presence of plants over a period of four years since the date of installation results confirm that the modified bioretention with an iwsz containing wood chips can improve nox removal and provide stable tn removal under various conditions compared with the conventional system the bioretention systems when loaded with constant tn influent concentrations of about 3 mg n l for the duration of a storm event sustained effluent tn concentrations below 0 75 mg n l for the modified system and below 1 60 mg n l for the conventional system in addition the modified system slightly improved tan removal compared with the conventional system the major condition we tested that significantly p value 0 05 affected tn and nox removal was hlr which directly impacts the contact time of the stormwater with the media during a storm event the storm events with lower hlr of 4 1 cm h had the greatest removal of tn while at the highest hlr of 13 9 cm h the lowest tn removal was observed for both systems adcs between 0 up to 13 days for storm events did not have an apparent impact on the n removal efficiency of the systems the addition of plants improved nox and tn removal averages although not statistically significant with a 0 05 confidence interval the improved n removal appeared more noticeably for the conventional system with plants providing more stable effluent concentrations in both systems additional long term field studies and modeling efforts are needed to improve our knowledge on how these systems sustain treatment of n over time and different seasons and to provide more accurate insights on maintenance requirements including the

18311,bioretention systems are efficient at removing particulates metals and hydrocarbons from stormwater runoff however managing dissolved nitrogen n species dissolved organic n nh4 no2 no3 is a challenge for these systems this paper reports the results of a long term field study comparing n removal of 1 a modified bioretention system that included an internal water storage zone containing wood chips to promote denitrification and 2 a conventional bioretention system the systems were studied without and with plants under varying hydraulic loading rates hlrs and antecedent dry conditions adcs both bioretention designs were efficient at removing nh4 83 modified 74 conventional while removal of nox no2 n no3 n was significantly higher in the modified system 81 modified 29 conventional results show that the addition of an internal water storage zone promotes denitrification resulting in lower effluent tn concentrations 0 75 mg l modified 1 60 mg l conventional the lowest hlr studied 4 1 cm h provided the longest hydraulic retention time in the internal water storage zone 3 h and had the greatest tn removal efficiency 90 modified 59 conventional in contrast to prior short term studies adcs between 0 and 13 days did not significantly affect doc export or tn removal a short term study with florida friendly vegetation indicated that tn removal performance was enhanced in the conventional bioretention system this field study provides promising results for improving dissolved n removal by modifying bioretention systems to include an internal water storage zone containing wood chips keywords biological nutrient removal nitrogen urbanization green stormwater infrastructure low impact development stormwater bmp 1 introduction it is estimated that by 2050 20 of the earth s population will face impaired water quality from excessive nutrients e g nitrogen n and phosphorus p including algal blooms eutrophication dead zones and drinking water contamination paerl and paul 2012 veolia and ifpri 2015 in the united states u s stormwater runoff is the largest diffused source of anthropogenic urban pollution of dissolved n and p dressing et al 2016 veolia and ifpri 2015 accordingly with an increase in urbanization there is a need to integrate low impact development technologies into the urban landscape that not only mitigate wet weather flooding events but also manage nutrient pollution luell et al 2011 the use of low impact development or what is most commonly referred to as green stormwater infrastructure is a promising way to manage stormwater low impact development aims to restore the natural hydrology of a site to predevelopment conditions by mimicking natural process such as infiltration and evapotranspiration manage stormwater close to the source and improve water quality ahammed 2017 bioretention systems are also commonly referred to as biofiltration systems rain gardens or bioswales for their similarities in appearance and construction conventional bioretention systems consist of a depression in the land underlain with mulch and well drained media such as vegetated soil sand and or gravel layers ahiablame et al 2012 they can be constructed from locally available materials have the ability to reduce stormwater runoff volume by storing and infiltrating runoff have a smaller footprint than other stormwater control measures such as wet or dry ponds increase the biodiversity of a site and are aesthetically pleasing ahammed 2017 in addition bioretention systems are efficient at removing many pollutants of concern for example suspended solids hydrocarbons fecal indicator bacteria davis et al 2009 p bratieres et al 2008 li and davis 2016 and heavy metals hatt et al 2009 however nox no3 no2 is reported to leach from conventional bioretention systems resulting in poor total nitrogen tn removal a wide range of tn removal efficiencies have been reported between 630 and 46 bratieres et al 2008 collins et al 2010 jiang et al 2015 lefevre et al 2015 in these systems the porous topsoil and sandy layer promotes adsorption of ammonium nh4 ammonification and nitrification due to aerobic conditions collins et al 2010 however removal of no3 requires denitrifying conditions with both anoxic conditions and the presence of an electron donor one way to improve management of dissolved n species is by modifying the drainage configuration of a bioretention system to incorporate an internal water storage zone iwsz i e a submerged zone or saturated zone that includes a solid organic carbon source as an electron donor e g wood chips to promote denitrification this configuration will be referred to as a modified bioretention system hereinafter in this paper lopez ponnada et al 2017 the fully submerged bottom layer promotes the development of anoxic conditions favorable for denitrifying bacteria that use no3 as their terminal electron acceptor for respiration for example wang et al 2018 performed a laboratory study on a bioretention system with a relatively high influent no3 concentration compared with typical urban runoff the authors reported that the inclusion of an iwsz increased removal efficiencies for no3 23 62 and tn 35 73 when compared to a conventional system that did not contain an iwsz furthermore other laboratory studies reported an increase in no3 and tn removal performance when wood chips are incorporated into the iwsz layer kim et al 2003 lynn et al 2015a peterson et al 2015 types of electron donors used in media for denitrifying bioreactors include hardwood and softwood chips sawdust maize cobs green waste wheat straw compost newspapers and elemental sulfur lopez ponnada et al 2017 lynn et al 2015a evaluated the use of eucalyptus wood chips a hardwood mixed with various media for the iwsz their results indicated that a mixture of gravel and wood chips 2 1 vol vol resulted in greater no3 removal and lower export of dissolved organic carbon doc when compared to using only sand or wood chips several urban and agricultural studies have investigated the field performance of modified bioretention systems ergas et al 2010 hsieh and davis 2005 luell et al 2011 ergas et al 2010 studied a modified bioretention system with hardwood chips treating dairy farm runoff in temperate northeastern u s influent concentrations were high relative to urban stormwater runoff yet the system achieved greater than 88 tn mass removal efficiency with effluent tn concentrations below 10 mg l other field studies of modified bioretention system have included employing an iwsz without a solid carbon source brown and hunt 2011 davis 2007 hsieh and davis 2005 hunt et al 2006 willard et al 2017 in some instances nox leaching was observed brown and hunt 2011 hunt et al 2006 li et al 2014 passeport et al 2009 willard et al 2017 however an evaluation of the performance of a field scale stormwater bioretention system that incorporates a permanently saturated iwsz containing wood chips has not yet been reported in addition while the presence of plants in a bioretention system is encouraged to provide an aesthetic element and increase biodiversity they may also improve water quality this is because plants have been shown to assist in nutrient uptake enrich the microbial community in the rhizosphere improve infiltration and hydraulic conductivity and prevent clogging muerdter et al 2018 read et al 2008 suggested that to improve n removal denitrification is a more permanent n removal pathway than uptake of n by plants however lucas and greenway 2011 demonstrated that n removal by plant uptake was the most apparent and quantifiable process with annual n uptake ranging from 51 to 65 g m2 yr the latter value was observed for mature systems with plants other bioretention studies have reported higher tn removal when plants were present although most of these studies were conventional systems and only a few studies have been carried out with modified systems barrett et al 2013 goh et al 2017 henderson et al 2007 lucas and greenway 2011 payne et al 2014 reported that tn removal improved in planted modified bioretention columns compared with conventional systems or unplanted columns twenty native australian plant species were used and the researchers found that plants were not critical for tn removal during the wet period during the dry period however the presence of an iwsz assisted in maintaining higher soil moisture to support plant survivability as a result plant nutrient uptake and microbial processes were enhanced between storm events the number of dry days in between storm events referred to as antecedent dry conditions adc has also been shown to impact tn removal in bioretention systems lynn et al 2015b longer adcs contribute to wood chip dissolution increasing the doc concentration in the iwsz pore water and increasing the rate of heterotrophic denitrification improved no3 removal has been observed in the modified systems with long adcs compared to periods with frequent storm events i e shorter adcs lynn et al 2015b however little is known about the influence of adc on conventional and modified bioretention systems under field conditions in this study we investigated the n removal performance of side by side field scale conventional and modified bioretention systems the systems were acclimated for two years prior to start of our field experiments after which n removal performance was investigated in unplanted year 3 and planted year 4 systems the overall goal of this study was to evaluate the n removal performance in the field of a conventional and modified bioretention system under different conditions the study specifically investigated the role of 1 varying hydraulic loading rates 2 varying adcs and 3 presence of plants on n mass removal efficiency in a conventional and modified bioretention system a detailed analysis of the fate of dissolved nitrogen species organic n nh4 nox and tn and dissolved organic carbon doc during the storm events allowed us to investigate the transient performance of these systems to the best of our knowledge this is the first long term field comparison of a stormwater bioretention system incorporating a permanently saturated iwsz layer containing wood chips and a conventional system many innovative technologies developed in the laboratory are known to not be implemented full scale because adoption of a new technology depends on time and resource intensive cycles of testing and validation mihelcic et al 2017 it is hoped the promising results of this study will lead to more widespread adoption of bioretention systems for nitrogen management of stormwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site one conventional and one modified field scale bioretention system were operated side by side in east tampa fl stormwater from east tampa drains to mckay bay an embayment of tampa bay and a u s estuary of national concern where n is a limiting nutrient media profiles and specifications for both systems are provided in fig 1 and table 1 the modified bioretention system was 122 cm length 45 7 cm width and 97 cm height and was composed of the following media materials from top to bottom a 2 cm of pea gravel as a mulch layer b 30 cm sand layer c 30 cm iwsz layer consisting of one part eucalyptus wood chips and two parts brown river rock by volume resulting in a porosity of 0 42 lynn et al 2015b d 5 cm brown river rock and e a 30 cm limestone under drain layer the conventional system was the same except it did not contain the 30 cm iwsz layer and was only 67 cm in height in between the sand and pea gravel layers a drainage filter fabric soil separator model 36150ssf 6 was installed to prevent movement of the sand into the under drain layer the filter fabric was added after we observed sand in the underdrain and effluent samples however the filter fabric could potentially be a site for excess biofilm growth and lead to clogging both systems were encased underground in a wooden frame made of 5 cm x 10 cm wood beams with an impermeable 45 mil geomembrane liner the liner aided in effluent sample collection from both systems and also aided in retaining water in the 71 l iwsz on the surface flexible garden lawn plastic edging vigoro model 8748v was used on the perimeter of each bioretention cell to delineate them keep the mulch pea gravel in place prevent influent stormwater from running off to the sides and allow for ponding of water during high hydraulic loading rate hlr events the under drain layer of both systems included a 10 cm diameter perforated pvc pipe to discharge effluent by gravity to an unlined underground trench and ultimately to groundwater for the modified system the under drain pipe had an upturned elbow raised to the top of the iwsz layer to maintain saturated anoxic conditions required for denitrification kim et al 2003 the systems were originally installed in november of 2013 and acclimated in the field for two years before running the experimental storm events described here 2 2 synthetic stormwater composition synthetic stormwater with n levels reported in other studies of urban runoff was used as the influent during controlled storm events harper and baker 2007 yang and toor 2017 the synthetic stormwater consisted of tap water with added potassium nitrate ammonium chloride and ground live oak quercus virginiana tree leaf extract described below to achieve 1 mg l of nh4 n 1 mg l of no3 n and 1 mg l of dissolved organic n don the tap water was stored in 210 l rain barrel drums at the field site for 24 h prior to each storm event to allow the chlorine to dissipate extract from ground live oak leaves was used to represent the dissolved organic nitrogen compounds that would normally be present in urban runoff as a result of dissolution of leaf litter and other organic materials the dried leaves were ground using a coffee grinder mr coffee model ids55 rb for approximately 1 min nine grams of ground tree leaves were then added to a nylon mesh bag 7 6 cm 10 2 cm dollar tree sku 975579 and sealed with drawstrings to form a tea bag the tea bag was placed into a 1 l bottle with 800 ml of di water mixed and left to steep overnight the extract was then added to the synthetic stormwater at a rate of 3 8 ml l to achieve the target dissolved org n concentration of 1 mg l 2 3 experimental field program the bioretention systems were operated in two phases table 2 without plants referred to as phase i and with plants referred to as phase ii and at varying hlr storm duration and adcs storm events in phase i were conducted in triplicate while storm events in phase ii were conducted in duplicate phase i ran from january to july 2016 using hlrs cm h of 4 1 6 9 and 13 9 with respective hydraulic retention times hrt for the iwsz of 3 1 1 9 and 0 9 h respectively these hrts were calculated based on an iwsz porosity of 0 42 hlrs were selected to compare with results from two previous bench scale studies davis et al 2006 lynn et al 2015b the hlrs were maintained using a peristaltic pump cole palmer masterflex l s model 07528 10 with easy load ii pump drives model 77200 50 that applied synthetic stormwater from the rain barrels to the surface of the bioretention systems the influent was applied through perforated tubing that ran across the middle of each cell on the longest side to provide an even distribution of the water on the surface of both systems the systems were exposed to actual stormwater runoff from the site mainly runoff from a building roof and environmental conditions for two full years prior to the start of the field experiments field conditions are important in analyzing the performance of these systems since with the change in seasons and time they change the materials and microbiome the diverse microbial community of the system compared to laboratory scaled systems ashoori et al 2019 pinto et al 2014 for the purpose of this study and based on observations if the amount of natural rainfall during a day was less than 1 9 cm it was counted as a dry day for calculation of adc this is the amount of precipitation that if falling directly over the modified bioretention cell would replace 15 of the volume within the iwsz a usgs rain gauge 275917082222500 near the field site provided precipitation data in phase ii march to august 2017 each bioretention system was planted with five plants after which each phase i hlr storm event was repeated in duplicate to test the effect of plants on n removal performance for both systems tests referred to as se1 p se6 p in table 2 native florida friendly plants were utilized four dwarf pentas pentas lanceolate two 1 quart size pots and two 1 pint size pots and one blue daze evolvulus glomeratus 1 quart size pot where planted 6 inches deep in each bioretention cell phase ii storm events used hlrs of 4 1 cm h 6 9 cm h and 13 9 cm h table 2 tracer studies before and after phase i and phase ii were conducted to assess changes in the hydraulics of each system over the study period data not shown this allowed us to observe whether the plants and their roots could have affected system hydraulics over the course of the study 2 4 sampling and water quality analyses a 200 ml water sample of the inflow and outflow was collected at each sampling event at pre determined time intervals every 20 or 30 min depending on the storm event and placed in acid washed high density polyethylene plastic bottles bottles were immediately placed in a cooler containing ice packs and transported to the laboratory after each field experiment samples were then filtered through 0 45 μm pore diameter membrane filters and refrigerated according to standard methods apha et al 2017 each water sample was tested for dissolved nitrogen species total ammonia nitrogen tan nh3 nh4 nitrate nitrite no x n no2 no3 and total n tn a subset of samples was tested for total dissolved organic carbon doc nox n and tan were measured by the gas diffusion conductivity method using a timberline ammonia analyzer timberline instruments boulder co tn was measured using two methods for se 1 se 7 and for se 3 p se 4 p tn was measured with hach tn test kits tnt plus 826 method loveland co thereafter tn and doc samples were measured with a shimadzu toc v csh total organic carbon total nitrogen analyzer shimadzu scientific instruments columbia md the method detection limit for tn was 0 03 mg n l and 0 11 mg toc l for the shimadzu instrument 0 7 mg n l for the hach tn test kits and 0 014 mg n l for nox n tan for the ammonia analyzer don was calculated by subtracting total inorganic nitrogen tin from tn on site temperature measurements of the influent and effluent water samples were made with a waterproof digital thermometer fisher scientific u s a detailed quality assurance project plan was developed that included calibration with standards duplicates blanks and determination of method detection limits for all analytes 2 5 data analysis weighted influent and effluent concentrations were used to determine the mass removal efficiency we were not able to measure the flow rate out of the system and assumed the flow rate out of our lined system was equal to the flow rate in however moisture losses were not taken into account modeling the flow regimes through the cells using hydrus 1d porous media software supported this assumption data not shown pc progress 2019 statistical analysis was conducted using microsoft excel and the jmp pro 13 2 1 statistical software package sas institute cary nc one way analysis of variance anova test with a significance threshold set at 95 α value of 0 05 was used to determine significance of n removal between the two systems and groups of data a pearson correlation and density ellipse fit with a confidence level of 95 were used to determine linear correlations between two variables box and whisker plots were used to show the distribution of the removal of n species and doc as affected by different variables 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall performance of conventional and modified systems average influent and effluent concentrations for all n species and doc for both the conventional and modified systems over the entire study are shown in fig 2 information on removal efficiencies for each storm event for tan nox n and tn along with hlr storm duration adc and number of pore volumes replaced in the iwsz are shown in table 2 lower effluent n species concentrations were achieved in the modified bioretention system compared with the conventional system fig 2 on average 3 12 mg n l of tn was introduced to both systems at a constant hlr for storm events that ranged from 2 to 6 h the weighted average effluent tn concentration for the modified system 0 74 mg n l was significantly lower than for the conventional system 1 54 mg n l p value 0 001 significantly lower effluent concentrations of tan p value 0 0014 and nox p value 0 001 were also observed in the modified bioretention system effluent compared with the conventional system nox export effluent concentrations higher than influent concentrations was observed only twice in the conventional system whereas the modified system always provided nox removal showing the effect of the iwsz where denitrification occurs greater tan removal in the modified system may indicate enhanced nitrification in aerobic regions of the iwsz due to transport of oxygen during storm events in addition the modified system provided more stable effluent n species concentrations than the conventional system throughout the entire experimental program note smaller standard deviations in fig 2 although the conventional system investigated in this study achieved lower overall n removal than the modified system the results were promising better than field results in prior studies even during phase i when the system was unplanted bratieres et al 2008 collins et al 2010 jiang et al 2015 lefevre et al 2015 lucas and greenway 2011 in particular nox removal in the conventional system when planted was higher 55 compared to other conventional systems in the literature 766 35 davis et al 2006 dietz and clausen 2005 hatt et al 2009 hsieh and davis 2005 line and hunt 2009 the design of the conventional system encased with an impermeable liner and with only a horizontal underdrain as the outlet may have resulted in fully saturated portions of the bioretention cell during and right after a storm event providing anoxic conditions for denitrification in addition denitrification in anoxic microsites in media aggregates occurs naturally during periods of high precipitation havlin 2013 parkin et al 1987 although no wood chips were included in the conventional system design doc was introduced in the influent an average of approximately 4 mg c l from the ground tree leaves used as a source of don in addition organic carbon from decaying vegetation or animal excrement e g cats dogs and chickens were observed at the site were likely carried into these anoxic zones during natural storm events or in between storm events the use of a liner and underdrain in conventional bioretention systems has the potential to reduce n contamination of the effluent to the groundwater even without inclusion of an iwsz containing wood chips the subtropical temperature at the field site and warmer influent temperatures may also have contributed to the high n removal observed with an average effluent water sample temperature of 28 c 1 9 c for both systems compared to other field studies in colder climates lefevre et al 2015 ergas et al 2010 studied a modified bioretention system in northeastern connecticut u s treating agricultural runoff and documented poor performance in early spring when temperatures were cooler than later in the year with warmer temperatures microbial activity for nitrification in soils is optimal at temperatures within 20 35 c manka et al 2016 russell et al 2002 hydrolysis of the wood chips solubilizes the organic carbon and makes doc bioavailable for denitrifying bacteria wang and chu 2016 however export of doc is not desirable export of doc was detected during four out of eight storm events for the modified and three out of eight storm events for the conventional system doc export never exceeded more than 4 5 mg c l above the average influent doc concentration however although average effluent doc concentrations in the modified system 4 0 mg c l were higher than those of the conventional system 3 4 mg c l these differences were not significant p value 0 56 the field systems in this study were installed for two years before the experiments were conducted which allowed sufficient time for the systems to stabilize and prevented leaching of doc and don at the magnitude typically encountered in new systems bench scale modified bioretention systems with short acclimation periods from a few days to months reported initial doc and toc values ranging from 50 to 114 mg c l 10 to 50 times higher than what we observed in the field igielski et al 2019 lynn et al 2015b peterson et al 2015 subramaniam et al 2015 calculations of denitrification kinetics in modified bioretention systems or other denitrifying bioreactors that use organic media can however be misleading if the systems have not reached stabilization subramaniam et al 2015 who had a two week stabilization period observed that as the system aged toc concentrations decreased reaching a second phase of stabilization a bench scale study conducted in our laboratory lynn et al 2015b tested a 45 cm deep iwsz layer with the same media as in this study s field system and reported higher effluent tkn nox tn and doc concentrations for storm events with similar hlr of 6 9 and 13 0 cm h export of tkn and doc in the laboratory study was attributed to the dissolution of wood chips in the iwsz similarly peterson et al 2015 studied a 70 cm iwsz at bench scale more than twice as deep as our iwsz although they achieved tn and no3 removals of 60 and 82 respectively they observed an export of tkn attributed also to the wood chips overall the field modified bioretention system with the shorter 30 cm iwsz was more efficient at removing tkn and nox than modified bioretention systems studied in the laboratory possible reasons for the improved efficiency may be because the two year operation period before the start of the field experiments provided sufficient time for the wood chips to acclimate and stabilize or the presence of a more diverse community of microorganisms at the field site a meta analysis of 57 denitrifying bioreactors revealed that denitrification rates dropped significantly after the systems were in operation for a year but then stabilized addy et al 2016 that meta analysis supports the observation made by other shorter duration studies therefore when natural organic materials are used as denitrification substrates it is important to conduct long term studies as hydrolysis of the wood chips and denitrification rates change over time robertson et al 2008 3 2 effect of hlr on bioretention system performance typical n species concentration profiles during phase i unplanted for both conventional and modified bioretention systems are shown in fig 3 for high hlr se 11 13 9 cm h and fig 4 for low hlr se 10 4 1 cm h at high hlr the modified bioretention maintained low effluent n concentrations 0 5 mg n l for approximately the first hour of the storm event as the initial pore water was flushed out with the incoming stormwater fig 3b after the pore water was flushed out concentrations of all n species slowly increased until about 2 h when effluent tn concentrations remained constant between 2 1 and 2 6 mg n l below the influent concentration of 3 8 mg n l in comparison the conventional bioretention cell s n concentrations increased rapidly within the first hour and remained above 2 5 mg n l after 1 5 h by the end of the storm event from 3 5 to 4 h the effluent tn concentrations in the conventional system were approximately the same as the influent at the lower hlr storm event of 4 1 cm h fig 4a and b effluent tn concentrations in the modified system were below 0 5 mg n l for the duration of the 6 h storm event when approximately one iwsz pore volume was flushed out for the conventional system after 1 5 h tn concentrations began to increase and then remained constant at approximately 2 mg n l for the duration of the storm event in the modified system effluent tn concentrations remained below 0 5 mg n l from 30 min to the end of the 6 h storm event the presence of the iwsz in the modified system resulted in longer retention of the stormwater resulting in better treatment efficiency summary data showing the effect of hlr on tan don nox and tn removal for all storm events for the conventional and modified systems are shown in fig 5 tn removal for both systems was significantly higher p value 0 05 at the lower 4 1 cm h hlr compared with the higher hlr of 13 9 cm h tn removal for the modified system in phase i during the low hlr events can reach 90 while at the higher hlr the tn removal was reduced to 52 in contrast the conventional system in phase i achieved much lower tn removal 59 during the low hlr which decreased to 14 for the high hlr for the modified system mean tn removal rate over all storm events were 0 21 g m2 hr ranging between 0 08 and 0 42 during operation and as normalized to the cell area tn removal rate was calculated by multiplying the change in weighted concentrations influent effluent with the hlr for each storm event although hlr had no significant effect on nox in the conventional system p value 0 05 in the modified system nox removal decreased significantly p 0 0003 as hlr increased from 4 1 to 13 9 cm h in contrast tn removal fig 5d was significantly lower as hlr increased from 4 1 to 13 9 cm h for both systems p 0 003 for the conventional and p 0 0007 for the modified system whereas the increase of hlr from 4 1 to 6 9 cm h was found to not be significant for either system p value 0 05 the increase of hlr from 6 9 to 13 9 cm h was determined to be significant p 0 0003 for the modified system but not for the conventional system the effect of hlr on doc is shown in fig 6 for both systems note that doc data is only available for eight storm events se 13 14 and se1 p se6 p doc export was slightly higher for both systems at higher hlr 6 9 and 13 9 cm h however these differences were not statistically significant p value 0 05 as discussed previously effluent doc concentrations were higher than influent concentrations for several storm events lynn et al 2015a performed a microcosm study using the same iwsz medium and reported a doc dissolution rate of 4 9 10 3 mg doc g wood h this suggests that increased effluent doc concentrations should be observed at longer hrt i e lower hlr but this was not observed in this study designing modified bioretention systems to receive stormwater runoff at relatively low hlr can maximize n removal as was shown in prior studies igielski et al 2019 lopez ponnada et al 2017 lucas and greenway 2011 this makes bioretention systems an ideal low impact development option to capture and treat small storm events that would contribute lower hlr s another way this could be achieved is if bioretention systems are included in stormwater control retrofit projects in a treatment train with wet or dry ponds where the flow rate into the bioretention system can be regulated or in optimized stormwater systems with flow regulators that are adjusted based on expected precipitation 3 3 effect of antecedent dry conditions on performance prior laboratory studies kim et al 2003 lynn et al 2015b smith 2008 have observed a positive correlation of nox removal with increasing adc days the detention time of the remaining stormwater in the iwsz the phenomenon was attributed to providing greater time for hydrolysis of the wood chips that contribute bioavailable organic carbon required to drive denitrification lynn et al 2015b doc is either degraded or flushed out during a storm event and time is required for doc to become bioavailable for the next storm event recent laboratory studies show how increased adc directly impacts n removal more specifically nox igielski et al 2019 lynn et al 2015b subramaniam et al 2015 however in our field study adc was not statistically correlated with increased nox or tn removal from the treated stormwater in either the conventional or modified system a linear regression of adc with nox removal resulted in a low r2 value of 0 0008 and a pearson correlation coefficient of 0 07 a linear regression of adc with tn removal also resulted in a low r2 value of 0 0075 and a pearson correlation coefficient of 0 092 doc concentrations in the pore water of the iwsz for eight storm events representing initial conditions before the start of a storm event were found to not be correlated with increasing adc r2 0 0006 and pearson correlation coefficient 0 35 data were examined for a subset of storm events where at least one iwsz pore volume was replaced in the prior storm event which would be a significant amount of runoff the results still did not show a clear relationship of increased in n removal with increased adc the success of the modified system in removing nox is evident even after back to back storm events i e adc 0 days this contrasts with prior studies that showed that longer adcs increased stormwater contact time and doc dissolution resulting in increased n removal igielski et al 2019 in this study the average initial doc concentration in the iwsz pore water was 3 5 mg c l and the average influent stormwater doc was 4 0 mg c l it was likely that this was sufficient for denitrifying the relatively low nox concentrations entering the iwsz in addition effluent doc concentrations were 4 0 mg c l indicating that doc did not limit denitrification even though we did not observe the same clear relationships as observed in laboratory studies designers may still want to size bioretention systems based on the contact time which includes adc the success of the modified bioretention system at low adc compared to prior laboratory studies may also have been due to favorable field conditions such as warmer ambient temperatures in addition laboratory studies can single out adc as a controlled variable while in this field study variations in soil moisture temperature percentage of the iwsz flushed from the previous storm event and influent n concentrations from natural storm events influenced the results although contact time is important for removal of n adc in terms of days did not significantly impact n removal in this study therefore more research is needed at field scale including measurements of readily biodegradable doc and dissolved oxygen analysis of microbial communities present in the iwsz to provide insights into the effect of adc on n removal and minimum pore water contact time in the iwsz required for a target n removal objective 3 4 effect of plants on performance the range of nox and tn removal for both the modified and conventional systems in phases i unplanted and ii planted is shown in fig 7 mean mass nox removal efficiency increased for the planted systems compared with unplanted systems for both modified from 78 to 88 and conventional bioretention from 15 to 54 however these differences were not statistically significant p 0 3542 for modified and p 0 1650 for the conventional tn removal followed similar patterns fig 7b tn removal was not significantly higher when the systems were planted p 0 32 for modified and p 0 128 for the conventional prior bioretention studies reported significantly higher n removal when plants were included and demonstrated the importance of plant species selection for increasing n removal lucas and greenway 2011 payne et al 2014 zhang et al 2010 note that phase ii was a short term study 6 months and plants did not have an opportunity to become established in the soil in addition the low lying florida friendly plants were selected by community members for their flowers and aesthetic appeal and ability to attract butterflies the selected plants are considered low primary productivity and therefore n removal was not significantly enhanced by inclusion of the plants less variability in nox and tn removal was observed for both systems during phase ii planted compared with phase i unplanted standard deviations for the percent removal in the planted systems were much lower than for the unplanted systems standard deviation for nox removal in the modified system was 24 of the mean when unplanted and decreased to 7 when planted decomposition of vegetation and organic matter during drying and wetting cycles between storm events releases doc to the water holden 2005 and may substantially increase nitrate removal rates maxwell et al 2019 for the modified bioretention likewise for the conventional system standard deviation for nox removal decreased from 70 of the mean in the unplanted system to 17 for the planted system when planted there was no nox export from the conventional system as was observed on two occasions during phase i fig 7a when planted average effluent concentrations for tan in the modified were lower and for the conventional nox concentrations were lower in both systems plants enhanced denitrification due to readily available carbon in the rhizosphere from root exudates and sloughed off root tissue havlin 2013 even if the sand layer is well oxygenated compared to the anoxic conditions of the iwsz layer the microbiome of the rhizosphere allows for denitrifiers to exist near plant roots and thrive in anoxic microsites where oxygen diffusion is reduced havlin 2013 this may explain the enhanced denitrification observed in the planted conventional system 4 conclusions this research assessed the performance of field scale conventional and modified bioretention systems to achieve n removal under varying hlr adc and presence of plants over a period of four years since the date of installation results confirm that the modified bioretention with an iwsz containing wood chips can improve nox removal and provide stable tn removal under various conditions compared with the conventional system the bioretention systems when loaded with constant tn influent concentrations of about 3 mg n l for the duration of a storm event sustained effluent tn concentrations below 0 75 mg n l for the modified system and below 1 60 mg n l for the conventional system in addition the modified system slightly improved tan removal compared with the conventional system the major condition we tested that significantly p value 0 05 affected tn and nox removal was hlr which directly impacts the contact time of the stormwater with the media during a storm event the storm events with lower hlr of 4 1 cm h had the greatest removal of tn while at the highest hlr of 13 9 cm h the lowest tn removal was observed for both systems adcs between 0 up to 13 days for storm events did not have an apparent impact on the n removal efficiency of the systems the addition of plants improved nox and tn removal averages although not statistically significant with a 0 05 confidence interval the improved n removal appeared more noticeably for the conventional system with plants providing more stable effluent concentrations in both systems additional long term field studies and modeling efforts are needed to improve our knowledge on how these systems sustain treatment of n over time and different seasons and to provide more accurate insights on maintenance requirements including the

total suspended solids tss turbidity organic matter as measured by chemical oxygen demand cod phosphate and arsenic emamjomeh and sivakumar 2009 zhao et al 2014 tian et al 2016 ec also has several reported operational advantages over chemical coagulation including compact size simple operation low capital costs and less waste sludge zhang et al 2016 shamaei et al 2018 several recent studies have examined electrocoagulation for boron removal with positive results ezechi et al 2014 isa et al 2014 dolati et al 2017 sari and chellam 2015 showed that boron removal from produced waters using ec is achieved primarily through sorption to amorphous al oh 3 precipitates rather than co precipitation electrocoagulation produces hydroxide ions at the cathode that can react with boric acid to form borate ions which facilitates increased boron sorption compared to chemical coagulation processes using aluminum or iron sulfate dolati et al 2017 electrocoagulation may be particularly suited to boron removal from high salinity waste streams including oil produced water while high background salt concentrations typically hinder other treatment processes high conductivity decreases the energy requirements for ec operations compared to freshwater conditions research to date on b removal by aluminum ec has given little attention to the removal mechanisms involved to the adsorptive capacity of al solids generated under a range of conditions that might alter their characteristics e g structure morphology and settling rate and to quantitative models for b adsorption in particular the characteristics of al oh 3 solids formed during ec depends both on operating conditions and water composition e g salt concentration wellner et al 2018 which may have a marked influence on boron adsorption the current study uses a two electrode ec cell to examine the impact of operating parameters and water quality on boron removal through electrochemical generation of dissolved aluminum species aluminum hydroxide solids generated during ec were analyzed using x ray infrared spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering dls to reveal the relationship between the morphology and structure of ec generated al oh 3 s and b removal quantitative models for b removal were developed based on boron adsorption isotherms and mass balance equations to predict b removal using ec the specific objectives were 1 to examine the mechanism s of b removal 2 to develop quantitative models describing b removal by aluminum ec 3 to optimize b removal by determining the effects of significant

kansas river and an oilfield produced water sample was collected from an oil well in douglas county ks the chemical compositions of the water samples are provided in supplementary tables 1s and 2s the kansas river water sample was spiked with 10 mg l boron and the oilfield produced water was spiked with 50 mg l boron 2 2 electrocoagulation setup and sample collection the scheme and a photo of the ec cell are shown in supplementary fig 2s the electrocoagulation reactor consisted of a 150 ml nalgene plastic beaker with two rods immersed in the aqueous solution and a metrohm 804 ti stand stirrer the electrode rods were 1 2 cm in diameter 5 cm long and were placed 2 5 cm apart in the solution before each experiment al electrodes were abraded with sand paper to remove scales and cleaned with 2 hno3 and then ultrapure water an extech dc regulated power supply 0 30 v was used as the power source and the electric current was monitored and held constant during each experiment by continuously adjusting the cell voltage during each experiment the ph of the solution in the beaker was periodically measured with a ph electrode metrohm 6 0262 100 and adjusted to the target value by the titrator metrohm 905 titrando with 800 dosino because the current interfered with the ph measurement the current was turned off when ph was measured wan et al 2011 the total concentrations of b and nacl as tds in the 150 ml experimental solutions were 50 mg l and 2000 mg l respectively except when explicitly described otherwise every 15 or 30 min during each experiment 2 4 ml of solution were collected from the beaker and a 1 ml aliquot was diluted by 2 hno3 to 10 ml and analyzed to determine the total concentrations of b and al in the solution the rest of the sample was filtered using a 0 45 μm nylon filter fisherbrand and 1 ml of the filtrate was acidified and diluted with 2 hno3 to 10 ml then used to determine the dissolved concentrations of selected elements the concentrations of b and al were determined using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes perkinelmer optima 2000 dv triplicate icp analyses were performed for each sample and measurements accepted if all results were within 10 of the averaged value the difference between the total and dissolved concentrations represented b removed from solution and the amount of al precipitate formed aluminum hydroxide solids concentrations are reported herein in mg l as al to compare the ec process with conventional alum coagulation boron removal experiments were conducted using solid aluminum sulfate 16 hydrate as a coagulant solid aluminum sulfate was added directly to the solution at varying dosages after alum addition the ph was adjusted back up to the desired value the beaker sealed and stirred for one and a half hours and the suspension was left to settle for 24 h a sample of the supernatant was then collected acidified and analyzed for boron using icp as described above 2 3 precipitate analysis after selected experiments aluminum solid samples were collected after standing for 24 h without stirring in the beaker to measure their size distribution the mean particle size of the al solids was determined by dynamic light scattering dls using a nanobrook omni particle sizer brookhaven instruments corp three consecutive 1 min measurements were obtained while detecting light scattering at a 90 angle the mean effective diameter was determined by the method of cumulants cordova et al 2008 samples of al coagulant solids were collected dried and prepared for ftir and xrd analysis after selected ec experiments al coagulant solids were collected by filtering each treated sample through a 10 kda ultrafiltration membrane shown in supplementary fig 3s the resulting filter cakes were frozen at less than 20 c the frozen samples were then freeze dried in a labconco freezone 4 5 and ground to obtain powder with 5 moisture complexation between b and al coagulants was characterized using attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir agilent technologies cary 630 the structure of al coagulant samples was examined using x ray diffraction xrd bruker d2 phaser with a co kα radiation source λ 1 79026 å operated at 30 kv and 10 ma and the 2θ scanning angle ranged from 25 to 100 with a speed of 11 min 2 4 predictive model of boron removal the b removal fraction during electrocoagulation η can be calculated by eq 2 2 η 1 b a q b t o t a l where b total and b aq refer to the total and aqueous concentrations respectively of b in solution in mg l boron removal was modeled as an adsorptive process with b adsorbing on al solids eq 3 al solids production was a function of time and current intensity eq 4 while the total concentration of b in the beaker remained constant eq 5 3 b a l f b a q 4 m f t i 5 b t o t a l m v b a l b a q in these equations b al refers to the concentration of b on al coagulant solids mg g m is the mass of al dissolved from anode and precipitated as al coagulant solids g t and i represent ec operating time and current with units of s and amperes a respectively and v is the volume of the ec reactor in l once the adsorption model eq 3 and mass of al solids eq 4 are determined b removal can be predicted under a range of different conditions chen and jafvert 2017 2018a 3 results and discussion 3 1 aluminum dissolution as a function of current intensity aluminum dissolution rates as a function of ec reaction time at varying current intensities are shown in fig 1 for a solution at ph 8 with 2000 mg l nacl the current intensities ranged from 0 10 to 1 40 a and were kept constant by continuously adjusting the cell voltage during each experiment 0 2 h the relationship between the current i and the amount m of aluminum dissolved in the ec reactor over time t can be theoretically predicted using faraday s law moussa et al 2017 eq 6 which was used to plot the lines shown in fig 1a 6 m i m t z f where i refers to current flow a and m is the atomic weight of al 27 g mol t represents operating time s z is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction at the electrode z 3 electrons per mole of al based on the reaction a l s a l 3 a q 3 e occurring at the anode and f is faraday s constant 96 486 c mol the faradaic efficiency fe of al generated during ec or the percentage of actual to theoretical al production can be calculated based on eq 7 lv et al 2014 to describe the charge transfer efficiency in a system facilitating an electrochemical reaction 7 f e z n f i t 100 where n is the amount of the generated products in the ec process in mole al and the remaining parameters are the same as in eq 6 fig 1b shows the faradaic efficiency of the ec cell at different current intensities and reaction times from fig 1a experimental al dissolution rates were slightly elevated compared to theoretical predictions using faraday s law eq 6 for currents ranging from 0 10 a to 0 50 a previous studies yilmaz et al 2007 sari and chellam 2015 have also observed a similar trend the observed super faradaic dissolution may be caused by the presence of chloride ions which can adsorb onto the oxide passivation film on the al anode surface and react with al species in the oxide film reducing the thickness of the oxide film as a result of chemical dissolution mouedhen et al 2008 sari and chellam 2015 additionally the chloride ions also cause pitting corrosion which produces small pits or holes on the al electrode surface leading to elevated metallic aluminum loss mameri et al 1998 jiménez come et al 2012 wellner et al 2018 from fig 1b currents from 0 10 to 0 50 a all produced fe values above 100 during the 2 h ec process consistent with observed super faradaic dissolution based on a regression of the experimental data 0 10 0 50 a the mean ratio of the actual dissolution of the al anode to faraday s law model lines i e the mean fe values was 1 16 this is similar to the average value of all single fe values 1 17 the faradaic efficiency at the two highest currents was much lower than at 0 50 a or lower the fe at 0 70 a started to decrease at 60 min where fe was 1 then decreased markedly to around 0 6 at 120 min at 1 40 a fe decreased dramatically after only 30 min to 0 6 and remained below 0 8 at 60 min the low faradaic efficiencies were likely caused by passivation of the al anode the high dissolution rates of al at these currents caused rapid formation of a stable oxidized film that covers and passivates the al anode inhibiting the further dissolution of al to the solution which increases resistance and reduces efficiency badawy et al 1999 the pitting corrosion effect of the high chloride ion concentration is slower than this passivating process the passivation behavior of electrodes is a serious concern for the longevity of the ec process kabdaşlı et al 2012 particularly given the increasingly early passivation effects as current increased to better predict the amount of al released under the conditions of this study including the effects of super faradaic dissolution the average fe value 1 16 was applied as a modification factor to current intensities 0 50 a and the value of m in the al mass balance model eq 4 was determined using a modified faraday s law eq 8 8 m f e i m t z f based on the experimental data fe 1 16 was used for all experiments in this study when the current intensity was 0 50 a or less 3 2 boron complexation with aluminum hydroxide solids fig 2 shows the atr ftir results for dried al oh 3 s precipitated using the electrocoagulation process at ph 8 both with and without boron present in solution the boron solution initially contained 50 mg l b of which approximately 65 was removed to the solid phase two new peaks associated with b removal appeared at around 1433 cm 1 and 1280 cm 1 for al oh 3 s these peaks are also distinct from those for boric acid in a saturated b oh 3 solution which were observed at 1403 cm 1 and 1144 cm 1 in agreement with previously reported spectra su and suarez 1995 these results indicate complexation of boron on the al oh 3 s surface leading to formation of a strong al o b bond the peak close to 1430 cm 1 appears due to b o asymmetric stretching and the peak near 1280 cm 1 arises because of in plane bending of trigonal boron su and suarez 1995 chorghe et al 2017 also reported broad peaks at similar wavelengths 1426 cm 1 and 1312 cm 1 in an alum coagulated nacl solution containing 130 mg l b which were interpreted as depicting boron trigonally coordinated with al oh 3 s lefèvre 2004 reported peaks at 1420 and 1280 cm 1 for al oh 3 s paste with adsorbed b at ph 7 indicating strengthening of o b and b oh bonds in the surface complex al o b oh 2 sari and chellam 2015 reported that the adsorption of b on al oh 3 s was based on outer sphere and inner sphere complexation of b oh 3 with al oh 3 confirmed by the b o bond shifting toward lower binding energies in xps 3 3 boron removal using al ec at varying current intensities fig 3 shows boron removal by ec using an al anode at ph 8 as a function of time and the applied current as shown in fig 3a increasing b removal was observed with increasing time and with increasing current for currents ranging from 0 10 a to 0 50 a as the total applied electric charge is the product of current and time increasing operating time or current both result in a greater total applied charges from 0 10 to 0 50 a current intensity boron removal increased with increasing applied charge supplementary fig 4s the highest removal of b 70 was observed in 2 h at 0 50 a dolati et al 2017 also reported 70 b removal from a solution with an initial b concentration of 100 mg l using aluminum ec at ph 8 for a current of 0 70 a b removal was higher than that obtained using 0 50 a during the first 30 min but then increased only 10 from 30 min to 2 h resulting in much lower overall removal at 1 40 a boron removal was below that at 0 35 a at 30 min these results indicate that using too high a current adversely affects b removal by al ec one of the possible reasons for this is that al ion generation is inhibited as shown in fig 1 by the formation of a passive layer on the al anode at high currents other possible reasons involve changes in the morphology and structure of the al oh 3 s formed in the reaction which will be discussed in the following section fig 3b shows the relationship between b removal and al dose i e total al generated by al ec or added in the form of aluminum sulfate for both al ec using currents of 0 10 0 50 a and coagulation using aluminum sulfate the model line is based on the model described in section 3 4 boron removal increased as more al ions were generated with 70 removal of b achieved by ec at an al dose of around 2 5 g l yilmaz et al 2007 observed even higher b removal up to 94 when generating at al dose of 7 45 g l during the al ec process it can be seen that b removal by al ec was much higher than that achieved using coagulation with aluminum sulfate when comparing the two processes based on total al added e g 60 removal for al ec at 1500 mg l al versus only 40 removal by coagulation with aluminum sulfate there are several possible explanations for the higher b removal during ec the continuous generation of al oh 3 s due to al dissolution over time in the ec system may allow more b to incorporate into the al solid structure as it forms and aggregates while the rapidly formed al oh 3 s produced by chemical coagulation may result in less surface contact area or time for b incorporation additionally hydroxide generated at the electrode results in locally high ph values that could induce formation of negatively charged b oh 4 which would adsorb better to the al solids to investigate the effect of al dissolution rate i e current on b removal samples were compared based on the b removal observed after the same concentration of al 900 mg l was generated with longer operating times being required for samples treated with lower currents fig 4 a shows b removal by al ec with currents of 0 20 0 35 0 70 and 1 40 a which required operating times of 105 60 30 and 15 min respectively to generate about 900 mg l of al ions currents of 0 20 a and 0 35 a produced similar b removal 52 higher b removal than observed using 0 70 a 43 and 1 40 a 27 particles generated using the 1 40 a current settled rapidly 30 min while those generated at lower currents required several hours to settle and formed a less compact floc layer photo fig 4b mean effective size measurements collected after allowing the particles to stand for 24 h fig 4b show that the solids generated with a current of 1 40 a were much larger than those in the other samples with the largest mean effective size of 120 μm the al solids generated by currents of 0 20 a and 0 35 a had essentially identical mean particles sizes while the particles at 0 70 a were larger but still much smaller than those at 1 40 a fig 4a also shows that boron was released from the al oh 3 solids between initial collection and 24 h except for those of larger particle size produced by the 1 40 a current b release from these samples ranged from 6 to 15 and can be explained by structural changes in the al oh 3 s as shown in fig 5 xrd analysis fig 5a shows no obvious peaks for the al oh 3 s generated using a 0 35 a current and collected immediately after al ec but distinct peaks in the solids generated with 1 40 a after contact with the solution for 24 h the 0 35 a solids also show the same peaks as initially observed in the higher current sample ftir spectroscopy fig 5b of these samples shows a similar pattern the initial solids generated at 0 35 a have only one peak at 1634 cm 1 while the 24 h aged sample shows two new peaks at 1062 and 879 cm 1 which are similar to the peaks at 1065 and 880 cm 1 for the initial sample generated by high current 1 40 a liu et al 2012 reported similar peaks 1072 and 884 cm 1 for boehmite γ alooh the color of al oh 3 s generated at 0 35 a also changed visibly from gray to white during the 24 h period as shown in supplementary fig 3s the xrd and ftir results indicate that al oh 3 s solids generated by al ec using a lower current intensity are initially more amorphous and better able to complex with b to form al o b bonds as the solids gradually crystallize a portion of the b is released as some of the al o b bonds are slowly transformed to al o al bonds wu et al 2019 also reported observing structural changes in al oh 3 s evidenced by similar xrd and ftir analyses indicating a shift from amorphous to more crystalline structure after 24 h based on their study given enough time which can be affected by stirring or other processes al solid would form boehmite structure the small intensity peaks in the xrd pattern for al solids obtained immediately after production at 1 40 a indicate some crystal structure is already present in these precipitates with characteristics similar to boehmite which is consistent with the ftir results liu et al 2012 al solids analyzed immediately after reaction at 0 35 a show no evidence of crystal structure in their xrd pattern however ageing for 24 h produces the same peaks as those found in the 1 40 a sample at shorter times these results particularly in comparison to wu et al s results indicate that al solids produced from ec form similar phases under both conditions but that crystallization is much faster at higher currents 3 4 boron adsorption models to obtain a better view of boron removal over a wider concentration range ec experiments were conducted at ph 8 using initial b concentrations ranging from 5 to 1000 mg l and current of 0 50 a the results are shown in fig 6 a and the classic langmuir adsorption isotherm eq 9 chen and jafvert 2018b was used to express b concentrations on the al oh 3 s as a function of the aqueous b concentration 9 b a l k b a q b m a x 1 k b a q where b al and b aq refer to the b concentrations in the solid phase al oh 3 s mg g and aqueous phase mg l respectively k represents the langmuir adsorption constant calculated based on data shown in fig 6a as 0 0021 l mg and b max is the calculated maximum b concentration adsorbed on al coagulant 538 mg g as can be seen from fig 6a when the aqueous b concentration is 100 mg l the relationship is approximately linear so a linear model eq 10 can be used to predict b removal at low initial concentrations using the data shown in fig 3 and the same background aqueous conditions total b concentration of 50 mg l at ph 8 and currents ranging from 0 10 a to 0 50 a a boron adsorption isotherm for al oh 3 s was simply regressed using a linear adsorption model eq 10 10 b a l a b a q where a is the linear adsorption constant and was found from linear regression to be 1 14 l g for our experimental data fig 6b r2 0 96 using a similar approach to model b removal by coagulation with aluminum sulfate as shown in fig 3b the a value was only 0 392 showing the lower affinity of boron for al oh 3 produced through chemical coagulation fig 6c shows b removal using ec with varying initial concentrations at ph 8 b removals were similar for b initial concentrations of 5 mg l and 50 mg l which were higher than for an initial b concentration of 250 mg l and the data show a clear trend of decreasing b removal as the initial b concentration increased yilmaz et al 2007 showed that b removal decreased as initial concentration increased from 100 mg l to 1000 mg l for both ec and chemical coagulation on the contrary dolati et al 2017 reported that removal of b declined when the initial b conentration was reduced from 100 mg l to 10 mg l a predictive model section 2 4 describing b removal by al ec was developed by coupling the linear adsorption model eq 10 for an initial b concentration of 50 mg l with mass balances on b eq 5 and al eq 8 as can be seen in fig 6c the predictive model was in reasonably good agreement with experimental values for initial b concentrations of 5 and 50 mg l but the model did not predict the observed decrease in boron removal at 250 mg l fig 6d shows b removal versus initial b concentration after 15 and 30 min of al ec treatment at 0 50 a which produced about 320 and 640 mg l of al oh 3 s respectively the results clearly show that b removal decreased with increasing initial b concentration confirming the earlier results fig 6c combining a langmuir adsorption isotherm with the mass balance equation yields predictions in good agreement with experimental data for a broad range of initial b concentrations and for varying al concentrations and much better predictions for high initial b concentrations than those when using the linear adsorption model as boron concentrations increase the deviation between the two models also increases as shown in fig 6d indeed the values predicted using the langmuir adsorption model were also in good agreement with the experimental data for an initial b concentration of 250 mg l shown in fig 6c model lines shown in fig 5s in summary the langmuir model can be used to describe b removal by ec from various water environmental conditions over a broad range of initial b concentrations e g freshwater seawater wastewater or produced waters while the linear model is reasonably accurate only for initial b concentrations of 100 mg l or less 3 5 effect of ph on boron adsorption solution ph has a notable impact on boron removal using al ec fig 7 a shows fractional b removal as a function of time for various initial ph values when the ph was not controlled during the ec process in these experiments the current was 0 50 a the initial b and nacl concentrations were 50 mg l and 2000 mg l respectively and initial ph was adjusted by adding hno3 or naoh before ec process for starting ph values between 6 and 8 ph increased over time to a final ph of about 8 5 after 1 h for a starting ph of 10 the ph decreased quickly to 9 4 during the first 5 min then remained constant for the rest of the experiment for a starting ph of 9 the ph stayed relatively constant throughout the experiment the final b removals after 1 h were similar for starting ph values between 6 and 8 and higher than those obtaining with an initial ph of 9 or 10 the stabilization of ph over time is attributed to the buffering effect of boric acid sayiner et al 2008 reported that the ph values of b solutions in iron and aluminum ec systems changed sharply until a maximum value was reached then remained relatively stationary in similar fashion to what was observed for the aluminum ec system in this study boron removal at constant ph values ranging from 6 to 10 is shown in fig 7b boron removal increased with increasing ph from 6 to 8 and then decreased at higher ph values of 9 and 10 the best removal of b occurred at ph 8 with approximately 40 removal at 30 min and 60 at 60 min these results were virtually the same as those of yilmaz et al 2005 who also reported that a ph of 8 was optimal for b removal by ec with aluminum ec produced similar amounts of solids at initial ph values of 7 8 and 9 but slightly less at ph 6 presumably due to formation of more positively charged soluble al hydroxo complexes and much less at ph 10 which is attributable to the formation of substantial amounts of tetrahydroxoaluminate ions al oh 4 a ph of 8 was also found to be optimal for boron removal by alum coagulation fig 6s the zeta potential of the al solids produced by al ec at varying ph values is shown in fig 7c zeta potential decreased with increasing ph as expected switching from positive to negative at ph slightly below 9 based on the dissociation of boric acid pk a 9 2 eq 1 at ph 9 less than half of the b would be present in the form of negatively charged borate ions at higher ph values the concentration of borate ions increases but so does the negative charge on the al solids according to al oh 3 stability diagram kartikaningsih et al 2016 at a ph of 8 less than 10 of the b is present as borate ions but as borate ions are bound to the positively charged al oh 3 s solids additional borate ions form and then are removed although the zeta potential of al solids is higher at ph 6 and 7 the fraction of negatively charged b species is negligible and neutrally charged boric acid is not attracted to the positively charged al solids 3 6 effect of tds on boron adsorption fig 8 shows the effect of varying the nacl tds concentration on b removal using al ec at ph 8 boron removal using a current of 0 50 a was around 40 for solutions with 600 2 000 and 10 000 mg l nacl fig 8a in high tds solutions 2 000 and 10 000 mg l nacl b removal increased as time and al generation increased with up to 70 removal at 2 h however b removal did not increase after 60 min for the 600 mg l nacl solution and decreased at 90 min fig 8b shows the mean effective sizes of al solids at 30 min and 60 min for each solution at 30 min when the concentration of al solids was around 640 mg l the effectives size of the al solids in varying tds solutions were similar all were around 5 μm but at 60 min the effective size of the al solids in the 600 mg l nacl solution increased dramatically to 120 μm much larger than those of the solids in the other two solutions although all of the solutions had similar total al solids concentrations as can be seen in the picture in fig 8b the sedimentation performance of the al solids in the 600 mg l nacl solution was also better than those of the solids in the other two solutions lee and gagnon 2016 also reported that ec formed larger more compact flocs in low salt solutions these results indicate that higher tds or ionic strength leads to al solids with a more amorphous structure and worse sedimentation performance but better adsorption of b than the more crystalline solids formed at low tds in addition tds was increased by adding nacl with increased chloride ion concentration the removal of passivating layers on al anode surface accelerates allowing the reaction to act in a super faradaic capacity electrode passivation in high chloride solutions is therefore reduced at equivalent operating conditions for these reasons higher tds nacl concentrations facilitate use of higher current intensities i e the limit on the al generation rate for achieving optimal b removal increases with increasing tds fig 8c confirms this conclusion by demonstrating that a lower current intensity 0 35 a led to similar b removal in the 600 and 2000 mg l nacl solutions in 2 h 3 7 boron removal from natural and produced waters by al ec fig 9 shows boron removal at ph 8 from a kansas river water sample and an oilfield produced water sample both collected in douglas county ks for the kansas river water sample spiked with 10 mg l b fig 9a b removal increased with increasing time up to 50 b removal was achieved in 2 h using 0 20 a and the removals predicted using the langmuir adsorption model were close to the experimental values using 0 35 a b removal increased during the first hour and exceeded the removal achieved using 0 20 a but decreased after that the model predicted removals were much greater than the experimental values and the difference increased after 1 h a likely reason for these results is that given the low tds of the kansas river water the 0 35 a current began generating more crystalline solids after 1 h which reduced the solids capacity to adsorb b fig 9b shows b removal from an oilfield produced water sample spiked with 50 mg l b because the tds of the water sample was much higher than that of kansas river water 31 000 mg l see table 2s higher currents were applied b removal increased over time at both 0 5 a and 1 0 a and up to 80 b was removed in 2 h with a 1 0 a current the gaps between model predictions and experimental data were large during the first hour but became smaller at 90 min and 120 min possible reasons why b removal was less than predicted include 1 the high conductivity caused by high tds 31 000 mg l may adversely affect contaminant removal during the ec process because the corresponding high ionic strength clearly affects the kinetics and equilibria of reactions between charged species lin and peng 1994 can et al 2003 and 2 removal of divalent cations or hardness e g ca2 mg2 ba2 and sr2 which occurred primarily during the first hour as shown in fig 7s may have altered the composition and characteristics of the al solids and affected their ability to adsorb b brahmi et al 2016 hakizimana et al 2016 4 conclusions under typical water quality conditions aqueous boron b is present primarily as boric acid h3bo3 which is neutrally charged making b particularly challenging to remove this research investigated b removal using electrocoagulation ec with aluminum and carbon electrodes electrolytically dissolving aluminum ions into the water to act as a coagulant ftir analysis showed the formation of surface complexes of b with al solids al oh 3 s providing a pathway for b removal from solution b removal increased with al dissolution and al solids formation and electrocoagulation was found to achieve better b removal than coagulation with aluminum sulfate when the same amount of al was added more amorphous al solids with a higher b adsorption capacity are formed using low currents while more crystalline solids with a lower adsorptive capacity for b but better sedimentation properties are formed using higher currents the optimal ph for al ec was found to be 8 a linear adsorption model was found to be suitable for predicting b removal for initial b concentrations up to 50 mg l at higher initial b concentrations of b the linear model over predicted b removal but the langmuir adsorption model predicted b removal by al ec reasonably well for initial b concentrations ranging from 5 to 1 000 mg l provided that the current was low enough to avoid formation of less amorphous al solids the limiting current depends strongly on the tds concentration samples having a higher tds concentration such as produced water can tolerate a higher current without forming solids having a lower adsorptive capacity for b two real water

18312,boron b normally present in ground water and sea water is a vital micronutrient for plants but is also toxic in excessive amounts under typical conditions aqueous boron is present as boric acid h3bo3 which is uncharged making b particularly challenging to remove by mechanisms commonly applicable to removal of trace constituents adsorption of b onto aluminum hydroxide solids al oh 3 s generated using aluminum based electrocoagulation ec is a promising strategy for b removal infrared spectroscopy analysis indicated complexation of b oh 3 with aluminum hydroxide solids via surface hydroxyl groups while x ray and infrared spectroscopy results indicated that the structure of the al oh 3 s was influenced both by ec operating conditions and by water quality a linear adsorption model predicted b removal well when initial concentrations were lower than 50 mg l but fit the experimental data poorly at higher initial b concentrations the langmuir adsorption model provided a good fit for a broader range of initial b concentrations 5 1000 mg l factors affecting b adsorption during the ec process including current intensity al dissolution rate boron concentration ph and total dissolved solid tds were investigated increasing current intensity initially led to a higher al dissolution rate and therefore higher b adsorption but there was a limit as further increases in current intensity caused rapid formation of al oh 3 s having a large particle size and a low capacity to complex b boron removal decreased as its concentration increased the best removal of b occurred at ph 8 corresponding to a slightly positive zeta potential for aluminum hydroxide and a small but significant fraction of negatively charged b species higher tds concentrations facilitated the use of higher current intensities i e the limit on the effective al dissolution rate increased with increasing tds two real water samples river water and oilfield produced water spiked with b were treated using ec

electrocoagulation adsorption model aluminum hydroxide surface complex 1 introduction boron b is a naturally occurring element with freshwater concentrations typically less than 1 mg l in most regions of the world who 2003 hasenmueller and criss 2013 seawater infiltration boron rich soils and anthropogenic sources can all result in much higher aqueous boron concentrations in some cases 100 mg l who 2003 hasenmueller and criss 2013 chen et al 2017 wastewater resulting from oil and gas production produced waters is often particularly high in boron content sari and chellam 2015 blondes et al 2017 chorghe et al 2017 while boron is an essential plant nutrient at low concentrations up to 0 3 mg l it is toxic to some commercial crops at concentrations that are only marginally greater from 0 5 to 2 mg l hilal et al 2011 yıldırım and kasım 2018 additionally the world health organization has determined a safe level of boron in drinking water to be 2 4 mg l who 2011 although some countries have established stricter standards down to 1 0 mg l or less güler et al 2015 guan et al 2016 boron removal is complicated by the properties of aqueous boron species boron is present in water as a mixture of boric acid h3bo3 or b oh 3 and borate h2bo3 or b oh 4 with the relative amounts of each species depending on ph as described by the dissociation reaction and equilibrium constant at 25 c shown in eq 1 dolati et al 2017 a predominance area diagram for boric acid is shown in supplementary fig 1s 1 b o h 3 h 2 o k a b oh 4 h p k a 9 2 at near neutral ph values in dilute solutions e g ph 6 to 8 aqueous b exists mainly as neutrally charged boric acid which is poorly removed by membrane processes such as reverse osmosis xu and jiang 2008 dolati et al 2017 increasing the ph above 9 increases boron removal but adds additional expense and process complexity jacob 2007 tu et al 2010 chemical precipitation using calcium carbonate hydroxyapatite and aluminum and iron coagulation have all been studied for boron removal but again these processes are more effective when borate rather than boric acid is the predominant aqueous phase kitano et al 1978 sasaki et al 2016 chorghe et al 2017 dolati et al 2017 chorghe et al 2017 found that very high doses of aluminum or iron could remove up to 80 of boron from produced water but suggested that the amount of chemical required made this approach impractical while boron selective ion exchange resins have been developed regeneration of these resins requires high chemical dosages resulting in correspondingly higher material and operational costs hilal et al 2011 dolati et al 2017 electrocoagulation ec is an electrochemical water treatment method that utilizes a sacrificial anode typically made of aluminum or iron to generate coagulants in situ for ec using aluminum anodes al ec aluminum ions generated at the anode react with hydroxide ions generated at the cathode forming a variety of dissolved aluminum hydrolysis products complexes and aluminum hydroxide solids al oh 3 s sari and chellam 2015 chorghe et al 2017 the distribution of aluminum species formed depends on ph operating conditions including current intensity and operating time and the chemical characteristics of the solution ghosh et al 2008 electrocoagulation has already seen extensive study for its efficacy in removing a variety of contaminants including total suspended solids tss turbidity organic matter as measured by chemical oxygen demand cod phosphate and arsenic emamjomeh and sivakumar 2009 zhao et al 2014 tian et al 2016 ec also has several reported operational advantages over chemical coagulation including compact size simple operation low capital costs and less waste sludge zhang et al 2016 shamaei et al 2018 several recent studies have examined electrocoagulation for boron removal with positive results ezechi et al 2014 isa et al 2014 dolati et al 2017 sari and chellam 2015 showed that boron removal from produced waters using ec is achieved primarily through sorption to amorphous al oh 3 precipitates rather than co precipitation electrocoagulation produces hydroxide ions at the cathode that can react with boric acid to form borate ions which facilitates increased boron sorption compared to chemical coagulation processes using aluminum or iron sulfate dolati et al 2017 electrocoagulation may be particularly suited to boron removal from high salinity waste streams including oil produced water while high background salt concentrations typically hinder other treatment processes high conductivity decreases the energy requirements for ec operations compared to freshwater conditions research to date on b removal by aluminum ec has given little attention to the removal mechanisms involved to the adsorptive capacity of al solids generated under a range of conditions that might alter their characteristics e g structure morphology and settling rate and to quantitative models for b adsorption in particular the characteristics of al oh 3 solids formed during ec depends both on operating conditions and water composition e g salt concentration wellner et al 2018 which may have a marked influence on boron adsorption the current study uses a two electrode ec cell to examine the impact of operating parameters and water quality on boron removal through electrochemical generation of dissolved aluminum species aluminum hydroxide solids generated during ec were analyzed using x ray infrared spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering dls to reveal the relationship between the morphology and structure of ec generated al oh 3 s and b removal quantitative models for b removal were developed based on boron adsorption isotherms and mass balance equations to predict b removal using ec the specific objectives were 1 to examine the mechanism s of b removal 2 to develop quantitative models describing b removal by aluminum ec 3 to optimize b removal by determining the effects of significant operating parameters especially time and current intensity and water quality initial b concentration ph and tds and 4 to experimentally investigate b removal from real waters e g a river water and an

experimental water samples while the ph of experimental solutions was adjusted using sodium hydroxide 0 5 m or nitric acid 2 the electrodes used for generating aluminum and hydroxide ions in situ consisted of a 99 aluminum rod anode and 99 999 graphite carbon rod cathode both purchased from strem chemicals newburyport ma us the natural water sample used in this study was collected from the kansas river and an oilfield produced water sample was collected from an oil well in douglas county ks the chemical compositions of the water samples are provided in supplementary tables 1s and 2s the kansas river water sample was spiked with 10 mg l boron and the oilfield produced water was spiked with 50 mg l boron 2 2 electrocoagulation setup and sample collection the scheme and a photo of the ec cell are shown in supplementary fig 2s the electrocoagulation reactor consisted of a 150 ml nalgene plastic beaker with two rods immersed in the aqueous solution and a metrohm 804 ti stand stirrer the electrode rods were 1 2 cm in diameter 5 cm long and were placed 2 5 cm apart in the solution before each experiment al electrodes were abraded with sand paper to remove scales and cleaned with 2 hno3 and then ultrapure water an extech dc regulated power supply 0 30 v was used as the power source and the electric current was monitored and held constant during each experiment by continuously adjusting the cell voltage during each experiment the ph of the solution in the beaker was periodically measured with a ph electrode metrohm 6 0262 100 and adjusted to the target value by the titrator metrohm 905 titrando with 800 dosino because the current interfered with the ph measurement the current was turned off when ph was measured wan et al 2011 the total concentrations of b and nacl as tds in the 150 ml experimental solutions were 50 mg l and 2000 mg l respectively except when explicitly described otherwise every 15 or 30 min during each experiment 2 4 ml of solution were collected from the beaker and a 1 ml aliquot was diluted by 2 hno3 to 10 ml and analyzed to determine the total concentrations of b and al in the solution the rest of the sample was filtered using a 0 45 μm nylon filter fisherbrand and 1 ml of the filtrate was acidified and diluted with 2 hno3 to 10 ml then used to determine the dissolved concentrations of selected elements the concentrations of b and al were determined using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes perkinelmer optima 2000 dv triplicate icp analyses were performed for each sample and measurements accepted if all results were within 10 of the averaged value the difference between the total and dissolved concentrations represented b removed from solution and the amount of al precipitate formed aluminum hydroxide solids concentrations are reported herein in mg l as al to compare the ec process with conventional alum coagulation boron removal experiments were conducted using solid aluminum sulfate 16 hydrate as a coagulant solid aluminum sulfate was added directly to the solution at varying dosages after alum addition the ph was adjusted back up to the desired value the beaker sealed and stirred for one and a half hours and the suspension was left to settle for 24 h a sample of the supernatant was then collected acidified and analyzed for boron using icp as described above 2 3 precipitate analysis after selected experiments aluminum solid samples were collected after standing for 24 h without stirring in the beaker to measure their size distribution the mean particle size of the al solids was determined by dynamic light scattering dls using a nanobrook omni particle sizer brookhaven instruments corp three consecutive 1 min measurements were obtained while detecting light scattering at a 90 angle the mean effective diameter was determined by the method of cumulants cordova et al 2008 samples of al coagulant solids were collected dried and prepared for ftir and xrd analysis after selected ec experiments al coagulant solids were collected by filtering each treated sample through a 10 kda ultrafiltration membrane shown in supplementary fig 3s the resulting filter cakes were frozen at less than 20 c the frozen samples were then freeze dried in a labconco freezone 4 5 and ground to obtain powder with 5 moisture complexation between b and al coagulants was characterized using attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir agilent technologies cary 630 the structure of al coagulant samples was examined using x ray diffraction xrd bruker d2 phaser with a co kα radiation source λ 1 79026 å operated at 30 kv and 10 ma and the 2θ scanning angle ranged from 25 to 100 with a speed of 11 min 2 4 predictive model of boron removal the b removal fraction during electrocoagulation η can be calculated by eq 2 2 η 1 b a q b t o t a l where b total and b aq refer to the total and aqueous concentrations respectively of b in solution in mg l boron removal was modeled as an adsorptive process with b adsorbing on al solids eq 3 al solids production was a function of time and current intensity eq 4 while the total concentration of b in the beaker remained constant eq 5 3 b a l f b a q 4 m f t i 5 b t o t a l m v b a l b a q in these equations b al refers to the concentration of b on al coagulant solids mg g m is the mass of al dissolved from anode and precipitated as al coagulant solids g t and i represent ec operating time and current with units of s and amperes a respectively and v is the volume of the ec reactor in l once the adsorption model eq 3 and mass of al solids eq 4 are determined b removal can be predicted under a range of different conditions chen and jafvert 2017 2018a 3 results and discussion 3 1 aluminum dissolution as a function of current intensity aluminum dissolution rates as a function of ec reaction time at varying current intensities are shown in fig 1 for a solution at ph 8 with 2000 mg l nacl the current intensities ranged from 0 10 to 1 40 a and were kept constant by continuously adjusting the cell voltage during each experiment 0 2 h the relationship between the current i and the amount m of aluminum dissolved in the ec reactor over time t can be theoretically predicted using faraday s law moussa et al 2017 eq 6 which was used to plot the lines shown in fig 1a 6 m i m t z f where i refers to current flow a and m is the atomic weight of al 27 g mol t represents operating time s z is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction at the electrode z 3 electrons per mole of al based on the reaction a l s a l 3 a q 3 e occurring at the anode and f is faraday s constant 96 486 c mol the faradaic efficiency fe of al generated during ec or the percentage of actual to theoretical al production can be calculated based on eq 7 lv et al 2014 to describe the charge transfer efficiency in a system facilitating an electrochemical reaction 7 f e z n f i t 100 where n is the amount of the generated products in the ec process in mole al and the remaining parameters are the same as in eq 6 fig 1b shows the faradaic efficiency of the ec cell at different current intensities and reaction times from fig 1a experimental al dissolution rates were slightly elevated compared to theoretical predictions using faraday s law eq 6 for currents ranging from 0 10 a to 0 50 a previous studies yilmaz et al 2007 sari and chellam 2015 have also observed a similar trend the observed super faradaic dissolution may be caused by the presence of chloride ions which can adsorb onto the oxide passivation film on the al anode surface and react with al species in the oxide film reducing the thickness of the oxide film as a result of chemical dissolution mouedhen et al 2008 sari and chellam 2015 additionally the chloride ions also cause pitting corrosion which produces small pits or holes on the al electrode surface leading to elevated metallic aluminum loss mameri et al 1998 jiménez come et al 2012 wellner et al 2018 from fig 1b currents from 0 10 to 0 50 a all produced fe values above 100 during the 2 h ec process consistent with observed super faradaic dissolution based on a regression of the experimental data 0 10 0 50 a the mean ratio of the actual dissolution of the al anode to faraday s law model lines i e the mean fe values was 1 16 this is similar to the average value of all single fe values 1 17 the faradaic efficiency at the two highest currents was much lower than at 0 50 a or lower the fe at 0 70 a started to decrease at 60 min where fe was 1 then decreased markedly to around 0 6 at 120 min at 1 40 a fe decreased dramatically after only 30 min to 0 6 and remained below 0 8 at 60 min the low faradaic efficiencies were likely caused by passivation of the al anode the high dissolution rates of al at these currents caused rapid formation of a stable oxidized film that covers and passivates the al anode inhibiting the further dissolution of al to the solution which increases resistance and reduces efficiency badawy et al 1999 the pitting corrosion effect of the high chloride ion concentration is slower than this passivating process the passivation behavior of electrodes is a serious concern for the longevity of the ec process kabdaşlı et al 2012 particularly given the increasingly early passivation effects as current increased to better predict the amount of al released under the conditions of this study including the effects of super faradaic dissolution the average fe value 1 16 was applied as a modification factor to current intensities 0 50 a and the value of m in the al mass balance model eq 4 was determined using a modified faraday s law eq 8 8 m f e i m t z f based on the experimental data fe 1 16 was used for all experiments in this study when the current intensity was 0 50 a or less 3 2 boron complexation with aluminum hydroxide solids fig 2 shows the atr ftir results for dried al oh 3 s precipitated using the electrocoagulation process at ph 8 both with and without boron present in solution the boron solution initially contained 50 mg l b of which approximately 65 was removed to the solid phase two new peaks associated with b removal appeared at around 1433 cm 1 and 1280 cm 1 for al oh 3 s these peaks are also distinct from those for boric acid in a saturated b oh 3 solution which were observed at 1403 cm 1 and 1144 cm 1 in agreement with previously reported spectra su and suarez 1995 these results indicate complexation of boron on the al oh 3 s surface leading to formation of a strong al o b bond the peak close to 1430 cm 1 appears due to b o asymmetric stretching and the peak near 1280 cm 1 arises because of in plane bending of trigonal boron su and suarez 1995 chorghe et al 2017 also reported broad peaks at similar wavelengths 1426 cm 1 and 1312 cm 1 in an alum coagulated nacl solution containing 130 mg l b which were interpreted as depicting boron trigonally coordinated with al oh 3 s lefèvre 2004 reported peaks at 1420 and 1280 cm 1 for al oh 3 s paste with adsorbed b at ph 7 indicating strengthening of o b and b oh bonds in the surface complex al o b oh 2 sari and chellam 2015 reported that the adsorption of b on al oh 3 s was based on outer sphere and inner sphere complexation of b oh 3 with al oh 3 confirmed by the b o bond shifting toward lower binding energies in xps 3 3 boron removal using al ec at varying current intensities fig 3 shows boron removal by ec using an al anode at ph 8 as a function of time and the applied current as shown in fig 3a increasing b removal was observed with increasing time and with increasing current for currents ranging from 0 10 a to 0 50 a as the total applied electric charge is the product of current and time increasing operating time or current both result in a greater total applied charges from 0 10 to 0 50 a current intensity boron removal increased with increasing applied charge supplementary fig 4s the highest removal of b 70 was observed in 2 h at 0 50 a dolati et al 2017 also reported 70 b removal from a solution with an initial b concentration of 100 mg l using aluminum ec at ph 8 for a current of 0 70 a b removal was higher than that obtained using 0 50 a during the first 30 min but then increased only 10 from 30 min to 2 h resulting in much lower overall removal at 1 40 a boron removal was below that at 0 35 a at 30 min these results indicate that using too high a current adversely affects b removal by al ec one of the possible reasons for this is that al ion generation is inhibited as shown in fig 1 by the formation of a passive layer on the al anode at high currents other possible reasons involve changes in the morphology and structure of the al oh 3 s formed in the reaction which will be discussed in the following section fig 3b shows the relationship between b removal and al dose i e total al generated by al ec or added in the form of aluminum sulfate for both al ec using currents of 0 10 0 50 a and coagulation using aluminum sulfate the model line is based on the model described in section 3 4 boron removal increased as more al ions were generated with 70 removal of b achieved by ec at an al dose of around 2 5 g l yilmaz et al 2007 observed even higher b removal up to 94 when generating at al dose of 7 45 g l during the al ec process it can be seen that b removal by al ec was much higher than that achieved using coagulation with aluminum sulfate when comparing the two processes based on total al added e g 60 removal for al ec at 1500 mg l al versus only 40 removal by coagulation with aluminum sulfate there are several possible explanations for the higher b removal during ec the continuous generation of al oh 3 s due to al dissolution over time in the ec system may allow more b to incorporate into the al solid structure as it forms and aggregates while the rapidly formed al oh 3 s produced by chemical coagulation may result in less surface contact area or time for b incorporation additionally hydroxide generated at the electrode results in locally high ph values that could induce formation of negatively charged b oh 4 which would adsorb better to the al solids to investigate the effect of al dissolution rate i e current on b removal samples were compared based on the b removal observed after the same concentration of al 900 mg l was generated with longer operating times being required for samples treated with lower currents fig 4 a shows b removal by al ec with currents of 0 20 0 35 0 70 and 1 40 a which required operating times of 105 60 30 and 15 min respectively to generate about 900 mg l of al ions currents of 0 20 a and 0 35 a produced similar b removal 52 higher b removal than observed using 0 70 a 43 and 1 40 a 27 particles generated using the 1 40 a current settled rapidly 30 min while those generated at lower currents required several hours to settle and formed a less compact floc layer photo fig 4b mean effective size measurements collected after allowing the particles to stand for 24 h fig 4b show that the solids generated with a current of 1 40 a were much larger than those in the other samples with the largest mean effective size of 120 μm the al solids generated by currents of 0 20 a and 0 35 a had essentially identical mean particles sizes while the particles at 0 70 a were larger but still much smaller than those at 1 40 a fig 4a also shows that boron was released from the al oh 3 solids between initial collection and 24 h except for those of larger particle size produced by the 1 40 a current b release from these samples ranged from 6 to 15 and can be explained by structural changes in the al oh 3 s as shown in fig 5 xrd analysis fig 5a shows no obvious peaks for the al oh 3 s generated using a 0 35 a current and collected immediately after al ec but distinct peaks in the solids generated with 1 40 a after contact with the solution for 24 h the 0 35 a solids also show the same peaks as initially observed in the higher current sample ftir spectroscopy fig 5b of these samples shows a similar pattern the initial solids generated at 0 35 a have only one peak at 1634 cm 1 while the 24 h aged sample shows two new peaks at 1062 and 879 cm 1 which are similar to the peaks at 1065 and 880 cm 1 for the initial sample generated by high current 1 40 a liu et al 2012 reported similar peaks 1072 and 884 cm 1 for boehmite γ alooh the color of al oh 3 s generated at 0 35 a also changed visibly from gray to white during the 24 h period as shown in supplementary fig 3s the xrd and ftir results indicate that al oh 3 s solids generated by al ec using a lower current intensity are initially more amorphous and better able to complex with b to form al o b bonds as the solids gradually crystallize a portion of the b is released as some of the al o b bonds are slowly transformed to al o al bonds wu et al 2019 also reported observing structural changes in al oh 3 s evidenced by similar xrd and ftir analyses indicating a shift from amorphous to more crystalline structure after 24 h based on their study given enough time which can be affected by stirring or other processes al solid would form boehmite structure the small intensity peaks in the xrd pattern for al solids obtained immediately after production at 1 40 a indicate some crystal structure is already present in these precipitates with characteristics similar to boehmite which is consistent with the ftir results liu et al 2012 al solids analyzed immediately after reaction at 0 35 a show no evidence of crystal structure in their xrd pattern however ageing for 24 h produces the same peaks as those found in the 1 40 a sample at shorter times these results particularly in comparison to wu et al s results indicate that al solids produced from ec form similar phases under both conditions but that crystallization is much faster at higher currents 3 4 boron adsorption models to obtain a better view of boron removal over a wider concentration range ec experiments were conducted at ph 8 using initial b concentrations ranging from 5 to 1000 mg l and current of 0 50 a the results are shown in fig 6 a and the classic langmuir adsorption isotherm eq 9 chen and jafvert 2018b was used to express b concentrations on the al oh 3 s as a function of the aqueous b concentration 9 b a l k b a q b m a x 1 k b a q where b al and b aq refer to the b concentrations in the solid phase al oh 3 s mg g and aqueous phase mg l respectively k represents the langmuir adsorption constant calculated based on data shown in fig 6a as 0 0021 l mg and b max is the calculated maximum b concentration adsorbed on al coagulant 538 mg g as can be seen from fig 6a when the aqueous b concentration is 100 mg l the relationship is approximately linear so a linear model eq 10 can be used to predict b removal at low initial concentrations using the data shown in fig 3 and the same background aqueous conditions total b concentration of 50 mg l at ph 8 and currents ranging from 0 10 a to 0 50 a a boron adsorption isotherm for al oh 3 s was simply regressed using a linear adsorption model eq 10 10 b a l a b a q where a is the linear adsorption constant and was found from linear regression to be 1 14 l g for our experimental data fig 6b r2 0 96 using a similar approach to model b removal by coagulation with aluminum sulfate as shown in fig 3b the a value was only 0 392 showing the lower affinity of boron for al oh 3 produced through chemical coagulation fig 6c shows b removal using ec with varying initial concentrations at ph 8 b removals were similar for b initial concentrations of 5 mg l and 50 mg l which were higher than for an initial b concentration of 250 mg l and the data show a clear trend of decreasing b removal as the initial b concentration increased yilmaz et al 2007 showed that b removal decreased as initial concentration increased from 100 mg l to 1000 mg l for both ec and chemical coagulation on the contrary dolati et al 2017 reported that removal of b declined when the initial b conentration was reduced from 100 mg l to 10 mg l a predictive model section 2 4 describing b removal by al ec was developed by coupling the linear adsorption model eq 10 for an initial b concentration of 50 mg l with mass balances on b eq 5 and al eq 8 as can be seen in fig 6c the predictive model was in reasonably good agreement with experimental values for initial b concentrations of 5 and 50 mg l but the model did not predict the observed decrease in boron removal at 250 mg l fig 6d shows b removal versus initial b concentration after 15 and 30 min of al ec treatment at 0 50 a which produced about 320 and 640 mg l of al oh 3 s respectively the results clearly show that b removal decreased with increasing initial b concentration confirming the earlier results fig 6c combining a langmuir adsorption isotherm with the mass balance equation yields predictions in good agreement with experimental data for a broad range of initial b concentrations and for varying al concentrations and much better predictions for high initial b concentrations than those when using the linear adsorption model as boron concentrations increase the deviation between the two models also increases as shown in fig 6d indeed the values predicted using the langmuir adsorption model were also in good agreement with the experimental data for an initial b concentration of 250 mg l shown in fig 6c model lines shown in fig 5s in summary the langmuir model can be used to describe b removal by ec from various water environmental conditions over a broad range of initial b concentrations e g freshwater seawater wastewater or produced waters while the linear model is reasonably accurate only for initial b concentrations of 100 mg l or less 3 5 effect of ph on boron adsorption solution ph has a notable impact on boron removal using al ec fig 7 a shows fractional b removal as a function of time for various initial ph values when the ph was not controlled during the ec process in these experiments the current was 0 50 a the initial b and nacl concentrations were 50 mg l and 2000 mg l respectively and initial ph was adjusted by adding hno3 or naoh before ec process for starting ph values between 6 and 8 ph increased over time to a final ph of about 8 5 after 1 h for a starting ph of 10 the ph decreased quickly to 9 4 during the first 5 min then remained constant for the rest of the experiment for a starting ph of 9 the ph stayed relatively constant throughout the experiment the final b removals after 1 h were similar for starting ph values between 6 and 8 and higher than those obtaining with an initial ph of 9 or 10 the stabilization of ph over time is attributed to the buffering effect of boric acid sayiner et al 2008 reported that the ph values of b solutions in iron and aluminum ec systems changed sharply until a maximum value was reached then remained relatively stationary in similar fashion to what was observed for the aluminum ec system in this study boron removal at constant ph values ranging from 6 to 10 is shown in fig 7b boron removal increased with increasing ph from 6 to 8 and then decreased at higher ph values of 9 and 10 the best removal of b occurred at ph 8 with approximately 40 removal at 30 min and 60 at 60 min these results were virtually the same as those of yilmaz et al 2005 who also reported that a ph of 8 was optimal for b removal by ec with aluminum ec produced similar amounts of solids at initial ph values of 7 8 and 9 but slightly less at ph 6 presumably due to formation of more positively charged soluble al hydroxo complexes and much less at ph 10 which is attributable to the formation of substantial amounts of tetrahydroxoaluminate ions al oh 4 a ph of 8 was also found to be optimal for boron removal by alum coagulation fig 6s the zeta potential of the al solids produced by al ec at varying ph values is shown in fig 7c zeta potential decreased with increasing ph as expected switching from positive to negative at ph slightly below 9 based on the dissociation of boric acid pk a 9 2 eq 1 at ph 9 less than half of the b would be present in the form of negatively charged borate ions at higher ph values the concentration of borate ions increases but so does the negative charge on the al solids according to al oh 3 stability diagram kartikaningsih et al 2016 at a ph of 8 less than 10 of the b is present as borate ions but as borate ions are bound to the positively charged al oh 3 s solids additional borate ions form and then are removed although the zeta potential of al solids is higher at ph 6 and 7 the fraction of negatively charged b species is negligible and neutrally charged boric acid is not attracted to the positively charged al solids 3 6 effect of tds on boron adsorption fig 8 shows the effect of varying the nacl tds concentration on b removal using al ec at ph 8 boron removal using a current of 0 50 a was around 40 for solutions with 600 2 000 and 10 000 mg l nacl fig 8a in high tds solutions 2 000 and 10 000 mg l nacl b removal increased as time and al generation increased with up to 70 removal at 2 h however b removal did not increase after 60 min for the 600 mg l nacl solution and decreased at 90 min fig 8b shows the mean effective sizes of al solids at 30 min and 60 min for each solution at 30 min when the concentration of al solids was around 640 mg l the effectives size of the al solids in varying tds solutions were similar all were around 5 μm but at 60 min the effective size of the al solids in the 600 mg l nacl solution increased dramatically to 120 μm much larger than those of the solids in the other two solutions although all of the solutions had similar total al solids concentrations as can be seen in the picture in fig 8b the sedimentation performance of the al solids in the 600 mg l nacl solution was also better than those of the solids in the other two solutions lee and gagnon 2016 also reported that ec formed larger more compact flocs in low salt solutions these results indicate that higher tds or ionic strength leads to al solids with a more amorphous structure and worse sedimentation performance but better adsorption of b than the more crystalline solids formed at low tds in addition tds was increased by adding nacl with increased chloride ion concentration the removal of passivating layers on al anode surface accelerates allowing the reaction to act in a super faradaic capacity electrode passivation in high chloride solutions is therefore reduced at equivalent operating conditions for these reasons higher tds nacl concentrations facilitate use of higher current intensities i e the limit on the al generation rate for achieving optimal b removal increases with increasing tds fig 8c confirms this conclusion by demonstrating that a lower current intensity 0 35 a led to similar b removal in the 600 and 2000 mg l nacl solutions in 2 h 3 7 boron removal from natural and produced waters by al ec fig 9 shows boron removal at ph 8 from a kansas river water sample and an oilfield produced water sample both collected in douglas county ks for the kansas river water sample spiked with 10 mg l b fig 9a b removal increased with increasing time up to 50 b removal was achieved in 2 h using 0 20 a and the removals predicted using the langmuir adsorption model were close to the experimental values using 0 35 a b removal increased during the first hour and exceeded the removal achieved using 0 20 a but decreased after that the model predicted removals were much greater than the experimental values and the difference increased after 1 h a likely reason for these results is that given the low tds of the kansas river water the 0 35 a current began generating more crystalline solids after 1 h which reduced the solids capacity to adsorb b fig 9b shows b removal from an oilfield produced water sample spiked with 50 mg l b because the tds of the water sample was much higher than that of kansas river water 31 000 mg l see table 2s higher currents were applied b removal increased over time at both 0 5 a and 1 0 a and up to 80 b was removed in 2 h with a 1 0 a current the gaps between model predictions and experimental data were large during the first hour but became smaller at 90 min and 120 min possible reasons why b removal was less than predicted include 1 the high conductivity caused by high tds 31 000 mg l may adversely affect contaminant removal during the ec process because the corresponding high ionic strength clearly affects the kinetics and equilibria of reactions between charged species lin and peng 1994 can et al 2003 and 2 removal of divalent cations or hardness e g ca2 mg2 ba2 and sr2 which occurred primarily during the first hour as shown in fig 7s may have altered the composition and characteristics of the al solids and affected their ability to adsorb b brahmi et al 2016 hakizimana et al 2016 4 conclusions under typical water quality conditions aqueous boron b is present primarily as boric acid h3bo3 which is neutrally charged making b particularly challenging to remove this research investigated b removal using electrocoagulation ec with aluminum and carbon electrodes electrolytically dissolving aluminum ions into the water to act as a coagulant ftir analysis showed the formation of surface complexes of b with al solids al oh 3 s providing a pathway for b removal from solution b removal increased with al dissolution and al solids formation and electrocoagulation was found to achieve better b removal than coagulation with aluminum sulfate when the same amount of al was added more amorphous al solids with a higher b adsorption capacity are formed using low currents while more crystalline solids with a lower adsorptive capacity for b but better sedimentation properties are formed using higher currents the optimal ph for al ec was found to be 8 a linear adsorption model was found to be suitable for predicting b removal for initial b concentrations up to 50 mg l at higher initial b concentrations of b the linear model over predicted b removal but the langmuir adsorption model predicted b removal by al ec reasonably well for initial b concentrations ranging from 5 to 1 000 mg l provided that the current was low enough to avoid formation of less amorphous al solids the limiting current depends strongly on the tds concentration samples having a higher tds concentration such as produced water can tolerate a higher current without forming solids having a lower adsorptive capacity for b two real water samples a river water and an oilfield produced water both spiked with b were treated using the al ec process up to 50 of the b was removed from the river water spiked with 10 mg l of b in 2 h with a 0 2 a current and 80 of the b was removed from produced water spiked with 50 mg l b in 2 h with a 1 0 a current declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

18313,decentralized drinking water purification complements water supply in areas with unreliable or absent infrastructure the exacerbating consequences of climate change in form of droughts and floods force remote households to tap various water sources hence household based processes must be versatile to cope with e g contaminated ground water and turbid surface waters purification at household level must be self sustaining in order to enable independence from continuous supply of power and consumables in this study we design a process accordingly and we prove its technical feasibility on pilot scale the two step process utilizes gravity driven ultrafiltration and activated carbon adsorption to purify water whereas the process regeneration is accomplished by combining temperature enhanced backwash and temperature swing adsorption to clean the membrane and adsorber respectively we obtained stable operation over 40 days with a sustained flowrate of 5 l h 1 and

centralized water treatment and distribution cannot supply drinking water to all people around the world since these complex systems cannot be installed and sustained under all boundary conditions larsen et al 2016 hence decentralized water treatment inevitably complements supply of safe water in areas with unreliable or absent infrastructure unicef and who recommend household also called point of use pou water treatment and safe storage because it is cost effective in improving public health reliable and in principle all purpose clasen et al 2007 unicef and who 2009 consequently the importance of such resilient systems in emergency situations such as droughts and floods is undoubted now ray and jain 2014 p 179 elliott et al 2019 and is likely to amplify in the future in view of the progressing climate change that will cause exacerbating weather extremes cohen et al 2014 francis and vavrus 2015 accompanied by outbreaks of waterborne diseases cann et al 2013 however there is a number of requirements that must be fulfilled for continuous operation and service sobsey et al 2008 peter varbanets et al 2009 aumeier et al 2017 first pou technologies depend on crucial supply routes for spare parts consumables such as chemicals or cleaning agents and most notably power ray and jain 2014 p 179 hence supplies must be as minimal as possible second system operation must be as easy as possible since skilled personnel is lacking third maintenance must be minimal and as easy as possible to minimize abandonment of the system fourth many households depend on various water sources with varying water quality to supply enough water at all times throughout the year ray and jain 2014 p 178 elliott et al 2017 foster and hope 2017 luetkemeier and liehr 2018 thus drinking water production must be versatile and possible from both ground water during droughts and river surface water during floods elliott et al 2019 highlighted and emphasized that multiple water source use is still inadequately addressed but eminent for these households at the moment commercial and researched systems suffer from various specific shortcomings as described by sobsey et al 2008 peter varbanets et al 2009 ray and jain 2014 and pooi and ng 2018 for instance only partial compliance with the aforementioned requirements therefore shannon et al 2008 highlighted the need for developing new household water treatment processes in this study we demonstrate the technical feasibility of a novel process that was specifically designed to meet the requirements named above in particular we demonstrate the stable operation of this process for divers feed waters that represent different operational environments and situations moreover we conduct an operational optimization to adapt the process to these different environments the presented process consists of two steps water purification and process regeneration the water purification step includes gravity driven membrane filtration gdm and adsorption on granular activated carbon this step is equivalent to other comparable systems such as proposed by peter varbanets et al 2010 frechen et al 2011 and oka et al 2017 or commercial products as reviewed by ray and jain 2014 chapter 5 and pooi and ng 2018 the process regeneration step represents the novelty of this study this regeneration step cleans the fouled membrane by so called temperature enhanced backwash teb and at the same time it regenerates the loaded exhausted adsorber by aqueous phase temperature swing adsorption tsa we have introduced and described the individual teb and tsa processes earlier aumeier et al 2018 2019 in this study we combined them scaled them up and integrated them into one process for the first time in the regeneration step the combined membrane adsorber module is placed and heated in a pressure vessel to few atmospheres gauge pressure and corresponding elevated boiling temperature by means of any low grade heat source then the gauge pressure is the main driving force to backwash the membrane teb with this hydrothermal solution whereas the elevated temperature drives desorption and regeneration of the adsorber tsa since the pressure vessel represents also the product storage tank re contamination is prevented effectively by these sterilization conditions as also applied in commercial autoclaves 20 min 121 c cf chmiel 2011 p 240 regeneration is intended once per day along with food preparation therefore we seeked to meet the requirements for household water treatment and safe storage already in the design phase in this way this gdm teb tsa process is able to contribute to safeguarding the access to improved drinking water sources for more than 884 million people around the world united nations development programme 2019 by providing a self sustaining versatile and robust process for people purifying water at household level 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials 3 amino 1 2 4 triazole hereafter called

i diagram of the process with its two operational steps a production and b regeneration the main components are the combined membrane adsorber module fig 1c and the pressure vessel the former was built from alloyed stainless steel x6crnimoti17 12 2 and incorporated three ultrafiltration membranes total surface area a 0 49 m 2 operated in parallel and dead end mode as well as an gac adsorber column bed volume bv 119 ml h d 3 2 m gac 69 g these dimensions were selected to yield a comparable empty bed contact time ebct of 1 35 min as in our previous study 1 56 min in aumeier et al 2019 employing the design flowrate of 5 3 l h 1 the remaining void space of the adsorber column was filled with inert glass beads bv 51 ml d beads 2 mm m beads 83 g the pressure vessel was a commercial pressure cooker popular pressure cooker 12 l from ttk prestige ltd india it was made of aluminum and equipped with a pressure relief valve v5 blowing off at 1 barg this gauge pressure is the design backwash pressure of teb and it corresponds to a boiling temperature t b 120 c which drives the desorption of tsa during the regeneration step the pressure cooker was placed on an electrical heating plate power demand p e l 1 5 kw from fig 1 one can derive the water mass balance for production 1 m w f feed in m w p product out and for regeneration 2 m w r e g regeneration feed in m w r residue out m w w waste out m w e evaporation loss out here the regeneration feed reg is a fraction of the product the residue r remains in the pressure cooker after the regeneration step based on these quantities we define the following water recoveries 3 φ set m w p m w w m w f 4 φ eff 1 m w p m w w m w e m w f and 5 φ eff 2 m w p m w w m w e m w r m w f the two effective water recoveries φ eff 1 and φ eff 2 are a measure for the regeneration efficiency and overall water productivity respectively 2 4 production and regeneration procedure cyclic operation was conducted to test the performance of the prototype one cycle consisted of a production step and a regeneration step the production was executed by gravity driven filtration with a hydrostatic head of 1 2 m fig 1a feeding water that is characterized in section 2 2 each production step at ambient temperature lasted until 7 0 kg of product m w p were collected feed temperature t f was 20 c during tw gw and rw phases and 15 c during ww phase at the same time feed valve v3 product valve v4 and pressure relief valve v5 remained open closed and open respectively in each regeneration step a fraction of the product water was employed as regeneration feed m w r e g m w w m w e m w r the pressure cooker was closed and heated on the heating plate until the starting condition p 2 0 85 barg t b 118 c was reached except for φ set 92 5 in rw phase cycle 13 16 p 2 0 75 barg during gw phase and rw phase cycles 1 2 we allowed one previous pressure relief by v5 to approach pure water vapor atmosphere whereas we omitted previous pressure reliefs in later rw and ww phase to maximize the water recovery when the starting condition was reached we opened the backwash valve v3 until the set amount of waste m w w from eq 3 was collected in the waste receiver the residue in the pressure cooker m w r and evaporation losses m w e resulted accordingly afterwards the system cooled down and a subsequent cycle was started the next day 2 5 process optimization two different types of measures were conducted to optimize the process on process design and operational level respectively on the design level the safety margin assuring that only liquid water is fed during teb was reduced from 1 5 to 0 25 kg successively during gw and rw phases table s2 since product water is fed during teb this measure maximizes the water recovery and approaches the effective water recovery φ eff 2 to the set water recovery φ set furthermore we adopted a de aeration method during the commissioning to remove eventually entrapped air bubbles from the membrane module which can be simplified in future designs therefore we connected the membrane compartment of the module by passed adsorber to a pressure tank and flushed out air bubbles drop by drop with tap water this de aeration method was typically employed when the operational conditions set water recovery were changed table s2 as described below on the operational level however we performed an optimization of the set water recovery versus removal of the target compound amitrole the removal of a given compound r i is defined as 6 r i 1 c i p c i f where c i p and c i f are the compound concentrations in the product and feed respectively this operational optimization was done without gw and with significant organic background rw respectively the following set water recoveries φ set were investigated in the order specified 55 70 85 92 5 and 55 rpt repeated the two latter ones were only investigated during rw phase φ set 92 5 in order to analyze the sensitivity of amitrole breakthrough removal and φ set 55 rpt in order to check for hysteresis when operating with significant organic background this hysteresis may arise due to progressing organic fouling of the membrane or increasing adsorber loading respectively each set water recovery condition was at least operated for four consecutive cycles so that the system could approach cyclic steady state 2 6 sampling and water analysis we took mixed samples from all streams in each cycle feed f product p residue r waste w fig 1 sampling from feed and product was done directly after the production step whereas sampling from residue and waste was done after the system cooled down the following parameters were quantified in order to evaluate the process performance amitrole via high performance liquid chromatography

cycle 3 and 4 respectively samples of feed product residue and waste were cooled to 4 c and filtered through a 12 μ m glass fiber filter mn gf 1 macherey nagel germany one process control was included

cell toxicity of extracts was evaluated using the mtt 3 4 5 dimethylthiazol 2 yl 2 5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide a tetrazole assay where all extracts had no effect on cell viability the erα calux and the ames assay were performed according to the respective guidelines iso 19040 3 2018 iso 11350 2012 the final solvent concentration for the mtt and erα calux was 0 1 dmso and for the ames assay 2 dmso in all assays the samples were measured in a geometric dilution and the respective solvent and process controls as well as respective standards were included at least three independent biological

software toxrat toxrat solutions gmbh alsdorf germany 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane performance during production and regeneration flowrates and turbidity removal the average production flowrate decreased from cycle to cycle before it stabilized around 5 kg h 1 fig 2 a within one production step the flowrate was almost constant fig 2c the slight concave bending correlated well with the decreasing hydrostatic pressure head thus the membrane permeability was constant within each cycle note that the pressure drop over the adsorber is negligible during production see pressure drops during teb for comparison in fig 2d the decrease of average production flowrate over multiple cycles was thus attributed to entrapped air inside the membrane module rather than to fouling irrespectively of whether the fouling was colloidal fouling organic fouling biofouling or scaling this development turned out to be not fully reversible by use of teb in order to estimate the achievable bubble point to flush out entrapped air we used the laplace equation 7 δ p 4 γ cos θ d pore with the bubble point pressure δ p the surface tension γ the vapor liquid contact angle θ 0 and thus cos θ 1 and the pore diameter d pore inserting d pore f mwco 9 13 nm sarbolouki 1982 and γ f t vargaftik et al 1983 the bubble point pressure δ p was estimated to be 216 308 and 165 235 barg for 20 and 118 c respectively hence these teb conditions are far from overcoming the bubble point pressure accordingly only water in liquid state is expected to permeate as we already proposed earlier aumeier et al 2018 consequently entrapped air bubbles cannot permeate the membrane and thus cannot be flushed out by teb therefore we implemented a de aeration method after commissioning tw phase which was able to recover the production flowrate this de aeration method had a varying effect on the production flowrate of the subsequent cycle cf de aeration before gw cycles 1 2 rw cycle 1 9 13 17 and ww cycle 1 fig 2a on the contrary the teb flowrate as well as the permeability during teb both did not depend on the preceding cycles fig 2a but both correlated with the regeneration feed m w reg as well as with the water productivity φ eff 2 fig s4 teb flowrate increased with decreasing regeneration feed m w reg and with increasing water productivity φ eff 2 respectively we also derived this correlation m teb m w w m w e f m w reg theoretically supporting information section s3 fig 2d shows that the mass loss by evaporation m w e typically accounted for only 10 of the collected waste mass m w w we systematically reduced the safety margin stepwise down to 0 25 kg which was sufficient to account for the evaporation loss m w e but left a minimum residue m w r with this the effective water recovery φ eff 2 could be maximized to approach the set water recovery φ set the remaining deviation δ φ was only 4 moreover the flux during teb seemed to be evenly distributed over the 3 85 membrane channels there were no dead or lost channels at the center of the multichannel membrane as it can be seen indirectly by the color change at the end cap of the module fig s5d the even flow distribution during the teb may be directly measured by i e flow velocimetry of magnetic resonance imaging wypysek et al 2019 turbidity removal was the most sensitive membrane related parameter for this type of membrane toc removal from river water may be as low as 10 aumeier et al 2018 all product turbidities were 0 24 ntu except for one outlier in rw cycle 20 and thus independent from the feed turbidity fig 2b only rw phase rainy conditions challenged the membrane significantly with feed turbidity 1 ntu resulting in a removal of 96 2 n 12 therefore we concluded that the membrane integrity was assured at all times after we have replaced the adsorber bed before the tw and the ww phase the product turbidity was slightly elevated which supposedly resulted from washout of fine carbon particles however there was a slight but steady increase in product turbidity during continuous operation gw and rw phase we attributed this observation to flushed out colloidal precipitated organics from the previous regeneration step cf section 3 2 3 washout of fine activated carbon particles was supposedly negligible since the overall mass loss determined over tw gw and rw phases was δ m gac m gac 0 1 3 2 adsorber performance trade off between water recovery and amitrole removal regarding the process optimization on operational level we focused on the removal of amitrole and doc and their competition as a function of water recovery during gw and rw phase in order to structure these highly interlinked results we will first focus on the stable and steady operation of the adsorber in section 3 2 1 in section 3 2 2 the mechanism of adsorptive competition between amitrole and organic matter will be assessed finally we will conclude this part with discussing the fate of organics nutrients and change in ionic composition section 3 2 3 3 2 1 cyclic steady state and focus on amitrole the adsorber performance is depicted in fig 3 the evolution of the loading of gac with amitrole fig 3a gives an overview about the state and dynamics of the adsorber the comparison of consecutive cycles provides insight into the dynamics and can be used to evaluate whether the cyclic steady state is reached in this study the cyclic steady state is defined as constant gac loading with amitrole in three consecutive cycles based on this definition the cyclic steady state seemed to be completely reached for each set water recovery condition until rw phase φ set 70 rw cycle 8 afterwards the cyclic steady state was not reached 85 and 92 5 and was almost reached 55 rpt the amitrole removal r a m i decreased strongly with increasing effective water recovery φ eff 1 fig 3b which describes their trade off behavior for φ set 85 the product concentration of amitrole was even below loq and the removal reached r a m i 97 gray symbols in fig 3b most importantly also at relatively high water recovery φ set 85 the amitrole removal was r a m i 91 concentration factor c p c f 0 09 during both gw and rw phase this high removal demonstrates the technical feasibility of the tsa process and the successful scale up with very similar performance as compared to our previous study aumeier et al 2019 apart from that the most sensitive parameter was the waste mass mami w as a function of the regeneration conditions fig 3c for increasing water recovery during rw phase mami w distinctly approached zero because the amount of flushed out water mw w became very small hence this trend also illustrates the trade off between water recovery and amitrole adsorption desorption last but not least we analyzed the residual of the amitrole mass balance ε a m i in more detail a residual of the mass balance for amitrole ε a m i and for any other compound ε i being theoretically zero basically corresponds to the above mentioned cyclic steady state definition 8 ε i residual m i f feed in m i p product out m i r e g regeneration feed in m i r residue out m i w waste out the residual ε a m i can include both cumulative measurement errors as well as actually accumulated amitrole on the activated carbon the term m i p m i r e g represents the net product during gw phase for instance we attributed the residual ε a m i to measurement uncertainty in case of φ set 85 and to amitrole accumulation in case of φ set 55 in line with the comparison of consecutive adsorption cycles above the residual ε a m i indicated that the cyclic steady state was not yet reached 85 and 92 5 ε a m i 0 within four cycles each during rw phase however when returning to φ set 55 rpt ε a m i was slightly negative or zero within the given uncertainty moreover the waste mass mami w fig 3c and the removal r a m i fig 3b recovered both their previous values this absence of hysteresis proves the reversible character of amitrole adsorption and overall stable operation even in the presence of competing organic background 3 2 2 competition between amitrole and organic matter adsorption as opposed to amitrole the organic matter measured as doc broke through the adsorber under all rw conditions fig 3b and exhibited significantly lower removal r d o c 53 78 c p c f 0 22 0 47 the lc ocd ond data table s4 was not consistent in terms of fraction wise removal thus we could not confirm that breakthrough of organics depended on its fractions as opposed to jamil et al 2019 nevertheless we suppose that the fast diffusive transport of small amitrole molecules mw 84 g mol 1 as compared to rather large and thus slow organic matter humic substances and biopolymers mw 10 3 10 4 g mol 1 was responsible for preferred amitrole removal since the ebct was rather low it should be noted here that the amitrole removal itself seemingly did not depend on the ebct ranging from 0 94 to 2 11 min during rw phase preferred amitrole removal could also be explained by steric hindrance of larger doc fractions and thus reduced pore accessibility of doc hu et al 2014 in contrast to amitrole the doc removal was not fully reversible and exhibited a slight hysteresis suggesting that the cyclic steady state for bulk doc was not yet reached fig 3b of course the competition of amitrole with other organics lead to a reduced amitrole removal fig 3b which becomes evident when comparing gw with rw phase yet this competition was of the same nature but significantly less pronounced as reported by hu et al 2014 this difference might arise from adsorption kinetics since we conducted dynamic experiments and they performed batch equilibrium experiments finally the mass balance for doc revealed the same qualitative trends as for amitrole regarding the trade off between maximum removal versus maximum water recovery fig 3d it has to be taken into account that doc results bear a higher uncertainty because only the last cycle of each condition was sampled and analyzed thus no measurement errors are depicted for all set water recoveries the real residual may even be closer to zero than the calculated residual ε d o c since biomass is already about to be degraded at these hydrothermal conditions li et al 2019 this beneficial degradation and follow up precipitation of organic matter presumably lead to the slight increase in turbidity as discussed above 3 2 3 fate of organics nutrients and ionic composition we used the lc ocd ond data to get in depth information about the organic composition the lc ocd signal fig 4 was in good agreement with the doc data 8 direct comparison of rw and ww phases however is limited because sampling took place during rainy rw and dry weather ww respectively in both cases biopolymers accumulated in the waste thus the results confirm our previous findings aumeier et al 2018 analysis of the ammonium rw phase and nitrate ww phase data revealed concentration factors c p c f 0 06 and 0 36 respectively and c w c f 4 19 and 2 11 respectively table s4 these concentration factors for ammonium and nitrate coincided with the concentration factors for amitrole section 3 2 1 and aumeier et al 2019 and doc section 3 2 2 respectively given the same set water recovery the moderate to good removal c p c f and good enrichment c w c f by lc ond suggest temperature dependent ion exchange equilibria however it has to be kept in mind that this data is just indicative this promising phenomenon has to be investigated in more detail in future studies with regard to an exploitable temperature swing process for nutrients this process could possibly be applied for ammonium and or nitrate based fertilizer recovery directly from waste or process water or it could be transferred to other global water challenges such as arsenic and fluoride removal from ground water for drinking water purification in this study the ionic composition was assessed by cation chromatography table s3 the production step did not alter the ionic composition significantly but after temperature exposure a diverging behavior of monovalent and bivalent cations became apparent monovalent cations possibly were enriched c w c f monovalents 1 18 0 20 n 6 whereas bivalent cations were significantly depleted c w c f bivalents 0 69 0 10 n 6 this hardness reduction was attributed to temperature induced precipitation of caco3 on the external module surface as identified by x ray diffraction fig s1 concerning the increase of monovalent ion concentration we suggest a reciprocal ion exchange process inside the adsorber rather than a direct consequence of the temperature exposure because of the non significant change from product to residue c r c p monovalents 0 98 0 15 n 6 3 3 consideration of the produced waste and the specific energy demand the process produced two different waste streams the residue remaining in the pressure cooker after the regeneration step and the waste the former always had concentrations of amitrole and doc ranging between those in the product and waste respectively c i p c i r c i w except for at φ set 92 5 during rw phase where the residue concentrations of amitrole and doc even exceeded those in the waste since the amount of residue was small and systematically reduced cf section 3 1 this stream can be neglected in practice its amitrole mass was negligible fig 3c therefore it could be mixed with the waste or even with the product to simplify operation as much as possible the waste however contained the major mass flow of amitrole and doc respectively fig 3c and d either one evaporates the complete waste stream and disposes of the solid waste little additional energy input would be required because the waste stream was flushed out as vapor liquid mixture at 100 c we only re condensed it for proper analysis or one discharges this stream into the environment because at household level adverse environmental impact may be considered within tolerable limits because during the ww phase the estrogenic activity in the waste stream was still one order of magnitude below the predicted no effect concentration pnec caldwell et al 2012 to estimate the specific energy demand e we assumed a water recovery φ eff 2 80 and absence of energy recovery 9 e 1 φ eff 2 φ eff 2 c p t b t f δ v a p h 1 0 8 0 8 4 186 kj kg 1 k 1 98 k 2257 kj kg 1 667 kj kg 1 0 19 kwh m 3 with the heat capacity c p the boiling temperature t b the feed temperature t f and the evaporation enthalpy δ v a p h the operational cost would ultimately depend on the type power efficiency and specific cost of the employed fuel the optimal situation is when waste heat can be utilized to power the regeneration step it can be expected that the specific energy demand will be the major driver for the operational cost 3 4 ecotoxicological endpoints assessing environmentally relevant concentrations after optimizing the process with high pesticide concentrations in the feed it was a crucial step to validate the process performance also using environmentally relevant concentrations because of their good correlation with chemical trace analysis and high sensitivity in vitro bioassays were employed during the ww phase könemann et al 2018 first of all mutagenicity by the ames assay was not detected in any product sample table s5 however one feed sample extract revealed mutagenicity in both salmonella typhimurium strains ta 100 and ta 98 moreover mutagenicity was detected in one residue and the waste samples from both cycles with strain ta 98 after adding the s9 mixture which simulated metabolic activity similarly estrogenic activity was only quantifiable in the feed 0 24 0 05 ng eeq l 1 and waste samples 0 33 0 03 ng eeq l 1 using the erα calux assay whereas process control product samples as well as residue samples were all below the limit of quantification or detection fig 5 shows the detailed results of the erα calux assay however residue samples consisted of less sample volume and thus higher lod loq measured estrogenic activity of the feed samples agreed well with brückner et al 2018b reporting up to 0 5 ng eeq l 1 at the same sampling point during an extended monitoring campaign reported estradiol concentrations in wwtp effluents in germany and the uk may even be higher up to 21 ng l 1 and 1 80 ng l 1 respectively desbrow et al 1998 hillenbrand et al 2016 most importantly no estrogenic activity as well as no mutagenicity was detected in the product by the erα calux or ames assay respectively indicating that the water treatment process was able to effectively remove effect causing micropollutants from the feed also in case of an unfavorable ratio of micropollutant to bulk organics of 0 05 ng eeq mg doc furthermore the regeneration was effective in principle c r c f 1 76 and 1 11 for cycle 3 and 4 respectively however it remains an open question whether the regeneration was less effective as compared to the rw phase or whether the estrogenic activity were abated by the temperature exposure last but not least the removal of estrogenic activity r e e q 52 c p c f 0 48 ww cycle 3 and 65 c p c f 0 35 ww cycle 4 was consistent with the amitrole removal r a m i measured at 4 10 7 times higher concentrations this finding further emphasizes the technical feasibility of the proposed solution under environmentally relevant conditions 4 conclusions and outlook in this study we demonstrated the technical feasibility of an unprecedented self sustaining off grid process for decentralized water treatment the proposed process successfully combines gravity driven membrane filtration gdm with the novel membrane cleaning method temperature enhanced backwash teb and the adsorbent regeneration method temperature swing adsorption tsa in the aqueous phase it only employs a hydrothermal solution a scale up to pilot scale for household water treatment 5 l h 1 was realized membrane area 200 adsorber column 20 respectively as compared to our preceding studies during river water filtration the membrane flux stabilized at j 10 l m 2 h 1 for a hydrostatic pressure of 0 1 barg only by applying teb and de aeration the membrane removal performance was consistently yielding a product turbidity of 0 2 ntu which was decoupled from the feed turbidity we investigated the trade off between adsorptive removal and water recovery for different feed waters we identified the optimal operational condition at set water recovery φ set 85 and φ set 85 for feed water with low or high organic background respectively the combination of non target effect based methods and target hplc quantifications revealed the consistent adsorptive removal performance over pollutant concentrations spanning orders of magnitudes from micropollutants ng l 1 to bulk pollutants mg l 1 the gdm teb tsa process proved to be versatile and suited to purify both ground and surface water fulfilling the restrictions imposed by decentralized water treatment in remote areas therefore this household water treatment process is able to contribute to safeguarding the access to improved drinking water sources for more than 884

18313,decentralized drinking water purification complements water supply in areas with unreliable or absent infrastructure the exacerbating consequences of climate change in form of droughts and floods force remote households to tap various water sources hence household based processes must be versatile to cope with e g contaminated ground water and turbid surface waters purification at household level must be self sustaining in order to enable independence from continuous supply of power and consumables in this study we design a process accordingly and we prove its technical feasibility on pilot scale the two step process utilizes gravity driven ultrafiltration and activated carbon adsorption to purify water whereas the process regeneration is accomplished by combining temperature enhanced backwash and temperature swing adsorption to clean the membrane and adsorber respectively we obtained stable operation over 40 days with a sustained flowrate of 5 l h 1 and consistent product quality turbidity 0 2 ntu for all relevant water matrices synthetic ground water river water and even secondary effluent we achieved a high removal of the spiked model

centralized water treatment and distribution cannot supply drinking water to all people around the world since these complex systems cannot be installed and sustained under all boundary conditions larsen et al 2016 hence decentralized water treatment inevitably complements supply of safe water in areas with unreliable or absent infrastructure unicef and who recommend household also called point of use pou water treatment and safe storage because it is cost effective in improving public health reliable and in principle all purpose clasen et al 2007 unicef and who 2009 consequently the importance of such resilient systems in emergency situations such as droughts and floods is undoubted now ray and jain 2014 p 179 elliott et al 2019 and is likely to amplify in the future in view of the progressing climate change that will cause exacerbating weather extremes cohen et al 2014 francis and vavrus 2015 accompanied by outbreaks of waterborne diseases cann et al 2013 however there is a number of requirements that must be fulfilled for continuous operation and service sobsey et al 2008 peter varbanets et al 2009 aumeier et al 2017 first pou technologies depend on crucial supply routes for spare parts consumables such as chemicals or cleaning agents and most notably power ray and jain 2014 p 179 hence supplies must be as minimal as possible second system operation must be as easy as possible since skilled personnel is lacking third maintenance must be minimal and as easy as possible to minimize abandonment of the system fourth many households depend on various water sources with varying water quality to supply enough water at all times throughout the year ray and jain 2014 p 178 elliott et al 2017 foster and hope 2017 luetkemeier and liehr 2018 thus drinking water production must be versatile and possible from both ground water during droughts and river surface water during floods elliott et al 2019 highlighted and emphasized that multiple water source use is still inadequately addressed but eminent for these households at the moment commercial and researched systems suffer from various specific shortcomings as described by sobsey et al 2008 peter varbanets et al 2009 ray and jain 2014 and pooi and ng 2018 for instance only partial compliance with the aforementioned requirements therefore shannon et al 2008 highlighted the need for developing new household water treatment processes in this study we demonstrate the technical feasibility of a novel process that was specifically designed to meet the requirements named above in particular we demonstrate the stable operation of this process for divers feed waters that represent different operational environments and situations moreover we conduct an operational optimization to adapt the process to these different environments the presented process consists of two steps water purification and process regeneration the water purification step includes gravity driven membrane filtration gdm and adsorption on granular activated carbon this step is equivalent to other comparable systems such as proposed by peter varbanets et al 2010 frechen et al 2011 and oka et al 2017 or commercial products as reviewed by ray and jain 2014 chapter 5 and pooi and ng 2018 the process regeneration step represents the novelty of this study this regeneration step cleans the fouled membrane by so called temperature enhanced backwash teb and at the same time it regenerates the loaded exhausted adsorber by aqueous phase temperature swing adsorption tsa we have introduced and described the individual teb and tsa processes earlier aumeier et al 2018 2019 in this study we combined them scaled them up and integrated them into one process for the first time in the regeneration step the combined membrane adsorber module is placed and heated in a pressure vessel to few atmospheres gauge pressure and corresponding elevated boiling temperature by means of any low grade heat source then the gauge pressure is the main driving force to backwash the membrane teb with this hydrothermal solution whereas the elevated temperature drives desorption and regeneration of the adsorber tsa since the pressure vessel represents also the product storage tank re contamination is prevented effectively by these sterilization conditions as also applied in commercial autoclaves 20 min 121 c cf chmiel 2011 p 240 regeneration is intended once per day along with food preparation therefore we seeked to meet the requirements for household water treatment and safe storage already in the design phase in this way this gdm teb tsa process is able to contribute to safeguarding the access to improved drinking water sources for more than 884 million people around the world united nations development

characteristics rw and ww parameters were in good agreement with the monitoring program of the project demo3ac brückner et al 2018a brückner 2019 2 3 process design and dimensioning fig 1 shows the p i diagram of the process with its two operational steps a production and b regeneration the main components are the combined membrane adsorber module fig 1c and the pressure vessel the former was built from alloyed stainless steel x6crnimoti17 12 2 and incorporated three ultrafiltration membranes total surface area a 0 49 m 2 operated in parallel and dead end mode as well as an gac adsorber column bed volume bv 119 ml h d 3 2 m gac 69 g these dimensions were selected to yield a comparable empty bed contact time ebct of 1 35 min as in our previous study 1 56 min in aumeier et al 2019 employing the design flowrate of 5 3 l h 1 the remaining void space of the adsorber column was filled with inert glass beads bv 51 ml d beads 2 mm m beads 83 g the pressure vessel was a commercial pressure cooker popular pressure cooker 12 l from ttk prestige ltd india it was made of aluminum and equipped with a pressure relief valve v5 blowing off at 1 barg this gauge pressure is the design backwash pressure of teb and it corresponds to a boiling temperature t b 120 c which drives the desorption of tsa during the regeneration step the pressure cooker was placed on an electrical heating plate power demand p e l 1 5 kw from fig 1 one can derive the water mass balance for production 1 m w f feed in m w p product out and for regeneration 2 m w r e g regeneration feed in m w r residue out m w w waste out m w e evaporation loss out here the regeneration feed reg is a fraction of the product the residue r remains in the pressure cooker after the regeneration step based on these quantities we define the following water recoveries 3 φ set m w p m w w m w f 4 φ eff 1 m w p m w w m w e m w f and 5 φ eff 2 m w p m w w m w e m w r m w f the two effective water recoveries φ eff 1 and φ eff 2 are a measure for the regeneration efficiency and overall water productivity respectively 2 4 production and regeneration procedure cyclic operation was conducted to test the performance of the prototype one cycle consisted of a production step and a regeneration step the production was executed by gravity driven filtration with a hydrostatic head of 1 2 m fig 1a feeding water that is characterized in section 2 2 each production step at ambient temperature lasted until 7 0 kg of product m w p were collected feed temperature t f was 20 c during tw gw and rw phases and 15 c during ww phase at the same time feed valve v3 product valve v4 and pressure relief valve v5 remained open closed and open respectively in each regeneration step a fraction of the product water was employed as regeneration feed m w r e g m w w m w e m w r the pressure cooker was closed and heated on the heating plate until the starting condition p 2 0 85 barg t b 118 c was reached except for φ set 92 5 in rw phase cycle 13 16 p 2 0 75 barg during gw phase and rw phase cycles 1 2 we allowed one previous pressure relief by v5 to approach pure water vapor atmosphere whereas we omitted previous pressure reliefs in later rw and ww phase to maximize the water recovery when the starting condition was reached we opened the backwash valve v3 until the set amount of waste m w w from eq 3 was collected in the waste receiver the residue in the pressure cooker m w r and evaporation losses m w e resulted accordingly afterwards the system cooled down and a subsequent cycle was started the next day 2 5 process optimization two different types of measures were conducted to optimize the process on process design and operational level respectively on the design level the safety margin assuring that only liquid water is fed during teb was reduced from 1 5 to 0 25 kg successively during gw and rw phases table s2 since product water is fed during teb this measure maximizes the water recovery and approaches the effective water recovery φ eff 2 to the set water recovery φ set furthermore we adopted a de aeration method during the commissioning to remove eventually entrapped air bubbles from the membrane module which can be simplified in future designs therefore we connected the membrane compartment of the module by passed adsorber to a pressure tank and flushed out air bubbles drop by drop with tap water this de aeration method was typically employed when the operational conditions set water recovery were changed table s2 as described below on the operational level however we performed an optimization of the set water recovery versus removal of the target compound amitrole the removal of a given compound r i is defined as 6 r i 1 c i p c i f where c i p and c i f are the compound concentrations in the product and feed respectively this operational optimization was done without gw and with significant organic background rw respectively the following set water recoveries φ set were investigated in the order specified 55 70 85 92 5 and 55 rpt repeated the two latter ones were only investigated during rw phase φ set 92 5 in order to analyze the sensitivity of amitrole breakthrough removal and φ set 55 rpt in order to check for hysteresis when operating with significant organic background this hysteresis may arise due to progressing organic fouling of the membrane or increasing adsorber loading respectively each set water recovery condition was at least operated for four consecutive cycles so that the system could approach cyclic steady state 2 6 sampling and water analysis we took mixed samples from all streams in each cycle feed f product p residue r waste w fig 1 sampling from feed and product was done directly after the production step whereas sampling from residue and waste was done after the system cooled down the following parameters were quantified in order to evaluate the process performance amitrole via high performance liquid chromatography

cell toxicity of extracts was evaluated using the mtt 3 4 5 dimethylthiazol 2 yl 2 5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide a tetrazole assay where all extracts had no effect on cell viability the erα calux and the ames assay were performed according to the respective guidelines iso 19040 3 2018 iso 11350 2012 the final solvent concentration for the mtt and erα calux was 0 1 dmso and for the ames assay 2 dmso in all assays the samples were measured in a geometric dilution and the respective solvent and process controls as well as respective standards were included at least three independent biological

software toxrat toxrat solutions gmbh alsdorf germany 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane performance during production and regeneration flowrates and turbidity removal the average production flowrate decreased from cycle to cycle before it stabilized around 5 kg h 1 fig 2 a within one production step the flowrate was almost constant fig 2c the slight concave bending correlated well with the decreasing hydrostatic pressure head thus the membrane permeability was constant within each cycle note that the pressure drop over the adsorber is negligible during production see pressure drops during teb for comparison in fig 2d the decrease of average production flowrate over multiple cycles was thus attributed to entrapped air inside the membrane module rather than to fouling irrespectively of whether the fouling was colloidal fouling organic fouling biofouling or scaling this development turned out to be not fully reversible by use of teb in order to estimate the achievable bubble point to flush out entrapped air we used the laplace equation 7 δ p 4 γ cos θ d pore with the bubble point pressure δ p the surface tension γ the vapor liquid contact angle θ 0 and thus cos θ 1 and the pore diameter d pore inserting d pore f mwco 9 13 nm sarbolouki 1982 and γ f t vargaftik et al 1983 the bubble point pressure δ p was estimated to be 216 308 and 165 235 barg for 20 and 118 c respectively hence these teb conditions are far from overcoming the bubble point pressure accordingly only water in liquid state is expected to permeate as we already proposed earlier aumeier et al 2018 consequently entrapped air bubbles cannot permeate the membrane and thus cannot be flushed out by teb therefore we implemented a de aeration method after commissioning tw phase which was able to recover the production flowrate this de aeration method had a varying effect on the production flowrate of the subsequent cycle cf de aeration before gw cycles 1 2 rw cycle 1 9 13 17 and ww cycle 1 fig 2a on the contrary the teb flowrate as well as the permeability during teb both did not depend on the preceding cycles fig 2a but both correlated with the regeneration feed m w reg as well as with the water productivity φ eff 2 fig s4 teb flowrate increased with decreasing regeneration feed m w reg and with increasing water productivity φ eff 2 respectively we also derived this correlation m teb m w w m w e f m w reg theoretically supporting information section s3 fig 2d shows that the mass loss by evaporation m w e typically accounted for only 10 of the collected waste mass m w w we systematically reduced the safety margin stepwise down to 0 25 kg which was sufficient to account for the evaporation loss m w e but left a minimum residue m w r with this the effective water recovery φ eff 2 could be maximized to approach the set water recovery φ set the remaining deviation δ φ was only 4 moreover the flux during teb seemed to be evenly distributed over the 3 85 membrane channels there were no dead or lost channels at the center of the multichannel membrane as it can be seen indirectly by the color change at the end cap of the module fig s5d the even flow distribution during the teb may be directly measured by i e flow velocimetry of magnetic resonance imaging wypysek et al 2019 turbidity removal was the most sensitive membrane related parameter for this type of membrane toc removal from river water may be as low as 10 aumeier et al 2018 all product turbidities were 0 24 ntu except for one outlier in rw cycle 20 and thus independent from the feed turbidity fig 2b only rw phase rainy conditions challenged the membrane significantly with feed turbidity 1 ntu resulting in a removal of 96 2 n 12 therefore we concluded that the membrane integrity was assured at all times after we have replaced the adsorber bed before the tw and the ww phase the product turbidity was slightly elevated which supposedly resulted from washout of fine carbon particles however there was a slight but steady increase in product turbidity during continuous operation gw and rw phase we attributed this observation to flushed out colloidal precipitated organics from the previous regeneration step cf section 3 2 3 washout of fine activated carbon particles was supposedly negligible since the overall mass loss determined over tw gw and rw phases was δ m gac m gac 0 1 3 2 adsorber performance trade off between water recovery and amitrole removal regarding the process optimization on operational level we focused on the removal of amitrole and doc and their competition as a function of water recovery during gw and rw phase in order to structure these highly interlinked results we will first focus on the stable and steady operation of the adsorber in section 3 2 1 in section 3 2 2 the mechanism of adsorptive competition between amitrole and organic matter will be assessed finally we will conclude this part with discussing the fate of organics nutrients and change in ionic composition section 3 2 3 3 2 1 cyclic steady state and focus on amitrole the adsorber performance is depicted in fig 3 the evolution of the loading of gac with amitrole fig 3a gives an overview about the state and dynamics of the adsorber the comparison of consecutive cycles provides insight into the dynamics and can be used to evaluate whether the cyclic steady state is reached in this study the cyclic steady state is defined as constant gac loading with amitrole in three consecutive cycles based on this definition the cyclic steady state seemed to be completely reached for each set water recovery condition until rw phase φ set 70 rw cycle 8 afterwards the cyclic steady state was not reached 85 and 92 5 and was almost reached 55 rpt the amitrole removal r a m i decreased strongly with increasing effective water recovery φ eff 1 fig 3b which describes their trade off behavior for φ set 85 the product concentration of amitrole was even below loq and the removal reached r a m i 97 gray symbols in fig 3b most importantly also at relatively high water recovery φ set 85 the amitrole removal was r a m i 91 concentration factor c p c f 0 09 during both gw and rw phase this high removal demonstrates the technical feasibility of the tsa process and the successful scale up with very similar performance as compared to our previous study aumeier et al 2019 apart from that the most sensitive parameter was the waste mass mami w as a function of the regeneration conditions fig 3c for increasing water recovery during rw phase mami w distinctly approached zero because the amount of flushed out water mw w became very small hence this trend also illustrates the trade off between water recovery and amitrole adsorption desorption last but not least we analyzed the residual of the amitrole mass balance ε a m i in more detail a residual of the mass balance for amitrole ε a m i and for any other compound ε i being theoretically zero basically corresponds to the above mentioned cyclic steady state definition 8 ε i residual m i f feed in m i p product out m i r e g regeneration feed in m i r residue out m i w waste out the residual ε a m i can include both cumulative measurement errors as well as actually accumulated amitrole on the activated carbon the term m i p m i r e g represents the net product during gw phase for instance we attributed the residual ε a m i to measurement uncertainty in case of φ set 85 and to amitrole accumulation in case of φ set 55 in line with the comparison of consecutive adsorption cycles above the residual ε a m i indicated that the cyclic steady state was not yet reached 85 and 92 5 ε a m i 0 within four cycles each during rw phase however when returning to φ set 55 rpt ε a m i was slightly negative or zero within the given uncertainty moreover the waste mass mami w fig 3c and the removal r a m i fig 3b recovered both their previous values this absence of hysteresis proves the reversible character of amitrole adsorption and overall stable operation even in the presence of competing organic background 3 2 2 competition between amitrole and organic matter adsorption as opposed to amitrole the organic matter measured as doc broke through the adsorber under all rw conditions fig 3b and exhibited significantly lower removal r d o c 53 78 c p c f 0 22 0 47 the lc ocd ond data table s4 was not consistent in terms of fraction wise removal thus we could not confirm that breakthrough of organics depended on its fractions as opposed to jamil et al 2019 nevertheless we suppose that the fast diffusive transport of small amitrole molecules mw 84 g mol 1 as compared to rather large and thus slow organic matter humic substances and biopolymers mw 10 3 10 4 g mol 1 was responsible for preferred amitrole removal since the ebct was rather low it should be noted here that the amitrole removal itself seemingly did not depend on the ebct ranging from 0 94 to 2 11 min during rw phase preferred amitrole removal could also be explained by steric hindrance of larger doc fractions and thus reduced pore accessibility of doc hu et al 2014 in contrast to amitrole the doc removal was not fully reversible and exhibited a slight hysteresis suggesting that the cyclic steady state for bulk doc was not yet reached fig 3b of course the competition of amitrole with other organics lead to a reduced amitrole removal fig 3b which becomes evident when comparing gw with rw phase yet this competition was of the same nature but significantly less pronounced as reported by hu et al 2014 this difference might arise from adsorption kinetics since we conducted dynamic experiments and they performed batch equilibrium experiments finally the mass balance for doc revealed the same qualitative trends as for amitrole regarding the trade off between maximum removal versus maximum water recovery fig 3d it has to be taken into account that doc results bear a higher uncertainty because only the last cycle of each condition was sampled and analyzed thus no measurement errors are depicted for all set water recoveries the real residual may even be closer to zero than the calculated residual ε d o c since biomass is already about to be degraded at these hydrothermal conditions li et al 2019 this beneficial degradation and follow up precipitation of organic matter presumably lead to the slight increase in turbidity as discussed above 3 2 3 fate of organics nutrients and ionic composition we used the lc ocd ond data to get in depth information about the organic composition the lc ocd signal fig 4 was in good agreement with the doc data 8 direct comparison of rw and ww phases however is limited because sampling took place during rainy rw and dry weather ww respectively in both cases biopolymers accumulated in the waste thus the results confirm our previous findings aumeier et al 2018 analysis of the ammonium rw phase and nitrate ww phase data revealed concentration factors c p c f 0 06 and 0 36 respectively and c w c f 4 19 and 2 11 respectively table s4 these concentration factors for ammonium and nitrate coincided with the concentration factors for amitrole section 3 2 1 and aumeier et al 2019 and doc section 3 2 2 respectively given the same set water recovery the moderate to good removal c p c f and good enrichment c w c f by lc ond suggest temperature dependent ion exchange equilibria however it has to be kept in mind that this data is just indicative this promising phenomenon has to be investigated in more detail in future studies with regard to an exploitable temperature swing process for nutrients this process could possibly be applied for ammonium and or nitrate based fertilizer recovery directly from waste or process water or it could be transferred to other global water challenges such as arsenic and fluoride removal from ground water for drinking water purification in this study the ionic composition was assessed by cation chromatography table s3 the production step did not alter the ionic composition significantly but after temperature exposure a diverging behavior of monovalent and bivalent cations became apparent monovalent cations possibly were enriched c w c f monovalents 1 18 0 20 n 6 whereas bivalent cations were significantly depleted c w c f bivalents 0 69 0 10 n 6 this hardness reduction was attributed to temperature induced precipitation of caco3 on the external module surface as identified by x ray diffraction fig s1 concerning the increase of monovalent ion concentration we suggest a reciprocal ion exchange process inside the adsorber rather than a direct consequence of the temperature exposure because of the non significant change from product to residue c r c p monovalents 0 98 0 15 n 6 3 3 consideration of the produced waste and the specific energy demand the process produced two different waste streams the residue remaining in the pressure cooker after the regeneration step and the waste the former always had concentrations of amitrole and doc ranging between those in the product and waste respectively c i p c i r c i w except for at φ set 92 5 during rw phase where the residue concentrations of amitrole and doc even exceeded those in the waste since the amount of residue was small and systematically reduced cf section 3 1 this stream can be neglected in practice its amitrole mass was negligible fig 3c therefore it could be mixed with the waste or even with the product to simplify operation as much as possible the waste however contained the major mass flow of amitrole and doc respectively fig 3c and d either one evaporates the complete waste stream and disposes of the solid waste little additional energy input would be required because the waste stream was flushed out as vapor liquid mixture at 100 c we only re condensed it for proper analysis or one discharges this stream into the environment because at household level adverse environmental impact may be considered within tolerable limits because during the ww phase the estrogenic activity in the waste stream was still one order of magnitude below the predicted no effect concentration pnec caldwell et al 2012 to estimate the specific energy demand e we assumed a water recovery φ eff 2 80 and absence of energy recovery 9 e 1 φ eff 2 φ eff 2 c p t b t f δ v a p h 1 0 8 0 8 4 186 kj kg 1 k 1 98 k 2257 kj kg 1 667 kj kg 1 0 19 kwh m 3 with the heat capacity c p the boiling temperature t b the feed temperature t f and the evaporation enthalpy δ v a p h the operational cost would ultimately depend on the type power efficiency and specific cost of the employed fuel the optimal situation is when waste heat can be utilized to power the regeneration step it can be expected that the specific energy demand will be the major driver for the operational cost 3 4 ecotoxicological endpoints assessing environmentally relevant concentrations after optimizing the process with high pesticide concentrations in the feed it was a crucial step to validate the process performance also using environmentally relevant concentrations because of their good correlation with chemical trace analysis and high sensitivity in vitro bioassays were employed during the ww phase könemann et al 2018 first of all mutagenicity by the ames assay was not detected in any product sample table s5 however one feed sample extract revealed mutagenicity in both salmonella typhimurium strains ta 100 and ta 98 moreover mutagenicity was detected in one residue and the waste samples from both cycles with strain ta 98 after adding the s9 mixture which simulated metabolic activity similarly estrogenic activity was only quantifiable in the feed 0 24 0 05 ng eeq l 1 and waste samples 0 33 0 03 ng eeq l 1 using the erα calux assay whereas process control product samples as well as residue samples were all below the limit of quantification or detection fig 5 shows the detailed results of the erα calux assay however residue samples consisted of less sample volume and thus higher lod loq measured estrogenic activity of the feed samples agreed well with brückner et al 2018b reporting up to 0 5 ng eeq l 1 at the same sampling point during an extended monitoring campaign reported estradiol concentrations in wwtp effluents in germany and the uk may even be higher up to 21 ng l 1 and 1 80 ng l 1 respectively desbrow et al 1998 hillenbrand et al 2016 most importantly no estrogenic activity as well as no mutagenicity was detected in the product by the erα calux or ames assay respectively indicating that the water treatment process was able to effectively remove effect causing micropollutants from the feed also in case of an unfavorable ratio of micropollutant to bulk organics of 0 05 ng eeq mg doc furthermore the regeneration was effective in principle c r c f 1 76 and 1 11 for cycle 3 and 4 respectively however it remains an open question whether the regeneration was less effective as compared to the rw phase or whether the estrogenic activity were abated by the temperature exposure last but not least the removal of estrogenic activity r e e q 52 c p c f 0 48 ww cycle 3 and 65 c p c f 0 35 ww cycle 4 was consistent with the amitrole removal r a m i measured at 4 10 7 times higher concentrations this finding further emphasizes the technical feasibility of the proposed solution under environmentally relevant conditions 4 conclusions and outlook in this study we demonstrated the technical feasibility of an unprecedented self sustaining off grid process for decentralized water treatment the proposed process successfully combines gravity driven membrane filtration gdm with the novel membrane cleaning method temperature enhanced backwash teb and the adsorbent regeneration method temperature swing adsorption tsa in the aqueous phase it only employs a hydrothermal solution a scale up to pilot scale for household water treatment 5 l h 1 was realized membrane area 200 adsorber column 20 respectively as compared to our preceding studies during river water filtration the membrane flux stabilized at j 10 l m 2 h 1 for a hydrostatic pressure of 0 1 barg only by applying teb and de aeration the membrane removal performance was consistently yielding a product turbidity of 0 2 ntu which was decoupled from the feed turbidity we investigated the trade off between adsorptive removal and water recovery for different feed waters we identified the optimal operational condition at set water recovery φ set 85 and φ set 85 for feed water with low or high organic background respectively the combination of non target effect based methods and target hplc quantifications revealed the consistent adsorptive removal performance over pollutant concentrations spanning orders of magnitudes from micropollutants ng l 1 to bulk pollutants mg l 1 the gdm teb tsa process proved to be versatile and suited to purify both ground and surface water fulfilling the restrictions imposed by decentralized water treatment in remote areas therefore this household water treatment process is able to contribute to safeguarding the access to improved drinking water sources for more than 884

18314,past research on ags aerobic granular sludge technology has mainly focused on macro environment factors such as settling time feeding pattern olr organic loading rate srt sludge retention time among others and their effects on the granulation process the biomass granulation process however is significantly affected by the micro environment surrounding these biomass aggregates in this research an in silico computational approach was adopted to study the impact of the micro environment on the biomass granulation process a 2 d biofilm model based on the cellular automata algorithm and computational fluid dynamics was used to simulate the development of an individual biomass aggregate under specific hydrodynamic and substrate availability conditions the simulation results indicated that shear and bulk substrate concentration combined to create the optimal conditions for aerobic granule formation this process can be characterized by the rt reversed thiele modulus value which is the ratio of the maximum substrate transport over the maximum substrate reaction rate and an indicator of substrate availability for ags formation the rt value should be greater than 0 1 many common strategies such as the application of batch reactors selection for slow growing microorganism f m food mass ratio adjustment feast and famine condition and short settling time for biomass granulation production can be explained by the rt value the results suggest that rethinking unit process configurations in wastewater treatment facilities will be required to achieve reliable ags formation graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerobic granular sludge computational fluid dynamics substrate transport activated sludge biofilm modelling 1 introduction because of its many advantages ags aerobic granular sludge technology for wastewater treatment has been the subject of increasing research focus in the past two decades beun et al 1999 franca et al 2018 in ags systems the biomass aggregate into self immobilized large dense granules with sizes between 200 and 2000 μm beun et al 2002 while in cas conventional activated sludge the biomass forms smaller flocs aerobic granules settle faster than cas flocs allowing for more efficient settling higher treatment efficiency and compact plant design moreover the stratified layers of aerobic anoxic and anaerobic conditions in the radial direction of the granules allow for potential simultaneous removal of organic material nitrogen and phosphorous de kreuk et al 2005 while past research has revealed operational conditions associated with granular sludge formation the mechanisms involved in their formation and disintegration are still not fully understood nancharaiah and reddy 2018 among many factors the selective pressure from the short settling time in sbrs sequencing batch reactors hydrodynamic shear force feeding pattern i e feast famine cycle anaerobic feeding f m food to mass ratio substrate type and concentration olr organic loading rate srt sludge retention time and do dissolved oxygen concentration have been considered the primary factors for granule formation and disintegration nancharaiah and reddy 2018 in addition concerns with the long startup period for full scale treatment pronk et al 2015 and long term granule stability still hinder the wide application of ags technology franca et al 2018 finally the formation of ags primarily in sbrs has also prevented the incorporation of ags technology in wastewater treatment as these systems are not easily applied in continuous flow wastewater treatment facilities kent et al 2018 many of these factors influencing biomass granulation deal with the macro environment at the reactor scale yet it is the micro environment surrounding the single biomass aggregates that determines the biomass granulation process and many mechanistic models for biomass granulation i e inert nuclei model selection pressure model multi valence positive ion bonding model etc were developed on the micro scale liu et al 2003 while the macro environment affects the micro environment for the biomass aggregates the degree to which the macro environment affects this micro environment varies for example the hydrodynamic shear force imposed by the same aeration rate could cause entirely different micro environments for different reactor configurations the olr f m ratio and do could have different effects on the substrate concentrations at the micro scale for biomass aggregates of different sizes density viable biomass content and growth rate examining the individual micro environment for single biomass aggregates is very difficult to perform through laboratory experiments particle image velocimetry has been attempted to measure the flow velocity field in a fixed biofilm system stoodley et al 1994 however there are no experimental methods to characterize the flow condition around suspended growth granules some specific substrate concentrations i e do nitrite and nitrate within granules were measured using microelectrodes that are mounted on precisely controlled devices li and bishop 2004 unfortunately the obtrusive nature of using microelectrodes may affect the actual micro environment that influence substrate transport and the local cultivation of these biomass aggregates many of the factors involved in biomass granulation are indeed interrelated for example both the hydrodynamic shear force and substrate loading rate impact the substrate transport around the surface of the biomass aggregates liu and tay 2002 the two factors were not easily separable in this research an in silico computational approach was adopted to study the impact of the micro environment on the biomass granulation process a 2 d biofilm model based on the cellular automata algorithm and computational fluid dynamics was used to simulate the development of the individual biomass aggregate under specific substrate availability and hydrodynamic conditions the substrate availability was included as it directly affects the biomass growth rate the hydrodynamic condition could affect the transport of substrate to biomass along with the aggregate solids detachment process the simulation tools developed in this study are expected to assist experimental investigations and provide insight into the biomass aggregation process at the micro scale level in particular this paper aims to answer the following research questions 1 what favorable micro environments lead to the formation of granules i e how do the substrate concentration and hydrodynamic shear surrounding the biomass aggregates affect the granulation process 2 is there a unique combination of substrate concentration and hydrodynamic shear that determines the biomass granulation process 3 can these simulations explain the main experimental results i e why biomass granulation is more prevalent in sbrs than in continuous flow reactors 4 what are the possible operational strategies at the reactor macro level to achieve a favorable micro environment for the formation of ags 2 model description 2 1 model geometry and setup a two dimensional fem finite element model that includes biomass aggregate formation growth liquid flow soluble substrate transport both convective and diffusive biodegradation and detachment was developed a singular biomass aggregate was tracked in a rectangular flow field with a width and height of 20 mm and 15 mm respectively fig 1 the left and right edges of this flow field were defined as the inlet and outlet as shown in fig 1 the inlet liquid velocities were varied to study the effect of shear on biomass aggregation shear forces produced from varying the inlet liquid velocities ranged between 0 and 250 s 1 the top and bottom edges of the flow domain were defined as symmetrical boundaries to minimize the impact of rectangle height on the simulation results the simulated biomass aggregate was composed of multiple 10 10 μm computational cells a sensitivity analysis of the computational cell size was performed to confirm that the computational cell size has no significant impact on the simulation results in terms of the granule and floc morphology i e circularity results shown in the supplementary information si figs s1 and s2 the size and shape of the biomass aggregate were developed from the total number and the position of these cells which were determined through the cellular automata algorithms for biomass development described in section 2 4 the biomass aggregate was allowed to rotate in the flow field at 15 increments in each simulation interval to imitate the potential movement of biomass aggregates in the flow field the biomass aggregate was surrounded by a cbl concentration boundary layer and a hbl hydraulic boundary layer as suggested by bishop et al 1997 a schematic representation of the cbl and hbl is shown in fig s3 the cbl is a region above the biomass aggregate where the flow is assumed stagnant the hbl is a region in which the flow velocity reduces from the free stream velocity to zero at the top of cbl the border of the cbl was defined by a circle located at the centroid of the biomass aggregate the radius of the cbl circle is the sum of the radius of the minimum bounding circle for the biomass aggregate and the cbl thickness the hbl circle was the concentric circle of the cbl and had a radius that is the sum of cbl radius and hbl thickness according to experimental results from bishop et al 1997 the thickness of the cbl in μm depends on the flow velocity m s eq 1 while the thickness of the hbl equals 4 8 mm which was not affected by the biofilm roughness and only slightly influenced at different flow velocities bishop et al 1997 1 l c 200 800 e 200 v four distinct regions bulk liquid hbl cbl and biomass aggregates were modeled with different governing equations described in section 2 3 the bulk liquid was the area outside the hbl the mass transfer in the hbl was simulated by including advection and diffusion since the flow in the cbl is stagnant the mass transfer in the cbl was simulated by diffusion alone the substrate concentration inside the biomass aggregates was simulated by diffusion and reaction i e convective transport was not included wanner and morgenroth 2004 2 2 hydraulic modeling the water flow in the bulk liquid and hbl was simulated using the navier stokes equations assuming laminar flow the maximum inlet velocity was set to 0 05 m s the maximum re reynolds number was 500 assuming a water density 1000 kg m3 dynamic viscosity 0 001 pa s and water flow height 10 mm the inlet velocity varied between 0 and 0 05 m s which produced an average shear rate in the vicinity of a 0 5 mm diameter granule between 0 and 250 s 1 fig s4 a in the si displays the distribution of shear rate around the 0 5 mm granule with an inlet velocity of 0 05 m s fig s4 b shows the correlation between the inlet velocity and the average shear rate a no slip boundary condition was defined for the biomass aggregate surface and a zero pressure condition was adopted for the outlet of the hydraulic simulation domain the shear stress calculated from the hydraulic model was used to control the detachment of granules biomass detachment was initiated when the shear stress was higher than 0 5 pa stoodley et al 1999 the flow velocity was used to calculate the convective transport of the substrate within the hbl 2 3 soluble substrate mass balance the soluble substrate transport in the hbl was simulated using the convective and diffusive transport equation 2 s t d l 2 s u s where d l is the diffusion coefficient in the liquid u is the flow velocity calculated from the hydraulic modeling and s is the soluble substrate concentration the bulk liquid was assumed to be completely mixed the constant substrate concentration boundary condition was applied at the interface between the hbl and bulk liquid the soluble substrate mass balance in the biomass aggregates was simulated using the diffusion reaction equation 3 s t d b 2 s r s where d b is the diffusional coefficient in the biomass aggregates and r s is the bioreaction rate which can be expressed with eq 4 4 r s μ m a x h s s k s x where μ max h is the maximum specific biomass growth rate d 1 x is the biomass concentration mg l and ks is the substrate half saturation constant mg l in the asm activated sludge models several substrate limitation conditions were used for simplicity only one limiting substrate organic matter was used in this study the values of the model parameters used in eqs 2 4 were obtained from the literature table s1 in the si 2 4 development of the biomass aggregate a cellular automata algorithm was used for simulating the development of the biomass aggregate the increase in the biomass concentration δx was calculated incrementally at a simulation duration of 6 h δt using the following equation 5 δ x y h t t δ t r s where y h was the yield coefficient of biomass due to substrate consumption for simplicity biomass decay was ignored biomass was designed to spread from its starting location when the 10 10 μm cells split according to the ca cellular automata algorithm picioreanu et al 1998 an 8 neighbor cell filling rule was used in the ca algorithm the ca procedure consists of the following a if the biomass density in a cell reaches the critical density xc table s1 the biomass in the cell split into two equal parts one part stayed in the original cell the other half was placed randomly in one of the empty neighboring cells the biomass density in the two split cells was adjusted to half of the original cell b if none of the 8 neighboring cells was empty one of the 8 occupied cells was randomly chosen and the biomass inside the occupied cell was randomly displaced to one of its empty neighboring cells c if there were no empty neighboring cells from step b then step b was repeated until an empty cell was identified d the steps from a to c were executed repeatedly until the biomass density in all the cells was less than the critical density xc to examine the effect of simulation interval on the simulation results a sensitivity analysis was performed using the simulation interval of 1 2 4 6 and 12 h fig s5 in the si displays the derived granule images and circularities produced from simulations with different time intervals the results in fig s5 show that the simulation interval had no significant effect on the biomass aggregate morphology and circularity the detachment of biomass from the biomass aggregates was controlled by the shear stress calculated from the hydraulic model biomass detachment occurred when the surrounding shear stress exceeded 0 5 pa a value selected based on the measured biomass strength from stoodley et al 1999 2 5 model implementation the model was implemented in the matlab 8 4 and comsol multiphysics 5 2 environment the main script was written in matlab to 1 define the model parameters 2 call for the comsol solver 3 define the model geometry 4 solve the ca algorithm and 5 perform the biomass aggregates image analysis the comsol software was used to solve the hydraulic and substrate mass balance partial differential equation pdes the matlab and comsol software were integrated using the livelink feature of comsol for matlab to reduce the impact of selected kinetic parameters on the simulation result the bulk cod concentration was normalized to a minimum unit substrate s min defined by the following equation 6 s m i n k s μ m a x h the model was implemented in the following steps 1 the model parameters shown in table s1 were defined in matlab 2 one of the 10 10 μm cells was seeded with initial biomass concentration at 50 of the critical density i e 50 of x c the biomass aggregate progressively spreads from the center the initial seeding position 3 the geometries physics equations and initial conditions for the hydraulic modeling and substrate mass balance were defined in matlab and imported into comsol the initial velocity in the bulk liquid and the boundary layer was assumed to be zero the initial substrate concentration in all the domains was the same as the bulk substrate concentration 4 the hydraulic model and substrate mass balance were solved in comsol for the time interval of 6 h δt 5 the results from the comsol calculation in step 4 were exported to matlab and used to determine the biomass density if the resulting biomass specific density in certain cells was larger than one the cells were divided into two and spread according to the ca algorithm 6 the new biomass aggregate geometries were defined based on the result from step 5 the newly created biomass geometries were rotated 15 anti clockwise relative to the previous biomass geometries 7 steps 4 to 6 were repeated until biomass aggregate diameter of 0 7 mm was reached for the repeated simulations the previous result at the end of 6 h simulation was used as the initial condition for the next simulation the maximum mesh size for the bulk liquid and biomass aggregate was selected as 25 and 2 5 μm respectively fig s6 to examine the effect of rotation angle on the simulation results a sensitivity analysis was performed using the following rotation angles 10 20 30 40 and 50 fig s7 in the si displays the derived granule images and circularities produced from simulations with different rotation angles the results in fig s7 show that the rotation angle had no significant effect on the biomass aggregate morphology and circularity the biomass aggregates of different morphologies were produced by running the model at different shear and substrate concentration conditions 2 6 reversed thiele modulus the reversed thiele rt modulus defined by the ratio of the maximum substrate transport rate to the maximum substrate reaction rate was used to represent the condition for biomass aggregate formation 7 rt m a x i u

velocity and both the hbl and cbl thickness under a high flow velocity condition the substrate transport in the hbl is not a limiting factor the substrate transport was limited by the diffusion in the cbl on the other hand under a low flow velocity condition both the hbl and cbl substrate transport could become a limiting factor for the 2d simulation condition the maximum substrate transport rate in the cbl was calculated according to eq 8 fig s3 in si 8 m c b l 2 π r d c l c where r is the radius of biomass aggregate l c is the thickness of cbl c is the substrate concentration at the cbl

the calculated rt values under different biomass aggregate radii substrate concentrations and flow velocities fig s8 in si show that the rt value decreases with increasing biomass aggregate radius increases linearly with substrate concentration increases with shear values below 100 s 1 and stabilized for shear values 200 s 1 and higher 2 7 image analysis of the biomass aggregates the image analysis toolbox within the matlab software was used to measure the biomass aggregate s diameter and circularity the diameter was assumed to be the same as a bounding circle with the minimum diameter that covered all the biomass aggregate area the circularity i c was calculated using the following equation 11 i c 4 π a r e a p r i m e t e r 2 3 simulation results 3 1 simulation results at two typical conditions the biomass aggregate morphology produced under two different substrate concentrations and flow conditions is shown in fig 2 the flow velocity and the substrate concentration distribution fig 2 a and b respectively show that under the low inlet velocity 0 01 m s and average shear rate of 20 s 1 and low bulk substrate concentration defined as 50 s min the biomass aggregate had an irregular surface and low circularity fig 2 a b under high shear inlet velocity 0 05 m s and an average shear rate of 250 s 1 and high substrate concentration 300 s min condition the shape of the biomass aggregate was more circular and compact than the low shear and low substrate condition fig 2 c d the high flow velocity reduced the cbl thickness shown in the fig 2 c in comparison to the cbl shown in the fig 2 a the reduced cbl thickness and increased substrate concentration increased the substrate flux into the biomass aggregate 3 2 impact of shear and substrate concentration on the biomass aggregate morphology fig 3 a displays the morphology and circularity for biomass aggregate formed under the constant bulk substrate concentration of 200 s min and variable shear rate at 0 300 s 1 at the zero shear condition the biomass aggregate had an open finger like morphology that became more compact and circular with increasing shear rate the impact of bulk substrate concentration on the biomass aggregate morphology under the constant shear rate of 200 s 1 is shown in fig 3 b the increase in the substrate concentration from 50 to 600 s min led to more compact and circular biomass aggregates results in fig 3 suggest that at some limiting value either shear rate or bulk substrate concentration no significant change in the circularity was observed to investigate the combined impact of shear and substrate concentration on the biomass aggregate morphology a series of simulations were performed under shear rates between 0 and 250 s 1 and substrate concentrations between 50 and 600 s min the surface plot of the circularity from the simulations fig 3 c shows that under low substrate concentration i e less than 150 s min the circularity of biomass aggregates remained below 0 1 despite the variation of shear rate between 0 and 250 s 1 for substrate concentration higher than 500 s min the biomass aggregates circularity remained larger than 0 5 in other words the local shear has no impact on the biomass aggregate morphology for substrate concentrations less than 150 s min or higher than 500 s min for substrate concentrations between 150 and 500 s min increasing shear led to high biomass aggregate circularity high circularity is defined as values greater than 0 6 while low circularity is defined as values below 0 2 3 3 the effect of reversed thiele modulus on the biomass aggregate morphology fig 4 a displays the calculated rt values for different combinations of shear and bulk substrate concentration of a circular biomass aggregate with a diameter of 500 μm in fig 4 a the shape of the circularity curve as a function of the rt value was similar to the shear and substrate concentration effect shown in fig 3 c this result suggests that the rt value could be used as a universal dimensionless factor to determine the morphology of biomass aggregates at different shear rates and substrate concentrations the impact of rt values on biomass aggregates of 400 500 and 600 μm diameter fig 4 b show similar patterns regardless of the aggregate size the biomass aggregate circularity increased from 0 1 to 0 65 when the rt value increased from 0 02 to 0 1 and stabilized for rt value larger than 0 1 the simulation results indicate that the maximum substrate transport rate should be around 10 of the maximum substrate reaction rate to produce biomass aggregates of circularity near 0 65 the rt values shown in fig 4 b were calculated from various arbitrary combinations of shear and bulk substrate concentration this set of simulated experiments indicate that shear and bulk substrate concentration work in a unified way by controlling the substrate availability to affect the biomass aggregate morphology for granule formation to be achieved an rt value larger than 0 1 is necessary to understand how the biomass aggregate size affects its circularity the development of biomass aggregate size circularity and the rt value for the two simulation scenarios in fig 2 were performed and results are shown in fig 5 under the low substrate availability scenario the increase in the floc diameter coincided with a decrease in circularity and rt values fig 5 a under the high substrate availability scenario the circularity was stable despite the increase in granule diameter and decrease in rt value fig 5 b however the rt value in fig 5 b remained above 0 1 and supports the results in fig 4 that a high circularity could be achieved at or above this rt threshold value regardless of the biomass aggregate size this result suggests that the rt value and not the biomass aggregate size determines its circularity 3 4 simulation of biomass aggregate formation and disintegration in a batch reactor the simulation results described above were derived under constant bulk substrate concentrations and stable shear conditions to simulate the biomass aggregate formation in a typical sequencing batch reactor sbr the shear and bulk substrate concentration were varied according to the profiles in fig 6 a and b respectively the average shear rate variation shown in fig 6 a was achieved by adjusting the inlet velocity between 0 and 0 05 m s using a sinusoidal function the bulk substrate concentration decreased during each cycle according to a first order reaction rate 12 c t c 0 e k t for the case shown in fig 6 b the first order reaction coefficient k was set to 1 h 1 results in fig 6 c from this varying shear rate and declining bulk substrate concentration led to a declining rt value starting from a value greater than 0 1 to zero at the end of each cycle fig 6 d displays the biomass aggregate formed under this alternating shear and declining substrate condition the substrate concentration profile within the biomass aggregate at the end of one reaction cycle is displayed in fig 6 e the circularity for the biomass aggregate was calculated to be 0 6 when its diameter was 500 μm another simulation was performed that produced an alternating shear rate and a declining rt value where at no point was the rt above 0 1 see supplemental fig s9 in that simulation the results clearly show that a floc biomass aggregate with a 0 08 circularity value was produced it can be concluded that the biomass aggregate formed under variable shear and substrate conditions can only produce circular and compact biomass aggregate if at some point the rt is equal or larger than 0 1 indicating sufficient substrate availability fig 5 b suggests that for the formation of granules with circularity more than 0 6 the rt value should be greater than 0 1 the granule produced in the sbr reactor had a circularity of 0 6 and the rt value in the sbr cycle varied between 0 and 0 1 in a separate simulation we performed a numerical test with a fast declining substrate concentration i e k 5 h 1 in equation 12 fig s9 in the si the rt value was initially higher than 0 1 but remained less than 0 01 for the majority of the 4 h reaction cycle fig s10 c during this simulation granules with circularity at 0 6 can still be produced we hypothesize that the initial rt value above 0 1 at the start of each cycle is responsible for the granule formation in the sbr if the sbr system never achieves this threshold value as shown in fig s9 granules will not be produced one possible explanation for this requirement in sbrs is that biomass growth may be occurring during the high rt stage due to the high substrate transfer rate 4 discussion 4 1 the micro environment for biomass granulation substrate availability theory the simulation study examined the effect of micro environment characterized by shear and substrate concentration in close proximity to the biomass aggregate on the aerobic granulation process our results indicated that shear and substrate concentration that can be characterized by the rt value work together to influence the occurrence of aerobic granular sludge rt represents the ratio between the maximum substrate transport and maximum substrate reaction rate for ags to be formed the rt value should be higher than 0 1 this value could be achieved by increasing the shear or substrate concentration or both fig 4 a although the effects of shear on the biomass aggregate have been widely reported the underlying reasons for these effects on the biomass aggregate morphology have not been clearly determined considering the many aspects that shear could exert on the biomass aggregates e g biomass density extracellular polymeric substances eps production substrate transport biomass detachment liu and tay 2002 it is very difficult to rely on a single mechanism to explain the effect of shear on the biomass aggregate morphology in this study we focused on the effect of shear induced substrate transport on the biomass granulation process a the shear induced cbl thickness change and b the substrate transport in the hbl the simulation results identified that shear only affected the biomass granulation process for the medium 150 500 smin range of substrate concentration at high substrate concentrations high shear is not necessary to increase the rt value while an increase in shear cannot result in an increase in the rt value at very low substrate concentrations under which the granules could not be formed this simulation result is supported by experimental data sturm and irvine 2008 in which aerobic granules cannot be formed under low substrate concentration despite the elevated shear force the rt value represents how the shear and bulk substrate concentration are linked to affect the substrate availability in the micro scale environment 4 2 the impact of reactor macro environment on the biomass aggregate micro environment many of the prior experimental studies on granule formation were performed by adjusting reactor operational factors that influence the macro scale level here we examined how these operational factors affected the micro environment and subsequently affected biomass aggregate morphology 4 2 1 sbr vs continuous flow reactor granules are usually more challenging to grow in a continuous flow reactor kent et al 2018 the bulk substrate concentration s bulk in the ideal continuously stirred tank reactor cstr could be expressed by the following equation metcalf and eddy 2002 13 s b u l k k s 1 b s r t s r t μ m a x h b 1 where b is the biomass decay rate d 1 if we ignore the biomass decay rate the above equation could be simplified to 14 s b u l k k s s r t μ m a x h 1 considering the definition of s min in the eq 6 the above equation could be rewritten as 15 s b u l k 1 s r t 1 μ m a x h s m i n for a typical srt of 10 d and μ m a x h of 3 d 1 in the aerobic activated sludge system the s bulk in the cstr could be calculated as 0 103 s min according to the simulation results fig 3 c at such a low substrate concentration no granule will be formed this simple analysis could explain why aerobic granules have been rarely reported in continuous reactors franca et al 2017 kent et al 2018 liu and tay 2002 simulation results here confirmed that granules are more easily formed in sbrs than in continuous flow reactors beun et al 1999 franca et al 2018 due to the high initial substrate availability in the feast period of sbr operation 4 2 2 selection of slower growing organisms to promote granulation it should be noted that the substrate concentration used in this study was normalized in terms of the biomass kinetic parameters i e half saturation constant and maximum specific growth rate equation 6 the lower maximum specific growth rate of slow growing organisms could be equivalent to high substrate availability according to equation 6 the simulation results also explain why slow growers are preferred in granule formation it can be concluded from the previous studies that slow growing organisms are favored in the formation of granules de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 long before aerobic granules were discovered anaerobic granules have been used extensively in uasb up flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors lettinga 1995 other slow growers e g the nitrifying bacteria kishida et al 2012 and annamox bacteria van der star et al 2008 also have a tendency to form granules the high bulk substrate availability condition could be readily maintained for slow growing microorganisms 4 2 3 f m ratio adjustment the effect of f m food to microorganisms ratio on the aerobic granulation process is inconsistent in the literature initial high f m ratio 1 1 g cod g vss 1 d 1 was reported to promote granulation and increase the granule size however f m ratio needs to be reduced to 0 3 g cod g vss 1 d 1 to achieve long term granule stability li et al 2011 on the other hand decreasing f m ratio from 0 6 to 0 1 g cod g vss 1 d 1 was shown to increase filamentous growth and unstable granules liu and liu 2006 others have reported that very high f m ratio above 2 5 g cod g vss 1 d 1 led to filamentous bulking and poor settling in ags hamza et al 2018 the ability to produce granular sludge at high f m ratio li et al 2011 and the increase in filamentous growth under low f m ratio hamza et al 2018 could be explained by the low substrate availability condition shown in our simulations 4 2 4 aeration rate high do concentrations are typically required to produce round and clearly shaped aerobic granules low do concentrations lead to the filamentous growth and granule instability sturm and irvine 2008 consistent with the substrate availability theory described in this study it is usually believed that aeration could affect the aerobic granulation process by applying sufficient hydraulic shear and do liu and tay 2002 here we showed that shear and substrate concentration work on the same principle of increasing substrate availability for granule formation only organic substrate was included in the model equation to represent the limiting substrate when the organic substrate was not the limiting substrate high do was required to achieve aerobic granulation sturm and irvine 2008 4 2 5 feast and famine condition the feast and famine condition usually applied in the sbr was regarded as one of the main driving forces for granulation granule formation was promoted by an extended famine period beun et al 2000 corsino et al 2017 franca et al 2018 for any given initial substrate concentration an increase in the starvation period increased the rate of substrate availability in the feast period therefore promoting the granulation process according to the simulation result in this study conversely in the sbr where the feeding period was spread over a longer time span to reduce the bulk substrate concentration in the feast period the biomass aggregate settling ability decreased and filamentous bacterial growth increased martins et al 2003 granules with high settling ability could not be formed under low substrate availability regardless of a feast famine condition this result suggests that it was the high substrate availability in the feast period that promoted granulation not the feast famine condition 4 3 implications of the simulation study on the cultivation of aerobic granules this simulation study suggests that the microscale substrate availability characterized by the local shear and bulk substrate concentration could provide a reasonable explanation for biomass granulation formation under the model assumptions e g soluble substrate conditions the substrate availability theory could explain the majority of the operational strategies used for promoting biomass granulation i e use of batch reactors selection for slow growing microorganisms f m ratio adjustment feast and famine condition and short settling time the high substrate availability condition appears to be the common denominator in these strategies for biomass granulation although more experimental verification is needed the substrate availability phenomenon identified in this study could lead to completely new strategies for biomass granulation e g a granule selector with high substrate availability placed upstream of the main reactor or additional organic substrate addition with monitoring to avoid substrate deficiency the study used simulation to examine the impact of shear and substrate availability on granule formation however biomass granulation is quite complex and could involve other factors e g the interactive effects of eps extracellular polymer substances in the granule formation process research to date has not informed investigators or practitioners on the impact of shear and substrate availability on the production of eps or the role eps has on floc morphology during the granulation process only one active biomass component was included in the model developed in this study the actual biomass aggregates found in aerobic biological processes include multiple biomass species i e heterotrophic bacteria autotrophic bacteria and their decay products the mathematical model could be expanded to include the above mentioned factors and validated by detailed experimental data to fully understand the biomass granulation process 5 conclusions results of this in silico study using a 2 d biofilm model based on the cellular automata algorithm and computational fluid dynamics revealed that shear and bulk substrate concentration combined to create the optimal conditions for aerobic granule formation this process can be characterized by the reversed thiele rt modulus value which is the ratio of the maximum substrate transport over the maximum substrate reaction rate and an indicator of substrate availability for ags formation the rt value should be greater than 0 1 the rt value proposed in this study could also explain why granules could be more readily formed in an sbr with a high initial rt value than in a cstr with a low rt value many common strategies for biomass granulation production such as the use of batch reactors selection for slow growing microorganism f m ratio adjustment feast and famine condition and short settling time etc can be explained using the rt value and further suggests possible new strategies for ags formation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

18314,past research on ags aerobic granular sludge technology has mainly focused on macro environment factors such as settling time feeding pattern olr organic loading rate srt sludge retention time among others and their effects on the granulation process the biomass granulation process however is significantly affected by the micro environment surrounding these biomass aggregates in this research an in silico computational approach was adopted to study the impact of the micro environment on the biomass granulation process a 2 d biofilm model based on the cellular automata algorithm and computational fluid dynamics was used to simulate the development of an individual biomass aggregate under specific hydrodynamic and substrate availability conditions the simulation results indicated that shear and bulk substrate concentration combined to create the optimal conditions for aerobic granule formation this process can be characterized by the rt reversed thiele modulus value which is the ratio of the maximum substrate transport over the maximum substrate reaction rate and an indicator of substrate availability for ags formation the rt value should be greater than 0 1 many common strategies such as the application of batch reactors selection for slow growing microorganism f m food mass ratio adjustment feast and famine condition and short settling time for biomass granulation production can be explained by the rt value the results suggest that rethinking unit process configurations in wastewater treatment facilities will be required to achieve reliable ags formation graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerobic granular sludge computational fluid dynamics substrate transport activated sludge biofilm modelling 1 introduction because of its many advantages ags aerobic granular sludge technology for wastewater treatment has been the subject of increasing research focus in the past two decades beun et al 1999 franca et al 2018 in ags systems the biomass aggregate into self immobilized large dense granules with sizes between 200 and 2000 μm beun et al 2002 while in cas conventional activated sludge the biomass forms smaller flocs aerobic granules settle faster than cas flocs allowing for more efficient settling higher treatment efficiency and compact plant design moreover the stratified layers of aerobic anoxic and anaerobic conditions in the radial direction of the granules allow for potential simultaneous removal of organic material nitrogen and phosphorous de kreuk et al 2005 while past research has revealed operational conditions associated with granular sludge formation the mechanisms involved in their formation and disintegration are still not fully understood nancharaiah and reddy 2018 among many factors the selective pressure from the short settling time in sbrs sequencing batch reactors hydrodynamic shear force feeding pattern i e feast famine cycle anaerobic feeding f m food to mass ratio substrate type and concentration olr organic loading rate srt sludge retention time and do dissolved oxygen concentration have been considered the primary factors for granule formation and disintegration nancharaiah and reddy 2018 in addition concerns with the long startup period for full scale treatment pronk et al 2015 and long term granule stability still hinder the wide application of ags technology franca et al 2018 finally the formation of ags primarily in sbrs has also prevented the incorporation of ags technology in wastewater treatment as these systems are not easily applied in continuous flow wastewater treatment facilities kent et al 2018 many of these factors influencing biomass granulation deal with the macro environment at the reactor scale yet it is the micro environment surrounding the single biomass aggregates that determines the biomass granulation process and many mechanistic models for biomass granulation i e inert nuclei model selection pressure model multi valence positive ion bonding model etc were developed on the micro scale liu et al 2003 while the macro environment affects the micro environment for the biomass aggregates the degree to which the macro environment affects this micro environment varies for example the hydrodynamic shear force imposed by the same aeration rate could cause entirely different micro environments for different reactor configurations the olr f m ratio and do could have different effects on the substrate concentrations at the micro scale for biomass aggregates of different sizes density viable biomass content and growth rate examining the individual micro environment for single biomass aggregates is very difficult to perform through laboratory experiments particle image velocimetry has been attempted to measure the flow velocity field in a fixed biofilm system stoodley et al 1994 however there are no experimental methods to characterize the flow condition around suspended growth granules some specific substrate concentrations i e do nitrite and nitrate within granules were measured using microelectrodes that are mounted on precisely controlled devices li and bishop 2004 unfortunately the obtrusive nature of using microelectrodes may affect the actual micro environment that influence substrate transport and the local cultivation of these biomass aggregates many of the factors involved in biomass granulation are indeed interrelated for example both the hydrodynamic shear force and substrate loading rate impact the substrate transport around the surface of the biomass aggregates liu and tay 2002 the two factors were not easily separable in this research an in silico computational approach was adopted to study the impact of the micro environment on the biomass granulation process a 2 d biofilm model based on the cellular automata algorithm and computational fluid dynamics was used to simulate the development of the individual biomass aggregate under specific substrate availability and hydrodynamic conditions the substrate availability was included as it directly affects the biomass growth rate the hydrodynamic condition could affect the transport of substrate to biomass along with the aggregate solids detachment process the simulation tools developed in this study are expected to assist experimental investigations and provide insight into the biomass aggregation process at the micro scale level in particular this paper aims to answer the following research questions 1 what favorable micro environments lead to the formation of granules i e how do the substrate concentration and hydrodynamic shear surrounding the biomass aggregates affect the granulation process 2 is there a unique combination of substrate concentration and hydrodynamic shear that determines the biomass granulation process 3 can these simulations explain the main experimental results i e why biomass granulation is more prevalent in sbrs than in continuous flow reactors 4 what are the possible operational strategies at the reactor macro level to achieve a favorable micro environment for the formation of ags 2 model description 2 1 model geometry and setup a two dimensional fem finite element model that includes biomass aggregate formation growth liquid flow soluble substrate transport both convective and diffusive biodegradation and detachment was developed a singular biomass aggregate was tracked in a rectangular flow field with a width and height of 20 mm and 15 mm respectively fig 1 the left and right edges of this flow field were defined as the inlet and outlet as shown in fig 1 the inlet liquid velocities were varied to study the effect of shear on biomass aggregation shear forces produced from varying the inlet liquid velocities ranged between 0 and 250 s 1 the top and bottom edges of the flow domain were defined as symmetrical boundaries to minimize the impact of rectangle height on the simulation results the simulated biomass aggregate was composed of multiple 10 10 μm computational cells a sensitivity analysis of the computational cell size was performed to confirm that the computational cell size has no significant impact on the simulation results in terms of the granule and floc morphology i e circularity results shown in the supplementary information si figs s1 and s2 the size and shape of the biomass aggregate were developed from the total number and the position of these cells which were determined through the cellular automata algorithms for biomass development described in section 2 4 the biomass aggregate was allowed to rotate in the flow field at 15 increments in each simulation interval to imitate the potential movement of biomass aggregates in the flow field the biomass aggregate was surrounded by a cbl concentration boundary layer and a hbl hydraulic boundary layer as suggested by bishop et al 1997 a schematic representation of the cbl and hbl is shown in fig s3 the cbl is a region above the biomass aggregate where the flow is assumed stagnant the hbl is a region in which the flow velocity reduces from the free stream velocity to zero at the top of cbl the border of the cbl was defined by a circle located at the centroid of the biomass aggregate the radius of the cbl circle is the sum of the radius of the minimum bounding circle for the biomass aggregate and the cbl thickness the hbl circle was the concentric circle of the cbl and had a radius that is the sum of cbl radius and hbl thickness according to experimental results from bishop et al 1997 the thickness of the cbl in μm depends on the flow velocity m s eq 1 while the thickness of the hbl equals 4 8 mm which was not affected by the biofilm roughness and only slightly influenced at different flow velocities bishop et al 1997 1 l c 200 800 e 200 v four distinct regions bulk liquid hbl cbl and biomass aggregates were modeled with different governing equations described in section 2 3 the bulk liquid was the area outside the hbl the mass transfer in the hbl was simulated by including advection and diffusion since the flow in the cbl is stagnant the mass transfer in the cbl was simulated by diffusion alone the substrate concentration inside the biomass aggregates was simulated by diffusion and reaction i e convective transport was not included wanner and morgenroth 2004 2 2 hydraulic modeling the water flow in the bulk liquid and hbl was simulated using the navier stokes equations assuming laminar flow the maximum inlet velocity was set to 0 05 m s the maximum re reynolds number was 500 assuming a water density 1000 kg m3 dynamic viscosity 0 001 pa s and water flow height 10 mm the inlet velocity varied between 0 and 0 05 m s which produced an average shear rate in the vicinity of a 0 5 mm diameter granule between 0 and 250 s 1 fig s4 a in the si displays the distribution of shear rate around the 0 5 mm granule with an inlet velocity of 0 05 m s fig s4 b shows the correlation between the inlet velocity and the average shear rate a no slip boundary condition was defined for the biomass aggregate surface and a zero pressure condition was adopted for the outlet of the hydraulic simulation domain the shear stress calculated from the hydraulic model was used to control the detachment of granules biomass detachment was initiated when the shear stress was higher than 0 5 pa stoodley et al 1999 the flow velocity was used to calculate the convective transport of the substrate within the hbl 2 3 soluble substrate mass balance the soluble substrate transport in the hbl was simulated using the convective and diffusive transport equation 2 s t d l 2 s u s where d l is the diffusion coefficient in the liquid u is the flow velocity calculated from the hydraulic modeling and s is the soluble substrate concentration the bulk liquid was assumed to be completely mixed the constant substrate concentration boundary condition was applied at the interface between the hbl and bulk liquid the soluble substrate mass balance in the biomass aggregates was simulated using the diffusion reaction equation 3 s t d b 2 s r s where d b is the diffusional coefficient in the biomass aggregates and r s is the bioreaction rate which can be expressed with eq 4 4 r s μ m a x h s s k s x where μ max h is the maximum specific biomass growth rate d 1 x is the biomass concentration mg l and ks is the substrate half saturation constant mg l in the asm activated sludge models several substrate limitation conditions were used for simplicity only one limiting substrate organic matter was used in this study the values of the model parameters used in eqs 2 4 were obtained from the literature table s1 in the si 2 4 development of the biomass aggregate a cellular automata algorithm was used for simulating the development of the biomass aggregate the increase in the biomass concentration δx was calculated incrementally at a simulation duration of 6 h δt using the following equation 5 δ x y h t t δ t r s where y h was the yield coefficient of biomass due to substrate consumption for simplicity biomass decay was ignored biomass was designed to spread from its starting location when the 10 10 μm cells split according to the ca cellular automata algorithm picioreanu et al 1998 an 8 neighbor cell filling rule was used in the ca algorithm the ca procedure consists of the following a if the biomass density in a cell reaches the critical density xc table s1 the biomass in the cell split into two equal parts one part stayed in the original cell the other half was placed randomly in one of the empty neighboring cells the biomass density in the two split cells was adjusted to half of the original cell b if none of the 8 neighboring cells was empty one of the 8 occupied cells was randomly chosen and the biomass inside the occupied cell was randomly displaced to one of its empty neighboring cells c if there were no empty neighboring cells from step b then step b was repeated until an empty cell was identified d the steps from a to c were executed repeatedly until the biomass density in all the cells was less than the critical density xc to examine the effect of simulation interval on the simulation results a sensitivity analysis was performed using the simulation interval of 1 2 4 6 and 12 h fig s5 in the si displays the derived granule images and circularities produced from simulations with different time intervals the results in fig s5 show that the simulation interval had no significant effect on the biomass aggregate morphology and circularity the detachment of biomass from the biomass aggregates was controlled by the shear stress calculated from the hydraulic model biomass detachment occurred when the surrounding shear stress exceeded 0 5 pa a value selected based on the measured biomass strength from stoodley et al 1999 2 5 model implementation the model was implemented in the matlab 8 4 and comsol multiphysics 5 2 environment the main script was written in matlab to 1 define the model parameters 2 call for the comsol solver 3 define the model geometry 4 solve the ca algorithm and 5 perform the biomass aggregates image analysis the comsol software was used to solve the hydraulic and substrate mass balance partial differential equation pdes the matlab and comsol software were integrated using the livelink feature of comsol for matlab to reduce the impact of selected kinetic parameters on the simulation result the bulk cod concentration was normalized to a minimum unit substrate s min defined by the following equation 6 s m i n k s μ m a x h the model was implemented in the following steps 1 the model parameters shown in table s1 were defined in matlab 2 one of the 10 10 μm cells was seeded with initial biomass concentration at 50 of the critical density i e 50 of x c the biomass aggregate progressively spreads from the center the initial seeding position 3 the geometries physics equations and initial conditions for the hydraulic modeling and substrate mass balance were defined in matlab and imported into comsol the initial velocity in the bulk liquid and the boundary layer was assumed to be zero the initial substrate concentration in all the domains was the same as the bulk substrate concentration 4 the hydraulic model and substrate mass balance were solved in comsol for the time interval of 6 h δt 5 the results from the comsol calculation in step 4 were exported to matlab and used to determine the biomass density if the resulting biomass specific density in certain cells was larger than one the cells were divided into two and spread according to the ca algorithm 6 the new biomass aggregate geometries were defined based on the result from step 5 the newly created biomass geometries were rotated 15 anti clockwise relative to the previous biomass geometries 7 steps 4 to 6 were repeated until biomass aggregate diameter of 0 7 mm was reached for the repeated simulations the previous result at the end of 6 h simulation was used as the initial condition for the next simulation the maximum mesh size for the bulk liquid and biomass aggregate was selected as 25 and 2 5 μm respectively fig s6 to examine the effect of rotation angle on the simulation results a sensitivity analysis was performed using the following rotation angles 10 20 30 40 and 50 fig s7 in the si displays the derived granule images and circularities produced from simulations with different rotation angles the results in fig s7 show that the rotation angle had no significant effect on the biomass aggregate morphology and circularity the biomass aggregates of different morphologies were produced by running the model at different shear and substrate concentration conditions 2 6 reversed thiele modulus the reversed thiele rt modulus defined by the ratio of the maximum substrate transport rate to the maximum substrate reaction rate was used to represent the condition for biomass aggregate formation 7 rt m a x i u

velocity and both the hbl and cbl thickness under a high flow velocity condition the substrate transport in the hbl is not a limiting factor the substrate transport was limited by the diffusion in the cbl on the other hand under a low flow velocity condition both the hbl and cbl substrate transport could become a limiting factor for the 2d simulation condition the maximum substrate transport rate in the cbl was calculated according to eq 8 fig s3 in si 8 m c b l 2 π r d c l c where r is the radius of biomass aggregate l c is the thickness of cbl c is the substrate concentration at the cbl

the calculated rt values under different biomass aggregate radii substrate concentrations and flow velocities fig s8 in si show that the rt value decreases with increasing biomass aggregate radius increases linearly with substrate concentration increases with shear values below 100 s 1 and stabilized for shear values 200 s 1 and higher 2 7 image analysis of the biomass aggregates the image analysis toolbox within the matlab software was used to measure the biomass aggregate s diameter and circularity the diameter was assumed to be the same as a bounding circle with the minimum diameter that covered all the biomass aggregate area the circularity i c was calculated using the following equation 11 i c 4 π a r e a p r i m e t e r 2 3 simulation results 3 1 simulation results at two

distribution fig 2 a and b respectively show that under the low inlet velocity 0 01 m s and average shear rate of 20 s 1 and low bulk substrate concentration defined as 50 s min the biomass aggregate had an irregular surface and low circularity fig 2 a b under high shear inlet velocity 0 05 m s and an average shear rate of 250 s 1 and high substrate concentration 300 s min condition the shape of the biomass aggregate was more circular and compact than the low shear and low substrate condition fig 2 c d the high flow velocity reduced the cbl thickness shown in the fig 2 c in comparison to the cbl shown in the fig 2 a the reduced cbl thickness and increased substrate concentration increased the substrate flux into the biomass aggregate 3 2 impact of shear and substrate concentration on the biomass aggregate morphology fig 3 a displays the morphology and circularity for biomass aggregate formed under the constant bulk substrate concentration of 200 s min and variable shear rate at 0 300 s 1 at the zero shear condition the biomass aggregate had an open finger like morphology that became more compact and circular with increasing shear rate the impact of bulk substrate concentration on the biomass aggregate morphology under the constant shear rate of 200 s 1 is shown in fig 3 b the increase in the substrate concentration from 50 to 600 s min led to more compact and circular biomass aggregates results in fig 3 suggest that at some limiting value either shear rate or bulk substrate concentration no significant change in the circularity was observed to investigate the combined impact of shear and substrate concentration on the biomass aggregate morphology a series of simulations were performed under shear rates between 0 and 250 s 1 and substrate concentrations between 50 and 600 s min the surface plot of the circularity from the simulations fig 3 c shows that under low substrate concentration i e less than 150 s min the circularity of biomass aggregates remained below 0 1 despite the variation of shear rate between 0 and 250 s 1 for substrate concentration higher than 500 s min the biomass aggregates circularity remained larger than 0 5 in other words the local shear has no impact on the biomass aggregate morphology for substrate concentrations less than 150 s min or higher than 500 s min for substrate concentrations between 150 and 500 s min increasing shear led to high biomass aggregate circularity high circularity is defined as values greater than 0 6 while low circularity is defined as values below 0 2 3 3 the effect of reversed thiele modulus on the biomass aggregate morphology fig 4 a displays the calculated rt values for different combinations of shear and bulk substrate concentration of a circular biomass aggregate with a diameter of 500 μm in fig 4 a the shape of the circularity curve as a function of the rt value was similar to the shear and substrate concentration effect shown in fig 3 c this result suggests that the rt value could be used as a universal dimensionless factor to determine the morphology of biomass aggregates at different shear rates and substrate concentrations the impact of rt values on biomass aggregates of 400 500 and 600 μm diameter fig 4 b show similar patterns regardless of the aggregate size the biomass aggregate circularity increased from 0 1 to 0 65 when the rt value increased from 0 02 to 0 1 and stabilized for rt value larger than 0 1 the simulation results indicate that the maximum substrate transport rate should be around 10 of the maximum substrate reaction rate to produce biomass aggregates of circularity near 0 65 the rt values shown in fig 4 b were calculated from various arbitrary combinations of shear and bulk substrate concentration this set of simulated experiments indicate that shear and bulk substrate concentration work in a unified way by controlling the substrate availability to affect the biomass aggregate morphology for granule formation to be achieved an rt value larger than 0 1 is necessary to understand how the biomass aggregate size affects its circularity the development of biomass aggregate size circularity and the rt value for the two simulation scenarios in fig 2 were performed and results are shown in fig 5 under the low substrate availability scenario the increase in the floc diameter coincided with a decrease in circularity and rt values fig 5 a under the high substrate availability scenario the circularity was stable despite the increase in granule diameter and decrease in rt value fig 5 b however the rt value in fig 5 b remained above 0 1 and supports the results in fig 4 that a high circularity could be achieved at or above this rt threshold value regardless of the biomass aggregate size this result suggests that the rt value and not the biomass aggregate size determines its circularity 3 4 simulation of biomass aggregate formation and disintegration in a batch reactor the simulation results described above were derived under constant bulk substrate concentrations and stable shear conditions to simulate the biomass aggregate formation in a typical sequencing batch reactor sbr the shear and bulk substrate concentration were varied according to the profiles in fig 6 a and b respectively the average shear rate variation shown in fig 6 a was achieved by adjusting the inlet velocity between 0 and 0 05 m s using a sinusoidal function the bulk substrate concentration decreased during each cycle according to a first order reaction rate 12 c t c 0 e k t for the case shown in fig 6 b the first order reaction coefficient k was set to 1 h 1 results in fig 6 c from this varying shear rate and declining bulk substrate concentration led to a declining rt value starting from a value greater than 0 1 to zero at the end of each cycle fig 6 d displays the biomass aggregate formed under this alternating shear and declining substrate condition the substrate concentration profile within the biomass aggregate at the end of one reaction cycle is displayed in fig 6 e the circularity for the biomass aggregate was calculated to be 0 6 when its diameter was 500 μm another simulation was performed that produced an alternating shear rate and a declining rt value where at no point was the rt above 0 1 see supplemental fig s9 in that simulation the results clearly show that a floc biomass aggregate with a 0 08 circularity value was produced it can be concluded that the biomass aggregate formed under variable shear and substrate conditions can only produce circular and compact biomass aggregate if at some point the rt is equal or larger than 0 1 indicating sufficient substrate availability fig 5 b suggests that for the formation of granules with circularity more than 0 6 the rt value should be greater than 0 1 the granule produced in the sbr reactor had a circularity of 0 6 and the rt value in the sbr cycle varied between 0 and 0 1 in a separate simulation we performed a numerical test with a fast declining substrate concentration i e k 5 h 1 in equation 12 fig s9 in the si the rt value was initially higher than 0 1 but remained less than 0 01 for the majority of the 4 h reaction cycle fig s10 c during this simulation granules with circularity at 0 6 can still be produced we hypothesize that the initial rt value above 0 1 at the start of each cycle is responsible for the granule formation in the sbr if the sbr system never achieves this threshold value as shown in fig s9 granules will not be produced one possible explanation for this requirement in sbrs is that biomass growth may be occurring during the high rt stage due to the high substrate transfer rate 4 discussion 4 1 the micro environment for biomass granulation substrate availability theory the simulation study examined the effect of micro environment characterized by shear and substrate concentration in close proximity to the biomass aggregate on the aerobic granulation process our results indicated that shear and substrate concentration that can be characterized by the rt value work together to influence the occurrence of aerobic granular sludge rt represents the ratio between the maximum substrate transport and maximum substrate reaction rate for ags to be formed the rt value should be higher than 0 1 this value could be achieved by increasing the shear or substrate concentration or both fig 4 a although the effects of shear on the biomass aggregate have been widely reported the underlying reasons for these effects on the biomass aggregate morphology have not been clearly determined considering the many aspects that shear could exert on the biomass aggregates e g biomass density extracellular polymeric substances eps production substrate transport biomass detachment liu and tay 2002 it is very difficult to rely on a single mechanism to explain the effect of shear on the biomass aggregate morphology in this study we focused on the effect of shear induced substrate transport on the biomass granulation process a the shear induced cbl thickness change and b the substrate transport in the hbl the simulation results identified that shear only affected the biomass granulation process for the medium 150 500 smin range of substrate concentration at high substrate concentrations high shear is not necessary to increase the rt value while an increase in shear cannot result in an increase in the rt value at very low substrate concentrations under which the granules could not be formed this simulation result is supported by experimental data sturm and irvine 2008 in which aerobic granules cannot be formed under low substrate concentration despite the elevated shear force the rt value represents how the shear and bulk substrate concentration are linked to affect the substrate availability in the micro scale environment 4 2 the impact of reactor macro environment on the biomass aggregate micro environment many of the prior experimental studies on granule formation were performed by adjusting reactor operational factors that influence the macro scale level here we examined how these operational factors affected the micro environment and subsequently affected biomass aggregate morphology 4 2 1 sbr vs continuous flow reactor granules are usually more challenging to grow in a continuous flow reactor kent et al 2018 the bulk substrate concentration s bulk in the ideal continuously stirred tank reactor cstr could be expressed by the following equation metcalf and eddy 2002 13 s b u l k k s 1 b s r t s r t μ m a x h b 1 where b is the biomass decay rate d 1 if we ignore the biomass decay rate the above equation could be simplified to 14 s b u l k k s s r t μ m a x h 1 considering the definition of s min in the eq 6 the above equation could be rewritten as 15 s b u l k 1 s r t 1 μ m a x h s m i n for a typical srt of 10 d and μ m a x h of 3 d 1 in the aerobic activated sludge system the s bulk in the cstr could be calculated as 0 103 s min according to the simulation results fig 3 c at such a low substrate concentration no granule will be formed this simple analysis could explain why aerobic granules have been rarely reported in continuous reactors franca et al 2017 kent et al 2018 liu and tay 2002 simulation results here confirmed that granules are more easily formed in sbrs than in continuous flow reactors beun et al 1999 franca et al 2018 due to the high initial substrate availability in the feast period of sbr operation 4 2 2 selection of slower growing organisms to promote granulation it should be noted that the substrate concentration used in this study was normalized in terms of the biomass kinetic parameters i e half saturation constant and maximum specific growth rate equation 6 the lower maximum specific growth rate of slow growing organisms could be equivalent to high substrate availability according to equation 6 the simulation results also explain why slow growers are preferred in granule formation it can be concluded from the previous studies that slow growing organisms are favored in the formation of granules de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 long before aerobic granules were discovered anaerobic granules have been used extensively in uasb up flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors lettinga 1995 other slow growers e g the nitrifying bacteria kishida et al 2012 and annamox bacteria van der star et al 2008 also have a tendency to form granules the high bulk substrate availability condition could be readily maintained for slow growing microorganisms 4 2 3 f m ratio adjustment the effect of f m food to microorganisms ratio on the aerobic granulation process is inconsistent in the literature initial high f m ratio 1 1 g cod g vss 1 d 1 was reported to promote granulation and increase the granule size however f m ratio needs to be reduced to 0 3 g cod g vss 1 d 1 to achieve long term granule stability li et al 2011 on the other hand decreasing f m ratio from 0 6 to 0 1 g cod g vss 1 d 1 was shown to increase filamentous growth and unstable granules liu and liu 2006 others have reported that very high f m ratio above 2 5 g cod g vss 1 d 1 led to filamentous bulking and poor settling in ags hamza et al 2018 the ability to produce granular sludge at high f m ratio li et al 2011 and the increase in filamentous growth under low f m ratio hamza et al 2018 could be explained by the low substrate availability condition shown in our simulations 4 2 4 aeration rate high do concentrations are typically required to produce round and clearly shaped aerobic granules low do concentrations lead to the filamentous growth and granule instability sturm and irvine 2008 consistent with the substrate availability theory described in this study it is usually believed that aeration could affect the aerobic granulation process by applying sufficient hydraulic shear and do liu and tay 2002 here we showed that shear and substrate concentration work on the same principle of increasing substrate availability for granule formation only organic substrate was included in the model equation to represent the limiting substrate when the organic substrate was not the limiting substrate high do was required to achieve aerobic granulation sturm and irvine 2008 4 2 5 feast and famine condition the feast and famine condition usually applied in the sbr was regarded as one of the main driving forces for granulation granule formation was promoted by an extended famine period beun et al 2000 corsino et al 2017 franca et al 2018 for any given initial substrate concentration an increase in the starvation period increased the rate of substrate availability in the feast period therefore promoting the granulation process according to the simulation result in this study conversely in the sbr where the feeding period was spread over a longer time span to reduce the bulk substrate concentration in the feast period the biomass aggregate settling ability decreased and filamentous bacterial growth increased martins et al 2003 granules with high settling ability could not be formed under low substrate availability regardless of a feast famine condition this result suggests that it was the high substrate availability in the feast period that promoted granulation not the feast famine condition 4 3 implications of the simulation study on the cultivation of aerobic granules this simulation study suggests that the microscale substrate availability characterized by the local shear and bulk substrate concentration could provide a reasonable explanation for biomass granulation formation under the model assumptions e g soluble substrate conditions the substrate availability theory could explain the majority of the operational strategies used for promoting biomass granulation i e use of batch reactors selection for slow growing microorganisms f m ratio adjustment feast and famine condition and short settling time the high substrate availability condition appears to be the common denominator in these strategies for biomass granulation although more experimental verification is needed the substrate availability phenomenon identified in this study could lead to completely new strategies for biomass granulation e g a granule selector with high substrate availability placed upstream of the main reactor or additional organic substrate addition with monitoring to avoid substrate deficiency the study used simulation to examine the impact of shear and substrate availability on granule formation however biomass granulation is quite complex and could involve other factors e g the interactive effects of eps extracellular polymer substances in the granule formation process research to date has not informed investigators or practitioners on the impact of shear and substrate availability on the production of eps or the role eps has on floc morphology during the granulation process only one active biomass component was included in the model developed in this study the actual biomass aggregates found in aerobic biological processes include multiple biomass species i e heterotrophic bacteria autotrophic bacteria and their decay products the mathematical model could be expanded to include the above mentioned factors and validated by detailed experimental data to fully understand the biomass granulation process 5 conclusions results of this in silico study using a 2 d biofilm model based on the cellular automata algorithm and computational fluid dynamics revealed that shear and bulk substrate concentration combined to create the optimal conditions for aerobic granule formation this process can be characterized by the reversed thiele rt modulus value which is the ratio of the maximum substrate transport over the maximum substrate reaction rate and an indicator of substrate availability for ags formation the rt value should be greater than 0 1 the rt value proposed in this study could also explain why granules could be more readily formed in an sbr with a high initial rt value than in a cstr with a low rt value many common strategies for biomass granulation production such as the use of batch reactors selection for slow growing microorganism f m ratio adjustment feast and famine condition and short settling time etc can be explained using the rt value and further suggests possible new strategies for ags formation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have
