1 introduction according to bendiksen and young 2015 there was a steady increase in commissioning time leading to overruns from 2008 to 2014 they state that due to inadequate interface management im during the design phase design changes are the norm which must be accommodated at the commissioning stage this paper proposes a framework to minimize late design changes im is a process which should stand the test of being reasonable however some processes may be more efficient than the others in achieving the goal of integration with minimal cost the proposed process for interface management starts with mapping all component of the system in some desirable order using dsm using the clustering technique components are grouped into several modules with minimal interfaces between them one should seek an optimal solution considering other constraints e g weight footprint etc and there may be several near optimal solutions the next step is to identify interface requirements between these modules document them get agreement between parties design them and verify them the tracking of progress is done via an interface register a case study is presented to demonstrate the proposed framework and quantify risks in recent years interface management im practices have emerged to address the challenges of managing large complex capital projects these challenges include scale multisite fabrication geographical distribution various working practices and different expertise is required to develop an offshore field fig 1 most problems occur at the interface between contractors during development buede 2012 handling the interaction between contractors and successfully integrating the various pieces of equipment is a major task which could involve over 1000 interfaces even within a single contractor s organization the contribution of many disciplines is required if the water is very deep or the field is marginal or scattered or located at some distance from the shore then an fpso is a suitable choice paik j k and thayamballi 2007 there are many constraints to be considered for example equipment that contains significant amounts of liquid should be located near to the centerline axis to minimize the wave action which acts as a constraint on the layout such practicalities as well as other considerations such as the availability of lifting equipment and specialization of fabricators etc will affect the layout which in turn affect the interfaces hölttä otto k 2005 the primary topside units are shown in fig 2 which are power generation and distribution heating and cooling mediums fuel gas mechanical handling water treatment seawater lift workshops maintenance and repair desalting system piping systems regeneration instrument and electrical room storage service water cranes freshwater produced water treatment sewage treatment injection methanol sodium hypochlorite ea seawater treatment filtration de aeration de sulfating fire protection and blast protection are part of the interface between process modules and the utility modules mitra n k 2018 any equipment belongs to a certain system group thus only the primary systems are named in fig 2 which is one realization of many ways of grouping equipment a case study of im for the topside equipment is given to demonstrate the im process during the design fabrication and installation of an fpso the same approach can be used for the commissioning phase as wells as for other parts of the development 2 systems engineering approach the time that a project takes from its inception to its end is generally referred to as its lifecycle incose 2015 the life cycle is a concept used in systems engineering to track an asset from its beginning to its decommissioning all systems engineering models and processes are organized around the concept of a life cycle but the detailed views implementations and terminology may be different a project typically has the following major phases each with its own agenda and issues appraise select define execution implementation operation and decommissioning fig 3 the left hand side of the v fig 3 represents concept development and the decomposition of requirements into functional and physical entities that can be architected designed and fabricated federal aviation administration 2008 the right hand side represents the integration of these entities which include suitable testing to verify that they satisfy the requirements and their ultimate transition into the operation as shown in fig 3 the system is decomposed broken down into functional building blocks subsystems and sub sub systems subsystems can then be designed and fabricated in parallel use of decomposition makes problems simpler and it is easier to map existing solutions and expertise to problems in the ideal case decomposition leads to sub problems that are sufficiently well defined and they may have standard solutions however there may still involve substantial work in adapting the known solutions to the new context fig 4 shows the breakdown of activities as described in the v model of fig 3 3 domain mapping fpso modules can be represented by a graph or a network of interacting block diagrams the dependencies between elements can be mapped into a matrix called a dsm eppinger and browning 2012 which is a square matrix with identical row and column labels an off diagonal mark signifies the interaction relationship or dependency of one component to another the component based dsm browning 2001 which is used in this paper comprises of a list of components in some desirable order fig 5 shows a simple system with five interdependent components and its representation using dsm is shown in table 1 the components of a system are shown as rows and columns in the matrix where the components are listed in the same order along both axes table 1 an off diagonal mark located within the matrix denotes an interface i e coupling between two components a number can be used to represent some quantity for example risk criticality or the volatility of the interface yasseri 2015 the diagonal of the square matrix is used to create a link to another worksheet which contains information about the interface table 1 shows a symmetrical matrix but asymmetrical matrices can be used to show different criticality for forward and backward dependencies reading down a column indicates that a component provides information to others in its associated row alternatively a component in the row receives information from the component in the corresponding column when reading across a row in the matrix dsm can be re organized into rows and columns such that all the information i e dependency marks in the new dsm flows forward and there is no feedback this transforms the dsm into a lower triangular form which is known as partitioning eppinger and browning 2012 reordering the dsm of an fpso s systems will not completely eliminate feedbacks but can minimize them and moves the rest as close as possible to the diagonal resulting in more interfaces within a module internal interfaces than between modules external interfaces in doing so fewer system elements will be involved in the iterative design cycle between contractors the ordering of rows and columns represent flow through time i e upstream activities in a design process precede downstream activities and terms like feedforward and feedback become meaningful when referring to interfaces operations on dsm relevant to this paper are epping and browning 2012 partitioning which is the process of reordering the dsm rows and columns such that the new dsm arrangement does not contain any feedback marks if possible thus transforming the dsm into a lower triangular form the objective is to move the feedback marks as close as possible to the diagonal clustering is grouping elements that have the most interaction into modules along the diagonal these modules consist of both sequential and iterative relationships tasks that share the most information are grouped together the aim of clustering is different from partitioning the objective is to increase iterations within the modules but reduce iteration between the modules browning 2001 areas between clusters may also contain dependencies these areas are referred to as the interface between clusters dependencies in the interface are the links between the modules 4 modularization fig 6 shows the division of deep water field development activities between various primary contractors such division creates interface issues between contractors as well as between equipment which must work together one important feature of interfaces between equipment is their physical or geometrical design i e size shape orientation etc helmer et al 2010 however to design these interfaces adequately the type of interactions that have to be performed through these interfaces must be well defined in addition to the transmission of forces moments and displacements between modules there may also be the transmission of fluid energy and data there are also hidden interactions such as vibration thermal expansion noise etc the interfaces between contractors will also cover schedule tolerances as well as controllable interactions such as thermal expansion vibration transmission forces and moment fig 7 shows a block diagram of the interfaces between various disciplines there are two parties at each interface the requester and the responder though two parties are partners in delivering mate able subsystems there are items that cannot tolerate strong interaction or are expensive to change in such a situation the cheaper item contactor is expected to accommodate changes to prevent excessive forces and moments being transmitted to the more expensive item during the execution phase of a project design defects may be detected which may require an iteration with the subsequent change requirements for the neighboring modules at interfaces alarcón l f and mardones d a 1998 fpso processing units are often grouped into several modules with manageable dimensions and weights in order to optimize the project schedule and cost this requires suitably chosen breakpoints between processing equipment at the early phase of development to exploit the full potential of modularization a module is a unit whose structural elements are tightly connected amongst themselves but relatively weakly connected to elements in other units clearly there are degrees of connection thus there are gradations of modularity baldwin and clark 2000 hölttä otto de weck 2007 equipment is acquired from various vendors by a primary contractor or the client and brought together to the fabrication yard to fit out a module modularization is also needed due to the specialization of equipment manufacturers reduction of onsite work to enhance concurrent engineering yassine and braha 2003 availability of transportation and lifting equipment etc this gives the advantage of an optimal number of lifts and interfaces with the fpso hull since each module needs a foundation to rest upon successful modularization is dependent on how interfaces between the different modules are defined modularization can be achieved by clustering of the dsm a cluster or module is commonly defined as a group of equipment that possesses a high number of internal dependencies compared to the external dependencies the lower part of table 1 shows a simple example of clustering results clustering reorders the rows and columns the clustering that is shown in table 1 is non overlapping clusters as each object is assigned to a single cluster module only non overlapping clusters are used in fpso technology in an overlapping cluster the interface units consist of male and female parts and each half is incorporated into one module modularization has the advantage that changes in one module has very little influence on another other than a change in input and output thus making the management of change process less complex however a topside module is not an isolated unit nor can it be designed as one with only the inputs and outputs by being aware of the transfer fluids power fuel etc management of the interfaces between the modules may simplify considerably if the flows and the equipment duties are well defined in every module then the effect of a change in one module is easier to trace thus re engineering work may be reduced changes in the process due to new reservoir information can affect many disciplines changes can also result when actual equipment data like sizes and weight differ from the expected data due to different vendor or technology change generally any change can propagate throughout the system but modularization may help to contain it within one module s boundary four design aspects together with the safety requirements dictate the topside layout and hence interfaces between equipment these are accessibility of all equipment for operational repair and maintenance purposes requiring a reservation area in the layout for access routes gangways and trapdoors for direct access to all topside equipment crane access for loading and offloading and work on the deck another issue is escaping routes which can be combined with access routes the functionality of the layout depends on the equipment arrangement the processes must flow undisturbed some equipment is location fixed e g crude separation unit due to its processing needs the separation tanks have to be located as closely to mid ship as possible since they are highly affected by the ship motion however some items may be housed together to save space e g piping cables and other lines on the deck however the grouping should be checked against operational safety standards the structure of the topside and all connections must have adequate strength robustness and resilience accounting also for the self weight of the vessel and the hull motions caused by the sea states if heavy and tall installations are necessary they will need to be located near mid ship the mechanical handling laydown areas areas reserved on the topside for repair and maintenance activities the layout and sizing of the area depend mainly on the equipment sizes considering the accessibility of the deck and the general material and tool storage a workshop should be on the deck for maintenance and repair of small sized equipment and for main storage of materials and tools the workshop has to be well accessible for movement of equipment its function is temporary storage of objects which are just offloaded onto the vessel or are prepared for transportation the architecture of a system sharman and yassine 2004 determines the flexibility of the system to future changes which may arise from a variety of reasons such as new reservoir conditions or technical innovations tilstra and wood 2009 the optimum topside layout is considered to be an architecture that is tolerant to changes hence enabling maximum flexibility to accommodate future needs 5 interface when one subsystem provides a flow of material information energy or physical contact to another subsystem then an interface exists between them blyler 2004 defines an interface as an input output relationship linking two subsystems the interface is defined as the boundary contact points between the two subsystems and appears identically in both subsystem specifications but it could have different verification methods at different sides of the interface when a system has a complex development and modification processes agreements between different engineering groups and different contractors on interfaces cannot be easily achieved lalli e al 1997 a complex system is a system with components interactions and interfaces which are not easy to describe understand predict manage design or change de weck et al 2011 eppinger 1997 interfaces within an organization are known as the internal interfaces interfaces between two or more contractors are termed as the external interfaces which are much more involved due to the differences in practices and procedures some interfaces are more critical because they reside at the boundary between many contractors modules and disciplines at the same time parslov and mortensen 2015 if there is an interaction between elements of two systems there is an interface an interface is defined as a common functional or physical boundary where the two systems interact wheatcraft 2010 proposed a three step approach to identifying defining and stating requirements for interfaces crawley et al 2004 suggested viewing an interface conceptually as a system element uddin et al 2015 presented an interface analysis framework for systems analysis with the intention of supporting interface definitions which consist of a template or checklist of various aspects related to the interactions exchanged at the interface interaction at the interface involves the flow of material energy and data as well as a spatial and physical relationship the spatial and physical relationships relate to the formal aspects of system integration zheng et al 2016 argues for a better classification of interfaces in multi disciplinary product development and proposes a new classification consisting of four classes geometric interface energy interface control interface and data interface parslov and mortensen 2015 presented a review of interface definitions in the literature pimmler and eppinger 1994 identified four types of interactions spatial proximity material flow information flow and energy exchange they define an interaction strength which reflects the level or degree of dependency among the components in contrast a binary dsm shows the absence or presence of interaction the definition of the interfaces evolves with the design and it is documented in the interface requirement documents irds they are agreements and statements of fact needed for the design to progress ird drives the design of interfaces and must be verified the interface requirements are not recorded in the system s requirements which are the client s requirements since they are one possible realization which enables the system to operate and there may be more than one solution the ird defines the nature of the interaction which includes what each system looks like at the interface what the characteristics are of the matter crossing the interface and the media involved in the interaction another document is developed that establishes the requirements to which the interfaces should be designed and developed these documents often called the interface control documents icds an icd specifies what is required to correctly connect subsystems in an overall system icds contain the functional physical performance and design requirements for inter system interfaces icds are not intended to show the detailed data that would normally appear on design drawings instead they show parameters characteristics or configurations that are necessary to ensure that the designed subsystems will operate together as intended icds must be analyzed for compatibility each time a change to the interface definitions occurs a compatibility analysis must be performed to demonstrate the completeness and correctness of interface information demonstrating correctness means providing a record that shows interfaces have been examined for having the right form fit and function for the interacting subsystems documenting agreements and committing to them is a crucial means of preventing design conflicts and re work the purpose of an icd is to guarantee that subsystems designed by different engineering agencies are compatible use of icds is particularly helpful when a product is composed of subsystems that are described by different models e g mechanical electrical hydraulic etc in such situations it is very difficult to have a product representation that includes all such variety of subsystems and defines the interfaces between them in such cases icds can be supplied as separate documents that describe the interfaces among subsystems 6 interfaces of an fpso an fpso project involves various disciplines and takes place in an extended period of time and may involve participants in different offices or even countries the interfacing parties must agree on the definitions in the interface and both interacting systems need to include the corresponding interface requirements in their requirement documents european space agency requirements and standard division 2013 the interface requirements should trace to each other a common definition in the icd and a common parent yasseri et al 2019 each subsystem equipment will have a drawing showing all the internal interfaces each of the interfacing systems modules will contain a context or boundary diagram showing their external interfaces interface verification occurs at many stages during the integration of subsystems yasseri 2014 yasseri et al 2019 it is carried out to demonstrate that the design and implementation conform to the icd and it will be described by formal procedures validation of the interface requirements will take place at the factory and again at the marine base each lead party is responsible for their assigned interface test at the marine base the respective interface will go through integration tests to validate the complete system compliance against the system design specification the overall system integration plan will elaborate on what and how system integration tests must be performed yasseri et al 2019 the interface management is at the heart of the multi disciplinary nature of systems engineering which covers what is necessary in order to connect the individual pieces of the system together into a working system fosse and delp 2013 interface management concerns the coordination and management of the interfaces between the hull and its topside and the interfaces between modules on the topside fig 8 shows the interface management process the objective of the interface management process is to guarantee the proper functioning of a system composed of many interfacing sub systems ineffective interface management is often responsible for the failure of large systems projects interface mismatches causing delays in commissioning excessive re work and cost over run interface integrity is particularly important with projects involving stringent safety and security requirements as explained in the previous section the following issues must be taking care of for an fpso project interface requirements which identifies functional or physical attributes that are required to exist at a common boundary this boundary can exist between two or more functions system elements configuration items or systems interface requirements document ird which contains interface requirements between two elements including the type of interface e g electrical pneumatic hydraulic etc and the interface characteristics performance functional or physical ird is the primary documentation of the interface requirements system interface requirements which are requirements whose fulfilment involve multiple subsystems not all subsystems involved own the requirement interface requirements reconciliation requires agreement among multiple subsystem vendors fabricators who may not share the same interest interface control document icd which is the design document that describes the detailed as built implementation of the requirements contained in the ird the icd is one of the two primary products of the interface process and is usually developed by the owner of the interface interface control planning which is a document that forms the formal management system of interface controls to ensure physical and functional compatibility between interfacing hardware software and facilities the interface planning document also provides the means for identifying and resolving interface incompatibilities and for determining the impact of interface design changes it contains the templates for preparing revising and processing interface control documents unique to the program and addresses supplier participation in the interface process interface working group iwg which is the forum is established for discussing interface issues iwg meetings serve two purposes to ensure the effective detailed definition of interfaces by all cognizant parties and to expedite the addition of initial irds icds and subsequent drawing changes to the baseline by encouraging resolution of interface issues interface register which tracks and record all interface issues a dossier or chronicle of events this is described later fig 9 shows a timeline for various stage interface management and expected system maturity at each stage it also shows the progression of system readiness as the design matures trl increase and risk reduces 7 quantifying the interface volatility this paper uses a numerical dsm for showing various levels of interaction and interface volatility or risk risks in this paper primarily refer to commercial loss such as the cost of correcting errors made to integrating two pieces of equipment ensuring that all interfacing subsystems indicated in the requirement agree with the content of the requirement is known as the interface requirements reconciliation reconciliation can be difficult since the custodian of the requirement must convince other subsystems about the necessity and attainability of the requirement however any un reconciled interface requirements are regarded as unfinished and therefore an outstanding issue different rating schemes have been proposed to differentiate the importance or complexity at the interface when using component dsm models in previous literature ranging from simple binary ones to weighted rating scales to ones that discriminate between different dependency types in order to include more information within the dsm model weighted rating scales can be used for example a 0 to 10 rating scale representing dependency strengths from no dependency to weak dependencies to strong dependencies fig 10 shows pimmler and eppinger 1994 proposal for the definition of the interface they also proposed to rate the interface according to their perceived risk to the project these rating schemes are not very informative for the topside equipment which must be sequential for most of the equipment yasseri 2015 proposed a rating scheme for the interfaces of subsea production equipment which is more useful it should be noted that in most cases topside modules are structurally connected to the fpso as well as connected via the pipe rack and not each other each module is separately connected to communication and power lines this paper defines the concept of interface volatility as a measure of technical risk leading to commercial loss interface volatility is defined as the product of two factors namely information changeability ic and interfaces sensitivity is thus yasseri 2015 1 i n t e r f a c e v o l a t i t y i s i c interface volatility iv is used to measure the volatility of the dependent components located in the rows of the dsm with respect to changes received from an input component located in the columns of the dsm information changeability ic determines the possibility that information provided by an input component can change after the initial design each input component has its own ic score which quantifies the probability of data to change in this paper one value is assigned to a component on both sides of the interface however assigning different values would not pose difficulty in the application information sensitivity is describes the sensitivity of the dependent subsystem located in the rows to changes in the component feeding into it located in columns the estimated changeability of information ic originating from a subsystem is categorized in three levels in this paper as shown in fig 11 using further levels serves no purpose as there may not be enough granularity to make a useful decision is depends on the strength of dependency between two particular components i s describes the physical nature of the interface while ic is related to the variability of input thus they are not related and they measure two different aspects of a design interface volatility iv is then multiplied by the technical risk tr of the two interfacing components and entered at the intersection of the row of the dependent component and column of the input component annex a of api 17 n 2009 gives guidance as to how the decision should be made technical risk tr indicates the sources of uncertainties which should reduce as more definition is added to the design that is as the design matures hence increase of trl tr reduces the purpose of tr is to identify potential technical risks by looking at what is different from before it is an assessment of the influence of a number of risk factors that can contribute to the likelihood of failure following api 17 n 2009 five criteria have been defined reliability complexity architecture environment and organization that are assessed against five different levels of risk based on the perceived deviation from previous experience the risk levels for each risk factor are defined in table 2 the proposed metrics are based on api with slight modification interface volatility iv is then multiplied by the technical risk tr of the two interfacing components and entered at the intersection of the row of the dependent component and column of the input component annex a of api 17 n 2009 gives guidance as to how the decision should be made technical risk tr indicates the sources of uncertainties which should reduce as more definition is added to the design e g as trl increases tr reduces the purpose of tr is to identify potential technical risks by looking at what is different from as shown in fig 3 the lower the trl the lower the higher is the technical risk technology becomes a source of risk if there is a likelihood that the technology will not reach trl 7 in time to meet the required in service condition this judgment is based on expert assessment and may include considerations such as are the technical requirements completely known what are the time and resources available what is the level of difficulty in maturing technology is this an extension of previously developed technology or is it leading edge technology does the system use new technology or components that have never been produced in a factory environment is a new manufacturing process or technique involved what is the availability of expertise do the developers have expertise in this area have the developers done similar development in the past does a particular technology represent a scale up or scale down that has never been achieved are there new materials being used it is important to note that the technological readiness may differ from one trl level to the next for example individual components may be commercially available implying that the risk for procurement at the component level is low however if these components have not yet been integrated and shown to fulfill the required functions in the required environment at the next trl level the risk at this higher level is considered high five sub criteria are given for every six primary criteria in table 2 subcriteria may be ranked by a single expert of a group of experts yasseri 2012 a simple way would be to score each attribute using a binary system of zero and one a demanding attribute is scored one otherwise is zero summing all scores then dividing it by 5 and rounding it up to the nearest whole number gives an estimate of tr an average overall score of less than one is rounded up to one technical risk at the beginning of development is set to 5 and reduces as the project reaches commissioning and completion where api s trl is 7 see fig 9 once the tr values have been entered in the spreadsheet for each component in the dsm table 4 for the example case the spreadsheet automatically calculates the overall interface volatility for each interface these values are calculated based on the following formula eppinger and browning 2012 2 c r i t i c a l i t y o f i n t e r f a c e b e t w e e n a b t r o f a t r o f b i c i s the interface criticality is intended to provide an overall view of the interfaces technical and design risk and to identify the patterns of system level risk cells with high value indicate a higher risk for interface reconciliation 8 example fig 12 is a process flow diagram pfd of an fpso s topside processing facilities showing all the major equipment this figure shows that the topside has been partitioned into nine modules which are described in table 3 the topside modules can range from one to a very large number however from other consideration such as specialty of fabricators road and sea transportation lifting capacity offshore work concurrent engineering fabrication etc a topside consisting of somewhere around 10 modules has emerged as an optimal modularization it can be shown that the partitioning as shown in fig 12 yields substantially less external interfaces within the limitations which are mentioned above table 4 shows the dsm for the topside modules of fig 12 for the sake of simplicity as well as keeping the size of dsm within the journal page size some equipment is bundled with other equipment modules or subsystems which are shown are labeled in fig 12 diagonals are used to link to another worksheet which contains further information about interfaces such as the interface register entries which are relevant to that module fig 13 this example has a symmetric structure where all couplings have bi directional rather than hierarchical dependency unidirectional which is typical in assembling equipment the installation process is another typical example where hierarchical dependency occurs namely one task must be completed before another task can begin for this reason process dsm representations are generally asymmetric each intersecting column and row corresponds to a set of the interface register ir which is produced to identify the interface issues the interfaces between various subsystems are stored in a worksheet and hyperlinked to the system s dsm using the diagonals cells this can also be useful in linking and generating connectivity between the interface and other project data the worksheet can contain all sorts of information the example shown in fig 13 shows how interface information can be documented as a simple spreadsheet by interrogating this the project managers can determine the completion status of all identified interfaces this register is continually updated while keeping the history in excel the history can be hidden to avoid clutter for each high level interface there may be several sub level interfaces which will also require recording and managing these will be listed on the interface register under other data that can be included to record the interface specifications the resulting database can be used to generate icds similar dsms are constructed for other subsystems input and output of each are parts of the external interface of the system to system connectivity additionally each module will have its own dsm again with definable input and output table 4 is one large single layer dsm where all topside equipment are included in one dsm however the size of dsm may get so large that its handing becomes too difficult a good policy would be to present a system in several layers as shown in fig 14 pektas s t 2014 9 concluding remarks a process is outlined for managing the interface between components of an fpso in design fabrication and installation using the topside processing equipment as an example the design structure matrix dsm is used to show how to cluster them into suitable size weight modules and specialization which also minimizes the number of external interfaces between contractors dsm is a visual aid for showing dependencies interfaces between components that tie components together through commonly shared requirements browning 2016 an example of all primary topside equipment on an fpso is mapped into a two dimensional matrix in a spreadsheet the off diagonal cells are used to record the criticality of the interface as a function of the sensitivity of its design to change and the likelihood of change as well as the technical technology risk the diagonal of the matrix is used to link every subsystem to another worksheet where details and history of the interfaces are recorded the interface register this can also be used in linking and generating connectivity between the interface model and other project data in this example each module is taken as a black box with input and output each module is of course is a system for its fabricator and the exact same method can also be used the highest level of dms is shown for an fpso s primary modules one can construct as many layers as deemed necessary for clarity this spreadsheet based interface management contains all information needed to assure the system integration and compatibility at interfaces it supports the configuration management effort by ensuring that configuration decisions are made with a full understanding of their impact outside the area of the change it also contributes to the interface requirements reconciliation yasseri and bhai 2018 2019 namely that all the interfacing subsystems comply with the content of the requirement this interface dsm is updated when a new piece of information becomes available to reflect changes in the project status many decision making methods involve the use of scoring methods in which the importance of each factor is rated on an ordinal scale the resulting values are then combined by additive weighting or by multiplication to compute an aggregate measure some of such methodologies go even further in employing methods to determine the ranking yasseri 2012 ordinal scales are used for scoring interface volatility and technical risk acknowledgments the authors wish to acknowledge their debts to mr chris millyards and professor y s yang seoul national university for their many helpful comments authors also would like to express their thanks to brunel university london which has supported this work

1 introduction according to bendiksen and young 2015 there was a steady increase in commissioning time leading to overruns from 2008 to 2014 they state that due to inadequate interface management im during the design phase design changes are the norm which must be accommodated at the commissioning stage this paper proposes a framework to minimize late design changes im is a process which should stand the test of being reasonable however some processes may be more efficient than the others in achieving the goal of integration with minimal cost the proposed process for interface management starts with mapping all component of the system in some desirable order using dsm using the clustering technique components are grouped into several modules with minimal interfaces between them one should seek an optimal solution considering other constraints e g weight footprint etc and there may be several near optimal solutions the next step is to identify interface requirements between these modules document them get agreement between parties design them and verify them the tracking of progress is done via an interface register a case study is presented to demonstrate the proposed framework and quantify risks in recent years interface management im practices have emerged to address the challenges of managing large complex capital projects these challenges include scale multisite fabrication geographical distribution various working practices and different expertise is required to develop an offshore field fig 1 most problems occur at the interface between contractors during development buede 2012 handling the interaction between contractors and successfully integrating the various pieces of equipment is a major task which could involve over 1000 interfaces even within a single contractor s organization the contribution of many disciplines is required if the water is very deep or the field is marginal or scattered or located at some distance from the shore then an fpso is a suitable choice paik j k and thayamballi 2007 there are many constraints to be considered for example equipment that contains significant amounts of liquid should be located near to the centerline axis to minimize the wave action which acts as a constraint on the layout such practicalities as well as other considerations such as the availability of lifting equipment and specialization of fabricators etc will affect the layout which in turn affect the interfaces hölttä otto k 2005 the primary topside units are shown in fig 2 which are power generation and distribution heating and cooling mediums fuel gas mechanical handling water treatment seawater lift workshops maintenance and repair desalting system piping systems regeneration instrument and electrical room storage service water cranes freshwater produced water treatment sewage treatment injection methanol sodium hypochlorite ea seawater treatment filtration de aeration de sulfating fire protection and blast protection are part of the interface between process modules and the utility modules mitra n k 2018 any equipment belongs to a certain system group thus only the primary systems are named in fig 2 which is one realization of many ways of grouping equipment a case study of im for the topside equipment is given to demonstrate the im process during the design fabrication and installation of an fpso the same approach can be used for the commissioning phase as wells as for other parts of the development 2 systems engineering approach the time that a project takes from its inception to its end is generally referred to as its lifecycle incose 2015 the life cycle is a concept used in systems engineering to track an asset from its beginning to its decommissioning all systems engineering models and processes are organized around the concept of a life cycle but the detailed views implementations and terminology may be different a project typically has the following major phases each with its own agenda and issues appraise select define execution implementation operation and decommissioning fig 3 the left hand side of the v fig 3 represents concept development and the decomposition of requirements into functional and physical entities that can be architected designed and fabricated federal aviation administration 2008 the right hand side represents the integration of these entities which include suitable testing to verify that they satisfy the requirements and their ultimate transition into the operation as shown in fig 3 the system is decomposed broken down into functional building blocks subsystems and sub sub systems subsystems can then be designed and fabricated in parallel use of decomposition makes problems simpler and it is easier to map existing solutions and expertise to problems in the ideal case decomposition leads to sub problems that are sufficiently well defined and they may have standard solutions however there may still involve substantial work in adapting the known solutions to the new context fig 4 shows the breakdown of activities as described in the v model of fig 3 3 domain mapping fpso modules can be represented by a graph or a network of interacting block diagrams the dependencies between elements can be mapped into a matrix called a dsm eppinger and browning 2012 which is a square matrix with identical row and column labels an off diagonal mark signifies the interaction relationship or dependency of one component to another the component based dsm browning 2001 which is used in this paper comprises of a list of components in some desirable order fig 5 shows a simple system with five interdependent components and its representation using dsm is shown in table 1 the components of a system are shown as rows and columns in the matrix where the components are listed in the same order along both axes table 1 an off diagonal mark located within the matrix denotes an interface i e coupling between two components a number can be used to represent some quantity for example risk criticality or the volatility of the interface yasseri 2015 the diagonal of the square matrix is used to create a link to another worksheet which contains information about the interface table 1 shows a symmetrical matrix but asymmetrical matrices can be used to show different criticality for forward and backward dependencies reading down a column indicates that a component provides information to others in its associated row alternatively a component in the row receives information from the component in the corresponding column when reading across a row in the matrix dsm can be re organized into rows and columns such that all the information i e dependency marks in the new dsm flows forward and there is no feedback this transforms the dsm into a lower triangular form which is known as partitioning eppinger and browning 2012 reordering the dsm of an fpso s systems will not completely eliminate feedbacks but can minimize them and moves the rest as close as possible to the diagonal resulting in more interfaces within a module internal interfaces than between modules external interfaces in doing so fewer system elements will be involved in the iterative design cycle between contractors the ordering of rows and columns represent flow through time i e upstream activities in a design process precede downstream activities and terms like feedforward and feedback become meaningful when referring to interfaces operations on dsm relevant to this paper are epping and browning 2012 partitioning which is the process of reordering the dsm rows and columns such that the new dsm arrangement does not contain any feedback marks if possible thus transforming the dsm into a lower triangular form the objective is to move the feedback marks as close as possible to the diagonal clustering is grouping elements that have the most interaction into modules along the diagonal these modules consist of both sequential and iterative relationships tasks that share the most information are grouped together the aim of clustering is different from partitioning the objective is to increase iterations within the modules but reduce iteration between the modules browning 2001 areas between clusters may also contain dependencies these areas are referred to as the interface between clusters dependencies in the interface are the links between the modules 4 modularization fig 6 shows the division of deep water field development activities between various primary contractors such division creates interface issues between contractors as well as between equipment which must work together one important feature of interfaces between equipment is their physical or geometrical design i e size shape orientation etc helmer et al 2010 however to design these interfaces adequately the type of interactions that have to be performed through these interfaces must be well defined in addition to the transmission of forces moments and displacements between modules there may also be the transmission of fluid energy and data there are also hidden interactions such as vibration thermal expansion noise etc the interfaces between contractors will also cover schedule tolerances as well as controllable interactions such as thermal expansion vibration transmission forces and moment fig 7 shows a block diagram of the interfaces between various disciplines there are two parties at each interface the requester and the responder though two parties are partners in delivering mate able subsystems there are items that cannot tolerate strong interaction or are expensive to change in such a situation the cheaper item contactor is expected to accommodate changes to prevent excessive forces and moments being transmitted to the more expensive item during the execution phase of a project design defects may be detected which may require an iteration with the subsequent change requirements for the neighboring modules at interfaces alarcón l f and mardones d a 1998 fpso processing units are often grouped into several modules with manageable dimensions and weights in order to optimize the project schedule and cost this requires suitably chosen breakpoints between processing equipment at the early phase of development to exploit the full potential of modularization a module is a unit whose structural elements are tightly connected amongst themselves but relatively weakly connected to elements in other units clearly there are degrees of connection thus there are gradations of modularity baldwin and clark 2000 hölttä otto de weck 2007 equipment is acquired from various vendors by a primary contractor or the client and brought together to the fabrication yard to fit out a module modularization is also needed due to the specialization of equipment manufacturers reduction of onsite work to enhance concurrent engineering yassine and braha 2003 availability of transportation and lifting equipment etc this gives the advantage of an optimal number of lifts and interfaces with the fpso hull since each module needs a foundation to rest upon successful modularization is dependent on how interfaces between the different modules are defined modularization can be achieved by clustering of the dsm a cluster or module is commonly defined as a group of equipment that possesses a high number of internal dependencies compared to the external dependencies the lower part of table 1 shows a simple example of clustering results clustering reorders the rows and columns the clustering that is shown in table 1 is non overlapping clusters as each object is assigned to a single cluster module only non overlapping clusters are used in fpso technology in an overlapping cluster the interface units consist of male and female parts and each half is incorporated into one module modularization has the advantage that changes in one module has very little influence on another other than a change in input and output thus making the management of change process less complex however a topside module is not an isolated unit nor can it be designed as one with only the inputs and outputs by being aware of the transfer fluids power fuel etc management of the interfaces between the modules may simplify considerably if the flows and the equipment duties are well defined in every module then the effect of a change in one module is easier to trace thus re engineering work may be reduced changes in the process due to new reservoir information can affect many disciplines changes can also result when actual equipment data like sizes and weight differ from the expected data due to different vendor or technology change generally any change can propagate throughout the system but modularization may help to contain it within one module s boundary four design aspects together with the safety requirements dictate the topside layout and hence interfaces between equipment these are accessibility of all equipment for operational repair and maintenance purposes requiring a reservation area in the layout for access routes gangways and trapdoors for direct access to all topside equipment crane access for loading and offloading and work on the deck another issue is escaping routes which can be combined with access routes the functionality of the layout depends on the equipment arrangement the processes must flow undisturbed some equipment is location fixed e g crude separation unit due to its processing needs the separation tanks have to be located as closely to mid ship as possible since they are highly affected by the ship motion however some items may be housed together to save space e g piping cables and other lines on the deck however the grouping should be checked against operational safety standards the structure of the topside and all connections must have adequate strength robustness and resilience accounting also for the self weight of the vessel and the hull motions caused by the sea states if heavy and tall installations are necessary they will need to be located near mid ship the mechanical handling laydown areas areas reserved on the topside for repair and maintenance activities the layout and sizing of the area depend mainly on the equipment sizes considering the accessibility of the deck and the general material and tool storage a workshop should be on the deck for maintenance and repair of small sized equipment and for main storage of materials and tools the workshop has to be well accessible for movement of equipment its function is temporary storage of objects which are just offloaded onto the vessel or are prepared for transportation the architecture of a system sharman and yassine 2004 determines the flexibility of the system to future changes which may arise from a variety of reasons such as new reservoir conditions or technical innovations tilstra and wood 2009 the optimum topside layout is considered to be an architecture that is tolerant to changes hence enabling maximum flexibility to accommodate future needs 5 interface when one subsystem provides a flow of material information energy or physical contact to another subsystem then an interface exists between them blyler 2004 defines an interface as an input output relationship linking two subsystems the interface is defined as the boundary contact points between the two subsystems and appears identically in both subsystem specifications but it could have different verification methods at different sides of the interface when a system has a complex development and modification processes agreements between different engineering groups and different contractors on interfaces cannot be easily achieved lalli e al 1997 a complex system is a system with components interactions and interfaces which are not easy to describe understand predict manage design or change de weck et al 2011 eppinger 1997 interfaces within an organization are known as the internal interfaces interfaces between two or more contractors are termed as the external interfaces which are much more involved due to the differences in practices and procedures some interfaces are more critical because they reside at the boundary between many contractors modules and disciplines at the same time parslov and mortensen 2015 if there is an interaction between elements of two systems there is an interface an interface is defined as a common functional or physical boundary where the two systems interact wheatcraft 2010 proposed a three step approach to identifying defining and stating requirements for interfaces crawley et al 2004 suggested viewing an interface conceptually as a system element uddin et al 2015 presented an interface analysis framework for systems analysis with the intention of supporting interface definitions which consist of a template or checklist of various aspects related to the interactions exchanged at the interface interaction at the interface involves the flow of material energy and data as well as a spatial and physical relationship the spatial and physical relationships relate to the formal aspects of system integration zheng et al 2016 argues for a better classification of interfaces in multi disciplinary product development and proposes a new classification consisting of four classes geometric interface energy interface control interface and data interface parslov and mortensen 2015 presented a review of interface definitions in the literature pimmler and eppinger 1994 identified four types of interactions spatial proximity material flow information flow and energy exchange they define an interaction strength which reflects the level or degree of dependency among the components in contrast a binary dsm shows the absence or presence of interaction the definition of the interfaces evolves with the design and it is documented in the interface requirement documents irds they are agreements and statements of fact needed for the design to progress ird drives the design of interfaces and must be verified the interface requirements are not recorded in the system s requirements which are the client s requirements since they are one possible realization which enables the system to operate and there may be more than one solution the ird defines the nature of the interaction which includes what each system looks like at the interface what the characteristics are of the matter crossing the interface and the media involved in the interaction another document is developed that establishes the requirements to which the interfaces should be designed and developed these documents often called the interface control documents icds an icd specifies what is required to correctly connect subsystems in an overall system icds contain the functional physical performance and design requirements for inter system interfaces icds are not intended to show the detailed data that would normally appear on design drawings instead they show parameters characteristics or configurations that are necessary to ensure that the designed subsystems will operate together as intended icds must be analyzed for compatibility each time a change to the interface definitions occurs a compatibility analysis must be performed to demonstrate the completeness and correctness of interface information demonstrating correctness means providing a record that shows interfaces have been examined for having the right form fit and function for the interacting subsystems documenting agreements and committing to them is a crucial means of preventing design conflicts and re work the purpose of an icd is to guarantee that subsystems designed by different engineering agencies are compatible use of icds is particularly helpful when a product is composed of subsystems that are described by different models e g mechanical electrical hydraulic etc in such situations it is very difficult to have a product representation that includes all such variety of subsystems and defines the interfaces between them in such cases icds can be supplied as separate documents that describe the interfaces among subsystems 6 interfaces of an fpso an fpso project involves various disciplines and takes place in an extended period of time and may involve participants in different offices or even countries the interfacing parties must agree on the definitions in the interface and both interacting systems need to include the corresponding interface requirements in their requirement documents european space agency requirements and standard division 2013 the interface requirements should trace to each other a common definition in the icd and a common parent yasseri et al 2019 each subsystem equipment will have a drawing showing all the internal interfaces each of the interfacing systems modules will contain a context or boundary diagram showing their external interfaces interface verification occurs at many stages during the integration of subsystems yasseri 2014 yasseri et al 2019 it is carried out to demonstrate that the design and implementation conform to the icd and it will be described by formal procedures validation of the interface requirements will take place at the factory and again at the marine base each lead party is responsible for their assigned interface test at the marine base the respective interface will go through integration tests to validate the complete system compliance against the system design specification the overall system integration plan will elaborate on what and how system integration tests must be performed yasseri et al 2019 the interface management is at the heart of the multi disciplinary nature of systems engineering which covers what is necessary in order to connect the individual pieces of the system together into a working system fosse and delp 2013 interface management concerns the coordination and management of the interfaces between the hull and its topside and the interfaces between modules on the topside fig 8 shows the interface management process the objective of the interface management process is to guarantee the proper functioning of a system composed of many interfacing sub systems ineffective interface management is often responsible for the failure of large systems projects interface mismatches causing delays in commissioning excessive re work and cost over run interface integrity is particularly important with projects involving stringent safety and security requirements as explained in the previous section the following issues must be taking care of for an fpso project interface requirements which identifies functional or physical attributes that are required to exist at a common boundary this boundary can exist between two or more functions system elements configuration items or systems interface requirements document ird which contains interface requirements between two elements including the type of interface e g electrical pneumatic hydraulic etc and the interface characteristics performance functional or physical ird is the primary documentation of the interface requirements system interface requirements which are requirements whose fulfilment involve multiple subsystems not all subsystems involved own the requirement interface requirements reconciliation requires agreement among multiple subsystem vendors fabricators who may not share the same interest interface control document icd which is the design document that describes the detailed as built implementation of the requirements contained in the ird the icd is one of the two primary products of the interface process and is usually developed by the owner of the interface interface control planning which is a document that forms the formal management system of interface controls to ensure physical and functional compatibility between interfacing hardware software and facilities the interface planning document also provides the means for identifying and resolving interface incompatibilities and for determining the impact of interface design changes it contains the templates for preparing revising and processing interface control documents unique to the program and addresses supplier participation in the interface process interface working group iwg which is the forum is established for discussing interface issues iwg meetings serve two purposes to ensure the effective detailed definition of interfaces by all cognizant parties and to expedite the addition of initial irds icds and subsequent drawing changes to the baseline by encouraging resolution of interface issues interface register which tracks and record all interface issues a dossier or chronicle of events this is described later fig 9 shows a timeline for various stage interface management and expected system maturity at each stage it also shows the progression of system readiness as the design matures trl increase and risk reduces 7 quantifying the interface volatility this paper uses a numerical dsm for showing various levels of interaction and interface volatility or risk risks in this paper primarily refer to commercial loss such as the cost of correcting errors made to integrating two pieces of equipment ensuring that all interfacing subsystems indicated in the requirement agree with the content of the requirement is known as the interface requirements reconciliation reconciliation can be difficult since the custodian of the requirement must convince other subsystems about the necessity and attainability of the requirement however any un reconciled interface requirements are regarded as unfinished and therefore an outstanding issue different rating schemes have been proposed to differentiate the importance or complexity at the interface when using component dsm models in previous literature ranging from simple binary ones to weighted rating scales to ones that discriminate between different dependency types in order to include more information within the dsm model weighted rating scales can be used for example a 0 to 10 rating scale representing dependency strengths from no dependency to weak dependencies to strong dependencies fig 10 shows pimmler and eppinger 1994 proposal for the definition of the interface they also proposed to rate the interface according to their perceived risk to the project these rating schemes are not very informative for the topside equipment which must be sequential for most of the equipment yasseri 2015 proposed a rating scheme for the interfaces of subsea production equipment which is more useful it should be noted that in most cases topside modules are structurally connected to the fpso as well as connected via the pipe rack and not each other each module is separately connected to communication and power lines this paper defines the concept of interface volatility as a measure of technical risk leading to commercial loss interface volatility is defined as the product of two factors namely information changeability ic and interfaces sensitivity is thus yasseri 2015 1 i n t e r f a c e v o l a t i t y i s i c interface volatility iv is used to measure the volatility of the dependent components located in the rows of the dsm with respect to changes received from an input component located in the columns of the dsm information changeability ic determines the possibility that information provided by an input component can change after the initial design each input component has its own ic score which quantifies the probability of data to change in this paper one value is assigned to a component on both sides of the interface however assigning different values would not pose difficulty in the application information sensitivity is describes the sensitivity of the dependent subsystem located in the rows to changes in the component feeding into it located in columns the estimated changeability of information ic originating from a subsystem is categorized in three levels in this paper as shown in fig 11 using further levels serves no purpose as there may not be enough granularity to make a useful decision is depends on the strength of dependency between two particular components i s describes the physical nature of the interface while ic is related to the variability of input thus they are not related and they measure two different aspects of a design interface volatility iv is then multiplied by the technical risk tr of the two interfacing components and entered at the intersection of the row of the dependent component and column of the input component annex a of api 17 n 2009 gives guidance as to how the decision should be made technical risk tr indicates the sources of uncertainties which should reduce as more definition is added to the design that is as the design matures hence increase of trl tr reduces the purpose of tr is to identify potential technical risks by looking at what is different from before it is an assessment of the influence of a number of risk factors that can contribute to the likelihood of failure following api 17 n 2009 five criteria have been defined reliability complexity architecture environment and organization that are assessed against five different levels of risk based on the perceived deviation from previous experience the risk levels for each risk factor are defined in table 2 the proposed metrics are based on api with slight modification interface volatility iv is then multiplied by the technical risk tr of the two interfacing components and entered at the intersection of the row of the dependent component and column of the input component annex a of api 17 n 2009 gives guidance as to how the decision should be made technical risk tr indicates the sources of uncertainties which should reduce as more definition is added to the design e g as trl increases tr reduces the purpose of tr is to identify potential technical risks by looking at what is different from as shown in fig 3 the lower the trl the lower the higher is the technical risk technology becomes a source of risk if there is a likelihood that the technology will not reach trl 7 in time to meet the required in service condition this judgment is based on expert assessment and may include considerations such as are the technical requirements completely known what are the time and resources available what is the level of difficulty in maturing technology is this an extension of previously developed technology or is it leading edge technology does the system use new technology or components that have never been produced in a factory environment is a new manufacturing process or technique involved what is the availability of expertise do the developers have expertise in this area have the developers done similar development in the past does a particular technology represent a scale up or scale down that has never been achieved are there new materials being used it is important to note that the technological readiness may differ from one trl level to the next for example individual components may be commercially available implying that the risk for procurement at the component level is low however if these components have not yet been integrated and shown to fulfill the required functions in the required environment at the next trl level the risk at this higher level is considered high five sub criteria are given for every six primary criteria in table 2 subcriteria may be ranked by a single expert of a group of experts yasseri 2012 a simple way would be to score each attribute using a binary system of zero and one a demanding attribute is scored one otherwise is zero summing all scores then dividing it by 5 and rounding it up to the nearest whole number gives an estimate of tr an average overall score of less than one is rounded up to one technical risk at the beginning of development is set to 5 and reduces as the project reaches commissioning and completion where api s trl is 7 see fig 9 once the tr values have been entered in the spreadsheet for each component in the dsm table 4 for the example case the spreadsheet automatically calculates the overall interface volatility for each interface these values are calculated based on the following formula eppinger and browning 2012 2 c r i t i c a l i t y o f i n t e r f a c e b e t w e e n a b t r o f a t r o f b i c i s the interface criticality is intended to provide an overall view of the interfaces technical and design risk and to identify the patterns of system level risk cells with high value indicate a higher risk for interface reconciliation 8 example fig 12 is a process flow diagram pfd of an fpso s topside processing facilities showing all the major equipment this figure shows that the topside has been partitioned into nine modules which are described in table 3 the topside modules can range from one to a very large number however from other consideration such as specialty of fabricators road and sea transportation lifting capacity offshore work concurrent engineering fabrication etc a topside consisting of somewhere around 10 modules has emerged as an optimal modularization it can be shown that the partitioning as shown in fig 12 yields substantially less external interfaces within the limitations which are mentioned above table 4 shows the dsm for the topside modules of fig 12 for the sake of simplicity as well as keeping the size of dsm within the journal page size some equipment is bundled with other equipment modules or subsystems which are shown are labeled in fig 12 diagonals are used to link to another worksheet which contains further information about interfaces such as the interface register entries which are relevant to that module fig 13 this example has a symmetric structure where all couplings have bi directional rather than hierarchical dependency unidirectional which is typical in assembling equipment the installation process is another typical example where hierarchical dependency occurs namely one task must be completed before another task can begin for this reason process dsm representations are generally asymmetric each intersecting column and row corresponds to a set of the interface register ir which is produced to identify the interface issues the interfaces between various subsystems are stored in a worksheet and hyperlinked to the system s dsm using the diagonals cells this can also be useful in linking and generating connectivity between the interface and other project data the worksheet can contain all sorts of information the example shown in fig 13 shows how interface information can be documented as a simple spreadsheet by interrogating this the project managers can determine the completion status of all identified interfaces this register is continually updated while keeping the history in excel the history can be hidden to avoid clutter for each high level interface there may be several sub level interfaces which will also require recording and managing these will be listed on the interface register under other data that can be included to record the interface specifications the resulting database can be used to generate icds similar dsms are constructed for other subsystems input and output of each are parts of the external interface of the system to system connectivity additionally each module will have its own dsm again with definable input and output table 4 is one large single layer dsm where all topside equipment are included in one dsm however the size of dsm may get so large that its handing becomes too difficult a good policy would be to present a system in several layers as shown in fig 14 pektas s t 2014 9 concluding remarks a process is outlined for managing the interface between components of an fpso in design fabrication and installation using the topside processing equipment as an example the design structure matrix dsm is used to show how to cluster them into suitable size weight modules and specialization which also minimizes the number of external interfaces between contractors dsm is a visual aid for showing dependencies interfaces between components that tie components together through commonly shared requirements browning 2016 an example of all primary topside equipment on an fpso is mapped into a two dimensional matrix in a spreadsheet the off diagonal cells are used to record the criticality of the interface as a function of the sensitivity of its design to change and the likelihood of change as well as the technical technology risk the diagonal of the matrix is used to link every subsystem to another worksheet where details and history of the interfaces are recorded the interface register this can also be used in linking and generating connectivity between the interface model and other project data in this example each module is taken as a black box with input and output each module is of course is a system for its fabricator and the exact same method can also be used the highest level of dms is shown for an fpso s primary modules one can construct as many layers as deemed necessary for clarity this spreadsheet based interface management contains all information needed to assure the system integration and compatibility at interfaces it supports the configuration management effort by ensuring that configuration decisions are made with a full understanding of their impact outside the area of the change it also contributes to the interface requirements reconciliation yasseri and bhai 2018 2019 namely that all the interfacing subsystems comply with the content of the requirement this interface dsm is updated when a new piece of information becomes available to reflect changes in the project status many decision making methods involve the use of scoring methods in which the importance of each factor is rated on an ordinal scale the resulting values are then combined by additive weighting or by multiplication to compute an aggregate measure some of such methodologies go even further in employing methods to determine the ranking yasseri 2012 ordinal scales are used for scoring interface volatility and technical risk acknowledgments the authors wish to acknowledge their debts to mr chris millyards and professor y s yang seoul national university for their many helpful comments authors

22396,the semi submersible mobile unit smu plays a vital role in the development of offshore oil and gas fields extreme weather conditions such as high winds waves and icy conditions impose an extraordinary load on the platform this paper presents a detailed operational failure model considering the wind and wave combined loading of extreme weather conditions the model is developed in a probabilistic framework using the bayesian network bn to assess the operational risk quantitatively the bn represents conditional dependencies of the weather effects and the operational characteristics of the smu the proposed model is tested and validated using a well known accident the ocean ranger the model predicts a very high probability of operational failure capsizing in the prevailing weather conditions which is confirmed by the fateful event on feb 15 1982 the proposed model is a useful and reliable tool to develop and monitor the operational failure envelope of the smu in given environmental conditions this work helps to promote safe and reliable offshore development keywords operational failure bayesian network physical reliability model semi submersible unit wind and wave load offshore failure model 1 introduction with the acceleration of urbanization land based oil exploitation alone cannot meet people s growing demand for energy attention has therefore shifted to offshore reservoirs which contain tremendous oil and gas resources however due to the complex and changeable marine environment offshore drilling accidents have occurred frequently in the last few decades through the analysis of public records and reports ismail et al 2014 stated that 15 1 of offshore drilling accidents are caused by storms and hurricanes second only to blowouts over the last 56 years previous research attempted to simulate the single environmental impact load on the smu ma et al 2017b developed a numerical simulation model to capture the dynamic stress response of the derrick under random wind loads lee et al 2018 studied derrick performance considering gravity and wind pressure instead of taking the smu as a whole system only one or several structural components have been analyzed note that all the elements working as a harmonious integration interact with the complicated marine environment liu et al 2018 addressed performance based analysis for the offshore jacket platform subject to wind loads banks and abdussamie 2017 developed wave and semi submersible interaction experiments using a piston type wavemaker however these models only analyzed the influence of a specific load with either wind or wave induced loading through numerical simulation model experiments or field tests gomathinayagam et al 2000 identified that wind load only accounts for 20 25 of total loads in cyclonic winds especially during extreme weather conditions any components of the offshore structure may fail subject to wind and wave combined impacts which potentially trigger a series of chain reactions therefore it is crucial to establish a damage assessment framework for the whole smu system which combines the predominant environmental loads wind and wave loads simultaneously research has been conducted to investigate the survivability of offshore platform structure from external loading ma et al 2017a applied ansys and aqwa to estimate structure and motion responses subjected to environmental loads ma et al 2019 put forward an improved mixture simulation ims method aiming to describe stress responses and structural displacement of a semi submersible offshore platform 3 d radiation and diffraction theory are employed to determine the frequence and time response of a semi submersible platform for the 100 year return period of environmental loads ghafari and dardel 2018 yu et al 2018 conducted hydrodynamic behaviour studies of tlp applying the johnswap wave type the aforementioned evaluation indicators pay more attention to either external hydrodynamic performance or internal structure dynamic analysis rather than assessing the operational risk quantitatively under the practical circumstance the operators want to ascertain the anticipate risk in the harsh environments to guide the further decision consequently how to evaluate the risk posed by rogue waves and violent winds quantitatively appears to be particularly important when it comes to employing risk analysis quantitative risk assessment qra is a widely used effective technique especially in offshore operational fields leimeister and kolios

integrated hydrodynamic analysis and failure modeling using bn to asses the reliability of marine floating structures as a result it can be concluded that bn is capable of estimating the overall operational probability of failure of an offshore structure based on conditional dependencies and subsystems failure probabilities in harsh environments accordingly this work aims to propose a robust

of failure are gathered thanks to different physical reliability models and joint probability functions which combine the dynamic probabilistic response to wind and wave loads with the application of bn the present study considers the weather on site and the unit configuration to estimate the overall probability of failure of an smu which provides an anticipated operational safety reference value for decision making this paper is organized as follows section 2 develops a methodology for operational failure modeling along with a simple case example the applicability is demonstrated with a case study in section 3 section 4 briefly explains the impact of the operational state and the combined loads and section 5 concludes the study 2 methodology to develop the operational failure model the proposed methodology to develop the operational failure model takes operational state and ultimate load bearing capacity into consideration then a bn is developed to assess the specific probability of failure under a certain set of circumstances to better illustrate the methodology fig 1 explains the framework of operational failure modeling of an smu in addition a simple case example is shown step by step 2 1 identify relevant characteristics physical and environmental the first step of the methodology is to identify the physical characteristics which include the fundamental configuration operational state and ultimate environmental conditions subsequently weather conditions on the scene should be clarified through related weather forecasts a simplified case is used to demonstrate the operational risk assessment model for the smu table 1 shows the geometric dimensions of the example smu for the sake of simplicity the aim is to assess the operational probability of failure under the harsh weather conditions of 80 knots wind speed and 70 ft wave height holmes 2015 developed the logarithmic profile to describe the wind speed above the ground the profile used a reference mean wind speed for 10 min at 10 m height above ground 1 z u h u 1 ln z h 2 ln h z 0 2 where z is the height h u is the reference mean wind speed for 10 min h is the reference height equal to 10 m and z 0 is the terrain roughness parameter wave fluid particle speed and acceleration are derived from the derivative of the wave velocity potential concerning displacement and then time respectively the formulae involved for fluid particle velocity and acceleration of the corresponding second order stokes wave theory are provided in dnvgl rp c205 2017 2 2 sections division and estimate components environmental loads according to the offshore structure design standard dnvgl os c201 2017 dnvgl os c101 2019 dnvgl os c201 2017 it is essential to take environmental loads wind and hydrodynamic loads induced by waves into consideration for mobile offshore units operating under harsh environmental conditions the smu is a widely deployed engineering equipment for offshore deep water oil and gas development which mainly consists of a derrick deck columns and pontoons in order to better assess the response of structural components probabilities of failure in detail the main components of the unit consisting of the derrick pontoons and columns are divided into four generated sections from section 1 to 4 as indicated in fig 2 every section includes many nodes which are statistically finite to be noticed these sections are also developed to form root nodes of the bn as a result wind and wave characteristics are determined through a wind speed profile and second order stokes wave theory accordingly table 2 presents wind wave load and sea pressure which are calculated for sections through wind load response modeling the morison model and the ultimate limit states method although the vertical wave loads sometimes exceed horizontal wave loads for the smu buoyancy force and gravitational force partially counteract the effects of the waves force additionally the deck is usually designed as grated and open non plated to reduce all kinds of contamination in the deck area and to avoid slip fall accidents bea et al 2001 insisted that vertical force is negligible compared to horizontal force on open grated decks technically the crux of the proposed methodology is to capture the probability of failure by incorporating the ultimate load and operational load regardless of the direction into the physical reliability model hence only the horizontal wave load and sea pressure are discussed in this paper the permissible loads and actual loads on the basis of real weather on the scene are presented in table 3 2 3 derive components probabilities of failure under combined loads the physical reliability model assumed that reliability is independent of the time parameter khakzad et al 2012 in this model the relationship between stress and strength is analyzed through a given distribution of the variables the probability of failure can be quantified by integrating the stress or strength distribution intuitively the loads are randomly distributed because of random weather conditions in nature as reflected in part a of fig 3 however every section presented in fig 2 includes many nodes which are statistically finite as mentioned every black line in part a of fig 3 represents various nodes resistance to loads which involve their specific responses owing to stress concentration unit configuration and so on to different loads for a particular node there exist a unique probabilistic response for dynamic external loads then it is assumed that the dynamic probabilistic response of all nodes in an individual section follows lognormal distribution for mathematical convenience with location parameter t m e d and shape parameter as shown in part b in fig 3 the x coordinate represents the corresponding maximum bearable weather response index such as wind speed or wave height for all nodes in a certain section instead of the physical properties of materials 2 p r l 0 l f r r d r φ 1 s l n l t m e d the next step is to determine the shape parameter and location parameter in equation 2 it is worth mentioning that both parameters can be related to mean μ and standard deviation σ through mathematical transformation a reasonable coefficient of variance cov helps to solve them in the work of cheng and yeung 2002 there is nearly 99 certainty that the cov is between 0 05 and 0 20 based on the available wind speed statistical data in 143 weather stations in the united states generally speaking cov stands for the degree of data concentration and dispersion as shown in fig 4 compared to the red case the blue case has a higher cov which is quite more even and scattered with the environmental loads producing small variations the resistance response of the red case tends to change dramatically due to stronger sensitivity generated by a smaller cov in an interview zhang 2017 robert bea a professor emeritus in civil engineering at the university of california berkeley said the pressures generated in those wave crests can exceed several thousand pounds per square inch he argues that offshore platforms can generally deal with wind and rainfall okay but cresting waves will do real damage therefore it is assumed that cov is 0 10 for every section s statistically distributed wind resistance response and 0 07 for statistically distributed wave resistance response dnvgl os c101 2019 suggested that the probability of exceedance for wind and wave induced loads should be no more than 10 2 under the maximum design loads once the ultimate load bearing capacity for each section loads produced by 100 knots wind speed and 100 ft wave height in the example respectively is calculated with load calculation models l and p are substituted into equation 2 with above loads separately the first step is to obtain the probability of failure under single load impact and 10 2 by combinations of simultaneous cov equations shape and location parameters can be solved to determine the probability of failure under any weather conditions on the scene for non specific sections against a single load it is known that the smu has to deal with multivariate site specific environmental loads in a harsh environment for example wind and wave induced loads affect deck and columns above the draft additionally pontoons and columns below the draft suffer the damage of sea pressure and wave induced loads in spite of the fact that the probabilistic response for a non specific section against a single load is solved sections different probabilistic responses regarding the different loads need to be combined in this paper the sections response for wind and wave loads are treated differently rather than using simple mathematical addition as a consequence a joint probability distribution can be applied to assess the components probability of failure joint probability functions forbes et al 2011 are known as multivariate distributions which can describe the distribution of multiple random variances concerning regions of n dimensional space moreover the probability of a set of random variables can be obtained through marginalization a bivariate lognormal distribution is adapted owing to the fact that not only are there positive values for loads without a clear increasing tendency but also because the marginal probability distribution follows a lognormal distribution the probability density function pdf of joint and marginal distributions of random variables x and y is f x y 1 2 π σ x σ y x y 1 ρ 2 exp 1 2 1 ρ 2 l n x μ x σ x 2 2 ρ l n x μ x σ x l n y μ y σ y l n y μ y σ y 2 3 x 0 y 0 1 ρ 1 4 f x 1 2 π σ x x exp 1 2 σ x 2 l n x e μ x 2 x 0 5 f y 1 2 π σ y y e x p 1 2 σ x 2 l n y e μ y 2 y 0 where ρ is the correlation coefficient σ x σ y are the standard deviation and μ x μ y are the mean of ln x ln y to conclude operationally safe wind and wave loads can be calculated using the design with affordable wind speed and wave height as provided in the smu safe operation manual respectively then the annual probability of exceedance is 10 2 for the operational safety wind and wave loads as stipulated by dnvgl os c101 2019 in addition marginal probability distribution parameters for every section under a single designed and manufactured maximum load response are calculated combining the assumed simultaneous cov equations ultimately the joint bivariate lognormal distribution is applied to determine the probability of failure for every analytical section under combined loads x wind loads and y wave loads at sections level parameters of the joint bivariate lognormal distribution are from the marginal distributions which are the components response to a single load in this paper it is assumed that wind load and wave load are independent of each other consequently the correlation coefficient ρ in the joint probability functions equals 0 under these conditions the probabilities of failure at components levels under combined wind and wave induced loading are completed during the monitor period in operation the maximum wind speed and wave height can be observed which are used to gain real time environmental load then the loads are substituted into the solved bivariate log normal distribution to assess the real time operational risk table 3 summarizes the probabilities of failure for each section of the principal components next step is to estimate the overall probability of failure with the aid of the bn 2 4 estimate the overall probability of failure using the bn a bn is a directed acyclic graphical model weber et al 2012 which is composed of random variables that represent root causes arcs that clarify dependencies between parent nodes and child nodes and the conditional probability that quantifies forward predictive inference 6 p a i 1 n p a b i p b i where p a b i is conditional probability and p b i is the probability of the ith variable conditional probability tables cpt of bns are achieved according to the weights of events which come from the survey with prior probabilities of primary events or subjective belief the weight of an event refers to the likelihood of occurrence of its upper events given the event s occurrence in this paper subjective opinions satisfy the primary purpose of assessing the probabilities of operational failure in a harsh environment the sixth generation of the deep water smu mainly consists of a derrick deck columns and pontoons the deck houses all drilling machinery including the derrick material storage and living facilities columns are located between the deck and pontoons supporting the unit with four to eight vertical cylinders pontoons composed of oil tanks ballast water tanks and drill water tanks provide flotation to the system in the demonstration example only corner columns are considered fig 5 illustrates the general bn assessing the probability of failure of an example smu the root nodes are from the sections of each structural component ds 1 4 represent sections 1 to 4 of the derrick similarly cs 1 4 and ps 1 4 represent sections 1 to 4 of the corner columns and pontoons as illustrated in fig 2 in order to distinguish the damage caused by the section itself response to environmental loads and the adjacent section the suffix s is applied for example ds3 indicates the damage caused by environmental loads to section 3 of the derrick directly and ds3s expresses the damage caused by both environmental loads directly and collateral debris from section 2 of the derrick because of the unit configuration it is assumed that only two adjacent sections interact with the debris trajectory in short the greater the height of the section the greater the mutual influence factor is since the uppermost section has the strongest potential of both kinetic and gravitational failure in this paper failure of any component derrick deck column and pontoon triggers the damage to the overall platform finally bn combines all the structural components to estimate the overall probability of failure pof under the weather on the scene to create a general assessing framework the results of the operational probabilities of failure for components and the platform are presented in table 3 the simulation results in table 3 show that the platform will bear a tolerable probability of failure if it operates under 80 knots of wind and a 70 ft wave height simultaneously generally in accordance with dnvgl os c101 2019 the operational failure envelope of in situ operational probability of failure can be defined as 10 2 1 the explanation for the operational failure envelope is that the higher the failure probability of the system the greater the destructive potential once the result of operational failure modeling based on weather data on the scene is calculated further recommendations are suggested to avoid catastrophic disaster if the estimated probability of failure falls in the operational failure envelope it is recommended to terminate the operation and drag the smu back to the harbour to reduce risk in contrast it is allowed to continue operating if the proper procedure is followed and real time conditions are monitored in case of rapidly changing weather conditions as an anticipated risk estimation model the proposed operational failure model is capable of capturing real time weather data on the scene and the current operational state to provide a safety operational perspective 3 testing of the model the ocean ranger disaster to verify the proposed methodology a case study was conducted the aim of the case study was to model the prevailing conditions during the ocean ranger oil rig disaster the accident occurred off the coast of newfoundland on feb 15 1982 heising and grenzebach 1989 earlier studied this accident using a fault tree with a beta factor to assess the capsize probability of the ocean ranger several core components including pumps valves and onboard liquids were utilized to analyze the failure probability using common cause failure according to the marine casualty report mobile offshore drilling unit modu ocean ranger us coast guard 1983 rogue waves which were still in the acceptable height range attacked the ocean ranger due to the design flaw the ballast control room with the open deadlight was located close to the drilling draft water line as a result the rig capsized and sank in the grand banks area 267 km east of st john s newfoundland us coast guard 1983 3 1 identify smu s physical characteristics and weather condition to begin table 4 illustrates the geometric scale parameters of the ocean ranger according to the final report by the us coast guard 1983 the ocean ranger was able to withstand 100 knot winds and 110 ft waves at the same time subsequently the wind speed predictive development model is the basis of the entire risk assessment process owing to the fact that both the wind s inflicted destruction potential and wind induced wave damage are dominated by wind speed thus a simple empirical database derived hurricane wind model is adapted for predicting the maximum wind of tropical cyclones kaplan and demaria 1995 the empirical decay model was derived based on landfall hurricanes which makes the application of the landfall reduction factor r and the effect of the distance inland reduction term c superfluous when dealing with an offshore hurricane therefore the modified hurricane wind speed decay model utilizes the weather report data us coast guard 1983 of 14 15 february 1982 when the ocean ranger sank as below 7 v t v b v 0 v b e α t 26 7 90 26 7 e 0 043 t where v b is background wind speed v 0 is maximum sustained 1 min surface wind speed and α is the decay constant h 1 fig 6 indicates that the maximum sustained 1 min wind speed is 90 knot which is below the ultimate wind speed for the ocean ranger the testimony and radio conversations us coast guard 1983 indicated that rogue waves up to 65 ft attacked the ocean ranger which destroyed the unprotected portlight of the ballast control room 3 2 divide the components sections and calculate corresponding environmental loads as a semi submersible offshore drilling unit the ocean ranger consisted of pontoons derrick supporting columns and main deck two pontoons which contained drill water ballast water and fuel provided floatation and rig power for the unit a total of eight columns consisting of four corner columns and four middle columns supported the deck and were located port and starboard respectively the ballast control room was in the starboard middle column 28 ft above the drilling draft protected by deadlights two deck layers provided the living space for crew and work areas above which was the 185 4 ft high drilling derrick fig 7 represents the generated structural units of the derrick middle and corner columns and pontoons similar to the demonstration example four different sections are divided for derrick corner column and pontoons while the ocean ranger had four more middle columns and the ballast control room was located at one of the middle columns noted that different components carry a diverse combination of loads except for the derrick in this paper it is clarified that pontoons and columns under the operational draft suffer simultaneously from the damage of wave load and sea pressure columns above the water line and deck are buffeted by the combined impact of wave and wind loads ideally the derrick should only be exposed to wind attacks results of a variety of loads for design manufactured permissible condition and actual operating state are summarized in table 5 3 3 derive components probabilities of failure under combined loads probabilities of failure at components levels under single loads can be solved by simultaneous equations of cov 0 10 for every section s statistically distributed wind resistance response and 0 07 for statistically distributed wave resistance response and substituting p and l in equation 2 with an annual probability of exceedance 10 2 and operational payload loads of affordable wind speed and wave height respectively subsequently equation 3 uses the shape and location parameters of equation 2 with the assumed correlation coefficient ρ 0 wind and wave independent assumption to derive joint probabilities of failure for the joint combined load the probabilities of failure for every component section are captured in table 5 as mentioned in the report us coast guard 1983 the deadlights which should have protected the porthole from wave impact were open because of improper operation for this case the strength reduction coefficient is introduced to model the damage probability of the portlight at first the portlights and the deadlights were regarded as a unit designed and built to withstand 110 ft waves and 100 knot winds simultaneously because of the improper operation the portlight was directly exposed to the harsh environments thus the acceptable wave load of a portlight should be reassessed based on dnvgl os c201 2017 the specific minimum yield stress for normal strength steel is 235 mpa however the ultimate permissible load on the protected portlight is 36 92 kpa because of configuration and stress concentration the maximum strength reduction coefficient is defined as the ratio of the specific minimum yield stress to the permissible load 8 r m σ m σ p 235 m p a 36 92 k p a 6368 56 where σ m is the specific minimum yield stress and σ p is the permissible load the r m is 6368 56 for deadlights for the sake of reliability and accuracy 50 of the r m is applied to the portlight which is made of tempered glass astm international 2018 stipulates the minimum surface compression for fully tempered glass is 69 mpa therefore the permissible load for a portlight is 2 17 10 4 pa as is shown in table 5 3 4 the bn establishment and overall probabilities of failure estimation it is worth pointing out that middle columns are taken into consideration because of the difference between the ocean ranger and the demonstration example ms 1 4 represent the probabilities of failure of sections 1 to 4 of the middle column caused by combined loads directly ms2s represents both the direct damage and collateral debris damage from adjacent section 1 of the middle column damage to the derrick can destroy the deck due to objects falling from high altitudes furthermore without the support of middle and corner columns the supporting system cannot reinforce the deck columns are installed above the pontoons which explains that once the sections of columns connected to the pontoons fails related pontoon sections inevitably rupture then onboard liquid is influenced because it is stored in the pontoon which further manages the buoyancy of the smu owing to a design flaw and improper operation the ballast control room where the portlights are installed is under the height of wave crests which leads to the failure of the deballast system if the portlights are destroyed by a rogue wave seawater can inundate the ballast control room causing the panel malfunction the panel which is protected by the portlight controls the pumping system and the ballast valves system which thereby control the onboard liquid finally damage probability modeling of the ocean ranger considering stability and operational components is tailored in fig 8 and table 5 with cpts provided in the appendix the probabilities of failure pof of several aforementioned root nodes heising and grenzebach 1989 including valves pumps ballast water drilling water and fuel were utilized to analyze failure probability using hugin 8 6 http www hugin com 4 results and discussion as can be seen from table 5 wind load rises significantly along with the increase of height which is calculated as 3 51 kpa for section 1 of the derrick while it is 1 69 kpa almost half as much for section 2 of columns in general the closer the height is to the sea horizon within a certain range the greater roughness leads to wind s speed increasing with altitude moreover the average failure probability of sections for the derrick is 1 8 10 4 however the average failure probabilities of sections for the deck columns and pontoons are approximately 5 7 10 5 2 7 10 5 and 4 2 10 5 in this regard derrick section experienced a relatively high probability of failure by almost one order of magnitude when compared to the other structural components in spite of the mutual interaction of adjacent sections owing to the debris trajectory the failure probability of the derrick 7 10 4 is still higher than for columns 1 10 4 and pontoons 2 10 4 the explanation for this phenomenon can be found through the application of bivariate joint probability distribution associated with the physical reliability model two different indicators are combined which is more accordant with the actual situation than combining various types of loads directly in other words it is dominated by the parameter which is closer to the maximum value and influenced by the other one in fact deck columns and pontoons suffer the impact from either the wind wave combined load or wave sea pressure combined load ideally the derrick bears only the wind induced load in this case the wind speed was 90 knots which reached 90 of the maximum critical value and the wave height was 65 ft only accounting for 59 of the limit thus wind speed in the prevailing conditions was the dominant indicator resulting in the derrick having a considerably high failure probability while the wave height that was far beyond the limit was the influenced parameter therefore components that bore either the load caused by the wave itself or the indirect dynamic sea pressure of each section were less likely to fail along with this line of consideration the simulation results in table 5 indicate that the ocean ranger operated with an incredible probability of failure of 0 5214 this is around 52 times as large as the lower limit of the operational failure envelope logically speaking if the estimated failure probability in the envelope fell dramatically termination of the operation to cease the risk should have been adopted on the contrary probabilities of failure for the main structural components such as the derrick middle and corner columns pontoons etc were about 10 4 the calculated failure probability was still acceptable which proved that the ocean ranger could have survived the storm nevertheless due to inappropriate manual operations the hurricane on 14 15 february 1982 destroyed the ocean ranger unfortunately as an improper operating procedure the deadlights which should have protected the porthole from wave impact were open as revealed by the reduction coefficient the permissible load of the portlight decreased significantly from 3 30 10 4 pa to 2 17 10 4 pa what is even worse the actual imposed load was 1 97 10 4 pa which led ineluctably to the increase of probability of failure the failure probability of the exposed portlight was derived as 0 6537 which is nearly 62 000 times greater than is the case under protection subsequently the branch which follows the panel malfunction failure of the pumping system and ballast valves severe listing flooding of the chain locker and failure of the support system occurred naturally because of the unexpected flooding of the chain locker room the failure probability of the supporting system rose sharply from 2 10 4 to 0 5205 it is highlighted that the damage to the portlight which lacked the protection of deadlights initiated the chain of events in agreement with the marine casualty report us coast guard 1983 this signifies that in the actual operational process not only do the design and manufacturing characteristics of the platform need to be taken into consideration but also that human operation practices can add considerable additional risk to the platform aiming to lower the damage caused by improper manual operation from the inherent design to emergency actions is essential if feasible it is recommended to strengthen the training knowledge and instruction for proper operational procedures to enhance reliability and mitigate potential hazards 5 conclusions the proposed operational failure model is able to capture real time weather data and their impact on safe operation which helps to promote safe and reliable offshore development it is highlighted that this study assesses the operational risk of the semi submersible mobile unit smu quantitatively under combined wind and wave induced loads with a probabilistic bayesian network bn framework which represents conditional dependencies of the weather s effect more specifically it presents a detailed operational failure model considering the combined loading of extreme weather conditions and the operational characteristics of the smu consistent and reliable results are provided as evidenced by the case study as an anticipated risk estimation model it is proved that the proposed model is a useful and reliable tool to develop and monitor an operational failure envelope of the smu in given environmental conditions for the sake of improvement it is recommended that more environmental loads such as currents and sea ice induced loads should be taken into consideration to simulate the operational disturbance for further research this paper has demonstrated the application of wind load response modeling the morison model and the ultimate limit states method to estimate the combined loading of extreme weather conditions imposed on the smu a physical reliability model and joint probability distribution function have been incorporated which provide a deeper insight to capture the risk response along with reducing the estimated failure probability through the implementation of bn with the operational failure envelope in given environmental conditions further operational recommendations are suggested in order to avoid catastrophic disaster acknowledgements the authors thankfully acknowledge the financial support from the natural science and engineering council of canada nserc and also the canada research chair crc tier i program in offshore safety and risk engineering appendix the subjective belief is adapted to assign cpts to reduce uncertainty which is sufficient to estimate the anticipated operational probability of failure for the purpose of a safety reference in short the greater the height of the section the greater the mutual influence factor is since the uppermost section has a strongest potential of both kinetic and gravitational furthermore it is assumed that only two adjacent sections interact with the debris trajectory as a consequence table 6 table 22 show the cpts of the developed bn x i represents the damage occurrence of component x i and w represents working condition f

22396,the semi submersible mobile unit smu plays a vital role in the development of offshore oil and gas fields extreme weather conditions such as high winds waves and icy conditions impose an extraordinary load on the platform this paper presents a detailed operational failure model considering the wind and wave combined loading of extreme weather conditions the model is developed in a probabilistic framework using the bayesian network bn to assess the operational risk quantitatively the bn represents conditional dependencies of the weather effects and the operational characteristics of the smu the proposed model is tested and validated using a well known accident the ocean ranger the model predicts a very high probability of operational failure capsizing in the prevailing weather conditions which is confirmed by the fateful event on feb 15 1982 the proposed model is a useful and reliable tool to develop and monitor the operational failure envelope of the smu in given environmental conditions this work helps to promote safe and reliable offshore development keywords operational failure bayesian network physical reliability model semi submersible unit wind and wave load offshore failure model 1 introduction with the acceleration of urbanization land based oil exploitation alone cannot meet people s growing demand for energy attention has therefore shifted to offshore reservoirs which contain tremendous oil and gas resources however due to the complex and changeable marine environment offshore drilling accidents have occurred frequently in the last few decades through the analysis of public records and reports ismail et al 2014 stated that 15 1 of offshore drilling accidents are caused by storms and hurricanes second only to blowouts over the last 56 years previous research attempted to simulate the single environmental impact load on the smu ma et al 2017b developed a numerical simulation model to capture the dynamic stress response of the derrick under random wind loads lee et al 2018 studied derrick performance considering gravity and wind pressure instead of taking the smu as a whole system only one or several structural components have been analyzed note that all the elements working as a harmonious integration interact with the complicated marine environment liu et al 2018 addressed performance based analysis for the offshore jacket platform subject to wind loads banks and abdussamie 2017 developed wave and semi submersible interaction experiments using a piston type wavemaker however these models only analyzed the influence of a specific load with either wind or wave induced loading through numerical simulation model experiments or field tests gomathinayagam et al 2000 identified that wind load only accounts for 20 25 of total loads in cyclonic winds especially during extreme weather conditions any components of the offshore structure may fail subject to wind and wave combined impacts which potentially trigger a series of chain reactions therefore it is crucial to establish a damage assessment framework for the whole smu system which combines the predominant environmental loads wind and wave loads simultaneously research has been conducted to investigate the survivability of offshore platform structure from external loading ma et al 2017a applied ansys and aqwa to estimate structure and motion responses subjected to environmental loads ma et al 2019 put forward an improved mixture simulation ims method aiming to describe stress responses and structural displacement of a semi submersible offshore platform 3 d radiation and diffraction theory are employed to determine the frequence and time response of a semi submersible platform for the 100 year return period of environmental loads ghafari and dardel 2018 yu et al 2018 conducted hydrodynamic behaviour studies of tlp applying the johnswap wave type the aforementioned evaluation indicators pay more attention to either external hydrodynamic performance or internal structure dynamic analysis rather than assessing the operational risk quantitatively under the practical circumstance the operators want to ascertain the anticipate risk in the harsh environments to guide the further decision consequently how to evaluate the risk posed by rogue waves and violent winds quantitatively appears to be particularly important when it comes to employing risk analysis quantitative risk assessment qra is a widely used effective technique especially in offshore operational fields leimeister and kolios 2018 the bayesian network bn is recommended for risk assessment as a graphic model it uses nodes and arcs to represent variables and relationships among them along with the conditional probability tables cpts the conditional dependencies are determined by either direct data or subjective expert systems to reduce uncertainty yeo et al 2016 abaei et al 2018b applied the bn to manage the risk arising from the storm of floating storage unit fsu based on the hydrodynamic accident load model barua et al 2016 mapped a dynamic fault tree into the bayesian network to perform a dynamic operational risk assessment with time dependent characteristics song et al 2016 employed a bn model to investigate occupational risks for offshore operations in harsh environments abaei et al 2018a integrated hydrodynamic analysis and failure modeling using bn to asses the reliability of marine floating structures as a result it can be concluded that bn is capable of estimating the overall operational probability of failure of an offshore structure based on conditional dependencies and subsystems failure probabilities in harsh environments accordingly this work aims to propose a robust and reliable operational failure model with the application of the bn for an smu considering wave and wind combined loads in a harsh environment to begin with environmental loads are calculated with the help of wind load response modeling dnvgl rp c205 2017 the morison model dnvgl rp c205 2017 and the ultimate limit states method dnvgl rp c103 2015 furthermore structural components probabilities of failure are gathered thanks to different physical reliability models and joint probability functions which combine the dynamic probabilistic response to wind and wave loads with the application of bn the present study considers the weather on site and the unit configuration to estimate the overall probability of failure of an smu which provides an anticipated operational safety reference value for decision making this paper is organized as follows section 2 develops a methodology for operational failure modeling along with a simple case example the applicability is demonstrated with a case study in section 3 section 4 briefly explains the impact of the operational state and the combined loads and section 5 concludes the study 2 methodology to develop the operational failure model the proposed methodology to develop the operational failure model takes operational state and ultimate load bearing capacity into consideration then a bn is developed to assess the specific probability of failure under a certain set of circumstances to better illustrate the methodology fig 1 explains the framework of operational failure modeling of an smu in addition a simple case example is shown step by step 2 1 identify relevant characteristics physical and environmental the first step of the methodology is to identify the physical characteristics which include the fundamental configuration operational state and ultimate environmental conditions subsequently weather conditions on the scene should be clarified through related weather forecasts a simplified case is used to demonstrate the operational risk assessment model for the smu table 1 shows the geometric dimensions of the example smu for the sake of simplicity the aim is to assess the operational probability of failure under the harsh weather conditions of 80 knots wind speed and 70 ft wave height holmes 2015 developed the logarithmic profile to describe the wind speed above the ground the profile used a reference mean wind speed for 10 min at 10 m height above ground 1 z u h u 1 ln z h 2 ln h z 0 2 where z is the height h u is the reference mean wind speed for 10 min h is the reference height equal to 10 m and z 0 is the terrain roughness parameter wave fluid particle speed and acceleration are derived from the derivative of the wave velocity potential concerning displacement and then time respectively the formulae involved for fluid particle velocity and acceleration of the corresponding second order stokes wave theory are provided in dnvgl rp c205 2017 2 2 sections division and estimate components environmental loads according to the offshore structure design standard dnvgl os c201 2017 dnvgl os c101 2019 dnvgl os c201 2017 it is essential to take environmental loads wind and hydrodynamic loads induced by waves into consideration for mobile offshore units operating under harsh environmental conditions the smu is a widely deployed engineering equipment for offshore deep water oil and gas development which mainly consists of a derrick deck columns and pontoons in order to better assess the response of structural components probabilities of failure in detail the main components of the unit consisting of the derrick pontoons and columns are divided into four generated sections from section 1 to 4 as indicated in fig 2 every section includes many nodes which are statistically finite to be noticed these sections are also developed to form root nodes of the bn as a result wind and wave characteristics are determined through a wind speed profile and second order stokes wave theory accordingly table 2 presents wind wave load and sea pressure which are calculated for sections through wind load response modeling the morison model and the ultimate limit states method although the vertical wave loads sometimes exceed horizontal wave loads for the smu buoyancy force and gravitational force partially counteract the effects of the waves force additionally the deck is usually designed as grated and open non plated to reduce all kinds of contamination in the deck area and to avoid slip fall accidents bea et al 2001 insisted that vertical force is negligible compared to horizontal force on open grated decks technically the crux of the proposed methodology is to capture the probability of failure by incorporating the ultimate load and operational load regardless of the direction into the physical reliability model hence only the horizontal wave load and sea pressure are discussed in this paper the permissible loads and actual loads on the basis of real weather on the scene are presented in table 3 2 3 derive components probabilities of failure under combined loads the physical reliability model assumed that reliability is independent of the time parameter khakzad et al 2012 in this model the relationship between stress and strength is analyzed through a given distribution of the variables the probability of failure can be quantified by integrating the stress or strength distribution intuitively the loads are randomly distributed because of random weather conditions in nature as reflected in part a of fig 3 however every section presented in fig 2 includes many nodes which are statistically finite as mentioned every black line in part a of fig 3 represents various nodes resistance to loads which involve their specific responses owing to stress concentration unit configuration and so on to different loads for a particular node there exist a unique probabilistic response for dynamic external loads then it is assumed that the dynamic probabilistic response of all nodes in an individual section follows lognormal distribution for mathematical convenience with location parameter t m e d and shape parameter as shown in part b in fig 3 the x coordinate represents the corresponding maximum bearable weather response index such as wind speed or wave height for all nodes in a certain section instead of the physical properties of materials 2 p r l 0 l f r r d r φ 1 s l n l t m e d the next step is to determine the shape parameter and location parameter in equation 2 it is worth mentioning that both parameters can be related to mean μ and standard deviation σ through mathematical transformation a reasonable coefficient of variance cov helps to solve them in the work of cheng and yeung 2002 there is nearly 99 certainty that the cov is between 0 05 and 0 20 based on the available wind speed statistical data in 143 weather stations in the united states generally speaking cov stands for the degree of data concentration and dispersion as shown in fig 4 compared to the red case the blue case has a higher cov which is quite more even and scattered with the environmental loads producing small variations the resistance response of the red case tends to change dramatically due to stronger sensitivity generated by a smaller cov in an interview zhang 2017 robert bea a professor emeritus in civil engineering at the university of california berkeley said the pressures generated in those wave crests can exceed several thousand pounds per square inch he argues that offshore platforms can generally deal with wind and rainfall okay but cresting waves will do real damage therefore it is assumed that cov is 0 10 for every section s statistically distributed wind resistance response and 0 07 for statistically distributed wave resistance response dnvgl os c101 2019 suggested that the probability of exceedance for wind and wave induced loads should be no more than 10 2 under the maximum design loads once the ultimate load bearing capacity for each section loads produced by 100 knots wind speed and 100 ft wave height in the example respectively is calculated with load calculation models l and p are substituted into equation 2 with above loads separately the first step is to obtain the probability of failure under single load impact and 10 2 by combinations of simultaneous cov equations shape and location parameters can be solved to determine the probability of failure under any weather conditions on the scene for non specific sections against a single load it is known that the smu has to deal with multivariate site specific environmental loads in a harsh environment for example wind and wave induced loads affect deck and columns above the draft additionally pontoons and columns below the draft suffer the damage of sea pressure and wave induced loads in spite of the fact that the probabilistic response for a non specific section against a single load is solved sections different probabilistic responses regarding the different loads need to be combined in this paper the sections response for wind and wave loads are treated differently rather than using simple mathematical addition as a consequence a joint probability distribution can be applied to assess the components probability of failure joint probability functions forbes et al 2011 are known as multivariate distributions which can describe the distribution of multiple random variances concerning regions of n dimensional space moreover the probability of a set of random variables can be obtained through marginalization a bivariate lognormal distribution is adapted owing to the fact that not only are there positive values for loads without a clear increasing tendency but also because the marginal probability distribution follows a lognormal distribution the probability density function pdf of joint and marginal distributions of random variables x and y is f x y 1 2 π σ x σ y x y 1 ρ 2 exp 1 2 1 ρ 2 l n x μ x σ x 2 2 ρ l n x μ x σ x l n y μ y σ y l n y μ y σ y 2 3 x 0 y 0 1 ρ 1 4 f x 1 2 π σ x x exp 1 2 σ x 2 l n x e μ x 2 x 0 5 f y 1 2 π σ y y e x p 1 2 σ x 2 l n y e μ y 2 y 0 where ρ is the correlation coefficient σ x σ y are the standard deviation and μ x μ y are the mean of ln x ln y to conclude operationally safe wind and wave loads can be calculated using the design with affordable wind speed and wave height as provided in the smu safe operation manual respectively then the annual probability of exceedance is 10 2 for the operational safety wind and wave loads as stipulated by dnvgl os c101 2019 in addition marginal probability distribution parameters for every section under a single designed and manufactured maximum load response are calculated combining the assumed simultaneous cov equations ultimately the joint bivariate lognormal distribution is applied to determine the probability of failure for every analytical section under combined loads x wind loads and y wave loads at sections level parameters of the joint bivariate lognormal distribution are from the marginal distributions which are the components response to a single load in this paper it is assumed that wind load and wave load are independent of each other consequently the correlation coefficient ρ in the joint probability functions equals 0 under these conditions the probabilities of failure at components levels under combined wind and wave induced loading are completed during the monitor period in operation the maximum wind speed and wave height can be observed which are used to gain real time environmental load then the loads are substituted into the solved bivariate log normal distribution to assess the real time operational risk table 3 summarizes the probabilities of failure for each section of the principal components next step is to estimate the overall probability of failure with the aid of the bn 2 4 estimate the overall probability of failure using the bn a bn is a directed acyclic graphical model weber et al 2012 which is composed of random variables that represent root causes arcs that clarify dependencies between parent nodes and child nodes and the conditional probability that quantifies forward predictive inference 6 p a i 1 n p a b i p b i where p a b i is conditional probability and p b i is the probability of the ith variable conditional probability tables cpt of bns are achieved according to the weights of events which come from the survey with prior probabilities of primary events or subjective belief the weight of an event refers to the likelihood of occurrence of its upper events given the event s occurrence in this paper subjective opinions satisfy the primary purpose of assessing the probabilities of operational failure in a harsh environment the sixth generation of the deep water smu mainly consists of a derrick deck columns and pontoons the deck houses all drilling machinery including the derrick material storage and living facilities columns are located between the deck and pontoons supporting the unit with four to eight vertical cylinders pontoons composed of oil tanks ballast water tanks and drill water tanks provide flotation to the system in the demonstration example only corner columns are considered fig 5 illustrates the general bn assessing the probability of failure of an example smu the root nodes are from the sections of each structural component ds 1 4 represent sections 1 to 4 of the derrick similarly cs 1 4 and ps 1 4 represent sections 1 to 4 of the corner columns and pontoons as illustrated in fig 2 in order to distinguish the damage caused by the section itself response to environmental loads and the adjacent section the suffix s is applied for example ds3 indicates the damage caused by environmental loads to section 3 of the derrick directly and ds3s expresses the damage caused by both environmental loads directly and collateral debris from section 2 of the derrick because of the unit configuration it is assumed that only two adjacent sections interact with the debris trajectory in short the greater the height of the section the greater the mutual influence factor is since the uppermost section has the strongest potential of both kinetic and gravitational failure in this paper failure of any component derrick deck column and pontoon triggers the damage to the overall platform finally bn combines all the structural components to estimate the overall probability of failure pof under the weather on the scene to create a general assessing framework the results of the operational probabilities of failure for components and the platform are presented in table 3 the simulation results in table 3 show that the platform will bear a tolerable probability of failure if it operates under 80 knots of wind and a 70 ft wave height simultaneously generally in accordance with dnvgl os c101 2019 the operational failure envelope of in situ operational probability of failure can be defined as 10 2 1 the explanation for the operational failure envelope is that the higher the failure probability of the system the greater the destructive potential once the result of operational failure modeling based on weather data on the scene is calculated further recommendations are suggested to avoid catastrophic disaster if the estimated probability of failure falls in the operational failure envelope it is recommended to terminate the operation and drag the smu back to the harbour to reduce risk in contrast it is allowed to continue operating if the proper procedure is followed and real time conditions are monitored in case of rapidly changing weather conditions as an anticipated risk estimation model the proposed operational failure model is capable of capturing real time weather data on the scene and the current operational state to provide a safety operational perspective 3 testing of the model the ocean ranger disaster to verify the proposed methodology a case study was conducted the aim of the case study was to model the prevailing conditions during the ocean ranger oil rig disaster the accident occurred off the coast of newfoundland on feb 15 1982 heising and grenzebach 1989 earlier studied this accident using a fault tree with a beta factor to assess the capsize probability of the ocean ranger several core components including pumps valves and onboard liquids were utilized to analyze the failure probability using common cause failure according to the marine casualty report mobile offshore drilling unit modu ocean ranger us coast guard 1983 rogue waves which were still in the acceptable height range attacked the ocean ranger due to the design flaw the ballast control room with the open deadlight was located close to the drilling draft water line as a result the rig capsized and sank in the grand banks area 267 km east of st john s newfoundland us coast guard 1983 3 1 identify smu s physical characteristics and weather condition to begin table 4 illustrates the geometric scale parameters of the ocean ranger according to the final report by the us coast guard 1983 the ocean ranger was able to withstand 100 knot winds and 110 ft waves at the same time subsequently the wind speed predictive development model is the basis of the entire risk assessment process owing to the fact that both the wind s inflicted destruction potential and wind induced wave damage are dominated by wind speed thus a simple empirical database derived hurricane wind model is adapted for predicting the maximum wind of tropical cyclones kaplan and demaria 1995 the empirical decay model was derived based on landfall hurricanes which makes the application of the landfall reduction factor r and the effect of the distance inland reduction term c superfluous when dealing with an offshore hurricane therefore the modified hurricane wind speed decay model utilizes the weather report data us coast guard 1983 of 14 15 february 1982 when the ocean ranger sank as below 7 v t v b v 0 v b e α t 26 7 90 26 7 e 0 043 t where v b is background wind speed v 0 is maximum sustained 1 min surface wind speed and α is the decay constant h 1 fig 6 indicates that the maximum sustained 1 min wind speed is 90 knot which is below the ultimate wind speed for the ocean ranger the testimony and radio conversations us coast guard 1983 indicated that rogue waves up to 65 ft attacked the ocean ranger which destroyed the unprotected portlight of the ballast control room 3 2 divide the components sections and calculate corresponding environmental loads as a semi submersible offshore drilling unit the ocean ranger consisted of pontoons derrick supporting columns and main deck two pontoons which contained drill water ballast water and fuel provided floatation and rig power for the unit a total of eight columns consisting of four corner columns and four middle columns supported the deck and were located port and starboard respectively the ballast control room was in the starboard middle column 28 ft above the drilling draft protected by deadlights two deck layers provided the living space for crew and work areas above which was the 185 4 ft high drilling derrick fig 7 represents the generated structural units of the derrick middle and corner columns and pontoons similar to the demonstration example four different sections are divided for derrick corner column and pontoons while the ocean ranger had four more middle columns and the ballast control room was located at one of the middle columns noted that different components carry a diverse combination of loads except for the derrick in this paper it is clarified that pontoons and columns under the operational draft suffer simultaneously from the damage of wave load and sea pressure columns above the water line and deck are buffeted by the combined impact of wave and wind loads ideally the derrick should only be exposed to wind attacks results of a variety of loads for design manufactured permissible condition and actual operating state are summarized in table 5 3 3 derive components probabilities of failure under combined loads probabilities of failure at components levels under single loads can be solved by simultaneous equations of cov 0 10 for every section s statistically distributed wind resistance response and 0 07 for statistically distributed wave resistance response and substituting p and l in equation 2 with an annual probability of exceedance 10 2 and operational payload loads of affordable wind speed and wave height respectively subsequently equation 3 uses the shape and location parameters of equation 2 with the assumed correlation coefficient ρ 0 wind and wave independent assumption to derive joint probabilities of failure for the joint combined load the probabilities of failure for every component section are captured in table 5 as mentioned in the report us coast guard 1983 the deadlights which should have protected the porthole from wave impact were open because of improper operation for this case the strength reduction coefficient is introduced to model the damage probability of the portlight at first the portlights and the deadlights were regarded as a unit designed and built to withstand 110 ft waves and 100 knot winds simultaneously because of the improper operation the portlight was directly exposed to the harsh environments thus the acceptable wave load of a portlight should be reassessed based on dnvgl os c201 2017 the specific minimum yield stress for normal strength steel is 235 mpa however the ultimate permissible load on the protected portlight is 36 92 kpa because of configuration and stress concentration the maximum strength reduction coefficient is defined as the ratio of the specific minimum yield stress to the permissible load 8 r m σ m σ p 235 m p a 36 92 k p a 6368 56 where σ m is the specific minimum yield stress and σ p is the permissible load the r m is 6368 56 for deadlights for the sake of reliability and accuracy 50 of the r m is applied to the portlight which is made of tempered glass astm international 2018 stipulates the minimum surface compression for fully tempered glass is 69 mpa therefore the permissible load for a portlight is 2 17 10 4 pa as is shown in table 5 3 4 the bn establishment and overall probabilities of failure estimation it is worth pointing out that middle columns are taken into consideration because of the difference between the ocean ranger and the demonstration example ms 1 4 represent the probabilities of failure of sections 1 to 4 of the middle column caused by combined loads directly ms2s represents both the direct damage and collateral debris damage from adjacent section 1 of the middle column damage to the derrick can destroy the deck due to objects falling from high altitudes furthermore without the support of middle and corner columns the supporting system cannot reinforce the deck columns are installed above the pontoons which explains that once the sections of columns connected to the pontoons fails related pontoon sections inevitably rupture then onboard liquid is influenced because it is stored in the pontoon which further manages the buoyancy of the smu owing to a design flaw and improper operation the ballast control room where the portlights are installed is under the height of wave crests which leads to the failure of the deballast system if the portlights are destroyed by a rogue wave seawater can inundate the ballast control room causing the panel malfunction the panel which is protected by the portlight controls the pumping system and the ballast valves system which thereby control the onboard liquid finally damage probability modeling of the ocean ranger considering stability and operational components is tailored in fig 8 and table 5 with cpts provided in the appendix the probabilities of failure pof of several aforementioned root nodes heising and grenzebach 1989 including valves pumps ballast water drilling water and fuel were utilized to analyze failure probability using hugin 8 6 http www hugin com 4 results and discussion as can be seen from table 5 wind load rises significantly along with the increase of height which is calculated as 3 51 kpa for section 1 of the derrick while it is 1 69 kpa almost half as much for section 2 of columns in general the closer the height is to the sea horizon within a certain range the greater roughness leads to wind s speed increasing with altitude moreover the average failure probability of sections for the derrick is 1 8 10 4 however the average failure probabilities of sections for the deck columns and pontoons are approximately 5 7 10 5 2 7 10 5 and 4 2 10 5 in this regard derrick section experienced a relatively high probability of failure by almost one order of magnitude when compared to the other structural components in spite of the mutual interaction of adjacent sections owing to the debris trajectory the failure probability of the derrick 7 10 4 is still higher than for columns 1 10 4 and pontoons 2 10 4 the explanation for this phenomenon can be found through the application of bivariate joint probability distribution associated with the physical reliability model two different indicators are combined which is more accordant with the actual situation than combining various types of loads directly in other words it is dominated by the parameter which is closer to the maximum value and influenced by the other one in fact deck columns and pontoons suffer the impact from either the wind wave combined load or wave sea pressure combined load ideally the derrick bears only the wind induced load in this case the wind speed was 90 knots which reached 90 of the maximum critical value and the wave height was 65 ft only accounting for 59 of the limit thus wind speed in the prevailing conditions was the dominant indicator resulting in the derrick having a considerably high failure probability while the wave height that was far beyond the limit was the influenced parameter therefore components that bore either the load caused by the wave itself or the indirect dynamic sea pressure of each section were less likely to fail along with this line of consideration the simulation results in table 5 indicate that the ocean ranger operated with an incredible probability of failure of 0 5214 this is around 52 times as large as the lower limit of the operational failure envelope logically speaking if the estimated failure probability in the envelope fell dramatically termination of the operation to cease the risk should have been adopted on the contrary probabilities of failure for the main structural components such as the derrick middle and corner columns pontoons etc were about 10 4 the calculated failure probability was still acceptable which proved that the ocean ranger could have survived the storm nevertheless due to inappropriate manual operations the hurricane on 14 15 february 1982 destroyed the ocean ranger unfortunately as an improper operating procedure the deadlights which should have protected the porthole from wave impact were open as revealed by the reduction coefficient the permissible load of the portlight decreased significantly from 3 30 10 4 pa to 2 17 10 4 pa what is even worse the actual imposed load was 1 97 10 4 pa which led ineluctably to the increase of probability of failure the failure probability of the exposed portlight was derived as 0 6537 which is nearly 62 000 times greater than is the case under protection subsequently the branch which follows the panel malfunction failure of the pumping system and ballast valves severe listing flooding of the chain locker and failure of the support system occurred naturally because of the unexpected flooding of the chain locker room the failure probability of the supporting system rose sharply from 2 10 4 to 0 5205 it is highlighted that the damage to the portlight which lacked the protection of deadlights initiated the chain of events in agreement with the marine casualty report us coast guard 1983 this signifies that in the actual operational process not only do the design and manufacturing characteristics of the platform need to be taken into consideration but also that human operation practices can add considerable additional risk to the platform aiming to lower the damage caused by improper manual operation from the inherent design to emergency actions is essential if feasible it is recommended to strengthen the training knowledge and instruction for proper operational procedures to enhance reliability and mitigate potential hazards 5 conclusions the proposed operational failure model is able to capture real time weather data and their impact on safe operation which helps to promote safe and reliable offshore development it is highlighted that this study assesses the operational risk of the semi submersible mobile unit smu quantitatively under combined wind and wave induced loads with a probabilistic bayesian network bn framework which represents conditional dependencies of the weather s effect more specifically it presents a detailed operational failure model considering the combined loading of extreme weather conditions and the operational characteristics of the smu consistent and reliable results are provided as evidenced by the case study as an anticipated risk estimation model it is proved that the proposed model is a useful and reliable tool to develop and monitor an operational failure envelope of the smu in given environmental conditions for the sake of improvement it is recommended that more environmental loads such as currents and sea ice induced loads should be taken into consideration to simulate the operational disturbance for further research this paper has demonstrated the application of wind load response modeling the morison model and the ultimate limit states method to estimate the combined loading of extreme weather conditions imposed on the smu a physical reliability model and joint probability distribution function have been incorporated which provide a deeper insight to capture the risk response along with reducing the estimated failure probability through the implementation of bn with the operational failure envelope in given environmental conditions further operational recommendations are suggested in order to avoid catastrophic disaster acknowledgements the authors thankfully acknowledge the financial support from the natural science and engineering council of canada nserc and also the canada research chair crc tier i program in offshore safety and risk engineering appendix the subjective belief is adapted to assign cpts to reduce uncertainty which is sufficient to estimate the anticipated operational probability of failure for the purpose of a safety reference in short the greater the height of the section the greater the mutual influence factor is since the uppermost section has a strongest potential of both kinetic and gravitational furthermore it is assumed that only two adjacent sections

22397,the production of intelligent materials in the design of vibration control devices have made significant progress in the past two decades since the shape memory alloy sma is a superelastic intelligent material highly capable of dissipating energy use has been made in this research of the sma pounding tuned mass damper sma ptmd to control the wave induced vibrations of the offshore jacket platforms the sma ptmd dynamic vibration absorber dva is a combination of sma tmd and ptmd connect the mass to the deck through a piston based sma dissipation device composed of varying geometry sma bars and gaps here the vibration equations have been developed by simulating the platform and the dva as a multi degree of freedom system and solved by the direct integration method to define the smas hysteretic behavior its idealized constitutive model has been implemented and the geometry of the sma bars has been adjusted using the ideal gas molecular movement optimization algorithm the time history responses have indicated significant reductions in the maximums and rms of the deck displacements of the optimized sma ptmd installed jackets vibrated under the action of irregular waves results have also shown high tuning and robustness of the sma ptmd under broadband frequency excitations and off tuning conditions keywords vibration control offshore jacket platform shape memory alloy dynamic vibration absorber sma ptmd 1 introduction jacket platforms experience large vibrations under the action of such lateral loads as winds waves earthquakes and ice mass ship collisions undesired vibrations of jacket platforms increase the destructive effects of fatigue in joints risers and mechanical equipment on the deck disrupt the operations of the platform drilling equipment reduce the personnel s comfort feeling and endanger their long term health by the deck s back and forth movements an effective vibration reduction method where the jacket platform is equipped with devices systems such as dampers isolators and dynamic vibration absorbers dvas categorized as passive semi active active and hybrid diverts or dissipates part of the energy applied to the structure kandasamy et al 2016 since passive tuned mass dampers tmds are inexpensive simple to install and used widely in the structural vibration control this research is mainly aimed to control the vibrations of jacket platforms using the shape memory alloy pounding tuned mass damper sma ptmd frahm 1911 was the first to use passive dva to control the vibrations of a structure in the early 20th century frahm 1911 he connected a mass to the structure by a linear spring and reduced its in resonance vibrations effectively by adjusting the characteristics of the mass and spring the main limitation of this device was that it could be tuned for only one specific excitation frequency a change in the latter reduced the dva s efficiency or even increased the structural vibrations ormondroyd and den hartog 1928 added a viscous linear damper to lessen this limitation and adjusted it to broadband frequency excitations ormondroyd and den hartog 1928 thereafter a variety of novel analysis technologies such as multiple tmds mohebbi et al 2015 semi active tmds with variable damping coefficients and stiffness values chey et al 2010 ptmd pounding tuned mass damper collette 1998 sma tmd shape memory alloy tuned mass damper rustighi and bernnan 2004 and hybrid damping system consisting of dissipation devices and tmd were applied to improve dvas to avoid the foregoing disadvantages and achieve a satisfactory vibration control performance the idea of using passive dvas to reduce the wave induced vibrations of jacket platforms was first proposed by vandiver and mitome 1979 vandiver and mitome 1979 who used deck top liquid storage tanks to prevent the jacket platform frequency from being resonated considering the soil structure interaction effects kawano and venkataramana 1996 studied the vibrations of the tmd equipped jacket platform under the seismic load and observed a significant reduction in its deck displacements kawano and venkataramana 1996 lu et al 2002 studied the effectiveness of multiple tmds on suppressing wave induced vibrations of an offshore platform lu et al 2002 huo and li 2004 developed a ctlcd circular tuned liquid column damper to control the platform s torsional responses under seismic loads huo and li 2004 jin et al 2007 studied the effectiveness of the cylinder tlds tuned liquid damper in controlling the earthquake response of jacket platforms by the interaction of the seismic input structure and liquid jin et al 2007 ma et al 2010 studied anti vibration devices for a model jacket platform and showed that when the device parameters took values in the optimal range the controlling effects were desirable ma et al 2010 as a case study jafarabad et al 2014 equipped foroozan and rankin jacket platforms with tmd and friction dampers and concluded that the former worked more efficiently in reducing the fatigue caused stresses under wave forces jafarabad et al 2014 equipping a jacket platform with an hbmd hydrodynamic buoyant mass damper that works based on the damper s buoyancy inertia forces and hydrodynamic damping effects moharrami and tootkaboni 2014 studied its dynamic behavior under three wave loading cases to reduce its displacement response moharrami and tootkaboni 2014 besides passive dvas the semi active and active mass dampers have been popular with researchers to control the vibrations of jacket platforms zhang et al 2019 sma tmd and ptmd are two robust passive dvas presented in the past two decades and used in many researches rostighi and bernnan 2004 were the first to use smas in dvas wherein the linear spring and viscous damper connected to the moving mass are replaced with an sma spring to enhance the tmd efficiency and robustness rustighi and bernnan 2004 and rustighi et al 2005 to reduce the seismic vibrations tian et al 2018 bolted an sma tmd at the top of a power transmission tower that combined the advantages of a traditional tmd and the energy dissipation capacity because it had three characteristics 1 it could be regarded as an ordinary spring and behave linearly when the earthquake loads were small 2 the sma material s forward phase transformation would be activated and its spring would enter the nonlinear stage to begin to dissipate energy when the earthquake loads were large tian et al 2018 and 3 since the elasticity modulus of an sma is a function of temperature the spring stiffness of the sma tmd could be tuned by heating or cooling huang and chang 2018 the ptmd is an integrated combination of a tmd and an impact damper used to enhance the performance of the tuned absorber li et al 2015 in some ptmds the stiff boundary limiters connected to the primary structure are located in the direction of moving mass and in some others the rigid limiters are covered with viscoelastic or sma materials ve ptmd sma ptmd tan et al 2019 when the tuned mass motion exceeds a certain level it will pound on the viscoelastic materials and dissipate the vibration energy therefore the ptmd has two vibration control mechanisms 1 it absorbs the kinetic energy as a tmd when the tuned mass vibrates between the two boundaries and 2 it dissipates the absorbed energy as an impact damper when it impacts on either boundary in comprehensive research xue et al 2016 controlled the vibrations of an offshore jacket platform by a ptmd and concluded through comparing the ptmd and traditional tmd that the former was advantageous not only in suppressing vibrations and reducing costs but also in effective frequency bandwidth xue et al 2016 the dynamic vibration absorber implemented in this research is a kind of sma ptmd where the moving mass is connected to the jacket deck through a piston based vg sma damper vg sma damper is a dissipation device composed of cylinder piston varying geometry sma bars and gaps since in a small piston stroke only 1 bar is tensioned while in a large stroke other sma bars contribute too the dva stiffness and damping characteristics can be tuned effectively for broadband frequency excitations as mentioned before an sma ptmd is a combination of sma tmd and ptmd poses the advantages of mentioned dvas in enferadi et al 2019 latest research use has been made of the vg sma dampers to control the wave induced vibrations of offshore jacket platforms and results have shown that the geometry and gaps of sma bars have significant effects on the device efficiency and robustness enferadi et al 2019 this research has been so organized as to study the emergence of history and application of smas in section2 performance of sma ptmd develop the equations governing the vibrations of multi degree of freedom lumped mass system equipped with sma ptmd formulate the multi linear idealized constitutive model of smas under axial loading validate the smas constitutive model with a reliable reference in section 3 do case studies and the related numerical analyses on the two jacket platforms equipped with optimized sma ptmds in section 4 and finally present the overall results and show the effects of sma ptmd on improving the jacket platform dynamic behavior in section 5 the jacket structures with and without sma ptmd are analyzed under the action of irregular waves with return periods of 2 5 10 and 100 years and sma bars geometric characteristics are optimized using the new efficient full gas molecular movement igmm optimization algorithm ghasemi and varaee 2017 2 shape memory alloys shape memory alloys emerged first in the 3rd decade of the 20th century they have two crystalline phases or structures and exhibit different behavior or effects against stress and temperature variations the dominant phase in such alloys depends on the temperature and applied tensions and is determined based on the chemical compositions of their constituent metals and the thermo dynamic processes when they are processed the high and low temperature stable phases are called austenite and martensite respectively the latter contains two states called twinned and detwinned martensite phase transitions of the shape memory alloys crystals can be separated into superelastic effect se and shape memory effect sme dutta et al 2018 the former was discovered by olander et al 1932 in the gold cadmium au cd alloy stress strain curve and the latter was first observed by buehler and his colleagues 1962 on the nickel titanium alloy in the u s naval ordnance laboratory they named their material nitinol the phase transitions of the smas sme and se are shown in figs 1 and 2 ozbulut et al 2010 if a piece of the sma alloy is loaded in the twinned martensite phase at a temperature between m s and m f the arrangement of its crystals will be transformed into a new detwinned martensite form after it flows fig 1 a but after unloading although the detwinned crystal phase remains unchanged the piece will face some residual strain fig 1 b in this situation if the temperature increases up to a f the created residual strain will vanish causing a return to the original geometric form where the arrangement of the crystals is transformed into the austenite phase finally a temperature decrease to m f will cause the crystal arrangement to return to the original twinned martensite form fig 1 a this phenomenon is called the shape memory effect if the same sma piece is in the austenite phase at a temperature above a f loading and applying stress will change its phase from austenite to detwinned martensite fig 2 a the latter will become unstable at unloading and face an inverse transformation due to which the alloy will return to its original state leaving no residual strain fig 2 b this particular alloy behavior is called the supper elasticity effect the energy dissipated at loading unloading stages is shown in the stress strain curve fig 2 b by the closed area which depends on such variables as the alloy genus the applied stress and the load dynamic characteristics the variations of which will highly affect the amount of the energy lost dissipated many researchers have studied the behavior of smas under axial flexural shear and torsional hysteresis loading and found that they have the highest energy dissipation potential under axial loading unloading this is why use is made of sma bars bolts and tension wires in most vibration control devices qian et al 2013 made of a combination of different metals shape memory alloys are usually classified with the name of their base metal as regards the vibration control devices nitinol smas are more efficient and durable than copper and steel ones the smas isothermal superelastic hysteresis stress strain behavior has been modeled and formulated by such researchers as graesser and cozzarelli 1991 auricchio et al 1997 wilde et al 2000 and so on these models are classified as nonlinear real wilde et al 2000 multi linear idealized auricchio et al 1997 and equivalent viscous damping wang and zhu 2018 it is necessary in general to determine how to model the damper s force displacement hysteresis curve before any dynamic analysis of the problem after the sma damper type has been selected most studies transform the smas stress strain relationships into force displacement ones considering the structure geometric conditions the damper and the compatibility of the resulting displacements in this study to model smas hysteresis behavior use has been made of the idealized multi linear constitutive model 3 methods and verification 3 1 sma ptmd sma ptmd installation on the jacket deck and its detail drawing are shown in fig 3 as is clear the moving mass of dva is connected to the deck through a piston based vg sma damper fig 3 a vg sma damper is a dissipation device composed of cylinder piston sma bars and gaps fig 3 b the piston strokes and gaps between it and sma bars cause different tensile elongations in the sma bars therefore the stiffness and damping characteristics of the sma ptmd could be tuned under the broadband frequency excitations the difference between sma ptmd and sma tmd is in the geometries of sma bars sma tmd is a dva with constant geometry of sma bars and no gaps while sma ptmd is a dva with varying geometry sma bars and gaps the sma ptmd performance is similar to ptmd with viscoelastic covered boundaries ve ptmd such devices are self tuned and work as semi active tuned mass dampers the outer diameter of the vg sma damper is about 0 25 0 5 m and its length is usually more than 1 m depending on the number and length of sma bars it is worth noting that the manufacturing installation of sma ptmd presented in this research is very simple without maintenance while traditional tmds with their hydraulic dampers need special maintenance and cost 3 2 dynamic equations in this research the jacket platform and the sma ptmd have been analyzed as a multi degree of freedom lumped mass system mdof wherein the equivalent vibration frequency should conform fairly well to the results of the platform s 3d analysis fig 4 shows the dynamic model of an equivalent mdof system and idealized force displacement hysteretic loops of sma ptmd according to fig 4 variables the vibration equations of the system are as follows 1 m s v c s v k s v f s m a p t m d f w 2 m t v t 1 n s f s h 0 in eq 1 where m s c s and k s are the matrices of the

chatziioannou 2018 f s h in eq 6 the sma ptmds bar hysteretic axial forces the calculation of which is explained in subsection 3 3 3 3 smas idealized constitutive model since the numerical solution methods of the set of differential equations governing the structure vibrations estimate the structure dynamic response by overlapping the results in time intervals e g alpha and newmark hilber et al 1977 the sma bar axial force variations can be determined in any forward time interval and added to that of the previous one according to fig 5 if x j denotes the sma bar length change in the jth step k 1 denotes axial stiffness in the elastic region k 2 denotes stiffness in austenite to martensite phase transition and k 3 denotes stiffness in martensite to austenite phase transition the f s h j restoring force can be estimated from eqs 8 10 8 f s h j f s h j 1 k 1 x j x j 1 x j x f m a 9 f s h j f s h j 1 k 1 x j x j 1 x f m a x j x f a m 9 a if f s h j upper plateau then f s h j a σ s a m k

as superscripts mean the austenite to martensite and martensite to austenite phase transitions respectively and s and f as subscripts mean the start and finish of phase transitions respectively stiffness values used in above equations can be found from eqs 11 13 11 k 1 a l e s m a 12 k 2 a l σ f a m σ s a m ε f a m ε s a m 13 k 3 a l σ s m a σ f m a ε j ε f m a where l e s m a and ε are the sma bar initial length initial modulus of elasticity and sma bar strain respectively in the proposed sma ptmd system shown in fig 3 use has been made of piston based sma dissipation device with varying geometry sma bars and gaps therefore the force displacement relations must be extended for all the sma bars considering displacement constraints for gaps since relations of this study do not need to use the velocity variable and functions that determine the signs of the hysteresis force they differ from those of other researchers because the number of unknowns is reduced and the speed of dynamic and optimization analyses are increased 3 4 verification to validate the correctness of the equations used and the results of the matlab based computer code developed in this study comparison have been made between the hysteresis graph of the sma of this research and that of asgarian and moradi who have placed an sma bar under the axial loading unloading and obtained the stress strain hysteresis loops asgarian and moradi 2011 the accuracy and precision of eqs 8 13 can be verified by a comparison of the graphs in fig 6 4 case studies the numerical analyses in this case studies are aimed to check the efficiency tuning and robustness of the proposed control system and find its strong weak points the analyses of this section are categorized into three parts efficiency and tuning of the sma ptmds in the vibration reduction of jacket platforms are evaluated in the first two parts subsections 4 1 and 4 2 and their robustness is checked in the third part subsection 4 3 higher conformity of the analytical assumptions to real sea platform conditions could increase the accuracy of the results and would facilitate the practical applications of the plan 4 1 sma ptmd efficiency in the vibration control of a 5 dof jacket platform a 90 m height jacket platform located in the 80 m water depth modeled as the 5 dof system is selected as the first case study elevation view of the platform named as jacket 1 is shown in fig 7 dynamic characteristics include mass and stiffness of levels and frequencies of the 1st to 5th oscillation modes are taken from enferadi et al 2019 and given in table 1 the jacket platform dynamic analysis would be more reliable under the action of irregular waves which accurately represent real sea conditions therefore four load cases based on four irregular waves are considered to find out the sma ptmd efficiency and tuning in the vibration control of the jacket dynamic characteristics of these waves according to jahanmard et al 2013 are presented in table 2 jahanmard et al 2013 to load the irregular waves each has been divided into 340 regular ones using the jonswap wave spectrum and the velocity and acceleration of the water particles for 300 s action of each regular wave with the platform have been calculated and added together wilson 2002 finally the member forces have been computed using the morrison equation and then applied to the equivalent system dofs morison et al 1950 morison equation used in this analysis is as follow 14 f z t ρ π d 2 4 c m u z t 1 2 ρ d c d u z t u z t in eq 14 f z t is the distributed force acting on a unit length of a vertical submerged cylinder u z t and u z t are the water particle acceleration and velocity respectively z is the height below still water level t is time d is the cylinder outer diameter c m and c d are respectively the inertia and drag coefficients taken constant in depth as equal to 2 and 0 8 respectively enferadi et al 2019 parameter ρ is the water density and considered as 1030 kg m3 the time histories of load case 1 to 4 acting on the 5 dof system of the jacket are shown in figs 8 and 9 according to eq 4 the jacket platform damping matric is determined based on the rayleigh damping model with considering a 2 percent damping ratio for all oscillation modes time history response of the jacket 1 deck displacements under the action of load case 4 for undamped and damped states are shown in fig 10 the mass ratio of dva of this research μ mass of dva mass of deck is considered 3 percent the deck mass is 4850 tons hence the dva mass is estimated to be 145 5 tons as mentioned before the moving mass of dva is connected to the deck through a piston based sma dissipation device such a device has both elastic and damping properties if the mechanical properties lengths and section areas of its sma bars are not selected correctly the damper elasticity may increase and its dissipation capability may decrease results from piccirillo et al research show that it is preferable for the sma tmd to use materials with fat stress strain hysteresis loops piccirillo et al 2017 according to fig 3 a the sma bar type a should undergo large tensions so that other bars too may experience tension therefore the alloy with a fat stress strain curve and a large phase transformation strain table 3 has been used to design the sma bars since there are not any specified equations to determine the sma bars lengths and section areas in the time history analysis method their geometrical characteristics have been estimated by the ideal gas molecular movement igmm optimization algorithm presented by varaee and ghasemi in 2017 varaee and ghasemi 2017 it is an efficient population based intelligent algorithm that is based on the principles and relationships that govern the ideal gas molecular movement and offers excellent precision and speed in solving complicated single multi objective optimization problems in optimization problems the design variables are l a lengths and section areas of the sma bars respectively and gaps and the constraint is x x f a m x is the bar length change and x f a m is the ultimate austenite to martensite displacement since this research aims mainly to control the platform structure vibrations under the action of four load cases presented in table 2 the optimization analysis is done with the average root mean squares of deck displacements minimization objective function it is worth noting that the number of sma bars is restricted on 3 and the first gap is equal to zero therefore the optimization analysis is done based on eight design variables and three constraints geometrical characteristics of the optimized sma ptmd are presented in table 4 the initial frequency of the optimized sma ptmd with considering the sma bar type a stiffness is evaluated equally to 2 165 rad sec the initial frequency ratio dva frequency first oscillation mode frequency of structure would be equal to 2 165 1 98 1 09 the frequency ratio considered by tian in tian et al 2018 for sma tmd was equal to 1 1 μ 1 1 03 0 97 therefore the initial frequency ratio of sma ptmd of this research is almost 12 percent higher than that of tian the force displacement hysteresis loops of sma bars and the time history of deck displacements are shown in figs 11 and 12 respectively as is clear the optimized sma ptmd of this research with varying geometry of sma bars and gaps had a significant effect on the vibration reduction of jacket platform under the action of four irregular waves the results indicate that the proposed dva worked as a tunable semi active dynamic absorber and is effective in broadband frequency excitations maximum minimum and root mean squares of the deck displacements in controlled and uncontrolled states are presented in table 5 based on the average reductions presented in table 6 the mentioned dynamic responses are reduced 33 36 5 and 43 percent respectively 4 2 sma ptmd efficiency in the vibration control of a 3 dof jacket platform a 95 m height jacket platform located in the persian gulf modeled as the 3 dof system is selected as a second case study elevation view of the platform named as jacket 2 is shown in fig 13 dynamic characteristics include mass and stiffness of levels and frequencies of the 1st to 3rd oscillation modes are taken from jafarabad et al 2014 and given in table 7 due to simplicity load cases of jacket 2 are selected based on jacket 1 s the jacket 1 was modeled as a 5 dof system therefore the lateral loads act on the 3 dof system of jacket 2 are evaluated according to table 8 this type of loading is not already conventional but due to similar heights and first mode oscillations of two jackets this loading is considered to check the sma ptmd efficiency and tuning the mass ratio of dva of jacket 2 is also considered 3 percent the deck mass is 6100 tons hence the dva mass is estimated to be 183 tons the mechanical characteristics of sma ptmds bars are the same presented in table 3 and the geometrical properties obtained from optimization analysis are presented in table 9 the force displacement hysteresis loops of the sma bars and the time history responses of deck displacements are shown in figs 14 and 15 respectively as is clear the optimized sma ptmd had a significant effect on the vibration reduction of jacket platform under the action of selected load cases besides the results indicate that the optimized sma ptmd worked as a tunable semi active dynamic absorber and is effective in broadband frequency excitations maximum minimum and root mean squares of the deck displacements of jacket 2 in controlled and uncontrolled states are presented in table 10 based on average reductions presented in table 11 the mentioned dynamic responses are reduced 26 5 28 5 and 31 percent respectively the force displacement hysteresis loops of the optimized sma ptmd of jacket 2 show that the sma bar type c undergoes tension only under load case 4 not under other load cases while in jacket 1 the sma bar type c undergoes tension in all 4 load cases since a performance comparison of the optimized sma ptmds presented in tables 5 and 10 suggests that the optimized sma ptmd of jacket 1 performs better than the one in jacket 2 it can be argued that the participation rate of sma bars in the force displacement hysteresis loops has a significant effect on the dva efficiency and the platform vibration control 4 3 sma ptmd robustness in the vibration control of jacket platforms in both case studies the dva efficiency ability to reduce vibrations and tuning adjustability against changes in the loading frequency have been studied and verified under the action of four different load cases another main criterion for a dva design besides efficiency and tuning is its robustness which means how effective and useful it can be against the changes in the structure s dynamic characteristics in other words since the structure mass stiffness and frequency may change over time or may have not been calculated accurately a good dva is one that can adapt itself to such changes and control the vibrations effectively to check the robustness of dvas the mass of the platform deck was multiplied by α 0 8 1 2 with step 0 05 while other structure dva characteristics were kept constant and the maximum absolute value and the rms of the deck displacements were calculated in both uncontrolled and controlled states through two analyses performed on jacket 1 loaded under load case 2 and on jacket 2 loaded under load case 3 results shown respectively in figs 16 and 17 confirm that the proposed dvas are acceptably robust the dvas efficiencies for each α value have been determined using the bar graphs in fig 18 where a height comparison of the bars shows that the dva efficiency declines with a decrease in the deck mass and almost rises with an increase in the deck mass as mentioned before since optimization was analyzed with three sma bars and dvas were not fully optimal the robustness was studied under load cases where dvas had the highest efficiency it is obvious that for practical purposes the dva robustness control should be done for all load cases 5 conclusion this research has addressed the effects of using sma ptmd to control the vibrations of offshore jacket platforms to dynamically analyze the damper equipped platform and model the force displacement hysteretic behavior of the smas use has been made of the modeling of an mdof lumped mass system and the idealized multi linear constitutive model respectively the sma ptmds implemented in this research consist of varying geometry sma bars and gaps and have been optimized by an igmm optimization algorithm to control the efficiency and tuning of the proposed controlling system two nearly similar 90 m high jacket platforms were equipped with two optimized sma ptmds considering 3 percent mass ratio and analyzed under the action of irregular waves with 2 5 10 and 100 years return periods the efficiency and high tuning of the proposed dvas were verified by the significant reductions in the average values of maximum minimum and rms of the deck displacements for jacket 1 by 33 36 5 and 43 percentages respectively and for jacket 2 by 26 5 28 5 and 31 percentages respectively the acceptable robustness of the optimized sma ptmds was also confirmed by the changes applied to the decks masses and the re analyses of their vibrations it can be claimed that the proposed dvas act similar to semi active and intelligent devices and provide the stiffness and damping proportional to any excitation in a self tuning manner the optimized sma ptmds mounted on each deck had three varying geometry sma bars that according to the dvas force displacement hysteresis loops worked well in the sma ptmd of jacket 1 and poorly in that of jacket 2 therefore it is advisable for practical purposes to increase their number to achieve the best contribution of the sma bars in adjusting the devices stiffness and damping since these dvas are light 3 percent mass ratio perform well and are easy to manufacture install they can be used to control the vibrations of marine land based structures 
22397,the production of intelligent materials in the design of vibration control devices have made significant progress in the past two decades since the shape memory alloy sma is a superelastic intelligent material highly capable of dissipating energy use has been made in this research of the sma pounding tuned mass damper sma ptmd to control the wave induced vibrations of the offshore jacket platforms the sma ptmd dynamic vibration absorber dva is a combination of sma tmd and ptmd connect the mass to the deck through a piston based sma dissipation device composed of varying geometry sma bars and gaps here the vibration equations have been developed by simulating the platform and the dva as a multi degree of freedom system and solved by the direct integration method to define the smas hysteretic behavior its idealized constitutive model has been implemented and the geometry of the sma bars has been adjusted using the ideal gas molecular movement optimization algorithm the time history responses have indicated significant reductions in the maximums and rms of the deck displacements of the optimized sma ptmd installed jackets vibrated under the action of irregular waves results have also shown high tuning and robustness of the sma ptmd under broadband frequency excitations and off tuning conditions keywords vibration control offshore jacket platform shape memory alloy dynamic vibration absorber sma ptmd 1 introduction jacket platforms experience large vibrations under the action of such lateral loads as winds waves earthquakes and ice mass ship collisions undesired vibrations of jacket platforms increase the destructive effects of fatigue in joints risers and mechanical equipment on the deck disrupt the operations of the platform drilling equipment reduce the personnel s comfort feeling and endanger their long term health by the deck s back and forth movements an effective vibration reduction method where the jacket platform is equipped with devices systems such as dampers isolators and dynamic vibration absorbers dvas categorized as passive semi active active and hybrid diverts or dissipates part of the energy applied to the structure kandasamy et al 2016 since passive tuned mass dampers tmds are inexpensive simple to install and used widely in the structural vibration control this research is mainly aimed to control the vibrations of jacket platforms using the shape memory alloy pounding tuned mass damper sma ptmd frahm 1911 was the first to use passive dva to control the vibrations of a structure in the early 20th century frahm 1911 he connected a mass to the structure by a linear spring and reduced its in resonance vibrations effectively by adjusting the characteristics of the mass and spring the main limitation of this device was that it could be tuned for only one specific excitation frequency a change in the latter reduced the dva s efficiency or even increased the structural vibrations ormondroyd and den hartog 1928 added a viscous linear damper to lessen this limitation and adjusted it to broadband frequency excitations ormondroyd and den hartog 1928 thereafter a variety of novel analysis technologies such as multiple tmds mohebbi et al 2015 semi active tmds with variable damping coefficients and stiffness values chey et al 2010 ptmd pounding tuned mass damper collette 1998 sma tmd shape memory alloy tuned mass damper rustighi and bernnan 2004 and hybrid damping system consisting of dissipation devices and tmd were applied to improve dvas to avoid the foregoing disadvantages and achieve a satisfactory vibration control performance the idea of using passive dvas to reduce the wave induced vibrations of jacket platforms was first proposed by vandiver and mitome 1979 vandiver and mitome 1979 who used deck top liquid storage tanks to prevent the jacket platform frequency from being resonated considering the soil structure interaction effects kawano and venkataramana 1996 studied the vibrations of the tmd equipped jacket platform under the seismic load and observed a significant reduction in its deck displacements kawano and venkataramana 1996 lu et al 2002 studied the effectiveness of multiple tmds on suppressing wave induced vibrations of an offshore platform lu et al 2002 huo and li 2004 developed a ctlcd circular tuned liquid column damper to control the platform s torsional responses under seismic loads huo and li 2004 jin et al 2007 studied the effectiveness of the cylinder tlds tuned liquid damper in controlling the earthquake response of jacket platforms by the interaction of the seismic input structure and liquid jin et al 2007 ma et al 2010 studied anti vibration devices for a model jacket platform and showed that when the device parameters took values in the optimal range the controlling effects were desirable ma et al 2010 as a case study jafarabad et al 2014 equipped foroozan and rankin jacket platforms with tmd and friction dampers and concluded that the former worked more efficiently in reducing the fatigue caused stresses under wave forces jafarabad et al 2014 equipping a jacket platform with an hbmd hydrodynamic buoyant mass damper that works based on the damper s buoyancy inertia forces and hydrodynamic damping effects moharrami and tootkaboni 2014 studied its dynamic behavior under three wave loading cases to reduce its displacement response moharrami and tootkaboni 2014 besides passive dvas the semi active and active mass dampers have been popular with researchers to control the vibrations of jacket platforms zhang et al 2019 sma tmd and ptmd are two robust passive dvas presented in the past two decades and used in many researches rostighi and bernnan 2004 were the first to use smas in dvas wherein the linear spring and viscous damper connected to the moving mass are replaced with an sma spring to enhance the tmd efficiency and robustness rustighi and bernnan 2004 and rustighi et al 2005 to reduce the seismic vibrations tian et al 2018 bolted an sma tmd at the top of a power transmission tower that combined the advantages of a traditional tmd and the energy dissipation capacity because it had three characteristics 1 it could be regarded as an ordinary spring and behave linearly when the earthquake loads were small 2 the sma material s forward phase transformation would be activated and its spring would enter the nonlinear stage to begin to dissipate energy when the earthquake loads were large tian et al 2018 and 3 since the elasticity modulus of an sma is a function of temperature the spring stiffness of the sma tmd could be tuned by heating or cooling huang and chang 2018 the ptmd is an integrated combination of a tmd and an impact damper used to enhance the performance of the tuned absorber li et al 2015 in some ptmds the stiff boundary limiters connected to the primary structure are located in the direction of moving mass and in some others the rigid limiters are covered with viscoelastic or sma materials ve ptmd sma ptmd tan et al 2019 when the tuned mass motion exceeds a certain level it will pound on the viscoelastic materials and dissipate the vibration energy therefore the ptmd has two vibration control mechanisms 1 it absorbs the kinetic energy as a tmd when the tuned mass vibrates between the two boundaries and 2 it dissipates the absorbed energy as an impact damper when it impacts on either boundary in comprehensive research xue et al 2016 controlled the vibrations of an offshore jacket platform by a ptmd and concluded through comparing the ptmd and traditional tmd that the former was advantageous not only in suppressing vibrations and reducing costs but also in effective frequency bandwidth xue et al 2016 the dynamic vibration absorber implemented in this research is a kind of sma ptmd where the moving mass is connected to the jacket deck through a piston based vg sma damper vg sma damper is a dissipation device composed of cylinder piston varying geometry sma bars and gaps since in a small piston stroke only 1 bar is tensioned while in a large stroke other sma bars contribute too the dva stiffness and damping characteristics can be tuned effectively for broadband frequency excitations as mentioned before an sma ptmd is a combination of sma tmd and ptmd poses the advantages of mentioned dvas in enferadi et al 2019 latest research use has been made of the vg sma dampers to control the wave induced vibrations of offshore jacket platforms and results have shown that the geometry and gaps of sma bars have significant effects on the device efficiency and robustness enferadi et al 2019 this research has been so organized as to study the emergence of history and application of smas in section2 performance of sma ptmd develop the equations governing the vibrations of multi degree of freedom lumped mass system equipped with sma ptmd formulate the multi linear idealized constitutive model of smas under axial loading validate the smas constitutive model with a reliable reference in section 3 do case studies and the related numerical analyses on the two jacket platforms equipped with optimized sma ptmds in section 4 and finally present the overall results and show the effects of sma ptmd on improving the jacket platform dynamic behavior in section 5 the jacket structures with and without sma ptmd are analyzed under the action of irregular waves with return periods of 2 5 10 and 100 years and sma bars geometric characteristics are optimized using the new efficient full gas molecular movement igmm optimization algorithm ghasemi and varaee 2017 2 shape memory alloys shape memory alloys emerged first in the 3rd decade of the 20th century they have two crystalline phases or structures and exhibit different behavior or effects against stress and temperature variations the dominant phase in such alloys depends on the temperature and applied tensions and is determined based on the chemical compositions of their constituent metals and the thermo dynamic processes when they are processed the high and low temperature stable phases are called austenite and martensite respectively the latter contains two states called twinned and detwinned martensite phase transitions of the shape memory alloys crystals can be separated into superelastic effect se and shape memory effect sme dutta et al 2018 the former was discovered by olander et al 1932 in the gold cadmium au cd alloy stress strain curve and the latter was first observed by buehler and his colleagues 1962 on the nickel titanium alloy in the u s naval ordnance laboratory they named their material nitinol the phase transitions of the smas sme and se are shown in figs 1 and 2 ozbulut et al 2010 if a piece of the sma alloy is loaded in the twinned martensite phase at a temperature between m s and m f the arrangement of its crystals will be transformed into a new detwinned martensite form after it flows fig 1 a but after unloading although the detwinned crystal phase remains unchanged the piece will face some residual strain fig 1 b in this situation if the temperature increases up to a f the created residual strain will vanish causing a return to the original geometric form where the arrangement of the crystals is transformed into the austenite phase finally a temperature decrease to m f will cause the crystal arrangement to return to the original twinned martensite form fig 1 a this phenomenon is called the shape memory effect if the same sma piece is in the austenite phase at a temperature above a f loading and applying stress will change its phase from austenite to detwinned martensite fig 2 a the latter will become unstable at unloading and face an inverse transformation due to which the alloy will return to its original state leaving no residual strain fig 2 b this particular alloy behavior is called the supper elasticity effect the energy dissipated at loading unloading stages is shown in the stress strain curve fig 2 b by the closed area which depends on such variables as the alloy genus the applied stress and the load dynamic characteristics the variations of which will highly affect the amount of the energy lost dissipated many researchers have studied the behavior of smas under axial flexural shear and torsional hysteresis loading and found that they have the highest energy dissipation potential under axial loading unloading this is why use is made of sma bars bolts and tension wires in most vibration control devices qian et al 2013 made of a combination of different metals shape memory alloys are usually classified with the name of their base metal as regards the vibration control devices nitinol smas are more efficient and durable than copper and steel ones the smas isothermal superelastic hysteresis stress strain behavior has been modeled and formulated by such researchers as graesser and cozzarelli 1991 auricchio et al 1997 wilde et al 2000 and so on these models are classified as nonlinear real wilde et al 2000 multi linear idealized auricchio et al 1997 and equivalent viscous damping wang and zhu 2018 it is necessary in general to determine how to model the damper s force displacement hysteresis curve before any dynamic analysis of the problem after the sma damper type has been selected most studies transform the smas stress strain relationships into force displacement ones considering the structure geometric conditions the damper and the compatibility of the resulting displacements in this study to model smas hysteresis behavior use has been made of the idealized multi linear constitutive model 3 methods and verification 3 1 sma ptmd sma ptmd installation on the jacket deck and its detail drawing are shown in fig 3 as is clear the moving mass of dva is connected to the deck through a piston based vg sma damper fig 3 a vg sma damper is a dissipation device composed of cylinder piston sma bars and gaps fig 3 b the piston strokes and gaps between it and sma bars cause different tensile elongations in the sma bars therefore the stiffness and damping characteristics of the sma ptmd could be tuned under the broadband frequency excitations the difference between sma ptmd and sma tmd is in the geometries of sma bars sma tmd is a dva with constant geometry of sma bars and no gaps while sma ptmd is a dva with varying geometry sma bars and gaps the sma ptmd performance is similar to ptmd with viscoelastic covered boundaries ve ptmd such devices are self tuned and work as semi active tuned mass dampers the outer diameter of the vg sma damper is about 0 25 0 5 m and its length is usually more than 1 m depending on the number and length of sma bars it is worth noting that the manufacturing installation of sma ptmd presented in this research is very simple without maintenance while traditional tmds with their hydraulic dampers need special maintenance and cost 3 2 dynamic equations in this research the jacket platform and the sma ptmd have been analyzed as a multi degree of freedom lumped mass system mdof wherein the equivalent vibration frequency should conform fairly well to the results of the platform s 3d analysis fig 4 shows the dynamic model of an equivalent mdof system and idealized force displacement hysteretic loops of sma ptmd according to fig 4 variables the vibration equations of the system are as follows 1 m s v c s v k s v f s m a p t m d f w 2 m t v t 1 n s f s h 0 in eq 1 where m s c s and k s are the matrices of the

chatziioannou 2018 f s h in eq 6 the sma ptmds bar hysteretic axial forces the calculation of which is explained in subsection 3 3 3 3 smas idealized constitutive model since the numerical solution methods of the set of differential equations governing the structure vibrations estimate the structure dynamic response by overlapping the results in time intervals e g alpha and newmark hilber et al 1977 the sma bar axial force variations can be determined in any forward time interval and added to that of the previous one according to fig 5 if x j denotes the sma bar length change in the jth step k 1 denotes axial stiffness in the elastic region k 2 denotes stiffness in austenite to martensite phase transition and k 3 denotes stiffness in martensite to austenite phase transition the f s h j restoring force can be estimated from eqs 8 10 8 f s h j f s h j 1 k 1 x j x j 1 x j x f m a 9 f s h j f s h j 1 k 1 x j x j 1 x f m a x j x f a m 9 a if f s h j upper plateau then f s h j a σ s a m k

as superscripts mean the austenite to martensite and martensite to austenite phase transitions respectively and s and f as subscripts mean the start and finish of phase transitions respectively stiffness values used in above equations can be found from eqs 11 13 11 k 1 a l e s m a 12 k 2 a l σ f a m σ s a m ε f a m ε s a m 13 k 3 a l σ s m a σ f m a ε j ε f m a where l e s m a and ε are the sma bar initial length initial modulus of elasticity and sma bar strain respectively in the proposed sma ptmd system shown in fig 3 use has been made of piston based sma dissipation device with varying geometry sma bars and gaps therefore the force displacement relations must be extended for all the sma bars considering displacement constraints for gaps since relations of this study do not need to use the velocity variable and functions that determine the signs of the hysteresis force they differ from those of other researchers because the number of unknowns is reduced and the speed of dynamic and optimization analyses are increased 3 4 verification to validate the correctness of the equations used and the results of the matlab based computer code developed in this study comparison have been made between the hysteresis graph of the sma of this research and that of asgarian and moradi who have placed an sma bar under the axial loading unloading and obtained the stress strain hysteresis loops asgarian and moradi 2011 the accuracy and precision of eqs 8 13 can be verified by a comparison of the graphs in fig 6 4 case studies the numerical analyses in this case studies are aimed to check the efficiency tuning and robustness of the proposed control system and find its strong weak points the analyses of this section are categorized into three parts efficiency and tuning of the sma ptmds in the vibration reduction of jacket platforms are evaluated in the first two parts subsections 4 1 and 4 2 and their robustness is checked in the third part subsection 4 3 higher conformity of the analytical assumptions to real sea platform conditions could increase the accuracy of the results and would facilitate the practical applications of the plan 4 1 sma ptmd efficiency in the vibration control of a 5 dof jacket platform a 90 m height jacket platform located in the 80 m water depth modeled as the 5 dof system is selected as the first case study elevation view of the platform named as jacket 1 is shown in fig 7 dynamic characteristics include mass and stiffness of levels and frequencies of the 1st to 5th oscillation modes are taken from enferadi et al 2019 and given in table 1 the jacket platform dynamic analysis would be more reliable under the action of irregular waves which accurately represent real sea conditions therefore four load cases based on four irregular waves are considered to find out the sma ptmd efficiency and tuning in the vibration control of the jacket dynamic characteristics of these waves according to jahanmard et al 2013 are presented in table 2 jahanmard et al 2013 to load the irregular waves each has been divided into 340 regular ones using the jonswap wave spectrum and the velocity and acceleration of the water particles for 300 s action of each regular wave with the platform have been calculated and added together wilson 2002 finally the member forces have been computed using the morrison equation and then applied to the equivalent system dofs morison et al 1950 morison equation used in this analysis is as follow 14 f z t ρ π d 2 4 c m u z t 1 2 ρ d c d u z t u z t in eq 14 f z t is the distributed force acting on a unit length of a vertical submerged cylinder u z t and u z t are the water particle acceleration and velocity respectively z is the height below still water level t is time d is the cylinder outer diameter c m and c d are respectively the inertia and drag coefficients taken constant in depth as equal to 2 and 0 8 respectively enferadi et al 2019 parameter ρ is the water density and considered as 1030 kg m3 the time histories of load case 1 to 4 acting on the 5 dof system of the jacket are shown in figs 8 and 9 according to eq 4 the jacket platform damping matric is determined based on the rayleigh damping model with considering a 2 percent damping ratio for all oscillation modes time history response of the jacket 1 deck displacements under the action of load case 4 for undamped and damped states are shown in fig 10 the mass ratio of dva of this research μ mass of dva mass of deck is considered 3 percent the deck mass is 4850 tons hence the dva mass is estimated to be 145 5 tons as mentioned before the moving mass of dva is connected to the deck through a piston based sma dissipation device such a device has both elastic and damping properties if the mechanical properties lengths and section areas of its sma bars are not selected correctly the damper elasticity may increase and its dissipation capability may decrease results from piccirillo et al research show that it is preferable for the sma tmd to use materials with fat stress strain hysteresis loops piccirillo et al 2017 according to fig 3 a the sma bar type a should undergo large tensions so that other bars too may experience tension therefore the alloy with a fat stress strain curve and a large phase transformation strain table 3 has been used to design the sma bars since there are not any specified equations to determine the sma bars lengths and section areas in the time history analysis method their geometrical characteristics have been estimated by the ideal gas molecular movement igmm optimization algorithm presented by varaee and ghasemi in 2017 varaee and ghasemi 2017 it is an efficient population based intelligent algorithm that is based on the principles and relationships that govern the ideal gas molecular movement and offers excellent precision and speed in solving complicated single multi objective optimization problems in optimization problems the design variables are l a lengths and section areas of the sma bars respectively and gaps and the constraint is x x f a m x is the bar length change and x f a m is the ultimate austenite to martensite displacement since this research aims mainly to control the platform structure vibrations under the action of four load cases presented in table 2 the optimization analysis is done with the average root mean squares of deck displacements minimization objective function it is worth noting that the number of sma bars is restricted on 3 and the first gap is equal to zero therefore the optimization analysis is done based on eight design variables and three constraints geometrical characteristics of the optimized sma ptmd are presented in table 4 the initial frequency of the optimized sma ptmd with considering the sma bar type a stiffness is evaluated equally to 2 165 rad sec the initial frequency ratio dva frequency first oscillation mode frequency of structure would be equal to 2 165 1 98 1 09 the frequency ratio considered by tian in tian et al 2018 for sma tmd was equal to 1 1 μ 1 1 03 0 97 therefore the initial frequency ratio of sma ptmd of this research is almost 12 percent higher than that of tian the force displacement hysteresis loops of sma bars and the time history of deck displacements are shown in figs 11 and 12 respectively as is clear the optimized sma ptmd of this research with varying geometry of sma bars and gaps had a significant effect on the vibration reduction of jacket platform under the action of four irregular waves the results indicate that the proposed dva worked as a tunable semi active dynamic absorber and is effective in broadband frequency excitations maximum minimum and root mean squares of the deck displacements in controlled and uncontrolled states are presented in table 5 based on the average reductions presented in table 6 the mentioned dynamic responses are reduced 33 36 5 and 43 percent respectively 4 2 sma ptmd efficiency in the vibration control of a 3 dof jacket platform a 95 m height jacket platform located in the persian gulf modeled as the 3 dof system is selected as a second case study elevation view of the platform named as jacket 2 is shown in fig 13 dynamic characteristics include mass and stiffness of levels and frequencies of the 1st to 3rd oscillation modes are taken from jafarabad et al 2014 and given in table 7 due to simplicity load cases of jacket 2 are selected based on jacket 1 s the jacket 1 was modeled as a 5 dof system therefore the lateral loads act on the 3 dof system of jacket 2 are evaluated according to table 8 this type of loading is not already conventional but due to similar heights and first mode oscillations of two jackets this loading is considered to check the sma ptmd efficiency and tuning the mass ratio of dva of jacket 2 is also considered 3 percent the deck mass is 6100 tons hence the dva mass is estimated to be 183 tons the mechanical characteristics of sma ptmds bars are the same presented in table 3 and the geometrical properties obtained from optimization analysis are presented in table 9 the force displacement hysteresis loops of the sma bars and the time history responses of deck displacements are shown in figs 14 and 15 respectively as is clear the optimized sma ptmd had a significant effect on the vibration reduction of jacket platform under the action of selected load cases besides the results indicate that the optimized sma ptmd worked as a tunable semi active dynamic absorber and is effective in broadband frequency excitations maximum minimum and root mean squares of the deck displacements of jacket 2 in controlled and uncontrolled states are presented in table 10 based on average reductions presented in table 11 the mentioned dynamic responses are reduced 26 5 28 5 and 31 percent respectively the force displacement hysteresis loops of the optimized sma ptmd of jacket 2 show that the sma bar type c undergoes tension only under load case 4 not under other load cases while in jacket 1 the sma bar type c undergoes tension in all 4 load cases since a performance comparison of the optimized sma ptmds presented in tables 5 and 10 suggests that the optimized sma ptmd of jacket 1 performs better than the one in jacket 2 it can be argued that the participation rate of sma bars in the force displacement hysteresis loops has a significant effect on the dva efficiency and the platform vibration control 4 3 sma ptmd robustness in the vibration control of jacket platforms in both case studies the dva efficiency ability to reduce vibrations and tuning adjustability against changes in the loading frequency have been studied and verified under the action of four different load cases another main criterion for a dva design besides efficiency and tuning is its robustness which means how effective and useful it can be against the changes in the structure s dynamic characteristics in other words since the structure mass stiffness and frequency may change over time or may have not been calculated accurately a good dva is one that can adapt itself to such changes and control the vibrations effectively to check the robustness of dvas the mass of the platform deck was multiplied by α 0 8 1 2 with step 0 05 while other structure dva characteristics were kept constant and the maximum absolute value and the rms of the deck displacements were calculated in both uncontrolled and controlled states through two analyses performed on jacket 1 loaded under load case 2 and on jacket 2 loaded under load case 3 results shown respectively in figs 16 and 17 confirm that the proposed dvas are acceptably robust the dvas efficiencies for each α value have been determined using the bar graphs in fig 18 where a height comparison of the bars shows that the dva efficiency declines with a decrease in the deck mass and almost rises with an increase in the deck mass as mentioned before since optimization was analyzed with three sma bars and dvas were not fully optimal the robustness was studied under load cases where dvas had the highest efficiency it is obvious that for practical purposes the dva robustness control should be done for all load cases 5 conclusion this research has addressed the effects of using sma ptmd to control the vibrations of offshore jacket platforms to dynamically analyze the damper equipped platform and model the force displacement hysteretic behavior of the smas use has been made of the modeling of an mdof lumped mass system and the idealized multi linear constitutive model respectively the sma ptmds implemented in this research consist of varying geometry sma bars and gaps and have been optimized by an igmm optimization algorithm to control the efficiency and tuning of the proposed controlling system two nearly similar 90 m high jacket platforms were equipped with two optimized sma ptmds considering 3 percent mass ratio and analyzed under the action of irregular waves with 2 5 10 and 100 years return periods the efficiency and high tuning of the proposed dvas were verified by the significant reductions in the average values of maximum minimum and rms of the deck displacements for jacket 1 by 33 36 5 and 43 percentages respectively and for jacket 2 by 26 5 28 5 and 31 percentages respectively the acceptable robustness of the optimized sma ptmds was also confirmed by the changes applied to the decks masses and the re analyses of their vibrations it can be claimed that the proposed dvas act similar to semi active and intelligent devices and provide the stiffness and damping proportional to any excitation in a self tuning manner the optimized sma ptmds mounted on each deck had three varying geometry sma bars that according to the dvas force displacement hysteresis loops worked well in the sma ptmd of jacket 1 and poorly in that of jacket 2 therefore it is advisable for practical purposes to increase their number to achieve the best contribution of the sma bars in adjusting the devices stiffness and damping since these dvas are light 3 percent mass ratio perform well and are easy to manufacture install they can be used to control the vibrations of marine land based structures 
22398,systems composed of an oscillating water column and a self rectifying turbine are among the most well known devices for wave energy conversion these systems have been largely studied experimentally and numerically focusing either on owc hydrodynamic or power unit performance the turbine has been studied in experimental facilities that reproduced the periodic motion of the water column in the chamber by an artificially moved piston while owc performance has been generally studied neglecting or crudely simplifying the turbine interaction the objective of this work is to introduce a lumped parameter model able to reproduce the interaction of the turbine with the air mass in the owc chamber results are compared with experimental and cfd data and demonstrate that the often discussed hysteresis is caused by compressibility effects in the air chamber and not as previously assumed by turbine aerodynamics the model is also used to estimate energy loss and phase delay in full scale owc systems proving the importance of a correct sizing of owc turbine systems the lumped parameter model allows to rapidly isolate parameters with the largest influence on system performance and could be integrated with existing wave to wire models to improve the understanding of the hydrodynamic aerodynamic interaction in the overall system keywords owc systems wells turbines hysteresis cfd lumped parameter model 1 introduction wave motion has the highest energy density among renewable sources clément et al 2002 but it is not fully exploited when compared to the technological and commercial impact achieved by other renewable sources the large number of concepts for wave conversion can be classified by their mode of operation drew et al 2009 among these owc oscillating water column is one of the most investigated category falcão and henriques 2016 the working principle is based on the periodic movement of a column of water inside a chamber the top of which is occupied by a volume of air that feeds a turbine comprehensive comparisons of the different types of self rectifying turbines employed in owc systems are given in falcão et al 2012 2018 several owc systems have been built in the last decades the limpet plant in the island of islay scotland is composed of a rectangular inclined owc where the air flow feeds two contra rotating wells turbines the pico owc plant in the azores island is composed of a pneumatic chamber dimensioned to provide resonance with the incident sea state and a wells turbine with inlet outlet guide vanes brito melo et al 2008 the mutriku wave energy plant in the basque country consists of 16 chambers each feeding a bi plane wells turbine torre enciso et al 2009 smaller scale systems have also been built for research purposes and are investigated experimentally lopez et al 2015 ferguson et al 2015 mitchell ferguson et al 2017 mahnamfar and altunkaynak 2017 falcao et al falcão and henriques 2014 elhanafi et al 2017 and simonetti et al 2018 focused on the effect of system size on its performance due to the increased impact of compressibility at larger scales the challenges linked to experimental testing of a system with different hydrodynamic and power system scales favored the development of numerical approaches which can allow faster and less expensive analyses numerical approaches can be separated in lumped and distributed models the former use a usually small number of discrete entities to approximate the behavior of the system which is described by ordinary differential equations in the latter the fluid system involved is discretized in space and time and a set of partial differential equations is to be solved to predict its behavior lumped parameter models lpm can be written for owc analysis by applying the laws of conservation of mass energy and momentum in volumetric form they have been solved both in the time falcão and justino 1999 boccotti 2006 boccotti et al 2007 malara et al 2017 spanos et al 2017 and in the frequency domain folley and whittaker 2005 malara and arena 2013 rezanejad and guedes soares 2018 and have been used for studying the effects of air

zoughi et al 2015 garrido et al 2015 owc performance and its interaction with the sea waves have been investigated also with distributed models computational fluid dynamics cfd for instance the pilot plant in the island of pico azores was studied by brito melo and sarmento 2002 using a boundary element method approach and including the discretization of the natural gully where the owc is installed bouali and larbi 2013 used a cfd approach to study the influence of chamber dimensions on owc hydrodynamic efficiency similar approaches have been used by kamath et al 2015 moñino et al 2017 torresi et al 2016 simulated the behavior of an experimental device built to emulate a rewec1 resonant wave energy converter comparing the theoretical value obtained using a linearized lpm with cfd results all owc studies presented so far studied the behavior of the owc system employing a simplified representation of the turbine in lpm analyses the presence of the turbine is represented with a damping term while in cfd approaches its effect is generally modeled using a slot providing an equivalent pressure drop torresi et al 2016 lopez et al 2016 pereiras et al 2015 this approach is similar to the one used in reduced scale experimental studies simonetti et al 2017 many experimental and computational works have focused on the turbine behavior and performance isolating the turbine from the owc and therefore neglecting their interaction these studies have been conducted either in stationary operating conditions gato and falcao 1988 1989 thakker et al 2000 gato and webster 2001 kim et al 2002 takao et al 2008 moisel and carolus 2016 lopes et al 2017 with the use of a constant air supply or in dynamic conditions inoue et al 1988 takao et al 1996 setoguchi et al 1998 paderi and puddu 2013 puddu et al 2014 supplying a time varying flow rate usually by means of a piston moving inside a large chamber the piston effectively replaces the alternating movement of the water in the owc thereby providing a working condition more representative of the real one however the velocity of the piston is imposed rather than a result of the system geometry and applied forces sea waves turbine aerodynamic forces and endwall friction forces with the effect that this bi directional connection is lost for example there is no guarantee that in the presence of a different turbine the water motion will remain the same among the different experimental studies the works of setoguchi et al 1998 are of particular interest as they highlighted the presence of a hysteretic behavior in the turbine performance between acceleration and deceleration phases i e a delay between piston movement and turbine performance the majority of cfd analyses of the turbine have also been performed in isolation i e studying a domain encompassing only the annular duct that houses the turbine this has been done either for steady operation dhanasekaran and govardhan 2005 gareev et al 2009 pereiras et al 2014 halder and samad 2016 hu and li 2017 halder et al 2017 mahboubidoust and ramiar 2017 with a fixed mass flow set as boundary condition or for dynamic operation setoguchi et al 2003 kinoue et al 2003 2004 2007 mamun et al 2004a 2004b liu et al 2018 using a boundary condition for the mass flow varying with time in a way representative of what happens in the real owc dynamic cfd simulations have been used to explain the origin of the hysteresis found in experimental analyses setoguchi et al 1998 the cause has been attributed to a different interaction of blade wake vortices with other vortical structures during acceleration and deceleration for the same piston velocity setoguchi et al 2003 kinoue et al 2003 hu and li 2017 this phenomenon has often been compared to the hysteresis that is present in rapidly moving airfoils often referred to with the name dynamic stall however non dimensional frequencies wells turbine operate at are 2 orders of magnitude lower than the ones studied for rapidly pitching or plunging airfoils where hysteretic effects are documented only at frequencies well above 10 2 mccroskey 1981 recently ghisu et al 2015 2016 2017a 2017b 2018a revisited these analyses and found no hysteresis in the turbine forces showing how the original cfd studies kinoue et al 2003 were affected by an insufficient temporal discretization that caused a phase error confused by the authors with an aerodynamic hysteresis of the turbine on the contrary by simulating a domain more representative of the actual experimental setup a large chamber with a moving piston that drives the air in and out of the annular duct they discovered that the alleged hysteresis was caused by the capacitive effect of the chamber and not by the dynamic operation of the turbine in fact the compressibility of the air within the owc chamber causes a temporal delay between the movement of the water surface in the chamber and the mass flow passing through the turbine this behavior is physically similar to what happens in helmholtz resonators alster 1972 and pressure measurement systems doebelin and manik 2007 these two systems have been often studied using lpm approaches in light of these recent findings this work introduces a lumped parameter model of the owc chamber wells turbine system by applying the laws of mass and momentum conservation in integral form to appropriately selected control volumes the model is solved both analytically after linearization and numerically and its predictions are compared to higher order numerical results cfd and experimental data the model is able to correctly predict the interaction between owc chamber and turbine its accuracy together with the low computational cost make it an ideal candidate for integration with existing wave to wire models penalba and ringwood 2016 kelly et al 2016 bailey et al 2016 which could benefit from a better representation of the effect produced by the turbine the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the physical setup used in the experimental analyses of setoguchi et al 1998 that have been taken as a reference in this work section 3 presents the cfd simulations that will be used to define the turbine force coefficient required for the lumped parameter model section 4 discusses the lumped parameter model used to study the interaction between air volume inside the owc chamber and wells turbine and presents two possible approaches for its solution numerical and analytical after linearization section 5 presents a comparison of the results obtained from the lpm approach with the ones obtained with cfd and with the experimental data of setoguchi et al 1998 finally section 6 draws some conclusions and suggestions for future work 2 model description the device used by setoguchi et al 1998 aims to replicate within a laboratory the conditions that a wells turbine experiences when coupled with an owc by imposing a periodic motion to a piston inside a cylindrical chamber a mass of air is pushed in and out of a duct where a wells turbine is placed a schematic of the system is given in fig 1 the main dimensions of the turbine together with operating conditions during the experimental test are reported in table 1 the reynolds number based on blade chord and relative velocity ranged between 1 6 10 5 and 2 4 10 5 during the experiment while the non dimensional frequency based on piston period and blade relative speed k π f c u m was 1 2 10 3 turbine results are usually reported in terms of non dimensional pressure drop p and non dimensional torque t as a function of the flow coefficient φ p defined in equation 1 1 t t ρ ω 2 r m 5 p δ p ρ ω 2 r m 2 ϕ p v 2 x ω r m in the above equations t is the turbine torque δ p the static pressure drop ω the rotational speed r m the mean radius ρ the air density and v 2 x the axial flow velocity upstream of the turbine which in the experiment from setoguchi et al 1998 was not measured but rather estimated from piston speed using the conservation of mass and neglecting compressibility effects in the chamber v 2 x v p a 1 a 2 3 reference cfd analysis the cause of the hysteresis often discussed in wells turbine dynamic performance setoguchi et al 1998 and previously attributed to a aerodynamic hysteresis of the turbine kinoue et al 2003 hu and li 2017 has been recently shown by ghisu et al 2016 2017a to lie in the capacitive behavior of the owc chamber these works demonstrated how earlier cfd results were obtained using an insufficient temporal discretization that led to a phase error that caused the appearance of an artificial counter clockwise loop in the performance curves which was erroneously considered as an aerodynamic hysteresis early numerical analyses setoguchi et al 2003 kinoue et al 2003 hu and li 2017 simulated only the turbine duct see fig 2 setting at the duct inlet a velocity boundary condition that was determined assuming negligible compressibility in the chamber i e no delay between piston velocity and massflow through the turbine despite this assumption they found a hysteresis in the numerical results a delay between the boundary condition and turbine forces that they interpreted as an aerodynamic effect of the turbine however ghisu et al 2016 2017a 2019 showed how these results were affected by a numerical phase error when the time step used in the calculation is sufficiently reduced the delay and the consequent numerical hysteresis disappear ghisu et al 2019 it is important to highlight how this result is in accordance with the large existing literature on rapidly moving pitching or plunging airfoils where dynamic effects are considered negligible at non dimensional frequencies below 10 2 carr et al 1977 ghisu et al 2018b a value significantly larger than the ones experienced by wells turbines in order to understand the origin of the hysteresis reported in setoguchi et al 1998 ghisu et al 2016 simulated a physical domain truly representative of the actual experiment this included in addition to the duct where the wells turbine was placed the chamber used in the experiment to produce the air flow through the turbine by means of an alternating piston movement a sketch of the simulated fluid domain is reported in fig 3 the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations have been solved with compressible ideal gas hypothesis the turbulence problem has been closed with the k ω sst model the multi block structured grid used to solve the fluid dynamics equations consists of about 10 6 cells and the y value is of the order of one for all surface cells a dynamic mesh has been used to simulate the moving piston and the consequent variation in chamber size the transient simulation has been run for 3 piston periods ensuring that periodically stable results had been obtained with a time step of 5 10 4 s sufficient to achieve time step independent results ghisu et al 2016 2017a more details about the numerical model as well as a thorough verification of the spatial and temporal discretization approaches can be found in ghisu et al 2016 fig 4 reports the results for the medium solidity turbine σ 0 57 a comparison with experimental non dimensional torque and pressure drop coefficients of setoguchi et al 1998 as a function of the global piston based flow coefficient ϕ p is presented the numerical results closely reproduce the experimental data with the hysteresis largely discussed in previous works a correct analysis of the hysteresis requires a distinction between the performance parameters based on piston velocity as done by setoguchi et al 1998 and those based on actual flow measurements near the rotor as done by paderi and puddu 2013 puddu et al 2014 the former are represented by the usual non dimensional torque and pressure difference coefficients equation 1 and by a global flow coefficient ϕ p equation 2 calculated using the piston velocity v p and hence neglecting compressibility effects in the chamber the latter are represented by coefficients of torque t and pressure drop p non dimensionalized with local values of flow velocity measured 0 5 c upstream of the blade and by a local flow coefficient ϕ l equation 3 2 ϕ p v p ω r m a 1 a 2 3 t t ρ w 2 t 2 r m 3 p δ p ρ w 2 t 2 ϕ l w 2 x w 2 t where w 2 x and w 2 t are the axial and tangential components of the relative flow velocity upstream of the rotor in the absence of swirl t t and p p but ϕ l v 2 x u ϕ p due to the compressibility of the air contained in the owc chamber to verify if the hysteresis is due to turbine aerodynamics the non dimensional torque and pressure drop coefficients are now calculated based on the local flow velocity evaluated 0 5 c upstream of the rotor the results are plotted in fig 5 as a function of the local flow coefficient ϕ l the turbine coefficients are in phase with the local flow coefficient ϕ l demonstrating that the hysteresis is not caused by dynamic effects on the turbine but by compressibility effects within the experimental system variable air chamber which causes a delay between the velocity of the piston and the mass flow passing through the turbine to explain this effect it is worth comparing the temporal evolution of local flow coefficient ϕ l calculated using values of flow velocity measured near the turbine as in equation 2 and piston based flow coefficients ϕ p calculated using the velocity of the piston as in equation 3 this comparison is reported in fig 6 it is evident how the air compressibility within the chamber determines a delay between piston velocity and air velocity in the turbine duct capacitive effect of the chamber which is responsible for the apparent hysteresis reported by setoguchi et al 1998 in fig 6 the maximum value of the local flow coefficient is about 3 larger than the theoretical one due to blockage effects within the turbine duct a detailed analysis of the flow features within the turbine is outside the scope of this work the interested reader is referred to ghisu et al 2016 where a complete analysis of the origin of the turbine forces and secondary flow structures during acceleration and deceleration is presented 4 lumped parameter model the cfd analysis presented in section 3 proves how the hysteretic behavior often discussed in wells turbine performance is due to compressibility effects in the air chamber i e to the delay between piston velocity and flow velocity in the turbine duct at this non dimensional frequency k π f c u 1 2 e 3 in fact it is reasonable to expect that dynamic effects on the turbine will be negligible carr et al 1977 if this explanation is correct the capacitive effect of the owc system could be simulated also with a lumped parameter model an approach largely used in the analysis of different systems it is noted from fig 1 that the system composed by owc chamber and duct where the wells turbine is installed shares significant similarities with for instance helmholtz resonators alster 1972 and pressure measurement systems doebelin and manik 2007 often studied with an lpm approach in the lpm analysis the tangential component of flow velocity will be neglected with reference to fig 1 the lumped parameter model for the system can be written by applying the continuity equation in the air chamber ① and the momentum equation in the turbine duct ② 4 d m 1 d t ρ f v f a f d ρ 2 v 2 x a 2 l d t p f p a a f f x in the first equation the rate of change of air mass m 1 in the chamber is equal to the mass flow passing through the interface f while in the second equation the rate of change in x momentum inside the turbine duct equals the sum of the forces applied to the control volume i e pressure forces on surfaces f and a and x component of the force exerted by the turbine some assumptions have been made compressibility effects within the duct are negligible due to its small volume compared with the volume of the air chamber ρ f ρ 2 ρ a and ρ f v f a f ρ 2 v 2 x a 2 ρ a v a a a and pressure at the interface f is approximated with p 1 inside the chamber forces due to friction inside the duct are neglected as they are significantly smaller than the ones exerted by the rotor thus one can write 5 d m 1 d t h 1 a 1 d ρ 1 d t ρ 1 a 1 d h 1 d t ρ a v 2 x a 2 d ρ 2 v 2 x a 2 l d t p 1 p a a 2 f x it should be noted that the term h 1 a 1 d ρ 1 d t represents the error made by setoguchi et al setoguchi et al 2003 kinoue et al 2003 when assuming the mass flow through the turbine to be in phase with the piston speed or ϕ l ϕ p this error becomes larger for larger variation in air density within the chamber but also for larger air chamber volumes the equations can be written in non dimensional form to directly highlight the relative influence of the different geometrical and flow parameters on the performance characteristics this has been achieved dividing the continuity equation by ρ a ω r m a 2 and the

coefficient ϕ l the non dimensional time step has been chosen after a sensitivity analysis similarly to what done in cfd analysis and a value of 5 10 4 proved to be sufficient to avoid any influence on the results the results presented in section 5 refer to the third piston period i e after the periodic convergence of the simulation had been obtained 4 2 analytical solution in order to define an

produced by the first order term in equation 14 the resistance represented by the turbine produces a delay between piston movement and mass flow in the turbine duct and a reduction in its maximum value while the effect on the former can be minimal although it needs to be taken into account when devising control strategies based on measurements in the owc chamber strati et al 2016 m zoughi et al 2015 garrido et al 2015 the latter generates a reduction in the energy available for the turbine and needs to be considered replacing the definitions of a b and c in equations 20 and 21 24 g s 1 ω

approach to the experimental test of setoghuchi et al setoguchi et al 1998 the lpm has been solved both numerically using a time marching scheme see section 4 1 and analytically after linearization see section 4 2 results obtained with both approaches will be compared against the experimental data from setoguchi et al 1998 and cfd results in fig 8 the temporal evolutions of the piston based flow coefficient ϕ p and of the local flow coefficient ϕ l for both analytical and numerical lpm solutions are compared a phase shift between ϕ p and ϕ l is evident as well as the similarity between numerical and analytical lpm solutions although small the delay that exists between piston and flow velocity is sufficient to produce a hysteresis when turbine forces that depend on local flow parameters are plotted as a function of piston speed as done by setoguchi et al in setoguchi et al 1998 and others thakker and abdulhadi 2008 camporeale and filianoti 2009 fig 9 a and b presents the turbine performance maps in terms of p and t as a function of the piston based flow coefficient the presence of phase difference between piston motion and mass flow in the turbine duct is the reason for the difference in performance during acceleration and deceleration already found in the experiments of setoguchi et al 1998 2003 thakker et al thakker and abdulhadi 2008 camporeale et al camporeale and filianoti 2009 and often erroneously referred to as turbine hysteresis setoguchi et al 1998 kinoue et al 2003 it is worth noting that the apparently small phase delay seen in the time evolution of flow coefficients fig 8 is sufficient to generate a clearly defined hysteretic loop in the representation of fig 9 a good agreement between experimental data and lpm is found especially for the numerical solution that is remarkably close to the cfd results the width of the hysteretic loop is well captured minor differences can be found between the two lpm implementations mainly due to the evaluation of the function representing the axial force coefficient it is expected that this difference will increase when the validity of the assumptions introduced in the linearized lpm section 4 2 becomes weaker in more complex cases when large variations in the coefficients are expected penalba and ringwood 2019 the non linear model should be used also given its low computational cost a few seconds on a standard destkop pc the main advantage of the linearized model is that it allows a clear understanding of the causes for the system behavior and a rapid evaluation of the relative importance of different geometric and working parameters these two aspects will be discussed in detail in sections 5 2 and 5 3 finally the lpm approach was able to show that the notorious hysteretic behavior of wells turbines is in reality a hysteresis of the owc system and not of the turbine the turbine is indeed subject to dynamic conditions but at a non dimensional frequency that is too low to generate any appreciable differences between acceleration and deceleration phase typical non dimensional frequencies for wells turbines are of the order of 10 3 or less well below the values that produce hysteresis for isolated airfoils and wings carr et al 1977 these results are substantiated by the cfd analyses presented in section 3 discussed in detail in ghisu et al 2016 and that have been also verified for different geometries ghisu et al 2015 2017a 2017b 5 1 influence of solidity once validated against cfd and experimental results the lumped parameter model presented in section 4 has been used to predict the effect of solidity on the performance of the system and in particular its effect on the hysteresis loop a lower and a larger solidity turbines σ 0 48 and σ 0 67 respectively tested by setoguchi with the same experimental setup setoguchi et al 1998 have been simulated apart from the solidity the other geometric and operating parameters remain fixed once again the data needed for the lpm models were deduced from the axial force and torque coefficients from cfd simulations the solidity has a direct effect on slope of the c x ϕ l curve the resistance produced by the rotor or on the coefficient c x ϕ in equation 12 furthermore a larger resistance produces an increase in the phase of the local flow coefficient equation 26 this is shown graphically in figs 10 and 11 where the analytical and numerical solutions are compared the small but well defined growth in the time shift visible passing from σ 0 48 to σ 0 67 is more evident when non dimensional parameters of pressure drop and torque are plotted vs the piston based flow coefficient ϕ p figs 12 and 13 compare the predictions of the non dimensional coefficients of pressure drop and torque obtained by means of the lumped parameter model both analytical and numerical with the experimental results presented by setoguchi et al 1998 and with cfd results as with the σ 0 57 case see fig 9 the delay between piston motion and mass flow passing through the turbine duct is at the origin of the widely documented hysteresis the results of the lumped parameter model show a good agreement with the cfd results and the experimental data the slope of the torque coefficient is slightly overpredicted in the σ 0 48 case fig 12b and this is caused by the difference between experiments and cfd already reported in ghisu et al 2016 where it was attributed to the difficulty in measuring the low values of torque in the experiments setoguchi et al 1998 this difference is not present for the higher solidity cases σ 0 57 and σ 0 67 the width of the hysteresis loop is always well predicted the delay caused by compressibility in the owc chamber is summarized in table 2 the phase shift of the local flow coefficient is reported for the different solidities the values predicted by lpm models and cfd approach have been obtained by fitting a sinusoidal function in the time evolution curve of the numerical data the results of the numerical lpm approach match closely the cfd results maximum error of 10 for σ 0 57 also it is found that the simple analytical model is fairly effective in predicting the correct trends maximum error 15 as already mentioned in section 5 this difference is expected to increase in case the coefficients of equation 11 deviate significantly from their values at rest in general the non linear model should be preferred also given its low computational cost 5 2 frequency analysis and bode plots the response of the system formed by air volume inside the owc and wells turbine can be analyzed in terms of its transfer function in the frequency domain bode plots can be used as a concise representation of the system s behavior magnitude and phase in the presence of external forcings of different frequencies bode plots for the system under consideration have been obtained from equations 20 and 21 and are reported in fig 14 for the three different turbines σ 0 48 σ 0 58 and σ 0 67 the main parameters used to generate these plots are reported in table 3 the natural frequency is the same for the three systems since this parameter is independent from the turbine characteristics which only affects the system s damping ratio from an analysis of fig 14 it is clear that all systems are over damped and operate at a frequency significantly lower than their natural frequency as a consequence the energy lost in the air chamber i e the reduction in the value of the maximum flow coefficient ϕ l ϕ p is minimal and equal to 0 5 of the energy entering the system for the case with the largest turbine solidity similarly the phase angle ξ the delay between ϕ p and ϕ l is not significant it has a value of 0 0981 for the system with the largest damping corresponding to the largest solidity turbine although small the phase delay between piston movement and mass flow entering the turbine is sufficient to show a hysteresis when turbine performance are reported as a function of the piston speed or the piston based flow coefficient ϕ p as shown in figs 9 12 and 13 as explained in section 3 the hysteresis is caused by the capacitive behavior of the owc chamber and not by aerodynamic effects in the turbine the delay and its origin may be important factors to be considered when implementing control strategy aiming at maximizing the energy extracted from the system strati et al 2016 m zoughi et al 2015 garrido et al 2015 5 3 sensitivity to system parameters while perhaps negligible for the systems considered in the previous sections the presence of an energy loss and of a phase delay between the conditions inside the chamber and the ones the turbine is exposed to need to be considered with attention when designing an owc system as their impact can become larger for different configurations the efficiency of the owc wells turbine system can be thought as the contribution of three efficiencies the efficiency of energy transfer from the sea waves to that of the water interface inside the chamber the efficiency of energy transfer from the water interface motion to the air flow passing through the wells turbine the efficiency of conversion of the latter into mechanical energy turbine and then electrical energy generator the second contribution is represented by the gain reported in equation 20 equations 24 and 25 show how the gain g s ϕ l ϕ p and the phase delay ξ depend on the angular frequency ratio ω ω n of the system and on its damping ratio ζ these two non dimensional parameters can be also written as follows 28 ω ω n ω l a γ h 10 a 1 l a 2 2 ζ c x φ γ h 10 a 1 l a 2 ω r m a several non dimensional parameters appear in the above equations ω l a is the product of angular wave frequency and of a system linear dimension l in this case non dimensionalized with the air speed of sound this parameter is representative of the combined effect of system size and wave angular frequency h 10 a 1 l a 2 is the ratio between chamber volume and turbine duct volume this geometrical parameter takes into account the relative influence of capacitive and inertial effects in the owc it affects both the angular frequency ratio and the damping ratio of the system c x ϕ is the turbine axial force coefficient introduced in equation 12 ω r m a is a non dimensional blade speed the last two parameters are representative of the turbine working conditions and influence only the damping ratio of the system actual ranges for the above parameters have been defined by means a literature survey of several full scale plants i e the ones in pico falcão 2000 limpet boake et al 2002 and mutriku torre enciso et al 2009 and are reported in table 4 the values of natural frequency and damping ratio of each owc wells turbine system are also shown they have been evaluated considering the following hypotheses the period of wind generated marine waves is generally between 1 and 30 s munk 1950 considering only wave frequencies with an exploitable energy content this range can be limited from 3 to 16 s holthuijsen 2007 garrido et al 2015 southampton oceanography centre 2001 to compare the different full scale plants with the set up studied in this paper see section 2 the non dimensional parameters reported in table 4 are evaluated considering a nominal value for the wave period equal to 6 s ω 1 05 s 1 values of ω have been kept constant and equal to the nominal value for each plant it is evident how significantly lower gains which means larger energy losses and larger phase delays are expected because of the interaction between owc chamber and turbine in the full size owc systems considered in table 4 the dependence of gain and phase in equations 28 on the wave period is reported in figure 15 where the behavior of the different systems can be observed for the laboratory setup analyzed in this work section 2 the gain is always close to unity and the phase delay is small for all the range of wave period analyzed the phase error is sufficient however to generate a visible hysteretic loops when turbine forces are plotted as a function of piston speed which was often erroneously interpreted as an aerodynamic hysteresis of the turbine kinoue et al 2003 2004 mamun et al 2004a hu and li 2017 the large gain and small phase of the laboratory setup are caused by the low value of the factor 2 ζ ω ω n as it can be deduced from equation 20 the limpet plant presents the largest value for this ratio and this entails the lowest values of gain and the largest absolute values of phase delay as shown in figure 15 the situation becomes even more extreme for higher frequency i e lower period waves these results prove how the efficiency of the energy conversion within the air chamber i e the from water column to the turbine is highly dependent on the characteristic of the owc turbine coupling and can be significantly reduced under some circumstances when designing a owc turbine assembly it is of fundamental importance to consider the coupling between owc and turbine to avoid undesirable energy losses furthermore the presence of a not negligible phase delay as well as its origin the capacitive behavior of the owc chamber need to be considered when designing a control system and the corresponding sensor layout aimed at maximizing the energy conversion 6 conclusions owc systems equipped with wells turbines are among the most well known devices for sea wave conversion their performance has been studied extensively usually by subdividing the overall problem in two simpler sub problems the conversion of wave energy into pneumatic energy in the owc and the conversion of the latter into mechanical energy through the turbine this separation has led to some necessary simplifications on the boundary conditions used for the two subsystems owc studies usually employ a simplified representation of the turbine while turbine studies usually fix the flow velocity entering the turbine either as constant or with a given periodic function lumped parameters models are often used for owc system analyses due to their low computational costs and the capability of correctly predicting the most important features of the device on the contrary turbine performance are usually studied with cfd approaches at a significantly larger computational cost with the aim of providing a lower order but still accurate mean of analyzing the turbine performance under dynamic operating conditions this work introduces a lumped parameter model to describe the interaction between the volume of air within the owc chamber and the turbine the model has been solved both analytically and numerically and the results compared with available experimental data and cfd results the model is able to accurately predict the dynamic behavior of the system in addition it provides a further evidence that the often discussed turbine hysteresis is in reality a hysteresis of the air volume turbine duct system caused by compressibility effect i e time shift within the air chamber and not by a difference in the turbine performance which is absolutely negligible at the non dimensional frequencies wells turbines usually operate at this result is in very good agreement with the results produced by higher order cfd models the model has been also applied to the analyzes of the air chamber turbine coupling of three full size owc plants this analysis demonstrates how in some occasions the energy loss in the conversion and the phase between conditions inside the chamber and near the turbine need to be considered with attention both for optimizing the overall system performance and when devising control strategies based on the measurement of flow properties inside the chamber given its low computational cost the proposed model represents an ideal candidate for integration with existing and new wave to wire models allowing a better representation to the bidirectional interaction between owc and turbine and therefore a fast and reliable method for owc turbine systems sizing and design acknowledgments this work has been funded by the regione autonoma

22398,systems composed of an oscillating water column and a self rectifying turbine are among the most well known devices for wave energy conversion these systems have been largely studied experimentally and numerically focusing either on owc hydrodynamic or power unit performance the turbine has been studied in experimental facilities that reproduced the periodic motion of the water column in the chamber by an artificially moved piston while owc performance has been generally studied neglecting or crudely simplifying the turbine interaction the objective of this work is to introduce a lumped parameter model able to reproduce the interaction of the turbine with the air mass in the owc chamber results are compared with experimental and cfd data and demonstrate that the often discussed hysteresis is caused by compressibility effects in the air chamber and not as previously assumed by turbine aerodynamics the model is also used to estimate energy loss and phase delay in full scale owc systems proving the importance of a correct sizing of owc turbine systems the lumped parameter model allows to rapidly isolate parameters with the largest influence on system performance and could be integrated with existing wave to wire models to improve the understanding of the hydrodynamic aerodynamic interaction in the overall system keywords owc systems wells turbines hysteresis cfd lumped parameter model 1 introduction wave motion has the highest energy density among renewable sources clément et al 2002 but it is not fully exploited when compared to the technological and commercial impact achieved by other renewable sources the large number of concepts for wave conversion can be classified by their mode of operation drew et al 2009 among these owc oscillating water column is one of the most investigated category falcão and henriques 2016 the working principle is based on the periodic movement of a column of water inside a chamber the top of which is occupied by a volume of air that feeds a turbine comprehensive comparisons of the different types of self rectifying turbines employed in owc systems are given in falcão et al 2012 2018 several owc systems have been built in the last decades the limpet plant in the island of islay scotland is composed of a rectangular inclined owc where the air flow feeds two contra rotating wells turbines the pico owc plant in the azores island is composed of a pneumatic chamber dimensioned to provide resonance with the incident sea state and a wells turbine with inlet outlet guide vanes brito melo et al 2008 the mutriku wave energy plant in the basque country consists of 16 chambers each feeding a bi plane wells turbine torre enciso et al 2009 smaller scale systems have also been built for research purposes and are investigated experimentally lopez et al 2015 ferguson et al 2015 mitchell ferguson et al 2017 mahnamfar and altunkaynak 2017 falcao et al falcão and henriques 2014 elhanafi et al 2017 and simonetti et al 2018 focused on the effect of system size on its performance due to the increased impact of compressibility at larger scales the challenges linked to experimental testing of a system with different hydrodynamic and power system scales favored the development of numerical approaches which can allow faster and less expensive analyses numerical approaches can be separated in lumped and distributed models the former use a usually small number of discrete entities to approximate the behavior of the system which is described by ordinary differential equations in the latter the fluid system involved is discretized in space and time and a set of partial differential equations is to be solved to predict its behavior lumped parameter models lpm can be written for owc analysis by applying the laws of conservation of mass energy and momentum in volumetric form they have been solved both in the time falcão and justino 1999 boccotti 2006 boccotti et al 2007 malara et al 2017 spanos et al 2017 and in the frequency domain folley and whittaker 2005 malara and arena 2013 rezanejad and guedes soares 2018 and have been used for studying the effects of air

zoughi et al 2015 garrido et al 2015 owc performance and its interaction with the sea waves have been investigated also with distributed models computational fluid dynamics cfd for instance the pilot plant in the island of pico azores was studied by brito melo and sarmento 2002 using a boundary element method approach and including the discretization of the natural gully where the owc is installed bouali and larbi 2013 used a cfd approach to study the influence of chamber dimensions on owc hydrodynamic efficiency similar approaches have been used by kamath et al 2015 moñino et al 2017 torresi et al 2016 simulated the behavior of an experimental device built to emulate a rewec1 resonant wave energy converter comparing the theoretical value obtained using a linearized lpm with cfd results all owc studies presented so far studied the behavior of the owc system employing a simplified representation of the turbine in lpm analyses the presence of the turbine is represented with a damping term while in cfd approaches its effect is generally modeled using a slot providing an equivalent pressure drop torresi et al 2016 lopez et al 2016 pereiras et al 2015 this approach is similar to the one used in reduced scale experimental studies simonetti et al 2017 many experimental and computational works have focused on the turbine behavior and performance isolating the turbine from the owc and therefore neglecting their interaction these studies have been conducted either in stationary operating conditions gato and falcao 1988 1989 thakker et al 2000 gato and webster 2001 kim et al 2002 takao et al 2008 moisel and carolus 2016 lopes et al 2017 with the use of a constant air supply or in dynamic conditions inoue et al 1988 takao et al 1996 setoguchi et al 1998 paderi and puddu 2013 puddu et al 2014 supplying a time varying flow rate usually by means of a piston moving inside a large chamber the piston effectively replaces the alternating movement of the water in the owc thereby providing a working condition more representative of the real one however the velocity of the piston is imposed rather than a result of the system geometry and applied forces sea waves turbine aerodynamic forces and endwall friction forces with the effect that this bi directional connection is lost for example there is no guarantee that in the presence of a different turbine the water motion will remain the same among the different experimental studies the works of setoguchi et al 1998 are of particular interest as they highlighted the presence of a hysteretic behavior in the turbine performance between acceleration and deceleration phases i e a delay between piston movement and turbine performance the majority of cfd analyses of the turbine have also been performed in isolation i e studying a domain encompassing only the annular duct that houses the turbine this has been done either for steady operation dhanasekaran and govardhan 2005 gareev et al 2009 pereiras et al 2014 halder and samad 2016 hu and li 2017 halder et al 2017 mahboubidoust and ramiar 2017 with a fixed mass flow set as boundary condition or for dynamic operation setoguchi et al 2003 kinoue et al 2003 2004 2007 mamun et al 2004a 2004b liu et al 2018 using a boundary condition for the mass flow varying with time in a way representative of what happens in the real owc dynamic cfd simulations have been used to explain the origin of the hysteresis found in experimental analyses setoguchi et al 1998 the cause has been attributed to a different interaction of blade wake vortices with other vortical structures during acceleration and deceleration for the same piston velocity setoguchi et al 2003 kinoue et al 2003 hu and li 2017 this phenomenon has often been compared to the hysteresis that is present in rapidly moving airfoils often referred to with the name dynamic stall however non dimensional frequencies wells turbine operate at are 2 orders of magnitude lower than the ones studied for rapidly pitching or plunging airfoils where hysteretic effects are documented only at frequencies well above 10 2 mccroskey 1981 recently ghisu et al 2015 2016 2017a 2017b 2018a revisited these analyses and found no hysteresis in the turbine forces showing how the original cfd studies kinoue et al 2003 were affected by an insufficient temporal discretization that caused a phase error confused by the authors with an aerodynamic hysteresis of the turbine on the contrary by simulating a domain more representative of the actual experimental setup a large chamber with a moving piston that drives the air in and out of the annular duct they discovered that the alleged hysteresis was caused by the capacitive effect of the chamber and not by the dynamic operation of the turbine in fact the compressibility of the air within the owc chamber causes a temporal delay between the movement of the water surface in the chamber and the mass flow passing through the turbine this behavior is physically similar to what happens in helmholtz resonators alster 1972 and pressure measurement systems doebelin and manik 2007 these two systems have been often studied using lpm approaches in light of these recent findings this work introduces a lumped parameter model of the owc chamber wells turbine system by applying the laws of mass and momentum conservation in integral form to appropriately selected control volumes the model is solved both analytically after linearization and numerically and its predictions are compared to higher order numerical results cfd and experimental data the model is able to correctly predict the interaction between owc chamber and turbine its accuracy together with the low computational cost make it an ideal candidate for integration with existing wave to wire models penalba and ringwood 2016 kelly et al 2016 bailey et al 2016 which could benefit from a better representation of the effect produced by the turbine the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the physical setup used in the experimental analyses of setoguchi et al 1998 that have been taken as a reference in this work section 3 presents the cfd simulations that will be used to define the turbine force coefficient required for the lumped parameter model section 4 discusses the lumped parameter model used to study the interaction between air volume inside the owc chamber and wells turbine and presents two possible approaches for its solution numerical and analytical after linearization section 5 presents a comparison of the results obtained from the lpm approach with the ones obtained with cfd and with the experimental data of setoguchi et al 1998 finally section 6 draws some conclusions and suggestions for future work 2 model description the device used by setoguchi et al 1998 aims to replicate within a laboratory the conditions that a wells turbine experiences when coupled with an owc by imposing a periodic motion to a piston inside a cylindrical chamber a mass of air is pushed in and out of a duct where a wells turbine is placed a schematic of the system is given in fig 1 the main dimensions of the turbine together with operating conditions during the experimental test are reported in table 1 the reynolds number based on blade chord and relative velocity ranged between 1 6 10 5 and 2 4 10 5 during the experiment

but rather estimated from piston speed using the conservation of mass and neglecting compressibility effects in the chamber v 2 x v p a 1 a 2 3 reference cfd analysis the cause of the hysteresis often discussed in wells turbine dynamic performance setoguchi et al 1998 and previously attributed to a aerodynamic hysteresis of the turbine kinoue et al 2003 hu and li 2017 has been recently shown by ghisu et al 2016 2017a to lie in the capacitive behavior of the owc chamber these works demonstrated how earlier cfd results were obtained using an insufficient temporal discretization that led to a phase error that caused the appearance of an artificial counter clockwise loop in the performance curves which was erroneously considered as an aerodynamic hysteresis early numerical analyses setoguchi et al 2003 kinoue et al 2003 hu and li 2017 simulated only the turbine duct see fig 2 setting at the duct inlet a velocity boundary condition that was determined assuming negligible compressibility in the chamber i e no delay between piston velocity and massflow through the turbine despite this assumption they found a hysteresis in the numerical results a delay between the boundary condition and turbine forces that they interpreted as an aerodynamic effect of the turbine however ghisu et al 2016 2017a 2019 showed how these results were affected by a numerical phase error when the time step used in the calculation is sufficiently reduced the delay and the consequent numerical hysteresis disappear ghisu et al 2019 it is important to highlight how this result is in accordance with the large existing literature on rapidly moving pitching or plunging airfoils where dynamic effects are considered negligible at non dimensional frequencies below 10 2 carr et al 1977 ghisu et al 2018b a value significantly larger than the ones experienced by wells turbines in order to understand the origin of the hysteresis reported in setoguchi et al 1998 ghisu et al 2016 simulated a physical domain truly representative of the actual experiment this included in addition to the duct where the wells turbine was placed the chamber used in the experiment to produce the air flow through the turbine by means of an alternating piston movement a sketch of the simulated fluid domain is reported in fig 3 the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations have been solved with compressible ideal gas hypothesis the turbulence problem has been closed with the k ω sst model the multi block structured grid used to solve the fluid dynamics equations consists of about 10 6 cells and the y value is of the order of one for all surface cells a dynamic mesh has been used to simulate the moving piston and the consequent variation in chamber size the transient simulation has been run for 3 piston periods ensuring that periodically stable results had been obtained with a time step of 5 10 4 s sufficient to achieve time step independent results ghisu et al 2016 2017a more details about the numerical model as well as a thorough verification of the spatial and temporal discretization approaches can be found in ghisu et al 2016 fig 4 reports the results for the medium solidity turbine σ 0 57 a comparison with experimental non dimensional torque and pressure drop coefficients of setoguchi et al 1998 as a function of the global piston based flow coefficient ϕ p is presented the numerical results closely reproduce the experimental data with the hysteresis largely discussed in previous works a correct analysis of the hysteresis requires a distinction between the performance parameters based on piston velocity as done by setoguchi et al 1998 and those based on actual flow measurements near the rotor as done by paderi and puddu 2013 puddu et al 2014 the former are represented by the usual non dimensional torque and pressure difference coefficients equation 1 and by a global flow coefficient ϕ p equation 2 calculated using the piston velocity v p and hence neglecting compressibility effects in the chamber the latter are represented by coefficients of torque t and pressure drop p non dimensionalized with local values of flow velocity measured 0 5 c upstream of the blade and by a local flow coefficient ϕ l equation 3 2 ϕ p v p ω r m a 1 a 2 3 t t ρ w 2 t 2 r m 3 p δ p ρ w 2 t 2 ϕ l w 2 x w 2 t where w 2 x and w 2 t are the axial and tangential components of the relative flow velocity upstream of the rotor in the absence of swirl t t and p p but ϕ l v 2 x u ϕ p due to the compressibility of the air contained in the owc chamber to verify if the hysteresis is due to turbine aerodynamics the non dimensional torque and pressure drop coefficients are now calculated based on the local flow velocity evaluated 0 5 c upstream of the rotor the results are plotted in fig 5 as a function of the local flow coefficient ϕ l the turbine coefficients are in phase with the local flow coefficient ϕ l demonstrating that the hysteresis is not caused by dynamic effects on the turbine but by compressibility effects within the experimental system variable air chamber which causes a delay between the velocity of the piston and the mass flow passing through the turbine to explain this effect it is worth comparing the temporal evolution of local flow coefficient ϕ l calculated using values of flow velocity measured near the turbine as in equation 2 and piston based flow coefficients ϕ p calculated using the velocity of the piston as in equation 3 this comparison is reported in fig 6 it is evident how the air compressibility within the chamber determines a delay between piston velocity and air velocity in the turbine duct capacitive effect of the chamber which is responsible for the apparent hysteresis reported by setoguchi et al 1998 in fig 6 the maximum value of the local flow coefficient is about 3 larger than the theoretical one due to blockage effects within the turbine duct a detailed analysis of the flow features within the turbine is outside the scope of this work the interested reader is referred to ghisu et al 2016 where a complete analysis of the origin of the turbine forces and secondary flow structures during acceleration and deceleration is presented 4 lumped parameter model the cfd analysis presented in section 3 proves how the hysteretic behavior often discussed in wells turbine performance is due to compressibility effects in the air chamber i e to the delay between piston velocity and flow velocity in the turbine duct at this non dimensional frequency k π f c u 1 2 e 3 in fact it is reasonable to expect that dynamic effects on the turbine will be negligible carr et al 1977 if this explanation is correct the capacitive effect of the owc system could be simulated also with a lumped parameter model an approach largely used in the analysis of different systems it is noted from fig 1 that the system composed by owc chamber and duct where the wells turbine is installed shares significant similarities with for instance helmholtz resonators alster 1972 and pressure measurement systems doebelin and manik 2007 often studied with an lpm approach in the lpm analysis the tangential component of flow velocity will be neglected with reference to fig 1 the lumped parameter model for the system can be written by applying the continuity equation in the air chamber ① and the momentum equation

the interface f while in the second equation the rate of change in x momentum inside the turbine duct equals the sum of the forces applied to the control volume i e pressure forces on surfaces f and a and x component of the force exerted by the turbine some assumptions have been made compressibility effects within the duct are negligible due to its small volume compared with the volume of the air chamber ρ f ρ 2 ρ a and ρ f v f a f ρ 2 v 2 x a 2 ρ a v a a a and pressure at the interface f is approximated with p 1 inside the chamber forces due to friction inside the duct are neglected as they are significantly smaller than the ones exerted by the rotor thus one can write 5 d m 1 d t h 1 a 1 d ρ 1 d t ρ 1 a 1 d h 1 d t ρ a v 2 x a 2 d ρ 2 v 2 x a 2 l d t p 1 p a a 2 f x it should be noted that the term h 1 a 1 d ρ 1 d t represents the error made by setoguchi et al setoguchi et al 2003 kinoue et al 2003 when assuming the mass flow through the turbine to be in phase with the piston speed or ϕ l ϕ p this error becomes larger for larger variation in air density within the chamber but also for larger air chamber volumes the equations can be written in non dimensional form to directly highlight the relative influence of the different geometrical and flow parameters on the performance characteristics this has been achieved dividing the continuity equation by ρ a ω r m a 2 and the

produced by the first order term in equation 14 the resistance represented by the turbine produces a delay between piston movement and mass flow in the turbine duct and a reduction in its maximum value while the effect on the former can be minimal although it needs to be taken into account when devising control strategies based on measurements in the owc chamber strati et al 2016 m zoughi et al 2015 garrido et al 2015 the latter generates a reduction in the energy available for the turbine and needs to be considered replacing the definitions of a b and c in equations 20 and 21 24 g s 1 ω

approach to the experimental test of setoghuchi et al setoguchi et al 1998 the lpm has been solved both numerically using a time marching scheme see section 4 1 and analytically after linearization see section 4 2 results obtained with both approaches will be compared against the experimental data from setoguchi et al 1998 and cfd results in fig 8 the temporal evolutions of the piston based flow coefficient ϕ p and of the local flow coefficient ϕ l for both analytical and numerical lpm solutions are compared a phase shift between ϕ p and ϕ l is evident as well as the similarity between numerical and analytical lpm solutions although small the delay that exists between piston and flow velocity is sufficient to produce a hysteresis when turbine forces that depend on local flow parameters are plotted as a function of piston speed as done by setoguchi et al in setoguchi et al 1998 and others thakker and abdulhadi 2008 camporeale and filianoti 2009 fig 9 a and b presents the turbine performance maps in terms of p and t as a function of the piston based flow coefficient the presence of phase difference between piston motion and mass flow in the turbine duct is the reason for the difference in performance during acceleration and deceleration already found in the experiments of setoguchi et al 1998 2003 thakker et al thakker and abdulhadi 2008 camporeale et al camporeale and filianoti 2009 and often erroneously referred to as turbine hysteresis setoguchi et al 1998 kinoue et al 2003 it is worth noting that the apparently small phase delay seen in the time evolution of flow coefficients fig 8 is sufficient to generate a clearly defined hysteretic loop in the representation of fig 9 a good agreement between experimental data and lpm is found especially for the numerical solution that is remarkably close to the cfd results the width of the hysteretic loop is well captured minor differences can be found between the two lpm implementations mainly due to the evaluation of the function representing the axial force coefficient it is expected that this difference will increase when the validity of the assumptions introduced in the linearized lpm section 4 2 becomes weaker in more complex cases when large variations in the coefficients are expected penalba and ringwood 2019 the non linear model should be used also given its low computational cost a few seconds on a standard destkop pc the main advantage of the linearized model is that it allows a clear understanding of the causes for the system behavior and a rapid evaluation of the relative importance of different geometric and working parameters these two aspects will be discussed in detail in sections 5 2 and 5 3 finally the lpm approach was able to show that the notorious hysteretic behavior of wells turbines is in reality a hysteresis of the owc system and not of the turbine the turbine is indeed subject to dynamic conditions but at a non dimensional frequency that is too low to generate any appreciable differences between acceleration and deceleration phase typical non dimensional frequencies for wells turbines are of the order of 10 3 or less well below the values that produce hysteresis for isolated airfoils and wings carr et al 1977 these results are substantiated by the cfd analyses presented in section 3 discussed in detail in ghisu et al 2016 and that have been also verified for different geometries ghisu et al 2015 2017a 2017b 5 1 influence of solidity once validated against cfd and experimental results the lumped parameter model presented in section 4 has been used to predict the effect of solidity on the performance of the system and in particular its effect on the hysteresis loop a lower and a larger solidity turbines σ 0 48 and σ 0 67 respectively tested by setoguchi with the same experimental setup setoguchi et al 1998 have been simulated apart from the solidity the other geometric and operating parameters remain fixed once again the data needed for the lpm models were deduced from the axial force and torque coefficients from cfd simulations the solidity has a direct effect on slope of the c x ϕ l curve the resistance produced by the rotor or on the coefficient c x ϕ in equation 12 furthermore a larger resistance produces an increase in the phase of the local flow coefficient equation 26 this is shown graphically in figs 10 and 11 where the analytical and numerical solutions are compared the small but well defined growth in the time shift visible passing from σ 0 48 to σ 0 67 is more evident when non dimensional parameters of pressure drop and torque are plotted vs the piston based flow coefficient ϕ p figs 12 and 13 compare the predictions of the non dimensional coefficients of pressure drop and torque obtained by means of the lumped parameter model both analytical and numerical with the experimental results presented by setoguchi et al 1998 and with cfd results as with the σ 0 57 case see fig 9 the delay between piston motion and mass flow passing through the turbine duct is at the origin of the widely documented hysteresis the results of the lumped parameter model show a good agreement with the cfd results and the experimental data the slope of the torque coefficient is slightly overpredicted in the σ 0 48 case fig 12b and this is caused by the difference between experiments and cfd already reported in ghisu et al 2016 where it was attributed to the difficulty in measuring the low values of torque in the experiments setoguchi et al 1998 this difference is not present for the higher solidity cases σ 0 57 and σ 0 67 the width of the hysteresis loop is always well predicted the delay caused by compressibility in the owc chamber is summarized in table 2 the phase shift of the local flow coefficient is reported for the different solidities the values predicted by lpm models and cfd approach have been obtained by fitting a sinusoidal function in the time evolution curve of the numerical data the results of the numerical lpm approach match closely the cfd results maximum error of 10 for σ 0 57 also it is found that the simple analytical model is fairly effective in predicting the correct trends maximum error 15 as already mentioned in section 5 this difference is expected to increase in case the coefficients of equation 11 deviate significantly from their values at rest in general the non linear model should be preferred also given its low computational cost 5 2 frequency analysis and bode plots the response of the system formed by air volume inside the owc and wells turbine can be analyzed in terms of its transfer function in the frequency domain bode plots can be used as a concise representation of the system s behavior magnitude and phase in the presence of external forcings of different frequencies bode plots for the system under consideration have been obtained from equations 20 and 21 and are reported in fig 14 for the three different turbines σ 0 48 σ 0 58 and σ 0 67 the main parameters used to generate these plots are reported in table 3 the natural frequency is the same for the three systems since this parameter is independent from the turbine characteristics which only affects the system s damping ratio from an analysis of fig 14 it is clear that all systems are over damped and operate at a frequency significantly lower than their natural frequency as a consequence the energy lost in the air chamber i e the reduction in the value of the maximum flow coefficient ϕ l ϕ p is minimal and equal to 0 5 of the energy entering the system for the case with the largest turbine solidity similarly the phase angle ξ the delay between ϕ p and ϕ l is not significant it has a value of 0 0981 for the system with the largest damping corresponding to the largest solidity turbine although small the phase delay between piston movement and mass flow entering the turbine is sufficient to show a hysteresis when turbine performance are reported as a function of the piston speed or the piston based flow coefficient ϕ p as shown in figs 9 12 and 13 as explained in section 3 the hysteresis is caused by the capacitive behavior of the owc chamber and not by aerodynamic effects in the turbine the delay and its origin may be important factors to be considered when implementing control strategy aiming at maximizing the energy extracted from the system strati et al 2016 m zoughi et al 2015 garrido et al 2015 5 3 sensitivity to system parameters while perhaps negligible for the systems considered in the previous sections the presence of an energy loss and of a phase delay between the conditions inside the chamber and the ones the turbine is exposed to need to be considered with attention when designing an owc system as their impact can become larger for different configurations the efficiency of the owc wells turbine system can be thought as the contribution of three efficiencies the efficiency of energy transfer from the sea waves to that of the water interface inside the chamber the efficiency of energy transfer from the water interface motion to the air flow passing through the wells turbine the efficiency of conversion of the latter into mechanical energy turbine and then electrical energy generator the second contribution is represented by the gain reported in equation 20 equations 24 and 25 show how the gain g s ϕ l ϕ p and the phase delay ξ depend on the angular frequency ratio ω ω n of the system and on its damping ratio ζ these two non dimensional parameters can be also written as follows 28 ω ω n ω l a γ h 10 a 1 l a 2 2 ζ c x φ γ h 10 a 1 l a 2 ω r m a several non dimensional parameters appear in the above equations ω l a is the product of angular wave frequency and of a system linear dimension l in this case non dimensionalized with the air speed of sound this parameter is representative of the combined effect of system size and wave angular frequency h 10 a 1 l a 2 is the ratio between chamber volume and turbine duct volume this geometrical parameter takes into account the relative influence of capacitive and inertial effects in the owc it affects both the angular frequency ratio and the damping ratio of the system c x ϕ is the turbine axial force coefficient introduced in equation 12 ω r m a is a non dimensional blade speed the last two parameters are representative of the turbine working conditions and influence only the damping ratio of the system actual ranges for the above parameters have been defined by means a literature survey of several full scale plants i e the ones in pico falcão 2000 limpet boake et al 2002 and mutriku torre enciso et al 2009 and are reported in table 4 the values of natural frequency and damping ratio of each owc wells turbine system are also shown they have been evaluated considering the following hypotheses the period of wind generated marine waves is generally between 1 and 30 s munk 1950 considering only wave frequencies with an exploitable energy content this range can be limited from 3 to 16 s holthuijsen 2007 garrido et al 2015 southampton oceanography centre 2001 to compare the different full scale plants with the set up studied in this paper see section 2 the non dimensional parameters reported in table 4 are evaluated considering a nominal value for the wave period equal to 6 s ω 1 05 s 1 values of ω have been kept constant and equal to the nominal value for each plant it is evident how significantly lower gains which means larger energy losses and larger phase delays are expected because of the interaction between owc chamber and turbine in the full size owc systems considered in table 4 the dependence of gain and phase in equations 28 on the wave period is reported in figure 15 where the behavior of the different systems can be observed for the laboratory setup analyzed in this work section 2 the gain is always close to unity and the phase delay is small for all the range of wave period analyzed the phase error is sufficient however to generate a visible hysteretic loops when turbine forces are plotted as a function of piston speed which was often erroneously interpreted as an aerodynamic hysteresis of the turbine kinoue et al 2003 2004 mamun et al 2004a hu and li 2017 the large gain and small phase of the laboratory setup are caused by the low value of the factor 2 ζ ω ω n as it can be deduced from equation 20 the limpet plant presents the largest value for this ratio and this entails the lowest values of gain and the largest absolute values of phase delay as shown in figure 15 the situation becomes even more extreme for higher frequency i e lower period waves these results prove how the efficiency of the energy conversion within the air chamber i e the from water column to the turbine is highly dependent on the characteristic of the owc turbine coupling and can be significantly reduced under some circumstances when designing a owc turbine assembly it is of fundamental importance to consider the coupling between owc and turbine to avoid undesirable energy losses furthermore the presence of a not negligible phase delay as well as its origin the capacitive behavior of the owc chamber need to be considered when designing a control system and the corresponding sensor layout aimed at maximizing the energy conversion 6 conclusions owc systems equipped with wells turbines are among the most well known devices for sea wave conversion their performance has been studied extensively usually by subdividing the overall problem in two simpler sub problems the conversion of wave energy into pneumatic energy in the owc and the conversion of the latter into mechanical energy through the turbine this separation has led to some necessary simplifications on the boundary conditions used for the two subsystems owc studies usually employ a simplified representation of the turbine while turbine studies usually fix the flow velocity entering the turbine either as constant or with a given periodic function lumped parameters models are often used for owc system analyses due to their low computational costs and the capability of correctly predicting the most important features of the device on the contrary turbine performance are usually studied with cfd approaches at a significantly larger computational cost with the aim of providing a lower order but still accurate mean of analyzing the turbine performance under dynamic operating conditions this work introduces a lumped parameter model to describe the interaction between the volume of air within the owc chamber and the turbine the model has been solved both analytically and numerically and the results compared with available experimental data and cfd results the model is able to accurately predict the dynamic behavior of the system in addition it provides a further evidence that the often discussed turbine hysteresis is in reality a hysteresis of the air volume turbine duct system caused by compressibility effect i e time shift within the air chamber and not by a difference in the turbine performance which is absolutely negligible at the non dimensional frequencies wells turbines usually operate at this result is in very good agreement with the results produced by higher order cfd models the model has been also applied to the analyzes of the air chamber turbine coupling of three full size owc plants this analysis demonstrates how in some occasions the energy loss in the conversion and the phase between conditions inside the chamber and near the turbine need to be considered with attention both for optimizing the overall system performance and when devising control strategies based on the measurement of flow properties inside the chamber given its low computational cost the proposed model represents an ideal candidate for integration with existing and new wave to wire models allowing a better representation to the bidirectional interaction between owc and turbine and therefore a fast and reliable method for owc turbine systems sizing and design acknowledgments this work has been funded by the regione autonoma

22399,in the present paper we study the hydrodynamic noise generated by a ship propeller in open sea conditions we use large eddy simulation for the hydrodynamic field whereas the acoustic field is reconstructed by applying the advective form of the ffowcs williams and hawkings equation a dynamic lagrangian model is adopted for the closure of the subgrid scale stresses and a wall layer model allows to skip the resolution of the viscous sub layer the acoustic equation is formulated in the integral form and solved through direct integration of the volume terms the propeller herein considered is a benchmark case whose fluid dynamic data are available in the literature a grid of about 3 106 cells is able to reproduce accurately both integral quantities like thrust and torque over the propeller and turbulence propagating downstream in the wake different noise generation mechanisms are investigated separately the linear terms give rise to a narrow band noise spectrum with a mean peak at the blade frequency and other peaks at frequencies multiple of the rotational one the non linear quadrupole term reveals a broad band noise spectrum the shaft vortex provides the largest contribution to the non linear part of the noise propagated in the far field keywords ship propeller les ffowcs williams and hawkings hydroacoustics 1 introduction generation and propagation of hydrodynamic noise in the marine environment is an emerging field of investigation due to its own impact on a number of engineering applications including among the others the marine propeller design slabbekoorn et al 2010 rako et al 2013 the international rules are becoming increasingly stringent in protected sea regions allowing the transit only of certified silent ships in areas of particular environmental value the threat of underwater noise pollution was recognized by the international maritime organization imo which adopted in 2014 the voluntary guidelines for the reduction of underwater noise produced by commercial shipping to address the impacts on marine life the development of new and complete noise prediction tools is hence required for the design of advanced environment friendly ships the underwater noise generated by a ship propeller propagates through two different mechanisms the first is associated with the propeller shape and rotational velocity it generates high level of pressure disturbance at the main frequency that is the rotation frequency multiplied by the number of blades the second is associated to the flow field around the propeller and the turbulent coherent structures that populate its wake moreover in presence of cavitation the acoustic signal appears even more loudly due to the presence of the vapor phase which usually exhibits unsteady features and the implosion of vapor bubbles hereafter unless specified we focus on the analysis of ship propeller in open sea conditions and in absence of cavitation over the years hydrodynamic performance as well as acoustics of ship propellers have been investigated using experimental as well as numerical techniques in different flow conditions several experimental studies collected data and provided important observations on the complex propeller wake dynamics for example fundamental works of jessup 1989 and chesnakas and jessup 1998 reported an accurate analysis of the three dimensional complex flow around propellers obtained through laser doppler velocimetry measurements recent studies provided detailed description of tip vortex evolution and interaction with the hub vortex under different propeller configurations and work conditions felli and falchi 2018 presented the comparison of the wake behavior in axis symmetric and in oblique inflow conditions for three inclination angles the authors analyzed the wake evolution and instability mechanisms through particle image velocimetry piv in the work of calcagno et al 2005 the complex interaction between the hull wake and propeller was addressed in felli et al 2011 the authors examined the dependence of the wake instability on the spiral to spiral distance through the use of three propellers with different number of blades these studies elucidated mechanisms of interaction and evolution of the vortex structures in the wake the destabilization of the tip vortices was found to occur before that of hub vortices independent on the number of blades and the propeller loading conditions the tip vortex dynamics is characterized by a multi step grouping mechanism driven by the mutual inductance between adjacent spirals numerical simulations of the hydrodynamic field have been carried out by several authors using different solution techniques first the potential flow theory has been used see among the other kerwin 1986 it was considered accurate enough to be used in the optimization process of a propeller design either to predict unsteady vibratory forces generated by a propeller or to estimate fluctuating loads on an individual blade as input to a structural analysis however the reliability of potential flow theory has been questioned in particular regarding the prediction of the three dimensional actual wake the reproduction of the unsteady trailing vortex wake interaction and the inability to reproduce the unsteady leading edge vortex separation more recently due to the continuous increase of the computer power the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations have been employed providing good prediction of the thrust and torque coefficients in a wide range of advance coefficients see among the others baek et al 2015 note that these coefficients represent the main output needed in the design process of the propeller for this reason the use of rans is nowadays a common practice for engineering purposes recently due to the available computation resources high resolution simulations of the turbulent field generated by the ship propeller have been carried out by different research groups among the others di mascio et al 2014 performed detached eddy simulations des of a propeller placed in oblique flow the authors adopted a grid of about 11 1 0 6 cells and observed a very complex vortical system composed of a strong tip vortex less intense trailing vortices due to the variation of the loading different blade root vortices and an intense hub vortex di felice et al 2009 carried out both experimental and numerical large eddy simulation les tests of a submarine propeller their fine mesh simulation composed of about 4 5 millions cells gave results in agreement with data obtained in physical laboratory chase and carrica 2013 performed rans des and delayed des ddes of a submarine propeller adopting four different grids the authors concluded that the grid refinement has weak effect on thrust and torque evaluation still being important for the accurate reproduction of the wake dynamics worth to be mentioned that in the eddy resolving simulations reported above di mascio et al 2014 and chase and carrica 2013 solved the field up to the wall while in di felice et al 2009 a wall layer model approach was adopted allowing for substantial reduction of the number of grid cells the very recent massive wall resolving 1 1 meaning that the near wall turbulent structures are directly resolved and a no slip condition is applied at the solid wall simulations of balaras et al 2015 kumar and mahesh 2017 and posa et al 2019 stand at the edge of the binomial accuracy computational cost the former carried out les of a propeller in open water conditions and in presence of an upstream appendage at zero incidence to deal with a realistic configuration they adopted the immersed boundary method and analyzed the flow physics and turbulence in the wake kumar and mahesh 2017 performed les using more than 180 millions of grid cells validated their results with experimental data and reported a wide and deep analysis on the fluid dynamics of the ship propeller an interesting aspect concerns the hub vortex which remains coherent over the length of the computational domain equal to 8 propeller diameters in posa et al 2019 les results were validated against piv measurements the authors adopted the immersed boundary method with a cylindrical eulerian grid composed of about 840 million nodes these studies have clearly shown the superiority of eddy resolving simulations with respect to ranss when the aim is to study the wake dynamics most of the studies on this topic in addition to the above mentioned references have reported on the presence of strong hub vortex remaining coherent over a length longer than the tip vortex this feature has some relevance in the present study and will be exploited in the next sections to summarize different numerical techniques with increasing complexity and computational cost have been applied over the years for the evaluation of the hydrodynamic field generated by a ship propeller it is now well established that the potential flow theory can provide useful data for the structural analysis of the propeller bulk coefficients of the propeller are well evaluated by using low order models rans both in steady and unsteady conditions on the opposite side wall resolving les provides very accurate pressure and velocity fields both in the near propeller region as well as in the wake although at a cost of very expensive and time consuming simulations intermediate techniques like des or wall modeled les wles appear as a good accuracy computational cost compromise providing accurate results over the propeller and in the wake using grid size as small as 10 1 0 2 times that needed using wall resolving les for this reason and with the aim of developing a methodology that can be used for engineering purposes wles is the approach accomplished in the present paper apart for the prediction of the hydrodynamic characteristics of the propeller the computational fluid dynamic analysis can be useful for the prediction of the noise propagated in the far field in fact the acoustic analysis of a ship propeller is a subject that has aroused growing interest in recent years usually in numerical studies the acoustic analogy is employed meaning that the solution of the hydrodynamic field is decoupled from that of the acoustic one the latter being reconstructed solving the ffowcs williams and hawkings fwh equation ffowcs williams and hawkings 1969 the equation formulated into an integral form shows that the radiated acoustic disturbance is given by the sum of linear terms associated to the pressure over the solid surface loading term and to the rotational velocity of the blades thickness term and of non linear ones quadrupole terms associated to the presence of the turbulent wake the hydroacoustic analysis of ship propellers or more complex multi body configurations including hull rudder and appendages has been based for long time on the coupling of rans and fwh linear or porous equation since rans was thought to be able to characterize the acoustic signature of the propeller in a relatively simple way however the results obtained from coupling rans models with different methodologies based on the fwh equation showed clearly that both in the case of isolated propeller ianniello et al 2013 and propeller together with hull rudder and appendages ianniello et al 2014 the calculated noise tends to decrease very fast as soon as the microphone moves away from the body moreover the calculated acoustic pressure is narrow banded and exhibits predominantly tonal features moreover the contribution of thickness and loading terms generated by a marine propeller can be extremely low unlike what happens in the aeronautical field to the point of becoming negligible compared to the non linear effects these non linear effects coming from the wake developing downstream a propeller become of fundamental acoustic importance consequently an accurate and reliable evaluation of the quadrupole non linear sources is required and cannot be adequately evaluated by a rans model recent literature has established that les may be the best method to reproduce the noise source since it provides dataset containing the relevant frequencies for the analysis of radiated noise from a marine propeller this because of the fact that the large and relevant turbulent scales are directly resolved whereas the small unresolved scales are uncorrelated and do not contribute to the radiated noise keller et al 2018 studied a five blades propeller using les and analyzed in detail the noise emission given by the thickness and loading terms by isolating the contribution of different circular sections on the propeller surface results show that although the individual blades are strongly tonal in the rotor plane the propeller is acoustically compact at low frequency and the tonal sound interferes destructively in the far field also the majority of the propeller sound is generated by localized unsteadiness at the blade tip which is caused by shedding of the tip vortex the experimental study of felli et al 2014 reported the analysis of the noise sources over a rudder located behind a marine propeller the investigation concerned near field pressure fluctuations measurements on the face and back surfaces of the rudder at different deflection angles a novel wavelet based filtering procedure was presented able to separate the acoustic and hydrodynamic components of the recorded pressure signals the study highlighted that the acoustic perturbation is mainly correlated with the unsteady load variations of the rudder and to the shear layer fluctuations of the propeller streamtube the importance of the evaluation of the quadrupole term in hydrodynamics was highlighted among the others by cianferra et al 2019 who used the acoustic analogy in conjunction with les fields to evaluate the noise produced by a finite size cylinder the authors showed that the direct evaluation of the non linear volume terms can be carried out in a very efficient way in a class of problems including hydrodynamics where compressible effects in the fluid dynamic field are unimportant the authors also showed that the quadrupole terms can give contribution in a wide range of frequencies in a companion paper cianferra et al 2018a the authors used the same methodology to study the effect of the shape of simple bluff bodies on the emitted noise they showed that sharp corner geometries are more loudly than a sphere and that a prolate spheroid produces a noise one order of magnitude smaller than a cube or a sphere also a direct comparison between a cube and a square cylinder showed that the quadrupole terms produced by the former is much less relevant than that produced by the elongated body due to the persistence of the wake in the latter case in the present study we extend and deepen the work presented in cianferra et al 2018b on the noise radiated from a ship propeller in open sea condition and in absence of cavitation our main scope is to evaluate the complete sound pressure level including the low frequency contribution related to the non linear quadrupole terms associated to the coherent structures in the wake in order to obtain reliable turbulent data we perform les of the turbulent field around the rotating body further to avoid the need of using huge grid also in view of engineering applications wall layer modeling is employed the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we report the governing equations for the fluid dynamic field together with the turbulence subgrid scale sgs model and the acoustic equation in section 3 the propeller benchmark case is described and in sections 4 and 5 we discuss respectively the fluid dynamic and the acoustic results finally in section 6 we give concluding remarks 2 numerical model the problem under investigation is axis symmetric with a constant rotation rate under these conditions the governing equations can be solved in the frame of reference rotating with the propeller introducing body forces accounting for rotational effects the incompressible navier stokes equations are thus formulated for the absolute velocity vector as proposed in kumar and mahesh 2017 with the coriolis and centrifugal body forces that take into account

model as discussed in the introduction less of ship propellers have been carried out at a model scale using wall resolving les this means that the near wall layer together with the turbulent structures are directly resolved with a computational cost which increases with r e 2 5 piomelli and balaras 2002 the literature wall resolving less of ship propeller in open sea conditions have generally employed a number of grid cells of the order of 1 0 8 1 0 9 requiring the use of a large number of cores on supercomputers these simulations have exploited flow features not observable in rans like simulations as well as in laboratory experiments also alternative strategies intermediate between rans and wall resolving les are hybrid techniques like among the others detached eddy simulation des and wall layer modeled les wles these hybrid techniques were already used for simulation of open water ship propellers see the introduction and have the advantage to allow for the reduction of grid points in the region close to the blades and the use of high resolution in the wake responsible of the quadrupole component of the noise propagated in the far field wles is commonly in use in the scientific community since it greatly reduces the computational cost of the simulation which increases with re since the inertial part of the boundary layer is resolved through the les whereas the viscous near wall region is modeled through a wall layer model which is required to reproduce correctly the wall shear stress previous studies piomelli and balaras 2002 radhakrishnan and piomelli 2008 wang 1999 2000 addressed the problem of the wall layer models based on the logarithmic law they compared the performance of the equilibrium wall layer model with improved versions of it namely considering also both pressure gradient and advective or unsteady terms for example in wang 2000 the friction coefficient of an airfoil was computed using different wall layer model less and compared with wall resolved les the best results were obtained through the two layer model tlm which involves the use of two separate grids the results obtained with other wall layer models including the one adopted in our work were all somewhat inaccurate in particular in the reverse pressure gradient region however the equilibrium wall layer model reproduced the peak value of the skin friction coefficient accurately further the results presented in radhakrishnan and piomelli 2008 where an oscillating boundary layer was studied a very complex problem subject to periodic acceleration deceleration during the oscillatory cycle exhibited acceptable agreement between the wall layer model les and resolved les finally wang 1999 computed the far field noise generated by the sharp trailing edge and found that the predictions of the calculations with approximate boundary conditions with logarithmic model did not match the resolved ones in the frequency range associated with scales generated in the separation region whereas at other frequencies the agreement was acceptable to summarize although it is well known in literature that the equilibrium wall layer model is a basic model it has also been recognized that it is robust in a number of complex flow cases including curvature local acceleration and stratification the main drawback of this model is in the reproduction of massive separation which is not the case investigated in our manuscript in the case of ship propellers in open sea conditions the equilibrium stress model is expected to provide reasonable accurate results as already shown in di felice et al 2009 to account for the desired stress at the wall the boundary conditions for the scalar field ν s g s need to be updated at every time step of the simulation the procedure is as follows i the wall stress τ w is obtained from instantaneous horizontal velocity at the first off the wall centroid based on law of the wall 10 u p 1 k l n y p b i f y p 11 y p i f y p 11 where u p u p u τ u 2 v 2 u τ is the modulus of instantaneous non dimensional velocity at the first off the wall computational node p placed at distance y p from the wall k 0 41 is the von kármán constant and b 5 1 note that u and v represent the two components of the tangential velocity to the wall more precisely in this section x y z are respectively the streamwise spanwise and the wall normal directions and u v w the corresponding velocity components the modulus of the friction velocity u τ is calculated from the velocity u p at each p point and depends on the distance from the wall y p either from linear or logarithmic law then the wall shear stress τ w is calculated from the friction velocity as τ w ρ u τ 2 ii the wall stress τ w is used to determine the boundary condition for the turbulent viscosity ν s g s considering the relation τ w ν ν s g s δ u δ y being the gradient of velocity δ u δ y u p u b y p where u b is the value of the velocity at the wall in our case u b corresponds to the tangential velocity given by rotation thus the information from the flow first cell off the wall is used to determine local wall stress which is then fed back to the les in the form of the proper momentum flux at the wall due to normal diffusion further since the numerical evaluation of the leading terms of s i j in the computation of ν s g s becomes increasingly wrong with decreasing grid resolution they are replaced by the analytical values based on the location of y p as proposed in stocca et al 2011 11 s x z u τ κ y p u u p s y z u τ κ y p v u p i f y p 11 s x z u τ 2 ν u u p s y z u τ 2 ν v u p i f y p 11 consequently the value of eddy viscosity near the wall adjusts consistently with the imposed stress as described and validated in fakhari et al 2018 2 3 acoustic model to reconstruct the acoustic field we adopt the advective form of the ffowcs williams and hawkings fwh equation given in cianferra et al 2019 2018a and reported here 12 c 2 h f p ˆ t ρ 0 v n ρ u n v n δ f x i p n ˆ i ρ u i u n v n δ f 2 x i x j t i j h f where c 2 2 t 2 c 0 2 2 x i x j 2 u 0 j 2 t x j u 0 i u 0 j 2 x i x j represents the convective form of the d alembert operator being u 0 i the mean flow velocity along i direction in eq 12 the function f describes the surface 13 s x f x t 0 the function f is such that f x t 0 within s and f x t 0 outside s h and δ are the heaviside and dirac delta functions respectively and indicate where the integration is defined specifically if v is the volume outside the closed surface s h f 1 for x v and h f 0 for x within s while δ f 0 only for x s and h f δ f n δ f the common assumption is that f 1 and f is a smooth function defined everywhere note that the use of dirac and heaviside functions is a mathematical formalism that allows to limit the acoustic sources distribution to specific surfaces or fluid regions v n is the velocity of the surface s projected along the outward normal to s represented by the unit vector n ˆ ρ is the constant density of the flow field p is the pressure distribution on the surface s which may coincide with the body surface in this case eq 12 is referred to as fwh direct formulation and it verifies u n v n alternatively the surface s may describe a not physical surface external to the body often referred to as porous domain or control surface in this case the net flow across s is given by the difference u n v n 0 in the present work the fwh direct formulation is adopted since it allows a separate analysis of the linear and non linear terms contribution the differential form 12 may be turned into the following integral form by considering the free space three dimensional advective green s function 14 p ˆ thickness loading τ d s quadrupole τ d v the first two source terms on the right hand side of eq 12 give rise to surface integrals thickness and loading terms in eq 14 and the procedure is described in detail in najafi yazdi et al 2011 the transformation of the third quadrupole term of eq 12 requires the manipulation of the double spatial derivative of the green s function and the procedure is described in detail in cianferra et al 2019 2018a then they have formulated a criterion for selecting cases where the computation of the time delays can be omitted and finally assessed different methodologies for the evaluation of the quadrupole terms the authors concluded that when the source is compact quantified by a value of the maximum frequency parameter m f p 1 δ d e l f m a x 1 where δ d e l max y x m i c min y x m i c c 0 with y v and f m a x the highest frequency at which the fluid dynamic phenomena is observed the direct integration of the volume terms can be performed neglecting the time delays and the solution is more accurate when compared with other solution techniques i e porous method since this is the case in the present study we calculate the fwh non linear terms by direct integration over volume regions including the wake finally differently than in cianferra et al 2019 2018a here we consider a rotating frame of reference since the cfd simulation is carried out likewise thus when computing the distance r x t y τ inside the integrals where x is the measurement point also referred to as probe or microphone and y is the source point which varies along the solid surface or along the volume one needs to consider the measurement point x as it were rotating with angular velocity ω ω 3 hydrodynamics of the propeller in this study we consider a benchmark propeller the sva vp1304 whose complete documentation including geometry experimental data and numerical results is available online 2 2 https www sva potsdam de en potsdam propeller test case pptc the data for both the open water and the installed configurations were presented and discussed in the international symposiums on marine propulsors in 2011 and 2015 respectively in the present study we carry out the analysis of the uniform flow case of an isolated propeller at design advance ratio and reynolds number 15 j v u 0 n d 1 0683 r e u 0 d ν 889 680 where u 0 4 m s is the advance velocity n is the rotational velocity in rps and d 0 25 m the diameter of the propeller for the value j v 1 0683 the thrust k t and torque k q coefficients are 16 k t s ρ n 2 d 4 0 3538 k q q ρ n 2 d 5 0 09096 where s and q are the thrust and the torque provided by the propeller in the experimental set up the rotation direction is right handed the solid body is composed of the five blade propeller and the shaft placed downstream according to the typical arrangement for isolated or equivalently open sea propeller performance assessment we use a cylindrical numerical domain as sketched in fig 1 a the diameter is equal to 7 d and the length is 10 d as suggested in kumar and mahesh 2017 the reference coordinate system is chosen such that the blades of the propeller are located at the plane x 0 and the flow is in the direction of negative x so that u 0 x 4 m s the axis of rotation of the frame of reference is r 0 the plane containing the blades is located 3 d downstream of the inlet and 7 d upstream of the outlet section the grid is obtained in the following way we generate a cylindrical o grid non uniform along the streamwise direction the cells are clustered in the regions occupied by the shaft and the blades and coarsened moving towards the cylindrical lateral boundaries then we adopt the openfoam tool snappyhexmesh to build the mesh merging geometry of the propeller within the cylindrical grid the mesh quality parameters fit the openfoam criteria of aspect ratio skewness and non orthogonality the near wall resolution is such to obtain a distance of the first grid point off the wall of about y 40 as required by the use of wall layer models a grid of about 3 millions of grid cells was built the grid refinement in the wake region was aimed at avoiding the artificial smearing of the helical tip vortex in the wake since it may give a significant contribution to the non linear part of the noise the present level of wake refinement was already tested in cianferra et al 2018b the wles was started from a solution obtained with a rans model on the same grid in order to avoid the initial development stage also after about 60 revolutions obtained by the wles the fluid dynamic data were collected for about 5 revolutions the time step of the les is d t 1 0 4 s giving a courant number 0 4 the flow fields were printed out every d t f l u i d 0 01333 s which corresponds to 72 degrees to carry out the phase average analysis of the fluid dynamics field and every d t a c o 0 0027 s which corresponds to about 15 degrees for the acoustic analysis adopting the sampling time d t a c o an entire revolution 360 degrees is discretized with just 22 snapshots this implies a loss of information on the high frequencies but allows to collect data for several revolutions in order to study the appearance of lower frequency modes we use the standard piso algorithm implemented in openfoam version 2 3 but modified by including the non inertial forces in the momentum equation as described in eq 2 as boundary conditions at the inlet section we give a uniform flow field with the advance velocity u 0 x 4 m s at lateral boundaries we set a slip condition and at the outlet we impose a zero gradient condition at the solid walls of the shaft hub and blades the tangential velocity is given as u t r ω r with r radial distance from the rotation axis and ω 2 π n 0 0 with n 15 r p s for the pressure we set p n 0 to all boundaries of the computational domain n being the direction normal to the surface the constant flow density and the speed of sound are set to ρ 998 kg m 3 and c 0 1400 m s respectively these quantities being necessary for the acoustic analysis 4 fluid dynamic analysis the simulation results are compared with available experimental data for the value of the advance coefficient j 1 068 we obtain the following values of the force and torque coefficients 17 k t 0 3414 k q 0 09051 corresponding to errors of 18 e k t 3 5 e k q 0 5 with respect to experimental data the coefficients are reproduced satisfactorily in previous studies carried out using wles see for example di felice et al 2009 where an equilibrium wall layer model was adopted thrust and torque were obtained with error of about 5 with respect to the experimental values we also observed a dependency of the coefficients k t and k q on the grid size in agreement with previous studies see for example chase and carrica 2013 di felice et al 2009 in the previous test discussed in cianferra et al 2018b we used a grid of about 6 million cells same as the one described here in the wake region but refined close to the propeller boundaries mean distance of the first grid point off the wall 15 y the results concerning the mean values of thrust and torque coefficients were slightly worse than those obtained in the present study but the time spectra of k t and k q appeared qualitatively comparable with that reported in kumar and mahesh 2017 namely broadband and with peaks on both revolution and blade frequency with the present resolution near the wall the values of k t and k q are closer to the experimental data and the time signal exhibits smaller fluctuations similarly to what reported in chase and carrica 2013 for a resolved des fig 2 a shows the signal in time expressed as rotational angle of k t k t k t in the range 150 550 degrees of rotation the two signals refer to two different simulations the one reported in a previous work cianferra et al 2018b and the one carried out in the present study the coefficient appears in statistically steady conditions with fluctuations around the mean value as discussed above the fluctuations of the signal relative to the grid more refined at the wall are more energetic compared to the signal obtained with the present grid these results are reasonable in that the wall layer model is designed to work better when the first grid point is placed in the log region of the boundary layer and thus in this case the thrust and the drag are reproduced with good accuracy on the other hand the increase of the distance of the first point from the wall reduces the level of fluctuations at the wall we also carried out a simulation after switching off the wall layer model thus performing an under resolved les the coefficients were strongly underestimated for example the value of the thrust coefficient k t decreased after about 7000 iterations which is approximately one revolution up to an error of about 30 this demonstrates the need to use a wall layer model in the present case to reproduce the near wall dynamics and obtain the correct stress at the wall the fact that our simulation gives accurate values of the coefficients is not surprising since the equilibrium wall layer model is very robust and accurate in simulations of non separated boundary layer as for the case of the blades of the propeller on the other hand the fact that reasonable results can be obtained making use of wall layer modeling approaches makes the analysis of ship propeller affordable even for engineering purposes to the best of our knowledge there are not quantitative literature data on the fluid dynamic field generated by the propeller investigated in this paper thus we proceed with qualitative comparison with results reported in the high resolution les of kumar and mahesh 2017 and posa et al 2019 where wall resolving les were performed in conjunction with huge grids the authors studied propellers different from the present one with a different advance ratio j and reynolds number in kumar and mahesh 2017 j 0 889 and r e 8 9 1 0 5 while in posa et al 2019 three different working conditions were considered j 0 74 0 65 0 56 also both in kumar and mahesh 2017 and posa et al 2019 the shaft is located upstream although qualitative the comparison of non dimensional quantities may be useful to place our data within the context of eddy resolving simulations of ship propellers also in view of the relevant acoustic analysis coherent structures are observed up to 4 d downstream of the propeller in fig 2 b the isosurface of the non dimensional vorticity magnitude ω d u 0 9 4 is reported after that length because of the grid coarsening along the x direction the grid resolution is not sufficient to capture accurately the tip vortex which furthermore tends to lose energy and to dissipate the tip and hub vortices are structures commonly observed in the wake of marine propellers di mascio et al 2014 kumar and mahesh 2017 in the present case we reproduce a pulling type propeller configuration typical of scale model tests in water basins this configuration differs from the real scale application where the propeller is in a pushing type configuration the main difference stands in the fact that being the shaft located downstream of the propeller we observe a shaft vortex instead of hub coherent structures in fact from the base of the propeller blades a vortex is created which then twists around the shaft along a helical shape this is clearly depicted in fig 3 through the q criterion figs 3 a and 3 b depict the isosurface q d 2 u 0 2 40 and 80 respectively we recall that positive values of the scalar q indicate flow regions characterized by vorticity the case of q d 2 u 0 2 40 is comparable with that reported in posa et al 2019 keeping in mind all the differences between the two cases in both figures the contour of the magnitude of vorticity and of the scalar q reveals the shaft vortex to be more energetic than the tip vortex this has important effects in the acoustic analysis reported in the next section 5 our results are consistent with those of kumar and mahesh 2017 where the hub vortex was observed to remain coherent over the entire length of the computational domain in figs 4 and 5 we select different planes perpendicular to the mean flow direction at locations x d 0 2 0 2 0 6 1 3 5 respectively from top panel to bottom panel there we show the contour plot of phase average non dimensional axial velocity vorticity magnitude and turbulent kinetic energy tke from left panel to right panel phase average is computed as f x i 1 m f x t 0 i 1 t m where f is the phase average value of any field f and t 1 n n is the period associated to blade passage consistently with kumar and mahesh 2017 the upstream region is characterized by the suction effect of the propeller this clearly appears looking at the axial velocity vorticity and tke fig 4 which also show that the propeller induced perturbations do not produce significant turbulence the level of tke in the upstream region is comparable with that of kumar and mahesh 2017 although a bit lower which is probably due to our grid resolution compared to the reference ones as large as 100 time our one however the tke contour plot near the propeller second row panel shows significant traces of turbulent fluctuations we observe a phenomenon similar to that described in kumar and mahesh 2017 namely as soon as the tip vortex becomes unstable the tke starts increasing at about three diameters downstream of the propeller and beyond both the tip and the shaft vortex break down completely producing tke see last two rows of fig 5 note that the highest values of tke and vorticity are observed around the shaft comparing the vorticity magnitude with those of posa et al 2019 we note a similar behavior and values except for the high values we have around the shaft which in their case decrease faster downstream this may be due to the different blade geometry and work conditions but also because of the presence of the shaft downstream which in the present case may help to keep the vortex structure consistent in space moreover we remind that we set the slip condition on the shaft and prevents from the interaction and coalescence of the hub vortex with the tip vortex as a further consequence of the grid coarseness with respect to the reference wall resolving less we observe the weakening of tip vortex signatures in the downstream region at about 2 diameters see fig 5 whereas it occurs more downstream at about 3 diameters in kumar and mahesh 2017 fig 6 shows the axial component of vorticity fields at x d 0 4 0 6 downstream of the propeller the spiral roll up of the blade wake vortex sheet is not as well defined as in kumar and mahesh 2017 however it is clear that clockwise vorticity is released by the propeller tip while a counterclockwise spiral mode characterizes the motion around the shaft the opposite sign between tip and shaft vortex may be observed also in fig 7 and it is reported in kumar and mahesh 2017 they observe opposite sign between tip and hub vortex in fig 7 non dimensional z component of vorticity contour is depicted on the plane z 0 we can anticipate that from an acoustic point of view shaft and tip vortex are relevant both having considerable amount of vorticity note that the shaft vortex is commonly observed and referred to as hub vortex being the shaft located upstream in previous studies see for example okulov and sørensen 2007 the hub vortex is found to be stronger than the tip vortex being generated by the coalescence of the blade root vortices and thus having a strength that is n times larger than that of the tip vortex in the present study the flipped shaft configuration influences the flow dynamics and the interaction among the vortical structures however a very energetic vortex is created which is rolled up around the shaft and remains stable downstream this is an important issue which deserves discussion the configuration herein studied is that typically employed in open water laboratory scale tests which substantially differ from the real scale application this is typically done under the assumption that the presence of the shaft which has to sustain the propeller during the test does not affect the loads thrust and torque over the propeller although this is true for the loads it has to be noticed that the downward shaft substantially modifies the structure of the wake since its own interaction with the tip vortex differs from the mutual influence between tip and hub vortex in other words if one is interested in the analysis of the wake developing downward a propeller the pulling type test is not the best suited for that in figs 8 and 9 we report the contour plot of phase average non dimensional pressure root mean square of pressure and turbulent viscosity ν s g s from left panel to right panel the different planes perpendicular to the mean flow direction are located at x d 0 2 0 2 0 6 1 3 5 respectively from top panel to bottom panel the low pressure cores of tip vortices are evident up to x d 1 downstream at x d 3 5 the region of low pressure around the shaft emphasizes the presence of the vortex the pressure fluctuation associated to the tip vortex are visible near the propeller up to a distance of 0 6 d while the region inside the shaft vortex contains large pressure fluctuations up to 5 diameters downstream the contour plot of eddy viscosity normalized with the molecular viscosity shows satisfactory values in the tip vortex regions and around the shaft a comparison with previous figs 4 and 5 shows that the turbulent transfer of energy occurs in regions characterized by high vorticity the fact that vortex cores are not evident and the contour plots show instead continuous strips is due to the phase average procedure we may conclude that the contour plot of the three quantities are in good qualitative agreement with the results reported in kumar and mahesh 2017 although the working condition is different and considering that our grid in much coarse finally the flow field in the wake of the blade is depicted in fig 10 contours of radial top left panel and axial top right panel non dimensional velocity fields are extracted on a r x plane with r being the radial direction the plane is located at the end of the trailing edge as sketched in fig 10 bottom panel the vortex sheet in the trailing edge wake of the blade can be observed in both axial and radial velocity fields the jump in radial velocity is quite sharp as also evidenced in kumar and mahesh 2017 overall our results exhibit a good accuracy when compared to high resolution reference simulations which take advantage of grids as large as 100 times our one this is true for the propeller coefficients as well as for the fluid dynamics of the wake which is relevant for the non linear quadrupole contribution to the noise 5 acoustic analysis as mentioned the computation of fwh volume integrals is feasible only in case of compact sources thus when time delays are unimportant otherwise the storing process of all the fluid dynamic data is too expensive in terms of ram and cpu time in literature it is common to find the assumption of compact noise source in cianferra et al 2019 a rigorous discussion was proposed based on a dimensional analysis involving source length maximum frequency and speed of sound and giving a criterion based on the value of the non dimensional parameter mfp in presence of a moving body such as a rotating propeller a consideration on the importance of time delays can be addressed by calculating the retarded surface σ see ianniello et al 2013 σ is defined for each time t of signal reception and for each observation point x therefore it would be σ σ t x and is the surface constituted by the points y τ such that t τ x y τ c 0 0 in this case the observer x is at rest and the source y rotates and changes in time the procedure of calculating σ consists of i choose a time t of acoustic signal reception and an observer location x i i calculate τ with the bisection method on the function f τ t τ x y τ c 0 where y τ are the points on the propeller that are rotating and x is a microphone location i i i once τ is found that satisfies f τ 0 we calculate y τ that corresponds to the retarded surface for high rotational values of the mach number as for helicopter blades the retarded surface is substantially different from the solid surfaces of the blade meaning that the time delays play a relevant role in the propagation of the acoustic signal conversely at very low rotational mach numbers as those typical of ship propellers the retarded surface coincides with the propeller surface this is clearly shown in fig 11 for the case herein investigated thus source pressure signals emitted by the propeller reach the observer at the same time meaning that they do not overlap over time in this case direct integration of kernels is allowed without the need to consider the time delays for these reasons hereafter we evaluate the acoustic pressure using the direct integration of the volume terms as described in cianferra et al 2019 we first discuss the propagation of the noise in the near field and successively in the far field 5 1 near field results two measurement points are selected on the propeller plane x 0 at distances 0 6 d mic a and 0 8 d mic b from the axis of rotation respectively thus just out of the tip of the blades when computing the fwh integral volume terms we adopt the acoustic control domain a of fig 1 b in order to include the entire wake contribution and the tip vortex fig 12 shows the time signal of the acoustic pressure the signature of the linear terms is periodic and practically monochromatic see the red line in both figs 12 and 13 with a frequency equal to n n being n the number of revolutions per second and n the number of blades very close to the propeller microphone a the amplitude peak reaches about 150 db whereas moving away from the blades it decreases to about 130 db microphone b this result is consistent with literature experimental data felli et al 2011 to be noted that the quadrupole non linear term significantly contributes at both locations it exhibits an important presence of lower frequencies also comparatively it contributes more to the overall noise with respect to linear terms at microphone b which is farther than a from the propeller in other words the rate at which the signal associated to the non linear terms decreases with distance is slower than that of linear terms this important issue has been also discussed in ianniello 2016 there the author investigated how the various terms of the fwh equation decay for the archetypal problem of a rotating point source and found that a simple rule based on the 1 r n decay law cannot be applied the spectrum of the signal expressed in a logarithmic scale is reported in fig 13 for microphones a and b respectively we recall that the sound spectrum level is evaluated as s p l 20 log 10 a p r e f db being a the amplitude of the signal and p r e f 1 μ pa the reference pressure for underwater measurements as already observed in the time signals the frequency analysis clearly shows the contribution of the quadrupole terms in the range of low frequencies a main peak is at about 15 20 hz in correspondence of the revolution frequency n and other peaks are in between n and nn to be noted that in the farther microphone b the maximum pressure amplitude of about 140 db is associated to the low frequency peak and thus to the non linear contribution to the noise we evaluate the noise at a third microphone c located downstream at 1 d 0 8 d 0 in the wake region in fig 14 the spl is shown for this latter microphone as for the previous cases and even more the non linear contribution to the noise is here predominant in particular in the range of lower frequencies at the revolution frequency n the linear part contribution amounts to about 70 db whereas the non linear contribution is a bit less than 140 db also the shape of the overall spectrum is completely different from that of the linear part specifically the former exhibits larger contributions in the range of low frequencies whereas the opposite is true for the latter the peak on the main frequency n n reaches about 100 db while the peak at the lower frequency 15 20 hz is a bit below 140 db the behavior depicted above indicates that the noise source persists downstream mainly due to the contribution of the wake whereas the noise generated by the pressure radiated from the propeller as known decreases with distance the comparison with previous fig 13 b highlights this remark an interesting issue is to understand which turbulent coherent structure mainly contributes to the composition of the non linear source term to this aim we show in fig 15 an instantaneous snapshot at the plane z 0 of the scalar 2 t i j x i x j related to the lighthill tensor of eq 12 which constitutes the instantaneous non linear in terms of velocity field source of the acoustic wave equation the figure shows that the most energetic contribution to the lighthill tensor and thus to the non linear source of noise may be the energetic helical vortex that forms around the propeller shaft this vortex structure appears even more significant than the tip vortex also its spatial distribution specifically the distance between two successive vortices along the mean flow direction is consistent with the low frequency observed in the spl our results are consistent with those of di mascio et al 2014 felli et al 2011 who reported that the wave number associated to the shaft vortex is 1 n times that associated to the tip vortex the fluid dynamic pressure induced on the shaft generates noise as well however its amplitude is four orders of magnitude lower than the pressure noise induced by the shaft vortex to show it we evaluated linear terms by integrating on the shaft surface alone the resulting pressure radiated from the shaft is given in fig 16 it is compared with the fwh pressure given by the quadrupole volume terms evaluated by integrating over the control domain b of fig 1 b by considering a narrow control domain b it was possible to consider the shaft vortex contribution alone note in fig 16 the different reference system along the y axis the frequency captured by both the fwh integrals volume and surface corresponds to 15 20 hz interestingly this noisy and energetic vortex structure is not present in full scale applications and in some sense it can be considered as an artifact generated by the pulling type architecture of the laboratory scale test 5 2 far field decay in this subsection we analyze the propagation of noise in the far field two microphones a 1 and a 2 are located over the line x z 0 at distances y 8 d and y 80 d respectively from the axis of symmetry in fig 17 their signals are compared with that of previous microphone a to be precise as acoustic far field it is considered a microphone placed at distance more than 2 wavelengths λ which depend on the frequency f since λ c 0 f therefore the most distant microphone a 2 can be considered as located in the acoustic far field at least in the range of high frequencies the energetic spl observed in correspondence of microphone a appears smoothed out once moving far from the propeller in particular high frequencies associated to turbulence and small scale fluid motion are not persistent over long distances and characterize the near field only we remind that microphone a is located in proximity of the blades where pressure impulses related to blade passage are intense this is the reason of the high pressure amplitudes about 150 db recorded at microphone a comparing the two far field probes a1 and a2 a mean decay of about 40 db is observed at probe a2 the main peak at n n hz drops down to values below 0 db and the signal exhibits a low frequency band in order to place our results within the context of the general theory of the far field noise propagation we recall the law of attenuation of spherical propagation which rules the rate of decay of an impulsive source it is given by the formula 19 l d 2 l d 1 20 log 10 d 2 d 1 where l d 1 l d 2 is the pressure level in db at distance d 1 d 2 eq 19 is valid for a point source and if d 2 10 d 1 the pressure level drop is l d 1 l d 2 20 db to validate it we carried out a test on a monopole field used as a simple source of noise the result of the acoustic analogy applied to the monopole field for two microphones placed at distances 10 m and 100 m from the source gives an amplitude decay from 0 0055 to 0 05 pascal corresponding to a drop of 20 db which is consistent with eq 19 however according to our results of fig 17 where we observe a mean decay of 40 db in the range of frequency 10 100 hz between two microphones a1 and a2 located at distance d 2 10 d 1 it is unclear whether this rule can be applied to the case of complex noise sources such as a flow field given by a propeller moreover we observe that the decay does not occur homogeneously with respect to the frequencies in fig 18 the difference between the sound pressure level of microphones a1 and a2 is reported we have separated the linear part red dashed line from the nonlinear one black solid line as regards the linear part a decay of about 70 db from the microphone a1 to a2 occurs at the fundamental frequency of 75 hz other peaks are relevant which indicate a strong decay of the linear part at frequencies 2 n 30 hz and 3 n 45 hz the decay of the non linear part is also different from the analytical ideal value being of the order of 70 hz at the frequency n and maintaining high values in a broad part of the spectrum this behavior has to be attributed to the complexity and non linearity of the noise source which deserves additional studies it must be said that the analysis of acoustic decay between microphone a1 and a2 does not correspond to a true analysis between two microphones in the far field therefore interaction phenomena of acoustic waves are still present instead of pure propagation of a signal however we note that to consider the far field for low frequencies it would be necessary to measure the noise at very great distances for example an acoustic wave of frequency 5 hz would reach the far field in our case at 2400 diameters away an other aspect closely related to the way the signal decays with distance is the directivity the directivity is here evaluated as the pressure root mean square given by solving the fwh equation at different measurement points equidistant from the source we consider 100 measurement points arranged on circumferences of radius 10 d over four different planes x 0 x 2 y 0 and y 2 sketched in fig 19 the results are depicted in figs 20 and 21 the distribution of pressure level over the planes x 0 and x 2 fig 20 top panels is consistent with theory and literature results since the radial symmetry of the problem is recovered in the computation of the directivity on the other hand the dipole type acoustic field is observable when considering the directivity of linear terms on the planes y 0 and y 2 fig 20 bottom panels this behavior has been already observed in previous research see among the others lidtke 2017 the results of the fwh non linear part appear even more interesting although the axial symmetry exhibited over the planes x 0 and x 2 still holds see fig 21 top panels very interesting patterns are evidenced over the planes y 0 and y 2 depicted in fig 21 bottom panels considering the fact that the negative cos a is in correspondence of the wake one may conclude that the propeller wake gives rise to consistent pressure fluctuations propagating in the downstream direction and contributing to the far field noise finally to be noted that the nonlinear contribution is about 3 orders of magnitude higher than linear one left bottom panels of figs 20 and 21 6 conclusions in the present paper we study the noise radiated from a marine propeller in open sea condition using the acoustic analogy the fluid dynamic field is simulated using large eddy simulation with wall layer models whereas the acoustic field is obtained using the ffowcs williams and hawkings equation as regards the fluid dynamic field wles gives accurate results both for the integral quantities thrust and torque and for the turbulent field developing downward in the wake the accuracy of the results was assessed through comparison with available experimental data and high resolution les carried out by other authors the integral formulation of the fwh equation is first formulated in the advective form and then solved using a direct volume integration for the non linear quadrupole terms in the present case this is possible because the assumption of compact source has been demonstrated to be valid through the retarded surface method the solution of the complete fwh equation allows to evaluate separately the linear and non linear contributions to the noise propagation in agreement with literature studies the linear part produces a narrow banded spectrum with a main peak at the blade frequency the non linear contribution appears of great interest it is mainly associated with the shaft vortex that persists for a long distance at the rear of the propeller it is characterized by high level of vorticity and strongly characterizes the acoustic field therefore the acoustic signature given by the fwh equation is found to consist mainly of quadrupole noise except for the peak on the blade frequency generated by the linear terms the analysis of the propagation of the noise in the far field shows that thumb like rules based on simple analytical formulations may be very inaccurate specifically in presence of a complex noise source like a ship propeller the decay of the noise in the far field is not constant over the frequency spectrum but appears much stronger at fundamental frequencies the linear part exhibits a strong decay at the fundamental frequency n n as well as at frequencies multiple of the rotational one n the non linear part decays faster in the range of low frequencies this has to be attributed to the fact that the main turbulent structures contributing to the far field noise are the well known tip vortex and the shaft vortex or hub vortex depending on the geometric configuration investigated the latter appears more energetic and noisy than the former the directivity points out the dipole type acoustic field generated by the fwh linear contribution which was already observed in previous studies also it exhibits a strong asymmetry due to the non linear contribution this is expected although it is noteworthy that the contribution of the linear part is much smaller than the non linear one especially in the far field and in the direction of the wake finally it is advisable to dwell on the particular configuration of this benchmark case which has the shaft flipped downstream the presence of the shaft in the middle of the wake affect the dynamics of the otherwise called hub vortex observed in previous experimental and numerical studies the different evolution of the downstream vortex also considerably changes the acoustic signature thus we would conclude that a configuration of this type can be misleading for realistic noise measurements acknowledgment this work was supported by region fvg por fesr 2014 2020

22399,in the present paper we study the hydrodynamic noise generated by a ship propeller in open sea conditions we use large eddy simulation for the hydrodynamic field whereas the acoustic field is reconstructed by applying the advective form of the ffowcs williams and hawkings equation a dynamic lagrangian model is adopted for the closure of the subgrid scale stresses and a wall layer model allows to skip the resolution of the viscous sub layer the acoustic equation is formulated in the integral form and solved through direct integration of the volume terms the propeller herein considered is a benchmark case whose fluid dynamic data are available in the literature a grid of about 3 106 cells is able to reproduce accurately both integral quantities like thrust and torque over the propeller and turbulence propagating downstream in the wake different noise generation mechanisms are investigated separately the linear terms give rise to a narrow band noise spectrum with a mean peak at the blade frequency and other peaks at frequencies multiple of the rotational one the non linear quadrupole term reveals a broad band noise spectrum the shaft vortex provides the largest contribution to the non linear part of the noise propagated in the far field keywords ship propeller les ffowcs williams and hawkings hydroacoustics 1 introduction generation and propagation of hydrodynamic noise in the marine environment is an emerging field of investigation due to its own impact on a number of engineering applications including among the others the marine propeller design slabbekoorn et al 2010 rako et al 2013 the international rules are becoming increasingly stringent in protected sea regions allowing the transit only of certified silent ships in areas of particular environmental value the threat of underwater noise pollution was recognized by the international maritime organization imo which adopted in 2014 the voluntary guidelines for the reduction of underwater noise produced by commercial shipping to address the impacts on marine life the development of new and complete noise prediction tools is hence required for the design of advanced environment friendly ships the underwater noise generated by a ship propeller propagates through two different mechanisms the first is associated with the propeller shape and rotational velocity it generates high level of pressure disturbance at the main frequency that is the rotation frequency multiplied by the number of blades the second is associated to the flow field around the propeller and the turbulent coherent structures that populate its wake moreover in presence of cavitation the acoustic signal appears even more loudly due to the presence of the vapor phase which usually exhibits unsteady features and the implosion of vapor bubbles hereafter unless specified we focus on the analysis of ship propeller in open sea conditions and in absence of cavitation over the years hydrodynamic performance as well as acoustics of ship propellers have been investigated using experimental as well as numerical techniques in different flow conditions several experimental studies collected data and provided important observations on the complex propeller wake dynamics for example fundamental works of jessup 1989 and chesnakas and jessup 1998 reported an accurate analysis of the three dimensional complex flow around propellers obtained through laser doppler velocimetry measurements recent studies provided detailed description of tip vortex evolution and interaction with the hub vortex under different propeller configurations and work conditions felli and falchi 2018 presented the comparison of the wake behavior in axis symmetric and in oblique inflow conditions for three inclination angles the authors analyzed the wake evolution and instability mechanisms through particle image velocimetry piv in the work of calcagno et al 2005 the complex interaction between the hull wake and propeller was addressed in felli et al 2011 the authors examined the dependence of the wake instability on the spiral to spiral distance through the use of three propellers with different number of blades these studies elucidated mechanisms of interaction and evolution of the vortex structures in the wake the destabilization of the tip vortices was found to occur before that of hub vortices independent on the number of blades and the propeller loading conditions the tip vortex dynamics is characterized by a multi step grouping mechanism driven by the mutual inductance between adjacent spirals numerical simulations of the hydrodynamic field have been carried out by several authors using different solution techniques first the potential flow theory has been used see among the other kerwin 1986 it was considered accurate enough to be used in the optimization process of a propeller design either to predict unsteady vibratory forces generated by a propeller or to estimate fluctuating loads on an individual blade as input to a structural analysis however the reliability of potential flow theory has been questioned in particular regarding the prediction of the three dimensional actual wake the reproduction of the unsteady trailing vortex wake interaction and the inability to reproduce the unsteady leading edge vortex separation more recently due to the continuous increase of the computer power the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations have been employed providing good prediction of the thrust and torque coefficients in a wide range of advance coefficients see among the others baek et al 2015 note that these coefficients represent the main output needed in the design process of the propeller for this reason the use of rans is nowadays a common practice for engineering purposes recently due to the available computation resources high resolution simulations of the turbulent field generated by the ship propeller have been carried out by different research groups among the others di mascio et al 2014 performed detached eddy simulations des of a propeller placed in oblique flow the authors adopted a grid of about 11 1 0 6 cells and observed a very complex vortical system composed of a strong tip vortex less intense trailing vortices due to the variation of the loading different blade root vortices and an intense hub vortex di felice et al 2009 carried out both experimental and numerical large eddy simulation les tests of a submarine propeller their fine mesh simulation composed of about 4 5 millions cells gave results in agreement with data obtained in physical laboratory chase and carrica 2013 performed rans des and delayed des ddes of a submarine propeller adopting four different grids the authors concluded that the grid refinement has weak effect on thrust and torque evaluation still being important for the accurate reproduction of the wake dynamics worth to be mentioned that in the eddy resolving simulations reported above di mascio et al 2014 and chase and carrica 2013 solved the field up to the wall while in di felice et al 2009 a wall layer model approach was adopted allowing for substantial reduction of the number of grid cells the very recent massive wall resolving 1 1 meaning that the near wall turbulent structures are directly resolved and a no slip condition is applied at the solid wall simulations of balaras et al 2015 kumar and mahesh 2017 and posa et al 2019 stand at the edge of the binomial accuracy computational cost the former carried out les of a propeller in open water conditions and in presence of an upstream appendage at zero incidence to deal with a realistic configuration they adopted the immersed boundary method and analyzed the flow physics and turbulence in the wake kumar and mahesh 2017 performed les using more than 180 millions of grid cells validated their results with experimental data and reported a wide and deep analysis on the fluid dynamics of the ship propeller an interesting aspect concerns the hub vortex which remains coherent over the length of the computational domain equal to 8 propeller diameters in posa et al 2019 les results were validated against piv measurements the authors adopted the immersed boundary method with a cylindrical eulerian grid composed of about 840 million nodes these studies have clearly shown the superiority of eddy resolving simulations with respect to ranss when the aim is to study the wake dynamics most of the studies on this topic in addition to the above mentioned references have reported on the presence of strong hub vortex remaining coherent over a length longer than the tip vortex this feature has some relevance in the present study and will be exploited in the next sections to summarize different numerical techniques with increasing complexity and computational cost have been applied over the years for the evaluation of the hydrodynamic field generated by a ship propeller it is now well established that the potential flow theory can provide useful data for the structural analysis of the propeller bulk coefficients of the propeller are well evaluated by using low order models rans both in steady and unsteady conditions on the opposite side wall resolving les provides very accurate pressure and velocity fields both in the near propeller region as well as in the wake although at a cost of very expensive and time consuming simulations intermediate techniques like des or wall modeled les wles appear as a good accuracy computational cost compromise providing accurate results over the propeller and in the wake using grid size as small as 10 1 0 2 times that needed using wall resolving les for this reason and with the aim of developing a methodology that can be used for engineering purposes wles is the approach accomplished in the present paper apart for the prediction of the hydrodynamic characteristics of the propeller the computational fluid dynamic analysis can be useful for the prediction of the noise propagated in the far field in fact the acoustic analysis of a ship propeller is a subject that has aroused growing interest in recent years usually in numerical studies the acoustic analogy is employed meaning that the solution of the hydrodynamic field is decoupled from that of the acoustic one the latter being reconstructed solving the ffowcs williams and hawkings fwh equation ffowcs williams and hawkings 1969 the equation formulated into an integral form shows that the radiated acoustic disturbance is given by the sum of linear terms associated to the pressure over the solid surface loading term and to the rotational velocity of the blades thickness term and of non linear ones quadrupole terms associated to the presence of the turbulent wake the hydroacoustic analysis of ship propellers or more complex multi body configurations including hull rudder and appendages has been based for long time on the coupling of rans and fwh linear or porous equation since rans was thought to be able to characterize the acoustic signature of the propeller in a relatively simple way however the results obtained from coupling rans models with different methodologies based on the fwh equation showed clearly that both in the case of isolated propeller ianniello et al 2013 and propeller together with hull rudder and appendages ianniello et al 2014 the calculated noise tends to decrease very fast as soon as the microphone moves away from the body moreover the calculated acoustic pressure is narrow banded and exhibits predominantly tonal features moreover the contribution of thickness and loading terms generated by a marine propeller can be extremely low unlike what happens in the aeronautical field to the point of becoming negligible compared to the non linear effects these non linear effects coming from the wake developing downstream a propeller become of fundamental acoustic importance consequently an accurate and reliable evaluation of the quadrupole non linear sources is required and cannot be adequately evaluated by a rans model recent literature has established that les may be the best method to reproduce the noise source since it provides dataset containing the relevant frequencies for the analysis of radiated noise from a marine propeller this because of the fact that the large and relevant turbulent scales are directly resolved whereas the small unresolved scales are uncorrelated and do not contribute to the radiated noise keller et al 2018 studied a five blades propeller using les and analyzed in detail the noise emission given by the thickness and loading terms by isolating the contribution of different circular sections on the propeller surface results show that although the individual blades are strongly tonal in the rotor plane the propeller is acoustically compact at low frequency and the tonal sound interferes destructively in the far field also the majority of the propeller sound is generated by localized unsteadiness at the blade tip which is caused by shedding of the tip vortex the experimental study of felli et al 2014 reported the analysis of the noise sources over a rudder located behind a marine propeller the investigation concerned near field pressure fluctuations measurements on the face and back surfaces of the rudder at different deflection angles a novel wavelet based filtering procedure was presented able to separate the acoustic and hydrodynamic components of the recorded pressure signals the study highlighted that the acoustic perturbation is mainly correlated with the unsteady load variations of the rudder and to the shear layer fluctuations of the propeller streamtube the importance of the evaluation of the quadrupole term in hydrodynamics was highlighted among the others by cianferra et al 2019 who used the acoustic analogy in conjunction with les fields to evaluate the noise produced by a finite size cylinder the authors showed that the direct evaluation of the non linear volume terms can be carried out in a very efficient way in a class of problems including hydrodynamics where compressible effects in the fluid dynamic field are unimportant the authors also showed that the quadrupole terms can give contribution in a wide range of frequencies in a companion paper cianferra et al 2018a the authors used the same methodology to study the effect of the shape of simple bluff bodies on the emitted noise they showed that sharp corner geometries are more loudly than a sphere and that a prolate spheroid produces a noise one order of magnitude smaller than a cube or a sphere also a direct comparison between a cube and a square cylinder showed that the quadrupole terms produced by the former is much less relevant than that produced by the elongated body due to the persistence of the wake in the latter case in the present study we extend and deepen the work presented in cianferra et al 2018b on the noise radiated from a ship propeller in open sea condition and in absence of cavitation our main scope is to evaluate the complete sound pressure level including the low frequency contribution related to the non linear quadrupole terms associated to the coherent structures in the wake in order to obtain reliable turbulent data we perform les of the turbulent field around the rotating body further to avoid the need of using huge grid also in view of engineering applications wall layer modeling is employed the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we report the governing equations for the fluid dynamic field together with the turbulence subgrid scale sgs model and the acoustic equation in section 3 the propeller benchmark case is described and in sections 4 and 5 we discuss respectively the fluid dynamic and the acoustic results finally in section 6 we give concluding remarks 2 numerical model the problem under investigation is axis symmetric with a constant rotation rate under these conditions the governing equations can be solved in the frame of reference rotating with the propeller introducing body forces accounting for rotational effects the incompressible navier stokes equations are thus formulated for the absolute velocity vector as proposed in kumar and mahesh 2017 with the coriolis and centrifugal body forces that take into account

piso algorithm adopting a second order linear upwind scheme in space and a backward time integration ensuring a second order overall accuracy the freely available solver is customized in order to properly include the rotational effects 2 1 dynamic lagrangian model the sgs stress tensor is here modeled using a dynamic model in conjunction with a smagorinsky closure some more details on the formulation are reported in cintolesi et al 2016 2015 the deviatoric part of the sgs stress tensor reads as 4 τ i j δ i j 3 τ k k 2 ν sgs s i j and ν sgs c s 2 δ 2 s i j where s i j 2 s i j s i j is contraction of strain rate tensor of the large scales s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i δ is the filter width that is set to be the cubic root of the cell volume c s is the smagorinsky constant the dynamic lagrangian model for sgs contribution developed by meneveau et al 1996 is adopted in order to compute smagorinsky constant it computes the constant c s dynamically by averaging over the fluid particle lagrangian trajectories this model is particularly suited when the flow field does not exhibit directions of homogeneity the constant is computed through the formula 5 c s 2 ℐ l m x t ℐ m m x t the

model as discussed in the introduction less of ship propellers have been carried out at a model scale using wall resolving les this means that the near wall layer together with the turbulent structures are directly resolved with a computational cost which increases with r e 2 5 piomelli and balaras 2002 the literature wall resolving less of ship propeller in open sea conditions have generally employed a number of grid cells of the order of 1 0 8 1 0 9 requiring the use of a large number of cores on supercomputers these simulations have exploited flow features not observable in rans like simulations as well as in laboratory experiments also alternative strategies intermediate between rans and wall resolving les are hybrid techniques like among the others detached eddy simulation des and wall layer modeled les wles these hybrid techniques were already used for simulation of open water ship propellers see the introduction and have the advantage to allow for the reduction of grid points in the region close to the blades and the use of high resolution in the wake responsible of the quadrupole component of the noise propagated in the far field wles is commonly in use in the scientific community since it greatly reduces the computational cost of the simulation which increases with re since the inertial part of the boundary layer is resolved through the les whereas the viscous near wall region is modeled through a wall layer model which is required to reproduce correctly the wall shear stress previous studies piomelli and balaras 2002 radhakrishnan and piomelli 2008 wang 1999 2000 addressed the problem of the wall layer models based on the logarithmic law they compared the performance of the equilibrium wall layer model with improved versions of it namely considering also both pressure gradient and advective or unsteady terms for example in wang 2000 the friction coefficient of an airfoil was computed using different wall layer model less and compared with wall resolved les the best results were obtained through the two layer model tlm which involves the use of two separate grids the results obtained with other wall layer models including the one adopted in our work were all somewhat inaccurate in particular in the reverse pressure gradient region however the equilibrium wall layer model reproduced the peak value of the skin friction coefficient accurately further the results presented in radhakrishnan and piomelli 2008 where an oscillating boundary layer was studied a very complex problem subject to periodic acceleration deceleration during the oscillatory cycle exhibited acceptable agreement between the wall layer model les and resolved les finally wang 1999 computed the far field noise generated by the sharp trailing edge and found that the predictions of the calculations with approximate boundary conditions with logarithmic model did not match the resolved ones in the frequency range associated with scales generated in the separation region whereas at other frequencies the agreement was acceptable to summarize although it is well known in literature that the equilibrium wall layer model is a basic model it has also been recognized that it is robust in a number of complex flow cases including curvature local acceleration and stratification the main drawback of this model is in the reproduction of massive separation which is not the case investigated in our manuscript in the case of ship propellers in open sea conditions the equilibrium stress model is expected to provide reasonable accurate results as already shown in di felice et al 2009 to account for the desired stress at the wall the boundary conditions for the scalar field ν s g s need to be updated at every time step of the simulation the procedure is as follows i the wall stress τ w is obtained from instantaneous horizontal velocity at the first off the wall centroid based on law of the wall 10 u p 1 k l n y p b i f y p 11 y p i f y p 11 where u p u p u τ u 2 v 2 u τ is the modulus of instantaneous non dimensional velocity at the first off the wall computational node p placed at distance y p from the wall k 0 41 is the von kármán constant and b 5 1 note that u and v represent the two components of the tangential velocity to the wall more precisely in this section x y z are respectively the streamwise spanwise and the wall normal directions and u v w the corresponding velocity components the modulus of the friction velocity u τ is calculated from the velocity u p at each p point and depends on the distance from the wall y p either from linear or logarithmic law then the wall shear stress τ w is calculated from the friction velocity as τ w ρ u τ 2 ii the wall stress τ w is used to determine the boundary condition for the turbulent viscosity ν s g s considering the relation τ w ν ν s g s δ u δ y being the gradient of velocity δ u δ y u p u b y p where u b is the value of the velocity at the wall in our case u b corresponds to the tangential velocity given by rotation thus the information from the flow first cell off the wall is used to determine local wall stress which is then fed back to the les in the form of the proper momentum flux at the wall due to normal diffusion further since the numerical evaluation of the leading terms of s i j in the computation of ν s g s becomes increasingly wrong with decreasing grid resolution they are replaced by the analytical values based on the location of y p as proposed in stocca et al 2011 11 s x z u τ κ y p u u p s y z u τ κ y p v u p i f y p 11 s x z u τ 2 ν u u p s y z u τ 2 ν v u p i f y p 11 consequently the value of eddy viscosity near the wall adjusts consistently with the imposed stress as described and validated in fakhari et al 2018 2 3 acoustic model to reconstruct the acoustic field we adopt the advective form of the ffowcs williams and hawkings fwh equation given in cianferra et al 2019 2018a and reported here 12 c 2 h f p ˆ t ρ 0 v n ρ u n v n δ f x i p n ˆ i ρ u i u n v n δ f 2 x i x j t i j h f where c 2 2 t 2 c 0 2 2 x i x j 2 u 0 j 2 t x j u 0 i u 0 j 2 x i x j represents the convective form of the d alembert operator being u 0 i the mean flow velocity along i direction in eq 12 the function f describes the surface 13 s x f x t 0 the function f is such that f x t 0 within s and f x t 0 outside s h and δ are the heaviside and dirac delta functions respectively and indicate where the integration is defined specifically if v is the volume outside the closed surface s h f 1 for x v and h f 0 for x within s while δ f 0 only for x s and h f δ f n δ f the common assumption is that f 1 and f is a smooth function defined everywhere note that the use of dirac and heaviside functions is a mathematical formalism that allows to limit the acoustic sources distribution to specific surfaces or fluid regions v n is the velocity of the surface s projected along the outward normal to s represented by the unit vector n ˆ ρ is the constant density of the flow field p is the pressure distribution on the surface s which may coincide with the body surface in this case eq 12 is referred to as fwh direct formulation and it verifies u n v n alternatively the surface s may describe a not physical surface external to the body often referred to as porous domain or control surface in this case the net flow across s is given by the difference u n v n 0 in the present work the fwh direct formulation is adopted since it allows a separate analysis of the linear and non linear terms contribution the differential form 12 may be turned into the following integral form by considering the free space three dimensional advective green s function 14 p ˆ thickness loading τ d s quadrupole τ d v the first two source terms on the right hand side of eq 12 give rise to surface integrals thickness and loading terms in eq 14 and the procedure is described in detail in najafi yazdi et al 2011 the transformation of the third quadrupole term of eq 12 requires the manipulation of the double spatial derivative of the green s function and the procedure is described in detail in cianferra et al 2019 2018a then they have formulated a criterion for selecting cases where the computation of the time delays can be omitted and finally assessed different methodologies for the evaluation of the quadrupole terms the authors concluded that when the source is compact quantified by a value of the maximum frequency parameter m f p 1 δ d e l f m a x 1 where δ d e l max y x m i c min y x m i c c 0 with y v and f m a x the highest frequency at which the fluid dynamic phenomena is observed the direct integration of the volume terms can be performed neglecting the time delays and the solution is more accurate when compared with other solution techniques i e porous method since this is the case in the present study we calculate the fwh non linear terms by direct integration over volume regions including the wake finally differently than in cianferra et al 2019 2018a here we consider a rotating frame of reference since the cfd simulation is carried out likewise thus when computing the distance r x t y τ inside the integrals where x is the measurement point also referred to as probe or microphone and y is the source point which varies along the solid surface or along the volume one needs to consider the measurement point x as it were rotating with angular velocity ω ω 3 hydrodynamics of the propeller in this study we consider a benchmark propeller the sva vp1304 whose complete documentation including geometry experimental data and numerical results is available online 2 2 https www sva potsdam de en potsdam propeller test case pptc the data for both the open water and the installed configurations were presented and discussed in the international symposiums on marine propulsors in 2011 and 2015 respectively in the present study we carry out the analysis of the uniform flow case of an isolated propeller at design advance ratio and reynolds number 15 j v u 0 n d 1 0683 r e u 0 d ν 889 680 where u 0 4 m s is the advance velocity n is the rotational

the thrust and the torque provided by the propeller in the experimental set up the rotation direction is right handed the solid body is composed of the five blade propeller and the shaft placed downstream according to the typical arrangement for isolated or equivalently open sea propeller performance assessment we use a cylindrical numerical domain as sketched in fig 1 a the diameter is equal to 7 d and the length is 10 d as suggested in kumar and mahesh 2017 the reference coordinate system is chosen such that the blades of the propeller are located at the plane x 0 and the flow is in the direction of negative x so that u 0 x 4 m s the axis of rotation of the frame of reference is r 0 the plane containing the blades is located 3 d downstream of the inlet and 7 d upstream of the outlet section the grid is obtained in the following way we generate a cylindrical o grid non uniform along the streamwise direction the cells are clustered in the regions occupied by the shaft and the blades and coarsened moving towards the cylindrical lateral boundaries then we adopt the openfoam tool snappyhexmesh to build the mesh merging geometry of the propeller within the cylindrical grid the mesh quality parameters fit the openfoam criteria of aspect ratio skewness and non orthogonality the near wall resolution is such to obtain a distance of the first grid point off the wall of about y 40 as required by the use of wall layer models a grid of about 3 millions of grid cells was built the grid refinement in the wake region was aimed at avoiding the artificial smearing of the helical tip vortex in the wake since it may give a significant contribution to the non linear part of the noise the present level of wake refinement was already tested in cianferra et al 2018b the wles was started from a solution obtained with a rans model on the same grid in order to avoid the initial development stage also after about 60 revolutions obtained by the wles the fluid dynamic data were collected for about 5 revolutions the time step of the les is d t 1 0 4 s giving a courant number 0 4 the flow fields were printed out every d t f l u i d 0 01333 s which corresponds to 72 degrees to carry out the phase average analysis of the fluid dynamics field and every d t a c o 0 0027 s which corresponds to about 15 degrees for the acoustic analysis adopting the sampling time d t a c o an entire revolution 360 degrees is discretized with just 22 snapshots this implies a loss of information on the high frequencies but allows to collect data for several revolutions in order to study the appearance of lower frequency modes we use the standard piso algorithm implemented in openfoam version 2 3 but modified by including the non inertial forces in the momentum equation as described in eq 2 as boundary conditions at the inlet section we give a uniform flow field with the advance velocity u 0 x 4 m s at lateral boundaries we set a slip condition and at the outlet we impose a zero gradient condition at the solid walls of the shaft hub and blades the tangential velocity is given as u t r ω r with r radial distance from the rotation axis and ω 2 π n 0 0 with n 15 r p s for the pressure we set p n 0 to all boundaries of the computational domain n being the direction normal to the surface the constant flow density and the speed of sound are set to ρ 998 kg m 3 and c 0 1400 m s respectively these quantities being necessary for the acoustic analysis 4 fluid dynamic analysis the simulation results are compared with available experimental data for the value of the advance coefficient j 1 068 we obtain the following values of the force and torque coefficients 17 k t 0 3414 k q 0 09051 corresponding to errors of 18 e k t 3 5 e k q 0 5 with respect to experimental data the coefficients are reproduced satisfactorily in previous studies carried out using wles see for example di felice et al 2009 where an equilibrium wall layer model was adopted thrust and torque were obtained with error of about 5 with respect to the experimental values we also observed a dependency of the coefficients k t and k q on the grid size in agreement with previous studies see for example chase and carrica 2013 di felice et al 2009 in the previous test discussed in cianferra et al 2018b we used a grid of about 6 million cells same as the one described here in the wake region but refined close to the propeller boundaries mean distance of the first grid point off the wall 15 y the results concerning the mean values of thrust and torque coefficients were slightly worse than those obtained in the present study but the time spectra of k t and k q appeared qualitatively comparable with that reported in kumar and mahesh 2017 namely broadband and with peaks on both revolution and blade frequency with the present resolution near the wall the values of k t and k q are closer to the experimental data and the time signal exhibits smaller fluctuations similarly to what reported in chase and carrica 2013 for a resolved des fig 2 a shows the signal in time expressed as rotational angle of k t k t k t in the range 150 550 degrees of rotation the two signals refer to two different simulations the one reported in a previous work cianferra et al 2018b and the one carried out in the present study the coefficient appears in statistically steady conditions with fluctuations around the mean value as discussed above the fluctuations of the signal relative to the grid more refined at the wall are more energetic compared to the signal obtained with the present grid these results are reasonable in that the wall layer model is designed to work better when the first grid point is placed in the log region of the boundary layer and thus in this case the thrust and the drag are reproduced with good accuracy on the other hand the increase of the distance of the first point from the wall reduces the level of fluctuations at the wall we also carried out a simulation after switching off the wall layer model thus performing an under resolved les the coefficients were strongly underestimated for example the value of the thrust coefficient k t decreased after about 7000 iterations which is approximately one revolution up to an error of about 30 this demonstrates the need to use a wall layer model in the present case to reproduce the near wall dynamics and obtain the correct stress at the wall the fact that our simulation gives accurate values of the coefficients is not surprising since the equilibrium wall layer model is very robust and accurate in simulations of non separated boundary layer as for the case of the blades of the propeller on the other hand the fact that reasonable results can be obtained making use of wall layer modeling approaches makes the analysis of ship propeller affordable even for engineering purposes to the best of our knowledge there are not quantitative literature data on the fluid dynamic field generated by the propeller investigated in this paper thus we proceed with qualitative comparison with results reported in the high resolution les of kumar and mahesh 2017 and posa et al 2019 where wall resolving les were performed in conjunction with huge grids the authors studied propellers different from the present one with a different advance ratio j and reynolds number in kumar and mahesh 2017 j 0 889 and r e 8 9 1 0 5 while in posa et al 2019 three different working conditions were considered j 0 74 0 65 0 56 also both in kumar and mahesh 2017 and posa et al 2019 the shaft is located upstream although qualitative the comparison of non dimensional quantities may be useful to place our data within the context of eddy resolving simulations of ship propellers also in view of the relevant acoustic analysis coherent structures are observed up to 4 d downstream of the propeller in fig 2 b the isosurface of the non dimensional vorticity magnitude ω d u 0 9 4 is reported after that length because of the grid coarsening along the x direction the grid resolution is not sufficient to capture accurately the tip vortex which furthermore tends to lose energy and to dissipate the tip and hub vortices are structures commonly observed in the wake of marine propellers di mascio et al 2014 kumar and mahesh 2017 in the present case we reproduce a pulling type propeller configuration typical of scale model tests in water basins this configuration differs from the real scale application where the propeller is in a pushing type configuration the main difference stands in the fact that being the shaft located downstream of the propeller we observe a shaft vortex instead of hub coherent structures in fact from the base of the propeller blades a vortex is created which then twists around the shaft along a helical shape this is clearly depicted in fig 3 through the q criterion figs 3 a and 3 b depict the isosurface q d 2 u 0 2 40 and 80 respectively we recall that positive values of the scalar q indicate flow regions characterized by vorticity the case of q d 2 u 0 2 40 is comparable with that reported in posa et al 2019 keeping in mind all the differences between the two cases in both figures the contour of the magnitude of vorticity and of the scalar q reveals the shaft vortex to be more energetic than the tip vortex this has important effects in the acoustic analysis reported in the next section 5 our results are consistent with those of kumar and mahesh 2017 where the hub vortex was observed to remain coherent over the entire length of the computational domain in figs 4 and 5 we select different planes perpendicular to the mean flow direction at locations x d 0 2 0 2 0 6 1 3 5 respectively from top panel to bottom panel there we show the contour plot of phase average non dimensional axial velocity vorticity magnitude and turbulent kinetic energy tke from left panel to right panel phase average is computed as f x i 1 m f x t 0 i 1 t m where f is the phase average value of any field f and t 1 n n is the period associated to blade passage consistently with kumar and mahesh 2017 the upstream region is characterized by the suction effect of the propeller this clearly appears looking at the axial velocity vorticity and tke fig 4 which also show that the propeller induced perturbations do not produce significant turbulence the level of tke in the upstream region is comparable with that of kumar and mahesh 2017 although a bit lower which is probably due to our grid resolution compared to the reference ones as large as 100 time our one however the tke contour plot near the propeller second row panel shows significant traces of turbulent fluctuations we observe a phenomenon similar to that described in kumar and mahesh 2017 namely as soon as the tip vortex becomes unstable the tke starts increasing at about three diameters downstream of the propeller and beyond both the tip and the shaft vortex break down completely producing tke see last two rows of fig 5 note that the highest values of tke and vorticity are observed around the shaft comparing the vorticity magnitude with those of posa et al 2019 we note a similar behavior and values except for the high values we have around the shaft which in their case decrease faster downstream this may be due to the different blade geometry and work conditions but also because of the presence of the shaft downstream which in the present case may help to keep the vortex structure consistent in space moreover we remind that we set the slip condition on the shaft and prevents from the interaction and coalescence of the hub vortex with the tip vortex as a further consequence of the grid coarseness with respect to the reference wall resolving less we observe the weakening of tip vortex signatures in the downstream region at about 2 diameters see fig 5 whereas it occurs more downstream at about 3 diameters in kumar and mahesh 2017 fig 6 shows the axial component of vorticity fields at x d 0 4 0 6 downstream of the propeller the spiral roll up of the blade wake vortex sheet is not as well defined as in kumar and mahesh 2017 however it is clear that clockwise vorticity is released by the propeller tip while a counterclockwise spiral mode characterizes the motion around the shaft the opposite sign between tip and shaft vortex may be observed also in fig 7 and it is reported in kumar and mahesh 2017 they observe opposite sign between tip and hub vortex in fig 7 non dimensional z component of vorticity contour is depicted on the plane z 0 we can anticipate that from an acoustic point of view shaft and tip vortex are relevant both having considerable amount of vorticity note that the shaft vortex is commonly observed and referred to as hub vortex being the shaft located upstream in previous studies see for example okulov and sørensen 2007 the hub vortex is found to be stronger than the tip vortex being generated by the coalescence of the blade root vortices and thus having a strength that is n times larger than that of the tip vortex in the present study the flipped shaft configuration influences the flow dynamics and the interaction among the vortical structures however a very energetic vortex is created which is rolled up around the shaft and remains stable downstream this is an important issue which deserves discussion the configuration herein studied is that typically employed in open water laboratory scale tests which substantially differ from the real scale application this is typically done under the assumption that the presence of the shaft which has to sustain the propeller during the test does not affect the loads thrust and torque over the propeller although this is true for the loads it has to be noticed that the downward shaft substantially modifies the structure of the wake since its own interaction with the tip vortex differs from the mutual influence between tip and hub vortex in other words if one is interested in the analysis of the wake developing downward a propeller the pulling type test is not the best suited for that in figs 8 and 9 we report the contour plot of phase average non dimensional pressure root mean square of pressure and turbulent viscosity ν s g s from left panel to right panel the different planes perpendicular to the mean flow direction are located at x d 0 2 0 2 0 6 1 3 5 respectively from top panel to bottom panel the low pressure cores of tip vortices are evident up to x d 1 downstream at x d 3 5 the region of low pressure around the shaft emphasizes the presence of the vortex the pressure fluctuation associated to the tip vortex are visible near the propeller up to a distance of 0 6 d while the region inside the shaft vortex contains large pressure fluctuations up to 5 diameters downstream the contour plot of eddy viscosity normalized with the molecular viscosity shows satisfactory values in the tip vortex regions and around the shaft a comparison with previous figs 4 and 5 shows that the turbulent transfer of energy occurs in regions characterized by high vorticity the fact that vortex cores are not evident and the contour plots show instead continuous strips is due to the phase average procedure we may conclude that the contour plot of the three quantities are in good qualitative agreement with the results reported in kumar and mahesh 2017 although the working condition is different and considering that our grid in much coarse finally the flow field in the wake of the blade is depicted in fig 10 contours of radial top left panel and axial top right panel non dimensional velocity fields are extracted on a r x plane with r being the radial direction the plane is located at the end of the trailing edge as sketched in fig 10 bottom panel the vortex sheet in the trailing edge wake of the blade can be observed in both axial and radial velocity fields the jump in radial velocity is quite sharp as also evidenced in kumar and mahesh 2017 overall our results exhibit a good accuracy when compared to high resolution reference simulations which take advantage of grids as large as 100 times our one this is true for the propeller coefficients as well as for the fluid dynamics of the wake which is relevant for the non linear quadrupole contribution to the noise 5 acoustic analysis as mentioned the computation of fwh volume integrals is feasible only in case of compact sources thus when time delays are unimportant otherwise the storing process of all the fluid dynamic data is too expensive in terms of ram and cpu time in literature it is common to find the assumption of compact noise source in cianferra et al 2019 a rigorous discussion was proposed based on a dimensional analysis involving source length maximum frequency and speed of sound and giving a criterion based on the value of the non dimensional parameter mfp in presence of a moving body such as a rotating propeller a consideration on the importance of time delays can be addressed by calculating the retarded surface σ see ianniello et al 2013 σ is defined for each time t of signal reception and for each observation point x therefore it would be σ σ t x and is the surface constituted by the points y τ such that t τ x y τ c 0 0 in this case the observer x is at rest and the source y rotates and changes in time the procedure of calculating σ consists of i choose a time t of acoustic signal reception and an observer location x i i calculate τ with the bisection method on the function f τ t τ x y τ c 0 where y τ are the points on the propeller that are rotating and x is a microphone location i i i once τ is found that satisfies f τ 0 we calculate y τ that corresponds to the retarded surface for high rotational values of the mach number as for helicopter blades the retarded surface is substantially different from the solid surfaces of the blade meaning that the time delays play a relevant role in the propagation of the acoustic signal conversely at very low rotational mach numbers as those typical of ship propellers the retarded surface coincides with the propeller surface this is clearly shown in fig 11 for the case herein investigated thus source pressure signals emitted by the propeller reach the observer at the same time meaning that they do not overlap over time in this case direct integration of kernels is allowed without the need to consider the time delays for these reasons hereafter we evaluate the acoustic pressure using the direct integration of the volume terms as described in cianferra et al 2019 we first discuss the propagation of the noise in the near field and successively in the far field 5 1 near field results two measurement points are selected on the propeller plane x 0 at distances 0 6 d mic a and 0 8 d mic b from the axis of rotation respectively thus just out of the tip of the blades when computing the fwh integral volume terms we adopt the acoustic control domain a of fig 1 b in order to include the entire wake contribution and the tip vortex fig 12 shows the time signal of the acoustic pressure the signature of the linear terms is periodic and practically monochromatic see the red line in both figs 12 and 13 with a frequency equal to n n being n the number of revolutions per second and n the number of blades very close to the propeller microphone a the amplitude peak reaches about 150 db whereas moving away from the blades it decreases to about 130 db microphone b this result is consistent with literature experimental data felli et al 2011 to be noted that the quadrupole non linear term significantly contributes at both locations it exhibits an important presence of lower frequencies also comparatively it contributes more to the overall noise with respect to linear terms at microphone b which is farther than a from the propeller in other words the rate at which the signal associated to the non linear terms decreases with distance is slower than that of linear terms this important issue has been also discussed in ianniello 2016 there the author investigated how the various terms of the fwh equation decay for the archetypal problem of a rotating point source and found that a simple rule based on the 1 r n decay law cannot be applied the spectrum of the signal expressed in a logarithmic scale is reported in fig 13 for microphones a and b respectively we recall that the sound spectrum level is evaluated as s p l 20 log 10 a p r e f db being a the amplitude of the signal and p r e f 1 μ pa the reference pressure for underwater measurements as already observed in the time signals the frequency analysis clearly shows the contribution of the quadrupole terms in the range of low frequencies a main peak is at about 15 20 hz in correspondence of the revolution frequency n and other peaks are in between n and nn to be noted that in the farther microphone b the maximum pressure amplitude of about 140 db is associated to the low frequency peak and thus to the non linear contribution to the noise we evaluate the noise at a third microphone c located downstream at 1 d 0 8 d 0 in the wake region in fig 14 the spl is shown for this latter microphone as for the previous cases and even more the non linear contribution to the noise is here predominant in particular in the range of lower frequencies at the revolution frequency n the linear part contribution amounts to about 70 db whereas the non linear contribution is a bit less than 140 db also the shape of the overall spectrum is completely different from that of the linear part specifically the former exhibits larger contributions in the range of low frequencies whereas the opposite is true for the latter the peak on the main frequency n n reaches about 100 db while the peak at the lower frequency 15 20 hz is a bit below 140 db the behavior depicted above indicates that the noise source persists downstream mainly due to the contribution of the wake whereas the noise generated by the pressure radiated from the propeller as known decreases with distance the comparison with previous fig 13 b highlights this remark an interesting issue is to understand which turbulent coherent structure mainly contributes to the composition of the non linear source term to this aim we show in fig 15 an instantaneous snapshot at the plane z 0 of the scalar 2 t i j x i x j related to the lighthill tensor of eq 12 which constitutes the instantaneous non linear in terms of velocity field source of the acoustic wave equation the figure shows that the most energetic contribution to the lighthill tensor and thus to the non linear source of noise may be the energetic helical vortex that forms around the propeller shaft this vortex structure appears even more significant than the tip vortex also its spatial distribution specifically the distance between two successive vortices along the mean flow direction is consistent with the low frequency observed in the spl our results are consistent with those of di mascio et al 2014 felli et al 2011 who reported that the wave number associated to the shaft vortex is 1 n times that associated to the tip vortex the fluid dynamic pressure induced on the shaft generates noise as well however its amplitude is four orders of magnitude lower than the pressure noise induced by the shaft vortex to show it we evaluated linear terms by integrating on the shaft surface alone the resulting pressure radiated from the shaft is given in fig 16 it is compared with the fwh pressure given by the quadrupole volume terms evaluated by integrating over the control domain b of fig 1 b by considering a narrow control domain b it was possible to consider the shaft vortex contribution alone note in fig 16 the different reference system along the y axis the frequency captured by both the fwh integrals volume and surface corresponds to 15 20 hz interestingly this noisy and energetic vortex structure is not present in full scale applications and in some sense it can be considered as an artifact generated by the pulling type architecture of the laboratory scale test 5 2 far field decay in this subsection we analyze the propagation of noise in the far field two microphones a 1 and a 2 are located over the line x z 0 at distances y 8 d and y 80 d respectively from the axis of symmetry in fig 17 their signals are compared with that of previous microphone a to be precise as acoustic far field it is considered a microphone placed at distance more than 2 wavelengths λ which depend on the frequency f since λ c 0 f therefore the most distant microphone a 2 can be considered as located in the acoustic far field at least in the range of high frequencies the energetic spl observed in correspondence of microphone a appears smoothed out once moving far from the propeller in particular high frequencies associated to turbulence and small scale fluid motion are not persistent over long distances and characterize the near field only we remind that microphone a is located in proximity of the blades where pressure impulses related to blade passage are intense this is the reason of the high pressure amplitudes about 150 db recorded at microphone a comparing the two far field probes a1 and a2 a mean decay of about 40 db is observed at probe a2 the main peak at n n hz drops down to values below 0 db and the signal exhibits a low frequency band in order to place our results within the context of the general theory of the far field noise propagation we recall the law of attenuation of spherical propagation which rules the rate of decay of an impulsive source it is given by the formula 19 l d 2 l d 1 20 log 10 d 2 d 1 where l d 1 l d 2 is the pressure level in db at distance d 1 d 2 eq 19 is valid for a point source and if d 2 10 d 1 the pressure level drop is l d 1 l d 2 20 db to validate it we carried out a test on a monopole field used as a simple source of noise the result of the acoustic analogy applied to the monopole field for two microphones placed at distances 10 m and 100 m from the source gives an amplitude decay from 0 0055 to 0 05 pascal corresponding to a drop of 20 db which is consistent with eq 19 however according to our results of fig 17 where we observe a mean decay of 40 db in the range of frequency 10 100 hz between two microphones a1 and a2 located at distance d 2 10 d 1 it is unclear whether this rule can be applied to the case of complex noise sources such as a flow field given by a propeller moreover we observe that the decay does not occur homogeneously with respect to the frequencies in fig 18 the difference between the sound pressure level of microphones a1 and a2 is reported we have separated the linear part red dashed line from the nonlinear one black solid line as regards the linear part a decay of about 70 db from the microphone a1 to a2 occurs at the fundamental frequency of 75 hz other peaks are relevant which indicate a strong decay of the linear part at frequencies 2 n 30 hz and 3 n 45 hz the decay of the non linear part is also different from the analytical ideal value being of the order of 70 hz at the frequency n and maintaining high values in a broad part of the spectrum this behavior has to be attributed to the complexity and non linearity of the noise source which deserves additional studies it must be said that the analysis of acoustic decay between microphone a1 and a2 does not correspond to a true analysis between two microphones in the far field therefore interaction phenomena of acoustic waves are still present instead of pure propagation of a signal however we note that to consider the far field for low frequencies it would be necessary to measure the noise at very great distances for example an acoustic wave of frequency 5 hz would reach the far field in our case at 2400 diameters away an other aspect closely related to the way the signal decays with distance is the directivity the directivity is here evaluated as the pressure root mean square given by solving the fwh equation at different measurement points equidistant from the source we consider 100 measurement points arranged on circumferences of radius 10 d over four different planes x 0 x 2 y 0 and y 2 sketched in fig 19 the results are depicted in figs 20 and 21 the distribution of pressure level over the planes x 0 and x 2 fig 20 top panels is consistent with theory and literature results since the radial symmetry of the problem is recovered in the computation of the directivity on the other hand the dipole type acoustic field is observable when considering the directivity of linear terms on the planes y 0 and y 2 fig 20 bottom panels this behavior has been already observed in previous research see among the others lidtke 2017 the results of the fwh non linear part appear even more interesting although the axial symmetry exhibited over the planes x 0 and x 2 still holds see fig 21 top panels very interesting patterns are evidenced over the planes y 0 and y 2 depicted in fig 21 bottom panels considering the fact that the negative cos a is in correspondence of the wake one may conclude that the propeller wake gives rise to consistent pressure fluctuations propagating in the downstream direction and contributing to the far field noise finally to be noted that the nonlinear contribution is about 3 orders of magnitude higher than linear one left bottom panels of figs 20 and 21 6 conclusions in the present paper we study the noise radiated from a marine propeller in open sea condition using the acoustic analogy the fluid dynamic field is simulated using large eddy simulation with wall layer models whereas the acoustic field is obtained using the ffowcs williams and hawkings equation as regards the fluid dynamic field wles gives accurate results both for the integral quantities thrust and torque and for the turbulent field developing downward in the wake the accuracy of the results was assessed through comparison with available experimental data and high resolution les carried out by other authors the integral formulation of the fwh equation is first formulated in the advective form and then solved using a direct volume integration for the non linear quadrupole terms in the present case this is possible because the assumption of compact source has been demonstrated to be valid through the retarded surface method the solution of the complete fwh equation allows to evaluate separately the linear and non linear contributions to the noise propagation in agreement with literature studies the linear part produces a narrow banded spectrum with a main peak at the blade frequency the non linear contribution appears of great interest it is mainly associated with the shaft vortex that persists for a long distance at the rear of the propeller it is characterized by high level of vorticity and strongly characterizes the acoustic field therefore the acoustic signature given by the fwh equation is found to consist mainly of quadrupole noise except for the peak on the blade frequency generated by the linear terms the analysis of the propagation of the noise in the far field shows that thumb like rules based on simple analytical formulations may be very inaccurate specifically in presence of a complex noise source like a ship propeller the decay of the noise in the far field is not constant over the frequency spectrum but appears much stronger at fundamental frequencies the linear part exhibits a strong decay at the fundamental frequency n n as well as at frequencies multiple of the rotational one n the non linear part decays faster in the range of low frequencies this has to be attributed to the fact that the main turbulent structures contributing to the far field noise are the well known tip vortex and the shaft vortex or hub vortex depending on the geometric configuration investigated the latter appears more energetic and noisy than the former the directivity points out the dipole type acoustic field generated by the fwh linear contribution which was already observed in previous studies also it exhibits a strong asymmetry due to the non linear contribution this is expected although it is noteworthy that the contribution of the linear part is much smaller than the non linear one especially in the far field and in the direction of the wake finally it is advisable to dwell on the particular configuration of this benchmark case which has the shaft flipped downstream the presence of the shaft in the middle of the wake affect the dynamics of the otherwise called hub vortex observed in previous experimental and numerical studies the different evolution of the downstream vortex also considerably changes the acoustic signature thus we would conclude that a configuration of this type can be misleading for realistic noise measurements acknowledgment this work was supported by region fvg por fesr 2014 2020
