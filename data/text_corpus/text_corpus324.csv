1620,identification of the nitrate sources that adversely impact groundwater quality is a necessary first step in the control of this major worldwide pollutant the impact of nitrate leachate from urea ammonium nitrate uan 50 urea n 25 ammonium n 25 nitrate n fertilizer whose use has increased dramatically in the last three decades largely because it can be applied through sprinkler irrigation systems to corn in all growth stages is investigated the dual isotopes δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 were measured in groundwater samples from 39 irrigation wells in two intensively sprinkler irrigated corn growing areas of nebraska with nitrate contaminated n 10 mg l groundwater and documented uan use to ascertain whether nitrified ammonia and nitrate fertilizers can be distinguished in the high plains aquifer the areas which are highly vulnerable to nitrate leaching and differ only in the composition and thickness of their unsaturated zones are uniquely suited to provide scientific evidence of the feasibility of identifying nitrate fertilizer leachate in groundwater and thereby add significantly to the small body of existing and inconclusive data the dual isotope method dim results indicate that the nitrate contamination in 38 wells is mostly nitrified ammonium fertilizer most importantly nitrate fertilizer from uan was not identified isotopically in groundwater beneath almost all fields with documented heavy uan use this could be a potentially valuable finding for fertilizer management or it could convey limitations on the appropriateness of the dim for nitrate fertilizer source identification in groundwater slightly enriched δ15nno3 values in a few wells coincide with the practice of wintering cattle on corn stubble which reportedly occurred more frequently in one focus area the absence of natural soil n leachates and denitrification in groundwater enabled an apparently reliable identification of manure leachates in both areas keywords dual isotopes groundwater nitrate fertilizer animal waste 1 introduction leachate from nitrogen n fertilized irrigated farmland in kansas nebraska oklahoma and texas is the major nonpoint source of contamination in the underlying high plains aquifer gurdak and qi 2006 since 1980 urea ammonium nitrate fertilizer uan 50 urea n 25 ammonium n 25 nitrate n has increasingly replaced anhydrous ammonia as irrigated corn producers commercial n fertilizer of choice and by 2005 it was the predominant commercial n fertilizer applied in nebraska ferguson 2015 the use of potentially explosive ammonium nitrate fertilizer declined precipitously after the 1995 oklahoma city bombing and its use is very limited in the central plains stewart 2008 potassium nitrate kno3 and calcium nitrate ca no3 2 are considerably more expensive and are used infrequently by midwestern producers δ15n values for fertilizers sold in nebraska range from 2 to 2 for urea n and ammonium n in uan and from 3 to 7 for nitrate fertilizer spalding et al 1982 worldwide nitrate fertilizer δ15n values average 2 75 hübner 1986 nitrate is the most enriched commercial n fertilizer formulation reported mariotti and letolle 1977 spalding et al 1982 hübner 1986 fernández et al 2017 atmospheric oxygen with a δ18o of 23 5 kroopnick and craig 1972 is the oxygen source for synthetic nitrate thus its oxygens should be similarly enriched theoretically then the nitrate and ammonium components of uan the only nitrate fertilizer commonly applied to irrigated corn fields in nebraska and the midwest can be differentiated by their dual isotope di δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 values previous investigations focused on identification of nitrate fertilizer in groundwater using the dual isotope δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 method dim have been inconclusive possibly because the studies were constrained by either inadequate documentation of n fertilizer application rates or areal extent in one of the earliest investigations enriched δ18ono3 values of 13 were expected in leachate from ammonium nitrate fertilized cropland upgradient of a septic plume but were not detected aravena et al 1993 in germany nitrate fertilizer leached through forest soils was identified by its δ18o signature however the quantity of nitrate leached was dependent upon the amount of soil microbiological activity durka et al 1994 mattern et al 2011 identified nitrate fertilizer in only two of 114 samples collected in a partially agricultural region overlying the brussel sand formation in belgium heavy δ18o values 18 characteristic of ca no3 2 fertilizer leachates were reported during winter in a fine textured soil lysimeter study conducted in switzerland mengis et al 2001 in summer however light δ18o values in lysimeter experiments suggested that soil microbiological activity during the warm season resulted in rapid immobilization of nitrate in the fine textured soils with the resulting organic n subsequently mineralized to ammonium and later nitrified mengis et al 2001 postulated that the immobilization process should be much less pronounced in sandy soil where leaching rates are greater in ireland minet et al 2012 also found lysimeter soil water δ18ono3 values in the range of nitrified ammonium that were of little use in identifying nitrate fertilizer in infiltrating n source mixtures however in two spring barley plots with nitrate inputs below crop requirements δ18ono3 values approximated those of infiltrating nitrate fertilizer they cited both mengis et al 2001 hypothesis that mineralization immobilization turnover processes likely cause the low δ18ono3 values and an alternative hypothesis that crops preferentially take up nitrate while ammonia remains for nitrification and leaching roadcap et al 2002 this investigation s primary objective was to determine whether the dim can successfully identify nitrate fertilizer in nitrate contaminated n 10 mg l groundwater in two expansive sprinkler irrigated corn production areas of nebraska that are highly vulnerable to leaching and have well documented long term histories of uan fertilizer use that are unique to this investigation similarly fertilized sprinkler irrigated corn growing areas are present throughout much of the high plains in south dakota and kansas a secondary purpose of this dim groundwater investigation was the identification of minor sources of δ15n enrichment by eliminating isotopic fractionation effects of denitrification 2 materials and methods 2 1 investigated areas the two focus areas one in the upper elkhorn natural resources district uenrd and one in the tri basin natural resources district tbnrd are the best areas in nebraska fig 1 to investigate component leaching of uan as they are in predominantly irrigated corn producing areas of eastern and central nebraska where 80 of nebraska s irrigated corn is grown usda nass nebraska is the united states third largest producer of corn for grain and more hectares are planted to corn than any other row crop in 2013 80 of the 2 8 million corn hectares were irrigated usda nass corn is nebraska s largest consumer of commercial n fertilizer the uenrd focus area is underlain by 274 200 contiguous hectares of nitrate contaminated groundwater north of the elkhorn river in holt and antelope counties while the tbnrd focus area is underlain by 34 820 contiguous hectares of nitrate contaminated groundwater south of the platte river in phelps and kearney counties exner et al 2014 in the uenrd and tbnrd 61 and 75 respectively of their nitrate contaminated focus area is cropped 85 and 84 of the cropped hectares respectively are irrigated and 54 and 62 of the irrigated hectares respectively are cropped to corn uan fertilizer use histories are well documented by the producers irrigation water is applied almost exclusively through a center pivot system designed to evenly apply water to a large area 50 ha of very permeable soils through overhead sprinklers many producers apply uan through the sprinklers a technique known as fertigation cattle are wintered on the corn stubble of many irrigated corn fields with the practice more prevalent in the tbnrd 2 1 1 upper elkhorn natural resources district focus area groundwater nitrate concentrations have been elevated within most of holt county s contaminated area for four decades exner and spalding 1979 exner et al 2014 and for two decades in antelope county exner et al 2014 which likely is associated with a shorter period of intense irrigation development groundwater in both counties is naturally oxidizing with very low total dissolved solids sprinkler irrigation acts as an aerator and return flows likely are further enriched in dissolved oxygen these soil conditions are not conducive to denitrification the 0 2 to 1 m thick soils are mostly well to excessively well drained sandy loams with low organic matter mahnke et al 1978 ragon et al 1983 valentine and thurman the dominant soil types have similar characteristics the top 150 cm are 93 to 97 sand and soil organic matter som averages 1 in the top 10 cm but quickly decreases to 0 3 at 30 cm soil survey staff nrcs these low organic matter soils are least likely to promote immobilization of nitrate fertilizer most som likely originates from recently decaying crop stubble and root material the unsaturated zone thickness beneath irrigated fields generally is 15 m spalding and hirsh 2012 the unsaturated zone is heterogeneous with layers of aeolian sands sandy silts and silty sands continuous clay lenses are absent souders and shaffer 1969 although isolated clay lenses can occur beneath some irrigated fields the hydraulic conductivity of the predominantly sandstone aquifer ranges from 6 1 to 45 7 m day and groundwater flow is predominately to the east except within 5 km of the elkhorn river where groundwater flow is toward the river pettijohn and chen 1982 peterson et al 2008 intense irrigation development of these very permeable soils became possible only with the advent of center pivot irrigation development began in holt county in the late 1960s and early 1970s and so dominated the landscape that in the 1970s astronauts could identify northeast nebraska by its lush green circles development began in antelope county in the 1970s and 1980s 2 1 2 tri basin natural resources district focus area groundwater nitrate concentrations in the focus area have been elevated for at least three decades and from 1987 to 2011 concentrations in irrigation wells increased at an annual rate of 0 23 mg n l to an average concentration of 20 7 mg n l exner et al 2014 considered a southern extension of the sandhills the area like the uenrd focus area is characterized primarily by center pivot irrigation on highly vulnerable valentine sandy soils depths to water however are shallow and average 6 m exner et al 2014 while the thicker 58 to 75 m aquifer is less heterogeneous with relatively thick sand and gravel layers while most irrigation is by center pivot pumping from shallow depths is relatively inexpensive and a few producers continue to furrow irrigate in northern phelps county groundwater flow is primarily to the east northeast at 0 3 m day and the hydraulic conductivity ranges from 15 to 30 m day farther east in northern kearney county groundwater flows parallel to or slightly away from the platte river and hydraulic conductivities are higher ranging from 30 to 61 m day pettijohn and chen 1982 stanton 2000 in addition to the shallow depths to groundwater the higher hydraulic conductivities allow for increased production over shorter distances thus wells depths in the tbnrd focus area are considerably shallower than in the uenrd 2 2 irrigation well characteristics and sampling high capacity irrigation wells usually tap several transmissive zones vertically integrated samples from these wells can be excellent indicators of nitrate levels in nonpoint source contaminated areas zlotnik et al 1995 high nitrate concentrations were shown to occur at all depths in the hundreds of irrigation wells in the uenrd focus area exner et al 2014 densely spaced high capacity wells likely increase vertical mixing of groundwater spalding et al 2001 nitrate concentrations in the 39 sampled irrigation wells were not significantly correlated to well depth ρ 0 01 while many studies have reported higher nitrate concentrations in shallow wells in this study the closely spaced wells their large drawdowns and multiple screened depths appear to pull the nitrate downward and homogenize the contamination with depth all 39 irrigation wells were pumping at least one hour before samples were collected by uenrd and tbnrd personnel midway during the 2013 and 2016 irrigation seasons samples for all parameters were collected in 250 ml acid washed polyethylene screw top bottles immediately placed on ice in coolers until they could be frozen and later transported on dry ice by university of nebraska personnel to lincoln where they were remained frozen until preparation for analysis nrd personnel documented their observations including manure use and unusual field conditions irrigation well data including location pumping rate total depth tables 1 2 were obtained from the nebraska department of natural resources 2 3 analytical methods samples for nitrate δ15nno3 δ18ono3 and δ18oh2o measurements were shipped overnight on dry ice to the university of waterloo s environmental isotope laboratory ei lab nitrate was measured by ion chromatography with a detection limit of 0 2 mg n l the 2013 samples were prepared for δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 isotopic analysis by precipitating no3 as agno3 silva et al 2000 δ15nno3 values were measured using an elemental analyzer isotope ratio mass spectrometer ea irms silva et al 2000 and δ18ono3 values determined by elemental analysis pyrolysis mengis et al 2001 the δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 values in the 2016 samples were determined by chemical denitrification to n2o pre concentration and analysis on a gv isoprime mass spectrometer ryabenko et al 2009 the ei lab instituted the change in methods as the denitrification method is cheaper and faster and utilizes less sample than the nitrate precipitation method with both methods δ15n and δ18o isotopic precision was 0 5 δ18oh2o was measured by isotope ratio laser spectrometry kerstel et al 1999 isotopic precision was 1 the stable isotopic n and o compositions relative to atmospheric nitrogen and v smow respectively are represented by δ15n and δ18o respectively and defined as rsample rstandard 1 1000 where r is the ratio of the two stable isotopes 15n 14n or 18o 16o concentrations of chloride which can cause interference in the silva et al 2000 method were screened in the 2013 samples using chemetrics titrets titration cell mercuric nitrate method with a range of 20 to 200 mg cl l before shipment to the ei lab concentrations in the 2016 samples were measured at the ei lab by ion chromatography the detection limit was 0 2 mg l 2 4 fertilizer use natural resources district nrd personnel reported fertilizer use for each field recent uan application rate data tables 1 2 were obtained from the annual chemigation permit issued by the local nrd and required for each pivot irrigation system applying chemicals for decades most producers liberally applied uan to their irrigated corn fields uan also is applied as a side dress and or broadcast by many producers therefore the reported amount of uan is a minimum the average annual n fertilizer application rate for the field associated with the sampled irrigation well in the tbnrd focus area and for some wells in the uenrd focus area was obtained from reports the producer must file annually for each irrigated cornfield for fields in the uenrd focus area that do not have a reporting requirement an approximate n fertilizer application rate was calculated using the county average irrigated corn yield and the commonly accepted rule of thumb that corn grain plus residual removes 1 to 1 2 lbs n bu acre of irrigated corn maddux and halverson 2008 the estimated rate likely falls short of the actual application rates the equivalent of 280 to 314 kg n ha are recommended for yields of 14 to 15 mg ha on the low organic matter sandy soils shapiro et al 2009 3 results the dim sample results are plotted with the δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 envelopes for potential n sources that could impact groundwater within the focus areas figs 2 3 the δ15nno3 values of nitrified ammonium fertilizer leachates in groundwater typically range from 4 to 4 kendall and aravena 2000 the envelope overlaps the natural soil n envelope from 3 to 8 amberger and schmidt 1987 the 10 to 10 δ18ono3 boundary for both potential n sources was determined by kendall and aravena 2000 by substituting the lower and upper ranges of soil water and atmospheric δ18o values in the formula δ18ono3 ⅔ δ18oh2o ⅓ δ18oatm for nitrification of ammonium in soils amberger and schmidt 1987 all δ18ono3 values figs 2 3 are clearly within the 10 to 10 boundaries for nitrification of ammonia shallow groundwater δ18oh2o values should typically reflect the mean weighted precipitation value clark and fritz 1997 and are used to approximate the δ18ono3 formed by soil nitrifiers aravena et al 1993 average δ18oh2o values of 9 5 and 8 5 in the groundwater of the uenrd and the tbnrd focus areas tables 1 2 respectively are in the middle of the range for mean weighted precipitation values reported by harvey and welker 2000 for north central and south central nebraska respectively using our average measured δ18oh2o and δ18ono3 values in the amberger and schmidt 1987 formula average δ18oatm values in the uenrd and tbnrd focus areas ranged from 19 to 21 and are within the 18 to 22 range reported by amberger and schmidt 1987 the δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 nitrate fertilizer envelope boundaries are 3 to 7 spalding et al 1982 and 18 to 22 amberger and schmidt 1987 respectively δ15nno3 values 10 in groundwater are indicators of animal waste sources heaton 1986 clark and fritz 1997 mengis et al 2001 böhlke et al 2002 stanton and fahlquist 2006 the 25 upper boundary encompasses the 10 to 20 range for animal manure first reported by kreitler and jones 1975 and most confined animal feeding operation cafo lagoon liquid manure the δ15nnh4 in 13 nebraska cafo lagoons ranged from 2 to 59 with only 10 of the values 10 during five sampling events in the same year while the average annual values ranged from 13 7 to 21 8 mariappan et al 2009 liquid hog manure in the san pedro and pichidegua agricultural areas of central chile ranged from 4 1 to 22 2 fernández et al 2017 in rural shijiazhaung china heavy δ15nno3 values confirmed that irrigating with wastewater contaminated groundwater as deep as 100 m chen et al 2006 δ15nno3 values from 7 to 16 suggested that human and animal wastes were major sources of groundwater nitrate contamination in the jericho area of the westbank palestine khayat et al 2006 ammonia volatilization is the main mechanism that enriches the light values found in fresh cattle urine 1 7 and manure 4 8 and pig urine 2 9 and manure 4 0 gormly and spalding 1979 to values 10 in manure and manure slurries δ15n values 13 for total reduced n in the compacted manure of feedlots indicate volatilization commences soon after manure deposition gormly and spalding 1979 nitrate n concentrations in the 18 deep irrigation wells sampled in the uenrd focus area ranged from 7 0 to 30 mg n l and averaged 20 mg n l table 1 the δ15nno3 values ranged from 1 4 to 4 8 and averaged 2 8 the δ18ono3 values ranged from 0 9 to 7 8 and averaged 2 6 except for one δ18ono3 value in the nh4 fertilizer envelope dim values were in a very narrow range fig 2 fifteen dim values were within the nitrified nh4 fertilizer source envelope five of the eight values populating the soil n envelope were in the overlap of the two envelopes all δ18ono3 values were considerably lighter than the lower δ18ono3 boundary 18 for nitrate fertilizer none of the dim values populated the nitrate fertilizer or animal waste envelopes chloride concentrations in the 2016 samples averaged 6 3 mg l with a range from 2 6 to 10 mg l nitrate n concentrations in the 21 irrigation wells in the tbnrd focus area also averaged 20 mg n l but had a wider concentration range from 6 5 to 53 mg n l table 2 the δ15nno3 values ranged from 0 3 to 7 8 and averaged 3 2 while the δ18ono3 values ranged from 1 4 to 6 8 and averaged 2 4 as in the uenrd focus area 15 dim values populated the nh4 fertilizer source envelope fig 3 five of the 11 values in the soil n envelope were in the overlap of the two source envelopes δ18ono3 values 4 0 in 19 of 21 irrigation wells suggest that most of the contamination stems from the nitrification of ammonium from fertilizer and som as in the uenrd focus area none of the dim values populated the nitrate fertilizer or animal waste envelopes chloride concentrations in the 2016 groundwater samples averaged 15 mg l with a range from 6 2 to 27 mg l 4 discussion nitrate is the most mobile form of n fertilizer and easily moves downward through the soil profile with infiltrating water its mobility is markedly faster than that of ammonium or urea which must undergo microbiological conversion to nitrate if significantly more nitrate than ammonium fertilizer preferentially leached through the highly vulnerable soils of the focus areas the δ18ono3 values would predictably be 8 and potentially approach the nitrate fertilizer envelope the results figs 2 3 clearly show that preferential leaching of nitrate fertilizer to groundwater did not occur enriched δ18ono3 values were absent in the groundwater beneath the thin coarse textured unsaturated zone of the tbnrd and the much thicker more heterogeneous finer textured unsaturated zone of the uenrd suggesting that fertilizer nitrate is not leached past the crop rooting zone the absence of identifiable nitrate fertilizer in groundwater beneath nitrate fertilized crops supports the early findings of aravena et al 1993 only one well 170994 in table 1 in the uenrd had identifiable uan nitrate fig 2 the heavier 7 8 δ18ono3 value together with the relatively light 2 1 δ15nno3 value may reflect direct uan transport either by backflow or by downward movement possibly from a leaking storage tank along the unsealed well casing if uan directly entered the groundwater 25 would be nitrate n and 75 nitrified ammonium n and urea n and the δ18ono3 fraction would be 8 if all the ammonium and urea were converted to nitrate in the groundwater and uan was the only n fertilizer applied further source analysis in the investigated areas is dependent upon the presence of denitrification which was not expected in the highly oxygenated groundwater and sprinkler irrigation return flows enrichment of both isotopes during denitrification is reflected in a positive δ18ono3 δ15nno3 slope an enrichment slope of 0 5 has been confirmed both by theoretical based computations chen and macquarrie 2005 seiler 2005 and field studies böttcher et al 1990 aravena and robertson 1998 mengis et al 1999 devito et al 2000 fukada et al 2004 seiler 2005 singleton et al 2007 the slightly negative slope 0 18 ρ 0 01 for the dim values in the uenrd focus area fig 2 clearly is not characteristic of di enrichment during denitrification thus fractionation via denitrification appears very limited to non existent in the thick heterotrophic unsaturated zone beneath much of the uenrd focus area and the dim values should be reliable indicators of n sources fractionation via denitrification would be even less likely in the sandy soils relatively thin unsaturated zone and highly oxygenated groundwater that characterize the tbnrd focus area in a dim investigation at hastings nebraska 40 km southeast of the tbnrd focus area denitrification was not evident in oxygenated groundwater samples beneath thick fine textured irrigated soils spalding et al 2018 the slope m 0 45 for the di enrichment in the 21 tbnrd focus area samples fig 3 suggests denitrification the data fig 4 ρ 0 01 however do not show the decrease in nitrate concentration that occurs as the δ15nno3 enrichment proceeds during denitrification the conflicting interpretations likely reflect statistical bias introduced in the di vector from the single enriched sample that is an outlier in both location and surface hydrology the slope m 0 29 of the di vector without the outlier well 220269 table 2 di values does not support denitrification thus the tbnrd focus area isotopic results do not appear compromised by fractionation via denitrification denitrification known to occur in riparian groundwater immediately adjacent to streams and rivers cey et al 1999 devito et al 2000 and in areas contaminated by labile organic matter usually from sewage and animal wastes spalding et al 1993 aravena and robertson 1998 is a possible source of enrichment in well 220269 table 2 the well is by far the closest 0 4 km of the 21 wells to the platte river fig 1 and it is adjacent to a drainage ditch filled with standing water throughout the growing season manure from cattle wintered on corn stubble and the well s elevated chloride concentration 27 mg l suggest the infiltration of animal waste ritter and churnside 1990 karr et al 2001 showers et al 2008 the dim values δ15nno3 7 8 δ18ono3 6 8 could be enriched by several factors or a combination of them they include capture of platte river riparian zone groundwater during pumping infiltration of partially denitrified ditch water infiltration of manure nitrate and infiltration of enriched δ18oh2o from evaporate in the ditch although soil nitrogen is depicted as a major source of groundwater nitrate in the biplots of both focus areas figs 2 3 mineralized soil contributions in these areas are considerably less than those from n fertilizer most of the labile natural soil n from these sandy soils 1 som probably was released a few years after the virgin sod was broken higher organic matter fine textured soils silt loams in central nebraska north of the platte river released most of their labile soil n from som within the first years of cultivation reinhorn and avnimelech 1974 gormly and spalding 1979 n fertilization of these soils has increased the aqueous extractable nitrate three fold and after 60 years of irrigation and cultivation mineralization of som from these silt loams was determined an insignificant source of nitrate in groundwater gormly and spalding 1979 with considerably less natural som and half a century of irrigated corn production in the focus areas mineralization of som residue during the growing season equates to 22 kg n som ha maddux and halverson 2008 and is much less than the 225 kg n ha yr applied as fertilizer in a dim investigation at hastings several di results were in the soil n envelope the flat linear increase in δ15nno3 values into the animal waste envelope together with the n fertilizer signatures in very shallow borehole groundwater beneath irrigated cropland suggested that soil derived nitrate leachates did not significantly impact the groundwater spalding et al 2018 the much thinner 2 m versus 20 m coarser and lower organic matter irrigated soils in the tbnrd and uenrd focus areas are not likely contributors of soil derived n since natural soil n is not a significant n source and denitrification is not blurring the isotopic identity of the sources the heavier δ15nno3 values outside the ammonium fertilizer envelope figs 2 3 likely reflect a mixture of ammonium fertilizer and a heavier n source small contributions of nitrified manure leachate with δ15nno3 values from 10 to 25 could easily explain enrichments of 2 potential sources of small amounts of manure n include the winter grazing of cattle on crop stubble and in the tbnrd focus area the application of manure to some fields leachate from nitrified ammonium in manure is a logical suspect in the δ15nno3 enriched sample 4 8 fig 2 from well 190116 where the producer reported wintering cattle on the field s corn stubble manure leachate is suspected in two other wells with slightly enriched 4 2 and 4 8 δ15nno3 values in the uenrd focus area producers and or nrd personnel reported animal waste on the fields adjacent to four of the five irrigation wells with slightly enriched 4 6 to 6 9 δ15nno3 values fig 3 in the tbnrd focus area cattle were winter grazed and manure appears to have been applied to the field adjacent to well 24165 table 2 both the enriched δ15nno3 value of 6 9 and elevated chloride concentration 21 mg l can be indicative of animal waste the same producer used similar practices adjacent to well 78 175 with a δ15nno3 value of 4 6 cattle also were wintered and manure occasionally spread on the fields adjacent to wells 21 436 and 16 168 which had δ15nno3 values of 5 9 and 4 8 respectively thus a mixture of ammonium fertilizer and manure derived nitrate likely is responsible for the slightly enriched δ15nno3 values within the soil n envelope figs 2 3 this is consistent with the results described in spalding et al 2018 that clearly showed that both nitrified ammonium leachates from commercial fertilizer and feedlot associated animal waste applied to irrigated cropland were drawn into the capture zones of several downgradient municipal wells in hastings nebraska while manure appears as a minor source of nitrate contamination in both areas nitrification of ammonium fertilizer is the dominant source of most nitrate in the groundwater of both focus areas the irrigation practices and n loading sandy soils and sandy unsaturated zones and oxic saturated zones in the investigated areas are similar to those found in western kansas and oklahoma mcmahon 2001 and in much of the area underlain by the central high plains aquifer mcmahon et al 2003 where nitrified ammonium fertilizer is the dominant source of groundwater contamination 5 conclusions our results suggest that the dim provides a better appreciation of the complexities of the n cycle in the soil rooting zone beneath fields that have received heavy uan applications for many years hypotheses for the absence of isotopically identifiable nitrate in the groundwater are crop removal and or chemical alteration in the biologically active irrigated root zone possibly timely uan application results in rapid uptake of the nitrate fraction within the root zone if correct this interpretation has major implications for best management practices more nitrate spoon feeding through irrigation systems and less urea and ammonium fertilization could be warranted the dim results suggest that application of nitrate using uan is for the most part a beneficial nitrogen management practice in seasonally warm bacterially active soil however nitrate could be immobilized reduced to organic n mineralized to ammonium and in aerobic soils nitrified remobilized back to nitrate mengis et al 2001 in this process the original atmospheric o2 would be replaced by soil water and atmospheric o2 and the oxygen isotope fingerprint in the nitrate would be lost as the oxygen isotopes in the subsequently mineralized nitrate would be isotopically indistinguishable from those in nitrified ammonium fertilizer both hypotheses demonstrate that in most agricultural settings application of the dim to identify nitrate fertilizer in groundwater is questionable although sandy soils have low organic matter and high leaching potential improved water management through sprinkler irrigation systems could increase nitrate fertilizer retention in the root zone and allow uptake and or immobilization to occur studies using isotopically labeled no3 on sandy soils during summer are needed to clarify whether nitrate immobilization and remobilization mask nitrate source identification the dim results indicate that denitrification is not a significant isotope fractionation mechanism in most of the groundwater samples and suggest that reliance on denitrification to reduce nitrate loading to aquifers in irrigated agricultural settings with thick coarse and or fine textured soils could be wishful thinking the elimination of denitrification and the lack of residual natural soil n leachates allowed identification of cattle manure as a minor source of δ15nno3 enrichment in a few samples the dim clearly showed that nitrified ammonium fertilizers are the primary source of nitrate in the groundwater beneath both focus areas acknowledgments we appreciate the patience of roch gaussoin and richard ferguson department of agronomy and horticulture in allowing the expenditure of funds from pre retirement accounts to complete this isotopic investigation

ammonium nitrate uan 50 urea n 25 ammonium n 25 nitrate n fertilizer whose use has increased dramatically in the last three decades largely because it can be applied through sprinkler irrigation systems to corn in all growth stages is investigated the dual isotopes δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 were measured in groundwater samples from 39 irrigation wells in two intensively sprinkler irrigated corn growing areas of nebraska with nitrate contaminated n 10 mg l groundwater and documented uan use to ascertain whether nitrified ammonia and nitrate fertilizers can be distinguished in the high plains aquifer the areas which are highly vulnerable to nitrate leaching and differ only in the composition and thickness of their unsaturated zones are uniquely suited to provide scientific evidence of the feasibility of identifying nitrate fertilizer leachate in groundwater and thereby add significantly to the small body of existing and inconclusive data the dual isotope method dim results indicate that the nitrate contamination in 38 wells is mostly nitrified ammonium fertilizer most importantly nitrate fertilizer from uan was not identified isotopically in groundwater beneath almost all fields with documented heavy uan use this could be a potentially valuable finding for fertilizer management or it could convey limitations on the appropriateness of the dim for nitrate fertilizer source identification in groundwater slightly enriched δ15nno3 values in a few wells coincide with the practice of wintering cattle on corn stubble which reportedly occurred more frequently in one focus area

the nitrate and ammonium components of uan the only nitrate fertilizer commonly applied to irrigated corn fields in nebraska and the midwest can be differentiated by their dual isotope di δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 values previous investigations focused on identification of nitrate fertilizer in groundwater using the dual isotope δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 method dim have been inconclusive possibly because the studies were constrained by either inadequate documentation of n fertilizer application rates or areal extent in one of the earliest investigations enriched δ18ono3 values of 13 were expected in leachate from ammonium nitrate fertilized cropland upgradient of a septic plume but were not detected aravena et al 1993 in germany nitrate fertilizer leached through forest soils was identified by its δ18o signature however the quantity of nitrate leached was dependent upon the amount of soil microbiological activity durka et al 1994 mattern et al 2011 identified nitrate fertilizer in only two of 114 samples collected in a partially agricultural region overlying the brussel sand formation in belgium heavy δ18o values 18 characteristic of ca no3 2 fertilizer leachates were reported during winter in a fine textured soil lysimeter study conducted in switzerland mengis et al 2001 in summer however light δ18o values in lysimeter experiments suggested that soil microbiological activity during the warm season resulted in rapid immobilization of nitrate in the fine textured soils with the resulting organic n subsequently mineralized to ammonium and later nitrified mengis et al 2001 postulated that the immobilization process should be much less pronounced in sandy soil where leaching rates are greater in ireland minet et al 2012 also found lysimeter soil water δ18ono3 values in the range of nitrified ammonium that were of little use in identifying nitrate fertilizer in infiltrating n source mixtures however in two spring barley plots with nitrate inputs below crop requirements δ18ono3 values approximated those of infiltrating nitrate fertilizer they cited both mengis et al 2001 hypothesis that mineralization immobilization turnover processes likely cause the low δ18ono3 values and an alternative hypothesis that crops preferentially take up nitrate while ammonia remains for nitrification and leaching roadcap et al 2002 this investigation s primary objective was to determine whether the dim can successfully identify nitrate fertilizer in nitrate contaminated n 10 mg l groundwater in two expansive sprinkler irrigated corn production areas of nebraska that are highly vulnerable to leaching and have well documented long term histories of uan fertilizer use that are unique to this investigation similarly fertilized sprinkler irrigated corn growing areas are present throughout much of the high plains in south dakota and kansas a secondary purpose of this dim groundwater investigation was the identification of minor sources of δ15n enrichment by eliminating isotopic fractionation effects of denitrification 2 materials and methods 2 1 investigated areas the two focus areas one in the upper elkhorn natural resources district uenrd and one in the tri basin natural resources district tbnrd are the best areas in nebraska fig 1 to investigate component leaching of uan as they are in predominantly irrigated corn producing areas of eastern and central nebraska where 80 of nebraska s irrigated corn is grown usda nass nebraska is the united states third largest producer of corn for grain and more hectares are planted to corn than any other row crop in 2013 80 of the 2 8 million corn hectares were irrigated usda nass corn is nebraska s largest consumer of commercial n fertilizer the uenrd focus area is underlain by 274 200 contiguous hectares of nitrate contaminated groundwater north of the elkhorn river in holt and antelope counties while the tbnrd focus area is underlain by 34 820 contiguous hectares of nitrate contaminated groundwater south of the platte river in phelps and kearney counties exner et al 2014 in the uenrd and tbnrd 61 and 75 respectively of their nitrate contaminated focus area is cropped 85 and 84 of the cropped hectares respectively are irrigated and 54 and 62 of the irrigated hectares respectively are cropped to corn uan fertilizer use histories are well documented by the producers irrigation water is applied almost exclusively through a center pivot system designed to evenly apply water to a large area 50 ha of very permeable soils through overhead sprinklers many producers apply uan through the sprinklers a technique known as fertigation cattle are wintered on the corn stubble of many irrigated corn fields with the practice more prevalent in the tbnrd 2 1 1 upper elkhorn natural resources district focus area groundwater nitrate concentrations have been elevated within most of holt county s contaminated area for four decades exner and spalding 1979 exner et al 2014 and for two decades in antelope county exner et al 2014 which likely is associated with a shorter period of intense irrigation development groundwater in both counties is naturally oxidizing with very low total dissolved solids sprinkler irrigation acts as an aerator and return flows likely are further enriched in dissolved oxygen these soil conditions are not conducive to denitrification the 0 2 to 1 m thick soils are mostly well to excessively well drained sandy loams with low organic matter mahnke et al 1978 ragon et al 1983 valentine and thurman the dominant soil types have similar characteristics the top 150 cm are 93 to 97 sand and soil organic matter som averages 1 in the top 10 cm but quickly decreases to 0 3 at 30 cm soil survey staff nrcs these low organic matter soils are least likely to promote immobilization of nitrate fertilizer most som likely originates from recently decaying crop stubble and root material the unsaturated zone thickness beneath irrigated fields generally is 15 m spalding and hirsh 2012 the unsaturated zone is heterogeneous with layers of aeolian sands sandy silts and silty sands continuous clay lenses are absent souders and shaffer 1969 although isolated clay lenses can occur beneath some irrigated fields the hydraulic conductivity of the predominantly sandstone aquifer ranges from 6 1 to 45 7 m day and groundwater flow is predominately to the east except within 5 km of the elkhorn river where groundwater flow is toward the river pettijohn and chen 1982 peterson et al 2008 intense irrigation development of these very permeable soils became possible only with the advent of center pivot irrigation development began in holt county in the late 1960s and early 1970s and so dominated the landscape that in the 1970s astronauts could identify northeast nebraska by its lush green circles development began in antelope county in the 1970s and 1980s 2 1 2 tri basin natural resources district focus area groundwater nitrate concentrations in the focus area have been elevated for at least three decades and from 1987 to 2011 concentrations in irrigation wells increased at an annual rate of 0 23 mg n l to an average concentration of 20 7 mg n l exner et al 2014 considered a southern extension of the sandhills the area like the uenrd focus area is characterized primarily by center pivot irrigation on highly vulnerable valentine sandy soils depths to water however are shallow and average 6 m exner et al 2014 while the thicker 58 to 75 m aquifer is less heterogeneous with relatively thick sand and gravel layers while most irrigation is by center pivot pumping from shallow depths is relatively inexpensive and a few producers continue to furrow irrigate in northern phelps county groundwater flow is primarily to the east northeast at 0 3 m day and the hydraulic conductivity ranges from 15 to 30 m day farther east in northern kearney county groundwater flows parallel to or slightly away from the platte river and hydraulic conductivities are higher ranging from 30 to 61 m day pettijohn and chen 1982 stanton 2000 in addition to the shallow depths to groundwater the higher hydraulic conductivities allow for increased production over shorter distances thus wells depths in the tbnrd focus area are considerably shallower than in the uenrd 2 2 irrigation well characteristics and sampling high capacity irrigation wells usually tap several transmissive zones vertically integrated samples from these wells can be excellent indicators of nitrate levels in nonpoint source contaminated areas zlotnik et al 1995 high nitrate concentrations were shown to occur at all depths in the hundreds of irrigation wells in the uenrd focus area exner et al 2014 densely spaced high capacity wells likely increase vertical mixing of groundwater spalding et al 2001 nitrate concentrations in the 39 sampled irrigation wells were not significantly correlated to well depth ρ 0 01 while many studies have reported higher nitrate concentrations in shallow wells in this study the closely spaced wells their large drawdowns and multiple screened depths appear to pull the nitrate downward and homogenize the contamination with depth all 39 irrigation wells were pumping at least one hour before samples were collected by uenrd and tbnrd personnel midway during the 2013 and 2016 irrigation seasons samples for all parameters were collected in 250 ml acid washed polyethylene screw top bottles immediately placed on ice in coolers until they could be frozen and later transported on dry ice by university of nebraska personnel to lincoln where they were remained frozen until preparation for analysis nrd personnel documented their observations including manure use and unusual field conditions irrigation well data including location pumping rate total depth tables 1 2 were obtained from the nebraska department of natural resources 2 3 analytical methods samples for nitrate δ15nno3 δ18ono3 and δ18oh2o measurements were shipped overnight on dry ice to the university of waterloo s environmental isotope laboratory ei lab nitrate was measured by ion chromatography with a detection limit of 0 2 mg n l the 2013 samples were prepared for δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 isotopic analysis by precipitating no3 as agno3 silva et al 2000 δ15nno3 values were measured using an elemental analyzer isotope ratio mass spectrometer ea irms silva et al 2000 and δ18ono3 values determined by elemental analysis pyrolysis mengis et al 2001 the δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 values in the 2016 samples were determined by chemical denitrification to n2o pre concentration and analysis on a gv isoprime mass spectrometer ryabenko et al 2009 the ei lab instituted the change in methods as the denitrification method is cheaper and faster and utilizes less sample than the nitrate precipitation method with both methods δ15n and δ18o isotopic precision was 0 5 δ18oh2o was measured by isotope ratio laser spectrometry kerstel et al 1999 isotopic precision was 1 the stable isotopic n and o compositions relative to atmospheric nitrogen and v smow respectively are represented by δ15n and δ18o respectively and defined as rsample rstandard 1 1000 where r is the ratio of the two stable isotopes 15n 14n or 18o 16o concentrations of chloride which can cause interference in the silva et al 2000 method were screened in the 2013 samples using chemetrics titrets titration cell mercuric nitrate method with a range of 20 to 200 mg cl l before shipment to the ei lab concentrations in the 2016 samples were measured at the ei lab by ion chromatography the detection limit was 0 2 mg l 2 4 fertilizer use natural resources district nrd personnel reported fertilizer use for each field recent uan application rate data tables 1 2 were obtained from the annual chemigation permit issued by the local nrd and required for each pivot irrigation system applying chemicals for decades most producers liberally applied uan to their irrigated corn fields uan also is applied as a side dress and or broadcast by many producers therefore the reported amount of uan is a minimum the average annual n fertilizer application rate for the field associated with the sampled irrigation well in the tbnrd focus area and for some wells in the uenrd focus area was obtained from reports the producer must file annually for each irrigated cornfield for fields in the uenrd focus area that do not have a reporting requirement an approximate n fertilizer application rate was calculated using the county average irrigated corn yield and the commonly accepted rule of thumb that corn grain plus residual removes 1 to 1 2 lbs n bu acre of irrigated corn maddux and halverson 2008 the estimated rate likely falls short of the actual application rates the equivalent of 280 to 314 kg n ha are recommended for yields of 14 to 15 mg ha on the low organic matter sandy soils shapiro et al 2009 3 results the dim sample results are plotted with the δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 envelopes for potential n sources that could impact groundwater within the focus areas figs 2 3 the δ15nno3 values of nitrified ammonium fertilizer leachates in groundwater typically range from 4 to 4 kendall and aravena 2000 the envelope overlaps the natural soil n envelope from 3 to 8 amberger and schmidt 1987 the 10 to 10 δ18ono3 boundary for both potential n sources was determined by kendall and aravena 2000 by substituting the lower and upper ranges of soil water and atmospheric δ18o values in the formula δ18ono3 ⅔ δ18oh2o ⅓ δ18oatm for nitrification of ammonium in soils amberger and schmidt 1987 all δ18ono3 values figs 2 3 are clearly within the 10 to 10 boundaries for nitrification of ammonia shallow groundwater δ18oh2o values should typically reflect the mean weighted precipitation value clark and fritz 1997 and are used to approximate the δ18ono3 formed by soil nitrifiers aravena et al 1993 average δ18oh2o values of 9 5 and 8 5 in the groundwater of the uenrd and the tbnrd focus areas tables 1 2 respectively are in the middle of the range for mean weighted precipitation values reported by harvey and welker 2000 for north central and south central nebraska respectively using our average measured δ18oh2o and δ18ono3 values in the amberger and schmidt 1987 formula average δ18oatm values in the uenrd and tbnrd focus areas ranged from 19 to 21 and are within the 18 to 22 range reported by amberger and schmidt 1987 the δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 nitrate fertilizer envelope boundaries are 3 to 7 spalding et al 1982 and 18 to 22 amberger and schmidt 1987 respectively δ15nno3 values 10 in groundwater are indicators of animal waste sources heaton 1986 clark and fritz 1997 mengis et al 2001 böhlke et al 2002 stanton and fahlquist 2006 the 25 upper boundary encompasses the 10 to 20 range for animal manure first reported by kreitler and jones 1975 and most confined animal feeding operation cafo lagoon liquid manure the δ15nnh4 in 13 nebraska cafo lagoons ranged from 2 to 59 with only 10 of the values 10 during five sampling events in the same year while the average annual values ranged from 13 7 to 21 8 mariappan et al 2009 liquid hog manure in the san pedro and pichidegua agricultural areas of central chile ranged from 4 1 to 22 2 fernández et al 2017 in rural shijiazhaung china heavy δ15nno3 values confirmed that irrigating with wastewater contaminated groundwater as deep as 100 m chen et al 2006 δ15nno3 values from 7 to 16 suggested that human and animal wastes were major sources of groundwater nitrate contamination in the jericho area of the westbank palestine khayat et al 2006 ammonia volatilization is the main mechanism that enriches the light values found in fresh cattle urine 1 7 and manure 4 8 and pig urine 2 9 and manure 4 0 gormly and spalding 1979 to values 10 in manure and manure slurries δ15n values 13 for total reduced n in the compacted manure of feedlots indicate volatilization commences soon after manure deposition gormly and spalding 1979 nitrate n concentrations in the 18 deep irrigation wells sampled in the uenrd focus area ranged from 7 0 to 30 mg n l and averaged 20 mg n l table 1 the δ15nno3 values ranged from 1 4 to 4 8 and averaged 2 8 the δ18ono3 values ranged from 0 9 to 7 8 and averaged 2 6 except for one δ18ono3 value in the nh4 fertilizer envelope dim values were in a very narrow range fig 2 fifteen dim values were within the nitrified nh4 fertilizer source envelope five of the eight values populating the soil n envelope were in the overlap of the two envelopes all δ18ono3 values were considerably lighter than the lower δ18ono3 boundary 18 for nitrate fertilizer none of the dim values populated the nitrate fertilizer or animal waste envelopes chloride concentrations in the 2016 samples averaged 6 3 mg l with a range from 2 6 to 10 mg l nitrate n concentrations in the 21 irrigation wells in the tbnrd focus area also averaged 20 mg n l but had a wider concentration range from 6 5 to 53 mg n l table 2 the δ15nno3 values ranged from 0 3 to 7 8 and averaged 3 2 while the δ18ono3 values ranged from 1 4 to 6 8 and averaged 2 4 as in the uenrd focus area 15 dim values populated the nh4 fertilizer source envelope fig 3 five of the 11 values in the soil n envelope were in the overlap of the two source envelopes δ18ono3 values 4 0 in 19 of 21 irrigation wells suggest that most of the contamination stems from the nitrification of ammonium from fertilizer and som as in the uenrd focus area none of the dim values populated the nitrate fertilizer or animal waste envelopes chloride concentrations in the 2016 groundwater samples averaged 15 mg l with a range from 6 2 to 27 mg l 4 discussion nitrate is the most mobile form of n fertilizer and easily moves downward through the soil profile with infiltrating water its mobility is markedly faster than that of ammonium or urea which must undergo microbiological conversion to nitrate if significantly more nitrate than ammonium fertilizer preferentially leached through the highly vulnerable soils of the focus areas the δ18ono3 values would predictably be 8 and potentially approach the nitrate fertilizer envelope the results figs 2 3 clearly show that preferential leaching of nitrate fertilizer to groundwater did not occur enriched δ18ono3 values were absent in the groundwater beneath the thin coarse textured unsaturated zone of the tbnrd and the much thicker more heterogeneous finer textured unsaturated zone of the uenrd suggesting that fertilizer nitrate is not leached past the crop rooting zone the absence of identifiable nitrate fertilizer in groundwater beneath nitrate fertilized crops supports the early findings of aravena et al 1993 only one well 170994 in table 1 in the uenrd had identifiable uan nitrate fig 2 the heavier 7 8 δ18ono3 value together with the relatively light 2 1 δ15nno3 value may reflect direct uan transport either by backflow or by downward movement possibly from a leaking storage tank along the unsealed well casing if uan directly entered the groundwater 25 would be nitrate n and 75 nitrified ammonium n and urea n and the δ18ono3 fraction would be 8 if all the ammonium and urea were converted to nitrate in the groundwater and uan was the only n fertilizer applied further source analysis in the investigated areas is dependent upon the presence of denitrification which was not expected in the highly oxygenated groundwater and sprinkler irrigation return flows enrichment of both isotopes during denitrification is reflected in a positive δ18ono3 δ15nno3 slope an enrichment slope of 0 5 has been confirmed both by theoretical based computations chen and macquarrie 2005 seiler 2005 and field studies böttcher et al 1990 aravena and robertson 1998 mengis et al 1999 devito et al 2000 fukada et al 2004 seiler 2005 singleton et al 2007 the slightly negative slope 0 18 ρ 0 01 for the dim values in the uenrd focus area fig 2 clearly is not characteristic of di enrichment during denitrification thus fractionation via denitrification appears very limited to non existent in the thick heterotrophic unsaturated zone beneath much of the uenrd focus area and the dim values should be reliable indicators of n sources fractionation via denitrification would be even less likely in the sandy soils relatively thin unsaturated zone and highly oxygenated groundwater that characterize the tbnrd focus area in a dim investigation at hastings nebraska 40 km southeast of the tbnrd focus area denitrification was not evident in oxygenated groundwater samples beneath thick fine textured irrigated soils spalding et al 2018 the slope m 0 45 for the di enrichment in the 21 tbnrd focus area samples fig 3 suggests denitrification the data fig 4 ρ 0 01 however do not show the decrease in nitrate concentration that occurs as the δ15nno3 enrichment proceeds during denitrification the conflicting interpretations likely reflect statistical bias introduced in the di vector from the single enriched sample that is an outlier in both location and surface hydrology the slope m 0 29 of the di vector without the outlier well 220269 table 2 di values does not support denitrification thus the tbnrd focus area isotopic results do not appear compromised by fractionation via denitrification denitrification known to occur in riparian groundwater immediately adjacent to streams and rivers cey et al 1999 devito et al 2000 and in areas contaminated by labile organic matter usually from sewage and animal wastes spalding et al 1993 aravena and robertson 1998 is a possible source of enrichment in well 220269 table 2 the well is by far the closest 0 4 km of the 21 wells to the platte river fig 1 and it is adjacent to a drainage ditch filled with standing water throughout the growing season manure from cattle wintered on corn stubble and the well s elevated chloride concentration 27 mg l suggest the infiltration of animal waste ritter and churnside 1990 karr et al 2001 showers et al 2008 the dim values δ15nno3 7 8 δ18ono3 6 8 could be enriched by several factors or a combination of them they include capture of platte river riparian zone groundwater during pumping infiltration of partially denitrified ditch water infiltration of manure nitrate and infiltration of enriched δ18oh2o from evaporate in the ditch although soil nitrogen is depicted as a major source of groundwater nitrate in the biplots of both focus areas figs 2 3 mineralized soil contributions in these areas are considerably less than those from n fertilizer most of the labile natural soil n from these sandy soils 1 som probably was released a few years after the virgin sod was broken higher organic matter fine textured soils silt loams in central nebraska north of the platte river released most of their labile soil n from som within the first years of cultivation reinhorn and avnimelech 1974 gormly and spalding 1979 n fertilization of these soils has increased the aqueous extractable nitrate three fold and after 60 years of irrigation and cultivation mineralization of som from these silt loams was determined an insignificant source of nitrate in groundwater gormly and spalding 1979 with considerably less natural som and half a century of irrigated corn production in the focus areas mineralization of som residue during the growing season equates to 22 kg n som ha maddux and halverson 2008 and is much less than the 225 kg n ha yr applied as fertilizer in a dim investigation at hastings several di results were in the soil n envelope the flat linear increase in δ15nno3 values into the animal waste envelope together with the n fertilizer signatures in very shallow borehole groundwater beneath irrigated cropland suggested that soil derived nitrate leachates did not significantly impact the groundwater spalding et al 2018 the much thinner 2 m versus 20 m coarser and lower organic matter irrigated soils in the tbnrd and uenrd focus areas are not likely contributors of soil derived n since natural soil n is not a significant n source and denitrification is not blurring the isotopic identity of the sources the heavier δ15nno3 values outside the ammonium fertilizer envelope figs 2 3 likely reflect a mixture of ammonium fertilizer and a heavier n source small contributions of nitrified manure leachate with δ15nno3 values from 10 to 25 could easily explain enrichments of 2 potential sources of small amounts of manure n include the winter grazing of cattle on crop stubble and in the tbnrd focus area the application of manure to some fields leachate from nitrified ammonium in manure is a logical suspect in the δ15nno3 enriched sample 4 8 fig 2 from well 190116 where the producer reported wintering cattle on the field s corn stubble manure leachate is suspected in two other wells with slightly enriched 4 2 and 4 8 δ15nno3 values in the uenrd focus area producers and or nrd personnel reported animal waste on the fields adjacent to four of the five irrigation wells with slightly enriched 4 6 to 6 9 δ15nno3 values fig 3 in the tbnrd focus area cattle were winter grazed and manure appears to have been applied to the field adjacent to well 24165 table 2 both the enriched δ15nno3 value of 6 9 and elevated chloride concentration 21 mg l can be indicative of animal waste the same producer used similar practices adjacent to well 78 175 with a δ15nno3 value of 4 6 cattle also were wintered and manure occasionally spread on the fields adjacent to wells 21 436 and 16 168 which had δ15nno3 values of 5 9 and 4 8 respectively thus a mixture of ammonium fertilizer and manure derived nitrate likely is responsible for the slightly enriched δ15nno3 values within the soil n envelope figs 2 3 this is consistent with the results described in spalding et al 2018 that clearly showed that both nitrified ammonium leachates from commercial fertilizer and feedlot associated animal waste applied to irrigated cropland were drawn into the capture zones of several downgradient municipal wells in hastings nebraska while manure appears as a minor source of nitrate contamination in both areas nitrification of ammonium fertilizer is the dominant source of most nitrate in the groundwater of both focus areas the irrigation practices and n loading sandy soils and sandy unsaturated zones and oxic saturated zones in the investigated areas are similar to those found in western kansas and oklahoma mcmahon 2001 and in much of the area underlain by the central high plains aquifer mcmahon et al 2003 where nitrified ammonium fertilizer is the dominant source of groundwater contamination 5 conclusions our results suggest that the dim provides a better appreciation of the complexities of the n cycle in the soil rooting zone beneath fields that have received heavy uan applications for many years hypotheses for the absence of isotopically identifiable nitrate in the groundwater are crop removal and or chemical alteration in the biologically active irrigated root zone possibly timely uan application results in rapid uptake of the nitrate fraction within the root zone if correct this interpretation has major implications for best management practices more nitrate spoon feeding through irrigation systems and less urea and ammonium fertilization could be warranted the dim results suggest that application of nitrate using uan is for the most part a beneficial nitrogen management practice in seasonally warm bacterially active soil however nitrate could be immobilized reduced to organic n mineralized to ammonium and in aerobic soils nitrified remobilized back to nitrate mengis et al 2001 in this process the original atmospheric o2 would be replaced by soil water and atmospheric o2 and the oxygen isotope fingerprint in the nitrate would be lost as the oxygen isotopes in the subsequently mineralized nitrate would be isotopically indistinguishable from those in nitrified ammonium fertilizer both hypotheses demonstrate that in most agricultural settings application of the dim to identify nitrate fertilizer in groundwater is questionable although sandy soils have low organic matter and high leaching potential improved water management through sprinkler irrigation systems could increase nitrate fertilizer retention in the root zone and allow uptake and or immobilization to occur studies using isotopically labeled no3 on sandy soils during summer are needed to clarify whether nitrate immobilization and remobilization mask nitrate source identification the dim results indicate that denitrification is not a significant isotope fractionation mechanism in most of the groundwater samples and suggest that reliance on denitrification to reduce nitrate loading to aquifers in irrigated agricultural settings with thick coarse and or fine textured soils could be wishful thinking the elimination of denitrification and the lack of residual natural soil n leachates allowed identification of cattle manure as a minor source of δ15nno3 enrichment in a few samples the dim clearly showed that nitrified ammonium fertilizers are the primary source of nitrate in the groundwater beneath both focus areas acknowledgments we appreciate the patience of roch gaussoin and richard ferguson department of agronomy and horticulture in allowing the expenditure of funds from pre retirement accounts to complete this isotopic investigation 
1621,methods to remediate soil and groundwater contamination at former manufactured gas plant fmgp sites are scarce the objective of this study was to investigate the ability of two chemical oxidants persulfate and permanganate to degrade fmgp residuals in a dynamic system representative of in situ conditions a series of physical model trials supported by aqueous and slurry batch experiments using impacted sediments collected from a fmgp site were conducted to explore treatment expectations a screening model constrained by the experimental data was employed the results from the aqueous experiments showed that dissolved components except for benzene were readily degraded by persulfate or permanganate in the well mixed slurry systems when contact with the oxidant was achieved 95 45 and 30 of the initial mass quantified was degraded by permanganate unactivated persulfate and alkaline activated persulfate respectively in stark contrast the total mass removed in the physical model trials was negligible for both permanganate and persulfate irrespective of the bleb or lense architecture used hence the net benefit of flushing 6 pore volumes of permanganate or persulfate at a concentration of 30 g l under the physical model operating conditions was minimal to achieve a substantial degradation of mass within the treatment system 40 results from the screening model indicated that the hydraulic resident time would need to be 10 days and the average lumped mass transfer coefficient increased by two orders of magnitude results from long term 5 years simulations showed that the dissolved concentrations of organic compounds are reduced temporarily as a result of the presence of permanganate but then rebound to a profile that is essentially coincident with a no treatment scenario following exposure to permanganate neither a lower velocity nor higher permanganate dosing affected the long term behavior of the dissolved phase concentrations however increasing the mass transfer rate coefficient had an impact the findings from this investigation indicate that the efficiency of permanganate or persulfate to treat for fmgp residuals is mass transfer limited keywords coal tar mgp persulfate permanganate mass transfer treatment end points long term expectations 1 introduction prior to 1950 thousands of manufacturing plants produced a combustible gas from coke coal or oil that was used in urban environments for lighting heating and cooking hatheway 2012 due to poor process operations and residual management practices there currently exists serious soil and groundwater contamination problems at many of these former manufactured gas plant fmgp sites cassidy et al 2015 wang et al 2015 hauswirth et al 2012 usepa 1999 fmgp residuals are usually found in the subsurface as non aqueous phase liquids napls that are typically denser and more viscous relative to water and are composed of hundreds to thousands of organic compounds mueller et al 1989 based on observations from various site characterization efforts the in situ architecture of these coal tar napls range from sheens stains tar blebs and tar coatings to saturated lenses or pools despite vast advancements in analytical methods it is currently only possible to quantify a portion of the organic compounds present in fmgp coal tars and even the analysis of this identified portion is extremely complicated birak and miller 2009 moreover the composition of fmgp tars varies between sites due to differences in source material and processing operations birak and miller 2009 luthy et al 1994 when fmgp tars are initially exposed to groundwater the more soluble compounds will gradually be depleted over time a phenomenon called aging or weathering and the higher molecular weight compounds which are generally the less soluble compounds will remain in the napl the presence of these fmgp tars in subsurface environments may pose a long term threat to groundwater quality and potentially human health if left untreated or if potential exposure pathways are not appropriately addressed remediation initiatives at many fmgp sites have been limited to isolation solidification or removal of the source materials usepa 2013 birak and miller 2009 luthy et al 1994 over the last 15 years in situ chemical oxidation isco has been growing steadily as a remediation technology used to treat a range of environmentally relevant contaminants siegrist et al 2011 although different types of chemical oxidants have been employed persulfate and permanganate are the two most frequently used as they are typically more persistent in subsurface systems petri et al 2011a 2011b usepa 2006 since chemical oxidation has been shown to successfully degrade a number of the dissolved organic compounds typically present at fmgp sites polyaromatic hydrocarbons pahs benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes btex sra et al 2013 forsey et al 2010 it is speculated that it could be a beneficial technology to treat fmgp tars in situ published studies dealing with the chemical oxidation of fmgp residuals have been diverse in scope with varied and often conflicting results table 1 provides a comprehensive summary of published bench scale studies which have used either persulfate or permanganate to degrade fmgp residuals in batch i e well mixed slurry or column systems some of the investigations detailed in table 1 have used impacted aquifer or river sediments collected from fmgp sites while others have used soils spiked with a mgp napl peng et al 2016 usman et al 2012 brown et al 2003 although spiked soil studies provide valuable insight into the chemical reactivity of different oxidants to attack mgp residuals the use of impacted materials collected from fmgp sites better represents the in situ chemical composition employing a series of batch experiments usman et al 2012 observed that magnetite activated persulfate was able to degrade 70 to 80 of the total pahs paht in spiked sand but when a fmgp soil was used no pah mass was removed in contrast cassidy et al 2015 reported mass removal of 55 to 65 using alkaline activated persulfate 37 g l in a batch system for soil material with an initial btex concentration of 0 58 g kg and a paht concentration of 3 06 g kg sum of 18 compounds nadim et al 2005 observed between 75 and 100 paht removal 7 compounds using iron activated persulfate 5 g l for a less impacted soil 0 01 g kg paht only a few studies have directly compared the effectiveness of different chemical oxidants to degrade organic mixtures lemaire et al 2013 ferrarese et al 2008 rivas 2006 gates anderson et al 2001 for example ferrarese et al 2008 identified that a 158 g l permanganate solution and a 120 g l persulfate solution were able to degrade 96 and 88 of the paht present in impacted soil with an initial paht concentration of 2 8 g kg respectively batch systems normally provide the most ideal environment to maximize treatment due to high oxidant dosing mass of oxidant mass of contaminant maximum contact between the oxidant and the napl well mixed and long reaction or residence times in contrast column systems are often considered more representative of a dynamic subsurface situation where preferential pathways exist there is less direct oxidant contact with the napl and the residence time is controlled by the flow system for example despite a paht removal of 47 14 compounds in a series of batch experiments richardson et al 2011 observed no reduction in pah mass from column experiments using a heat activated persulfate system in spite of a relatively low paht concentration of 0 3 g kg in comparison hauswirth and miller 2014 performed column experiments using fmgp impacted soils initial paht concentration of 1 99 g kg of tar 25 compounds and reported a 53 removal of paht after injecting 52 pore volumes pvs of a 50 g l alkaline activated persulfate solution since a typical field injection event is 1 pv huling et al 2017 crimi et al 2011 this high number of pvs is impractical at most field sites and hence the results from this column experiment should be viewed as highly optimistic in addition to the ability of chemical oxidants to degrade multi component napls such as fmgp residuals aquifer material and napl architecture in part dictate contaminant availability and consequently treatment effectiveness zhang et al 2007 the napl surface area to volume ratio is much less for a lense or pool architecture compared to bleb architecture and hence the relative surface or contact area is lower powers et al 1994a moreover the aqueous hydraulic conductivity is reduced within regions with a lense architecture and thus the ability to flush remedial fluids into these areas is limited zhang et al 2008 this will restrict the efficiency of a chemical oxidation system and in such conditions multiple injection episodes to effectively degrade the napl are required petri et al 2011a due to complex entrapment and multicomponent aspects of fmgp residuals it is generally not possible to remove all of the napl mass during treatment with a chemical oxidant soga et al 2004 for example thomson et al 2008 monitored the short term months and long term years behaviour of a plume originated from a multi component napl source zone after treatment with permanganate they concluded that while the short term organic compound concentrations were reduced significantly there was rebound of all of the monitored compounds after four years post treatment hence predicting the long term behaviour of dissolved phase concentrations following chemical oxidation treatment is necessary for the evaluation of post treatment expectations and risk assessment the few studies that have investigated the long term behavior of dissolved phase concentrations from fmgp residuals have indicated that dissolution kinetics depends on napl composition and the time scale for complete removal can vary between weeks to more than thousands of years for different napl architectures eberhardt and grathwohl 2002 based on the current literature table 1 it is unclear what the dissolved phase concentration behaviour is following treatment of fmgp tars with different napl architectures by various chemical oxidants the objective of this study was to investigate the performance of two chemical oxidants sodium persulfate na2s2o8 and potassium permanganate kmno4 to degrade fmgp residuals in a continuous flow system representative of in situ conditions specifically the focus was on the ability of each oxidant to remove fmgp residual mass and the impact on the dissolved phase concentrations following treatment supported by aqueous and slurry batch experiments a series of physical model trials were conducted using impacted sediments collected from a fmgp site the aqueous experiments focused on the ability of permanganate and three persulfate systems to degrade impacted groundwater collected from a fmgp site at both low and high initial oxidant concentrations in contrast the slurry experiments were used to quantify the potential of permanganate and three persulfate systems to remove mass from aquifer sediments containing fmgp residuals each physical model was subjected to three oxidant flushing episodes 6 pvs in total and the effluent was sampled between each episode at the termination of each trial sediment samples were collected from the physical model and analyzed for a suite of organic compounds to determine mass removed a simple single cell screening model constrained by the experimental results was used to investigate treatment expectations and the potential long term behaviour of dissolved phase concentrations as a result of treatment using these chemical oxidants 2 materials and methods 2 1 aquifer materials and napl impacted groundwater and fmgp residuals used in this study were obtained from the former west florida natural gas company site located in ocala florida from the late 1890s until about 1953 water gas or carbureted water gas was manufactured at this location by the lowe carbonization process or destructive distillation of bituminous coal and coke according to brown s directory of north american gas companies 1964 gas production was 48 103 m3 yr in 1900 and steadily increased to 900 103 m3 yr by 1950 in 1952 manufacturing stopped at the plant and the facility converted to the sale of butane propane air residues from the mgp process including tars and oily wastewaters were deposited in the area of the former gas plant facilities during operations there was an historic coal tar pit or area where residual tars were stored prior to sale for off site use as roofing materials groundwater samples were collected in 1000 ml amber glass containers from two monitoring wells screened from 19 8 to 21 3 and 36 0 to 39 6 m below ground surface bgs utilizing a low flow 0 2 l min purge sampling technique the samples were placed in coolers maintained at 4 c and transported to the university of waterloo where they were stored in a walk in refrigerator at 4 c during extensive drilling activities at the site both impacted and non impacted aquifer materials were collected from a weathered limestone unit using rotosonic drilling methods cores were recovered in 1 5 m runs using a 10 2 cm diameter core barrel with a button carbide drill bit core materials assigned as impacted weathered limestone unit material and non impacted weathered limestone unit material collected from inside the delineated source zone were used in this investigation the weathered limestone unit is part of an erosional surface of the miocene age and its composition includes clayey limestone sandy limestone and limey clay impacted aquifer material was immediately transferred into 500 ml glass jars sealed with a self sealing lid held in place with a metal screw top ring and stored on site in a freezer at 20 c see fig sm 1 a in the supplementary material sm section non impacted aquifer material was stored in polyethylene bags fig sm 1 b samples of impacted aquifer material were collected from two boreholes and are representative of depths ranging from 10 to 30 m bgs while non impacted aquifer materials were collected from five boreholes and are representative of depths ranging from 15 to 20 m bgs sufficient core materials were express shipped to the university of waterloo on ice samples of the impacted aquifer materials were stored at 40 c while samples of the non impacted aquifer materials were stored at 4 c the inventory of impacted aquifer materials received was visually inspected and separated into two categories based on napl presence lower impacted aquifer materials were reserved for the slurry treatability and the bleb architecture physical model experiments while the higher impacted aquifer materials were reserved for the saturated lense architecture physical model experiments fig sm 2 a napl sample density of 1 04 g cm3 collected from a well screened from 24 to 27 m bgs within the weathered limestone was submitted to alpha analytical laboratories westborough ma for analyses of btex total petroleum hydrocarbons tph and pahs a summary of these results are listed in table sm 1 and indicate that 34 of the napl mass was quantified 66 of the napl mass was unidentified consistent with the composition of other fmgp napls e g brown et al 2006 the most abundant compounds in the quantified portion of the napl are naphthalene 24 6 2 methylnaphthalene 13 7 1 methylnaphthalene 7 5 and acenaphthene 3 9 the benzene concentration represented 0 8 of the quantified portion of the napl for illustrative purposes in this paper we chose to report on the behaviour of naphthalene acenaphthene and benzene naphthalene and acenaphthene as a result of their higher napl concentration and benzene since it is typically a risk driver 2 2 natural oxidant interaction naturally occurring reductants and catalysts can be reactive and thus influence oxidant persistence typically the role of the dissolved groundwater species is overshadowed by the aquifer solids inorganic species containing iron fe manganese mn sulfur s and the natural organic matter nom associated with the aquifer solids are of concern the possibility of multiple inorganic species as well as a range of nom creates an extremely heterogeneous environment in which reactions may occur the result of the interaction between an oxidant and aquifer material leads to either an increase in the consumption of the oxidant by the aquifer solids or an enhancement in the oxidant decomposition rate when an oxidant is consumed by the aquifer solids the reactive species associated with the aquifer solids are finite and hence there exists a finite consumption or natural oxidant demand nod once the maximum nod is satisfied there is minimal additional oxidant aquifer material interaction and thus any additional oxidant delivered is available to interact with the contaminant conversely an enhancement in the oxidant decomposition rate implies that there is infinite interaction capacity available to capture these behavioral differences and the associated underlying processes for all oxidant behavior the term natural oxidant interaction noi is used rather than nod noi tests were used to estimate the potential in situ interaction of persulfate and permanganate with non impacted aquifer materials from three 3 representative locations for these noi tests the oxidant mass to solids ratio ranged from 5 to 40 g kg nominal noi tests were conducted for three persulfate systems 1 unactivated persulfate 2 chelated ferrous iron activated persulfate and 3 alkaline activated persulfate details of the experimental procedures employed are provided in the sm section 2 3 aqueous treatability experiments since the chemical oxidation of organic compounds occurs in the aqueous phase experiments were conducted using impacted groundwater exposed to permanganate or persulfate unactivated ferrous iron activated 300 mg l fe ii 0 5 mol citric acid mol fe ii or alkaline activated to determine aqueous degradation characteristics a suite of five 5 tests was executed in well mixed 20 ml batch reactors each test was performed in triplicate at a low 5 g l and a high 30 g l oxidant concentration in conjunction with experimental controls i e impacted groundwater and 0 2 ml of 10 nan3 and impacted groundwater adjusted with naoh to an initial ph of 11 impacted groundwater was added to each reactor followed by the activator solution if required and then the oxidant initial reactor solution volumes were adjusted with milli q water as required to ensure the same dilution of groundwater across all tests reactors were shaken gently by hand at least daily and left in the dark at an ambient temperature of 20 c aliquots of the solution were taken after a reaction period of 1 4 8 15 and 30 days and analyzed for the concentrations of a suite of 28 organic compounds table sm 4 and the oxidant the solution ph was also determined 2 4 slurry treatability experiments a series of experiments were performed to capture the ability of the various oxidant systems permanganate and persulfate to degrade impacted aquifer sediments the impacted weathered limestone unit material selected for these slurry treatability experiments were opened emptied onto a sterilized tray and homogenized minimal milli q water was added as required to improve mixing large size particles that were not suitable for the reactor design were removed by hand during mixing random samples from the homogenized mixture were used without additional alteration prior to filling the reactors five 5 sub samples from the homogenized mixture were collected and used to establish the initial bulk soil concentrations a 75 g random sample of the impacted sediments was added to a 125 ml reactor followed by a 30 g l oxidant solution permanganate unactivated persulfate and alkaline activated persulfate to achieve an oxidant mass to solids ratio of 30 g kg nominal all reactors were constructed in replicates 4 and constantly mixed on a shaker table in the dark at an ambient temperature of 20 c every 7 days for a 35 day period the oxidant concentration and ph were determined and a random sediment sub sample from each reactor was collected and analyzed to determine bulk soil concentrations if the results from a sampling episode indicated that the oxidant concentration was depleted additional oxidant mass was added to achieve a solution concentration of 30 g l 2 5 physical model experiments for the purpose of the evaluation conducted in this study we assumed that napl architecture that is characterized as sheens staining tar blebs and tar coatings have a similar architecture with respect to the ability of a reagent solution to interact with the napl when these napl forms are present in a permeable setting there is a good likelihood of contact between the reagent solution and the napl however when the napl is present as a napl saturated lense the ratio of napl surface area to volume is significantly smaller and reagent napl contact becomes problematic the series of small scale physical model experiments performed were designed with the intention to capture the two napl architecture end points blebs and tar coatings and saturated lenses the physical model was a 7 7 cm long flow through chamber with a cross sectional area of 8 37 cm2 3 1 2 7 cm fig 1 the influent and effluent ends of the chamber were packed with a 0 8 cm long zone of glass beads diameter 1 6 mm and a 20 stainless steel mesh to act as a flow distributor the remaining 6 1 cm length was wet packed with impacted aquifer sediments the chamber was sufficiently filled that when the lid was fastened it compressed the chamber contents ensuring a seal between the top of the chamber contents and the bottom of the lid to eliminate short circuiting of injected fluids for the bleb system impacted materials were packed gradually in several 0 5 cm thick layers into the central portion of the physical model for the saturated lense system impacted samples were emptied directly into the bottom of the physical model to a depth of 1 5 cm and the upper 1 5 cm portion of the chamber was then packed with non impacted material from the same borehole during the filling process five sub samples were taken and used to establish the initial bulk soil concentrations this system was then saturated with degassed milli q water and allowed to equilibrate for 7 days following the 7 day equilibration period flow was initiated at a nominal rate of 0 017 ml min approximate linear velocity of 10 cm day a peristaltic pump was connected to the influent end and a constant hydraulic head control was established at the outlet end an in line sampling system allowed aqueous samples to be collected from the effluent as required a tracer test using nabr was performed on each model system to ensure hydraulic consistency and packing following the tracer test three oxidant injection episodes were performed between each episode degassed milli q water was used to remove remnant oxidant from the system and facilitate the collection of aqueous effluent samples for analysis of organic compounds specifically each physical model system was operated in the following sequence of steps 1 one pv of degassed milli q water was injected to displace the pore water and allowed to equilibrate in the system for 7 days 2 three to four pvs of 100 mg l degassed nabr solution were injected during the tracer test effluent samples were collected every 4 h 3 at the end of the tracer test an effluent sample was collected to establish a baseline effluent organic compound concentration signature 4 two pvs of oxidant permanganate or persulfate at a concentration of 30 g l were injected during each oxidant injection episode the effluent was sampled at least 4 times for electrical conductivity ec ph and oxidant concentration 5 three pvs of degassed milli q water were injected the system effluent was monitored for ec ph and oxidant concentration during the initial 2 pvs to ensure remnant oxidant was removed from the system during the third pv an effluent sample was collected to determine the concentration of organic compounds in the effluent 6 steps 4 and 5 were then repeated twice more 3 oxidant injection episodes in total 7 when the experimental test was concluded the chamber lid was removed and three sub samples equally spaced along the length of the chamber were collected to establish post treatment bulk soil concentrations for the saturated lense system the sub samples were collected only from the lower 1 5 cm portion of the chamber that contained impacted material the sampling protocol followed in step 5 was adopted since the results from a series of preliminary experiments showed that when persulfate or permanganate was present in the effluent from the physical model the concentration of the organic compounds of interest were mdl for example see table sm 5 additionally our focus was on the rebound of the dissolved phase concentrations following treatment since this behavior is of interest to remediation practitioners and regulatory agencies thomson et al 2008 mcguire et al 2006 since the system pv and porosity was unknown at the start of each experiment a nominal pv of 19 33 ml was used this nominal pv was estimated from a porosity of 0 3 determined from a set of preliminary experiments and the packed chamber volume of 64 45 ml 7 7 cm 2 7 cm 3 1 cm the nominal hydraulic residence time was 20 h four physical systems were constructed for the bleb architecture and four systems for the saturated lense architecture permanganate 30 g l was used for two bleb systems identified as pm bleb 1 and pm bleb 2 and two saturated lense systems identified as pm lense 1 and pm lense 2 persulfate 30 g l was used for the remaining two bleb systems identified as ps bleb 1 and ps bleb 2 and two saturated lense systems identified as ps lense 1 and ps lense 2 based on the results from the aqueous and slurry batch experiments persulfate activator systems were not investigated in addition two systems were constructed as experimental controls and identified as co bleb and co lense the experimental controls received only degassed milli q water the oxidant concentration 30 g l was selected to mimic a potential concentration for a site where density driven advection of the injected oxidant solution is of

organic components in the aquifer sediment an 8 g sub sample was added directly to 10 ml of dcm and shaken for 18 h samples were allowed to settle and 1 ml of the dcm was transferred to a 2 0 ml

mdl for each quantified compound determined in the aqueous or sediment phase is presented in table sm 4 using these analytical methods we are able to track 28 compounds or 27 of the compounds in the napl mass table sm 1 the behaviour of the compounds that comprise the other 70 of the napl mass is unknown permanganate concentration was determined by spectrophotometry thermo scientific genesys 10s uv vis at 525 nm mdl of 1 3 mg l the spectrophotometer was calibrated prior to each sampling episode with a calibration curve 1 to 100 mg l generated using standardized solutions persulfate analysis

dionex chromeleon software and the mdl was 0 5 mg l an orion ph meter model 290a and ec meter model a122 were used to measure ph and electrical conductivity 2 7 screening model to explore expectations for the treatment of fmgp residuals by chemical oxidants a single cell screening model was employed in this model a specified mass and composition of napl is assumed to be present within the sediment and the aqueous phase is presumed completely mixed the inlet oxidant concentration is prescribed and the effluent concentrations of the known soluble constituents are estimated from mass balance considerations the objective of this idealized modeling effort was to provide insight into treatment expectations under different operating conditions then those employed in the physical model experiments and over longer time scales it was not our intent to simulate in situ conditions but rather to investigate what might be possible under ideal circumstances and hence yield the most optimistic predictor of field behavior this screening model was deemed an appropriate tool to satisfy this requirement the mass balance of the individual soluble napl constituents is given by 1 dc k

stoichiometric mass ratio defined as the mass of oxidant consumed per mass of constituent degraded and γnoi is the rate of oxidant mass lost to the natural oxidant interaction sink reactions details of a representative γnoi expression for permanganate are provided by xu and thomson 2009 and for persulfate by sra et al 2010 eqs 1 and 6 are coupled and must be solved in association with eqs 2 to 4 numerically the following attributes are inherent in this screening model i a completely mixed system i e no preferential flow pathways and infinite dispersion ii mineralization of organic compounds iii the generation of by products e g manganese oxides carbon dioxide are ignored and iv there are no diffusion limitations within the napl 3 results and discussion 3 1 batch experiments the noi profiles average of replicates for the selected un impacted aquifer materials are presented in fig sm 3 for the three 3 aquifer materials tested the maximum observed consumption of permanganate expressed as nod after 30 days of exposure ranged from of 2 to 5 g kg the system ph remained stable between 8 and 9 the permanganate nod manifested in these batch experiments as an initial rapid increase until day 7 nod7 followed by a minor increase until day 30 as it asymptotically approached nodmax fig sm 3 a the variations between the six series of experiments indicated that consistent with xu and thomson 2009 a higher initial permanganate concentration as well as oxidant to solids mass ratio m ox s yielded a higher nodmax and a faster permanganate consumption rate for all three of the persulfate systems evaluated fig sm 3 b d there was very little loss of persulfate mass 10 after the 30 day reaction period except for the aquifer materials from one borehole location identified as sample 1 where the maximum change in persulfate concentration was 7 g l 17 5 decrease the stability of persulfate in the presence of these aquifer materials implies that there is minimal noi and hence persulfate should be persistent in situ the data generated from the aqueous treatability experiments indicated that all of the 17 dissolved phase compounds detected in the impacted groundwater were readily degraded with persulfate or permanganate except for benzene to mdl by day 10 for the high 30 g l oxidant concentration systems see fig 2 for benzene naphthalene and acenaphthene as expected the observed reaction rates for the dissolved phase compounds for the low 5 g l oxidant concentration systems were slower while the oxidant concentration was in excess in all the high oxidant concentration systems oxidant consumption followed the order iron activated persulfate permanganate persulfate alkaline activated persulfate except for benzene the order of reactivity of the remaining 16 quantified organic compounds was iron activated persulfate permanganate persulfate alkaline activated persulfate despite the fact that it was never the intention of these aqueous treatability experiments to generate data that could be used to develop kinetic rate coefficients a comprehensive analysis of the data was undertaken in an attempt to estimate second order reaction rate coefficients for all 17 compounds as expected due to limited temporal data 2 4 data points for some compounds the results yielded only sporadic values and thus no rate coefficients are reported temporal oxidant and the bulk soil concentration profiles for benzene naphthalene and acenaphthene from the slurry experimental systems are shown in fig 3 although all attempts were made to homogenize the impacted materials prior to adding them to the reactors there was some variability in the initial bulk soil concentrations of subsamples collected from the stock supply of impacted sediments and those emplaced in each reactor the oxidant mass in the permanganate slurry reactors was replenished at day 7 and day 14 while the oxidant mass in the unactivated persulfate and alkaline activated persulfate slurry reactors was replenished only at day 7 following replenishment permanganate continued to be depleted while the concentration of persulfate remained elevated compared to either of the persulfate systems explored permanganate was more effective in treating pahs e g naphthalene 1 methylnaphthalene 2 methylnaphthalene and acenaphthene over the 35 day reaction period for the permanganate unactivated persulfate and alkaline activated persulfate systems it was estimated that 95 45 and 30 of the initial mass quantified was degraded respectively these values are consistent with the spectrum of mass removal reported by others using batch systems with either permanganate or persulfate see table 1 the overall bulk stoichiometry for these slurry experiments was estimated as the ratio of permanganate or persulfate consumed to the quantified mass degraded these estimates corrected for noi varied from 100 g kmno4 g for the permanganate system and 95 g nas2o8 g for the unactivated persulfate system to 150 g nas2o8 g for the alkaline activated persulfate system these stoichiometric values are consistent in magnitude with those reported by sra et al 2013 for the total petroleum hydrocarbon tph of dissolved gasoline degraded by various persulfate systems this data set provides insight into the ability of the investigated oxidant systems to destroy mass present in impacted aquifer materials under ideal conditions i e well mixed excess oxidant long contact time and hence are the most optimistic 3 2 physical models after 1 to 2 pvs of nabr injection the effluent concentration of bromide reached 50 of the injected concentration 100 mg l and after 3 to 4 pvs reached 100 for all physical models based on the tracer breakthrough profiles the effective porosity for co bleb and co lense was 0 26 and 0 38 respectively and ranged from 0 27 to 0 38 for the treatment bleb physical models and from 0 33 to 0 36 for the treatment lense physical models for the control systems co bleb and co lense the effluent ph was steady between 7 5 and 8 and the ec was minimal 300 μs cm as expected the concentrations of the detectable organic compounds in the effluent from both control systems were relatively constant except for a notable decrease in the concentration of benzene the final bulk soil concentrations were essentially unchanged from the initial soil concentrations except for benzene benzene was quickly depleted from the system as a result of a higher solubility and lower initial soil concentration compared to other compounds for both permanganate systems pm bleb and pm lense the average naphthalene and acenaphthene effluent concentrations following each oxidant injection episode 2 pvs episode decreased fig 4a b see fig sm 4 for benzene in contrast the average naphthalene and acenaphthene effluent concentrations following each oxidant injection episode 2 pvs episode for the persulfate systems either remained relatively constant ps bleb or increased ps lense fig 4c d these trends were generally consistent for the other monitored compounds except for benzene that remained relatively constant following each persulfate injection episode in the ps bleb and ps lense systems fig sm 4 the average maximum permanganate effluent concentration was 15 g l during the first injection episode and increased to 17 g l during the second and third injection episodes for the pm bleb physical models and was 17 g l during the first injection episode and 20 g l during the second and third injection episodes for the pm lense systems the average maximum persulfate effluent concentration for the ps bleb physical models was 23 g l during the first injection episode and increased to 25 g l during the second and third injection episodes for the ps lense physical models the average maximum persulfate effluent concentration was 25 g l for all injection episodes the significant reduction of the effluent permanganate or persulfate concentration to near the mdl during the injection of 3 pvs of degassed milli q water see fig sm 5 indicated that remnant oxidant was removed from the experimental system prior to collection of the effluent sample for analyses of organic compounds the effluent ec profiles were consistent with the permanganate or persulfate effluent profiles the effluent ph for the pm bleb physical models increased from 7 3 to 9 5 with minor decreases when permanganate was present in the system in contrast the effluent ph for the pm lense physical models oscillated between 7 6 and 9 4 the effluent ph remained relatively stable at 7 9 for the ps belb and 7 6 for the ps lense systems an evaluation of the initial and final bulk soil concentration data indicated that there was no statistically significant reduction in the total quantifiable mass for all treatment systems at the 5 level of significance it is suspected that any decrease in mass was masked by the inherent variability in the soil sub sampling procedure used and the contaminant heterogeneity present in the physical models the minor decreases observed in the effluent concentrations following each oxidant injection episode at least for the permanganate systems fig 4a b indicate that 6 pvs of oxidant treatment had perhaps a minor impact on mass removal but it was not statistically significant the insignificant mass removal observed in these physical model systems is consistent with the findings from richardson et al 2011 who observed no reduction in pah mass from column experiments using a heat activated persulfate system see table 1 in contrast hauswirth and miller 2014 observed 53 removal in a column experiment after injecting 52 pvs of a 50 g l alkaline activated persulfate solution oxidant dose of 330 g g paht compared to the order of magnitude smaller oxidant dose of 10 g g paht used in this study oxidant mass balance calculations for the bleb systems indicated that 50 and 17 of the permanganate and persulfate mass injected was consumed respectively while for the lense systems 35 and 19 of the permanganate and persulfate mass injected was consumed respectively hence while persulfate consumption was similar in the bleb and lense systems permanganate consumption in the bleb systems was more significant and can be attributed to higher napl aqueous phase contact area during the 3 oxidant injection episodes 6 pvs total elevated oxidant concentrations 5 g l were present for a total residence or contact time of 8 days the oxidant resident time was controlled by the flow rate which was established to yield a moderate linear velocity of 10 cm day it was not the objective of these physical model experiments to degrade all the quantified mass present but rather to determine treatment expectations under realistic aggressive conditions if the intent were to degrade all the mass present then 33 8 g of oxidant would have been required to degrade 100 of the initial quantified mass in either the bleb or lenses system this oxidant demand estimate is based on a stoichiometry 100 g oxidant g of the initial quantified mass estimated from the slurry experiments the bulk soil concentration of the aquifer material used in the lense system was about 100 larger than that using in the bleb system but only half of the physical model was filled with impacted material each physical model received a total of 3 8 g of oxidant or about 10 of the stoichiometric requirement delivered in 6 pvs a typical injection event at the field scale is 1 pv huling et al 2017 crimi et al 2011 so it would be a significant effort involving multiple mobilizations over several months to deliver the stoichiometric requirement since the oxidant mass that can be delivered per injection event is limited in practice multiple mobilization events are required and tempered by site access and economic constraints overall the data from these experiments indicate that the behavior of the physical models with the lense architecture was comparable to those with the bleb architecture this similarity is likely a direct result of insufficient napl concentration in the aquifer materials used to pack the bottom half of the lense physical models permanganate outperformed persulfate in terms of affecting a change to the system effluent concentration albeit this change was minor there was an insignificant change for persulfate despite the observation of better efficiency in the permanganate systems the total mass removal was low for both systems and hence the benefit of flushing 6 pvs of permanganate or persulfate at a concentration of 30 g l under the physical model operating conditions was minimal 3 3 screening model simulations 3 3 1 parametrization consistent with the physical model dimensions the system length and cross sectional area were set equal to 7 7 cm and 8 37 cm2 respectively this screening model was able to capture the hydraulic and solute transport behaviour observed in the small scale physical model systems e g see fig sm 6 the effective porosity values estimated were 0 28 for pm bleb and 0 35 for pm lense ps bleb and ps lense these porosity values are close to the assumed value of 0 3 that was used for the initial nominal pv calculation the system velocity was assigned a value of 10 cm day which is consistent with the average flow rate cross sectional area and effective porosity used for the physical model systems to reduce model complexity 22 representative organic compounds table 2 were extracted from the napl analytical results table sm 1 and used to represent the initial napl composition these 22 compounds represent 29 of the napl mass and the remaining bulk napl mass include some identified compounds 5 and the unidentified fraction 66 napl saturation for each physical model system was estimated from the initial bulk soil concentration data bulk density and napl composition the average napl saturation values estimated were 6 4 for pm bleb 6 6 for pm lense 4 3 for ps bleb and 7 9 for ps lense representative napl constituent solubility and fugacity data were obtained from the literature lide 1999 eberhardt and grathwohl 2002 thomson et al 2008 peters et al 1997 since higher treatment efficiency was observed in the physical model systems using permanganate we chose to focus exclusively on permanganate in these screening model simulations literature values forsey 2004 thomson et al 2008 forsey et al 2010 for the second order oxidant reaction rate coefficients for permanganate were used for most of the 22 representative organic compounds table 2 missing values for the second order oxidant rate coefficient were assumed based on structure and trends observed from the aqueous batch experiments theoretical values were used for the permanganate organic compound stoichiometry mass ratio β table 2 to capture the consumption of permanganate by the aquifer material the nod kinetic model developed by xu and thomson 2009 was fit to the data from series 3 for sample 1 aquifer material see left panel in fig sm 3 a in this kinetic model the rate of change of permanganate is expressed by 7 d θ c ox v t dt k ox fast θ c oam fast c ox v t k ox slow θ c oam slow c ox v t and the rate of change of the fast and slow reacting oxidizable aquifer material oam species is given by 8 dc oam fast v t dt k oam fast c oam fast c ox v t and 9 dc oam slow v t dt k oam slow c oam slow c ox v t where c ox is the aqueous concentration of permanganate expressed as mass of mno4 per volume of solution c oam fast and c oam slow is the concentration of the fast and slow fraction of the bulk oam expressed as mass of oam per volume of the system k ox fast and k ox slow are the fast and slow reaction rate coefficients with respect to permanganate k oam fast and k oam slow are the fast and slow reaction rate coefficients with respect to oam θ is the porosity of the system solution volume system volume and v t is the total system volume based on mass balance considerations the permanganate mass required per unit mass of oam g of mno4 g of oam or stoichiometric mass ratio can be expressed as 10 β fast k ox fast θ k oam fast and β slow k ox slow θ k oam slow the calibration results for this kinetic model are shown on fig sm 7 along with the model parameters eqs 7 was implemented into the screening model as the noi sink term in eq 6 and eqs 8 10 were used to represent the mass balance of the fast and slow reacting oam the lumped mass transfer rate coefficient λ k captures the complex dissolution process within the system reflecting among other factors the napl architecture β o in eq 4 was determined through a calibration procedure that involved the minimization of the weighted sum of squares of the difference between the observed c i obs and simulated c i sim baseline concentrations as given by 11 rss i 1 n c i obs c i sim c i obs where n is the number of observations the observations from first sampling episode step 3 for the 2 pm bleb systems and for the 2 pm lense systems were separately pooled n 16 and used to determine a representative β o for each system the calibrated β o value for the pm bleb system was 0 61 and resulted in an average λ k of 0 08 day min of 0 072 day max of 0 088 day and the calibrated β o value for the pm lense system was 1 1 and resulted in an average λ k of 0 14 day min of 0 131 day max of 0 160 day the slightly higher average λ k value for the lense system is presumably due to the higher napl saturation that results in more napl water contact area and a higher dissolution rate the scatter plot for the pm bleb system fig sm 8 shows that the model under predicted the concentration xylene this is likely caused by slight differences in the napl composition assigned to the model and the composition of the impacted aquifer materials used in the physical models the observed tracer test behaviour in conjunction with the initial napl saturation estimates and the lumped mass transfer coefficient values indicate that despite all attempts to create two distinct napl architectures both the bleb and lense systems were very similar this is consistent with the experimental observations 3 3 2 benchmarking the parametrized model was used to simulate the two permanganate physical model systems pm bleb and pm lense not surprising the overall simulated mass of permanganate consumed was less than that observed within this screening model permanganate consumption results from the oxidation reactions with organic compounds eq 6 and the nod eq 7 the stoichiometric mass ratios mass of oxidant consumed per mass of organic compound degraded listed in table 2 are defined by representative mineralization reactions and are subject to uncertainty since the degradation pathways are not fully understood in addition there are likely dissolved compounds present in the system beyond those listed in table 2 to account for this additional permanganate mass consumed we assumed that a combination of incorrect stoichiometry and the presence of other dissolved compounds were responsible for the increased observed permanganate consumption as an alternative to adding an additional permanganate mass sink into the screening model we elected to multiple the stoichiometric mass ratios by a uniform and constant value this approach is reasonable since it both increases the stoichiometric mass ratio of those compounds directly simulated and accounts for a variety of other dissolved compounds that are not simulated in the model but may have similar dissolution behaviour as those simulated this multiplication factor was estimated by minimizing the sum of squares between the simulated effluent concentration profiles for the three injection episodes and the average observed effluent concentration profiles see upper left panel in figs 5 and 6 for example the stoichiometric mass ratio multiplication factor was 140 for the pm bleb system and resulted in 1 0 g of additional permanganate being consumed figs 5 and 6 show the simulated effluent concentrations for three representative organic compounds benzene naphthalene and acenaphthene for the pm bleb and pm lense systems respectively along with the observed concentrations from the physical model systems the concentration of all the organic compounds initially increase from zero initial condition until the first permanganate injection episode occurs at 6 pvs when permanganate is present in the system all the reactive compounds are degraded to mdl this behavior is consistent with observations from a series of preliminary experiments for example see data in table sm 5 and by extension was presumed to be to the case in the experimental data shown on figs 5 and 6 since the observed permanganate effluent concentrations are elevated once the injection solution was switched from permanganate to milli q water and the permanganate mass was depleted from the system there was a marked rebound in the effluent concentrations benzene is not reactive with permanganate and hence follows a steady dissolution profile the simulation results from the pm bleb system indicate that during 25 pvs of combined oxidant and water flushing conditions 0 74 mg or 0 2 of the initial quantified mass was removed and 1 3 g of permanganate was consumed since average parameter values were used for the simulations there is a minor mismatch in timing between the simulated and observed effluent observations the slight variation less than an order of magnitude between the simulated and observed rebound concentrations is a result of the heterogeneous nature of the mgp residuals loaded into each physical model and the assumed initial composition of mgp napl used in the simulations table 2 no attempt was made to alter the initial napl composition to improve the match between the simulated and observed rebound concentrations again based on a series of preliminary experiments it was presumed that when permanganate was present in the system the concentration of organic compounds of interest were mdl however we did not add this assumed behavior to the data shown on figs 5 and 6 despite these characteristics this screening level model was able to simulate the general observed concentration trends of 23 dissolved organic components as well as the concentration of permanganate for 25 pvs the performance of this simple screening level model constrained by the collective dataset was considered to be sufficient evidence for this model to be used to 1 investigate potential conditions required to achieve significant mass removal and 2 understand the long term behavior of dissolved phase concertations following treatment 3 3 3 oxidation of quantified mass the results from the physical model experiments and screening model revealed that while 50 of injected permanganate mass was not consumed the total mass removed dissolved and oxidized during 25 pvs of flushing was minimal in contrast the results from the slurry experiments indicated that under well mixed conditions with sufficient mass of oxidant present 95 the quantified mass was degraded fig 3 hence it is of interest to explore potential conditions that are required to achieve significant mass removal from the physical model system by oxidation when the stoichiometric mass of oxidant is delivered for this hypothetical investigation we ignored nod and the stoichiometric mass ratio multiplication factor and estimated the mass of permanganate required to degrade the total fmgp mass present in the system from 12 m pm t i 1 n β i c i n ρ n s n θ v t where m pm t is the total mass of kmno4 required to completely degrade the quantified mass c i n is napl concentration of each organic compound and ρ n is bulk napl density 1 04 g cm3 using the parameters for a representative pm bleb system in conjunction with data from table 2 the required mass of permanganate to satisfy the stoichiometric requirement is 6 4 g kmno4 for simulation purposes we assumed that this mass of permanganate was delivered continuous in 25 pvs injection concentration of 14 2 g kmno4 l as noted previously at an actual field site the delivery of 3 pvs of an oxidant solution would be considerate aggressive however we used 25 pvs here to be consistent with the total number of pvs flushed though the physical models e g see fig 5 the influence of variations in flow rate and mass transfer rate coefficient on the mass removed by oxidation was explored the flow rate affects the hydraulic residence time hrt or contact time while the mass transfer rate coefficient controls the availability of dissolved phase organic compounds since the mass transfer rate coefficient eq 4 depends on the organic compound and velocity and hence flow rate we multiplied λ k by a scaling factor λ scaling factor to capture first order variations in this important process the results of this numerical investigation are presented in fig 7 as the fraction of mass oxidized by permanganate to the initial mass quantified in the system in response to a range of hrt and λ scaling factor values the white arrow on fig 7 indicates the conditions average λ k of 0 08 day and hrt of 0 77 days representative of the pm bleb physical model experiments where 0 2 of the quantified mass was oxidized if λ k is increased by 104 for the same hrt of 0 77 days 60 of the initial mass is oxidized however to achieve a higher mass oxidized within the system the hrt needs to be increased flow rate reduced so that more oxidant remains in the system and is available for oxidation reactions for example if the hrt is increased to 35 days 90 of the mass is oxidized for a λ scaling factor of 104 to achieve 95 mass oxidized for a λ scaling factor of 104 the hrt would need to be 105 days 250 yrs which is clearly unrealistic and essentially mimics a batch reactor a lumped mass transfer rate coefficient for naphthalene of 4000 day was reported by ghoshal et al 1996 for a flow through system using coal tar coated silica beads this value is 5 104 larger than the average λ k 0 08 day determined from our physical model experiments suggesting that the larger λ values in fig 7 are possible under specific conditions we acknowledge that in an actual field setting oxidant mass that is not utilized within the treatment zone would be available to degrade downgradient mass if present however this is not considered here in addition this system behavior is subject to the idealized nature of this simple screening level model and associated assumptions 3 3 4 long term impacts on dissolved phase concentrations an understanding of the expected long term behaviour of dissolved phase concentrations following treatment is crucial to establish the benefit of a remedial effort and for risk assessment the analysis presented in the previous section focussed on the mass removed within the system as a result of reactions with permanganate in contrast we now are interested in the temporal dissolved phase concentrations profiles in the effluent from the treatment system to determine these concentration profiles the constrained screening model for the pm bleb system was used to simulate behaviour over a 5 year period permanganate consumption from nod reactions and the stoichiometric mass ratio multiplication factor were included the effects of a lower pore velocity 0 1 cm day compared to 10 cm day and higher mass transfer rate coefficient 100 times increase of the average λ k on the following three scenarios were separately investigated i no treatment scenario no permanganate injection ii 6 pv oxidant injection scenario 6 pvs of permanganate 30 g l injected in 3 episodes identical to the oxidant dosing pattern used in the physical model experiments iii one year oxidant injection scenario continuous permanganate injection for 1 year at 30 or 300 g l fig 8 shows the dissolved phase concentrations profiles over the 5 yr simulation period for three representative organic compounds benzene naphthalene and acenaphthene for all three scenarios naphthalene is the most abundant and soluble pah compound present in the system acenaphthene is soluble abundant and highly reactive with permanganate relative to naphthalene and benzene is also soluble and abundant but is not reactive with permanganate for the base condition velocity of 10 cm day used a total of 2400 pvs are flushed through the treatment zone over the 5 year period as expected except for benzene that does not react with permanganate the concentration of the organic compounds are reduced temporarily as a result of the presence of permanganate and then rebound to a profile that is essentially coincident with a no treatment scenario for both the 6 pv oxidant injection and one year oxidant injection scenarios table 3 provides a summary of the mass removed and oxidant consumption for all scenarios for the 6 pv oxidant injection scenario 0 1 of the quantified mass was degraded by permanganate and 50 of the injected permanganate mass was not consumed in contrast for one year of continuous oxidant injection the quantified mass oxidized increased to 4 but the total mass removed did not change significantly 16 7 compared to 16 5 and just 14 4 of the injected permanganate mass was consumed these results indicate that injecting a 30 g kmno4 l solution for 6 pvs or one year equivalent to 475 pvs both considered aggressive approaches will not materially affect the long term behavior of dissolved phase concentrations relative to the no treatment scenario as illustrated on fig 7 the pore velocity directly affects the contact or residence time and higher hrt values result in an increase in the mass oxidized within the system to evaluate how a larger hrt affects dissolved phase concentrations profiles the pore velocity was decreased by two orders of magnitude from 10 cm day to 0 1 cm day as a direct result of the lower velocity the total pvs flushed through the treatment system over 5 years is 100 times less 24 vs 2400 pvs with this larger hrt value most of the permanganate mass injected is consumed fig 9 and table 3 the effluent permanganate concentration reached a maximum of 0 07 and 0 1 g l for the 6 pv oxidant injection and one year oxidant injection scenarios respectively the effluent organic compound concentrations with the slower velocity higher hrt are 5 times higher than those generated for a velocity of 10 cm day the total mass removed and mass oxidized are identical for both the 6 pv oxidant injection and one year oxidant injection scenarios table 3 for the lower velocity only 4 75 pvs of permanganate are injected into the system in 1 year which is close to 6 pvs so the consistency between the results from these two scenarios is expected overall the total mass removed is significantly lower compared to the mass removed for a velocity of 10 cm day 1 1 vs 16 6 since the mass transfer rate coefficients for the lower velocity of 0 1 cm day are 16 times smaller average λ k of 0 005 day to provide the treatment system with additional oxidant mass the permanganate injection concentration was increased by an order of magnitude in the one year oxidant injection scenario from 30 to 300 g kmno4 l an unrealistic value since the solubility of kmno4 in water is only 64 g l at 20 c petri et al 2011a the results from this simulation show that only 17 of the injected permanganate mass was consumed and that the higher permanganate dosing was not able to increase mass removal table 3 nor affect the dissolved phase concentrations profiles fig 9 despite the two order of magnitude increase in system residence time no material changes in the total mass removed and dissolved phase concentrations profiles compared to the no treatment scenario were observed as expected by increasing the average lumped mass transfer rate coefficient by two orders of magnitude the effluent permanganate concentration decreased and the effluent concentration of organic compounds increased fig 10 increasing the lumped mass transfer rate coefficient increases the dissolution rate thus allowing more mass of organic compounds to be available in the aqueous phase for oxidation after 5 years 71 of the initial mass quantified is removed from the treatment system by oxidation and dissolution for the no treatment and 6 pv oxidant injection scenarios table 3 while 28 of the initial mass quantified is removed by oxidation in the one year oxidant injection scenario this only results in a slight increase of the total mass removed of 76 compared to a no treatment scenario by 100 days benzene is completely depleted from the system due to its higher solubility and the dissolved phase concentration profiles for other organic compounds e g naphthalene and acenaphthene rebound to concentrations below those for the no treatment scenario once permanganate is no longer present in the system for the one year oxidant injection scenario only fig 10 in summary these results indicate that scenarios that involved a lower velocity 0 1 cm day compared to 10 cm day and a higher oxidant dosing were unable to significantly alter the dissolved phase concentrations profiles in contrast an increase in the lumped mass transfer rate coefficients by two orders of magnitude did have an effect on the dissolved phase concentrations these results provide additional evidence that treatment efficiency by permanganate is mass transfer limited in this system 4 summary the focus of this research effort was to investigate the performance of persulfate and permanganate to degrade fmgp residuals in a flow system representative of in situ conditions and to explore treatment expectations including the long term behavior of dissolved phase concentrations the key findings determined are approximately 29 of the napl mass was quantified 72 unidentified and categorized as bulk napl hence our understanding of the behavior of the bulk napl mass is uncertain however based on analytical data collected the bulk napl is generally considered to consist of low solubility components and as a result is not readily treated by chemical oxidants the dissolved phase components were readily degraded with persulfate or permanganate except for benzene in well mixed aqueous and slurry batch systems for example in the slurry systems 95 45 and 30 of the initial mass quantified was degraded by permanganate unactivated persulfate and alkaline activated persulfate respectively as a result of the well mixed conditions employed the batch experiment results provide the most optimistic outcome and can be used to bound the expectations for the effectiveness of chemical oxidation of mgp residuals physical model experiments were performed to evaluate the effects of 6 pvs of oxidant treatment 3 injection episodes at 2 pvs episode by either persulfate or permanganate this is considered an aggressive isco approach permanganate outperformed persulfate in terms of affecting a change to the system effluent concentration despite this observation the total mass removed was insignificant for both systems and hence the benefit of flushing 6 pvs of permanganate or persulfate at a concentration of 30 g l under the physical model operating conditions was deemed minimal the developed screening model was able to capture the general behavior trends and concentration magnitude observed in the small scale physical model experiments since insignificant mass was degraded in the physical model experiments compared to the slurry batch reactors the developed screening model was used to determine the potential conditions required so that all of the quantified mass in the system is degraded when sufficient oxidant is present the results from this evaluation indicated that for larger λ scaling factor 100 and hrt 10 days values compared to those determined for the physical model experiments λ of 0 08 day hrt of 0 77 days permanganate can degrade 40 of the initial quantified mass the screening model was used to estimate dissolved phase concentrations for 5 years following exposure to permanganate the model input parameters were constrained by literature data and the physical model experimental results the model projected the following the concentration of the organic compounds are reduced temporarily as a result of the presence of permanganate and then rebound to a profile that is essentially coincident with a no treatment scenario despite the presence of excess mass of permanganate scenarios that involved a lower velocity 0 1 cm day compared to 10 cm day and higher permanganate dosing were unable to significantly alter the long term dissolved phase concentration profiles increasing the lumped mass transfer rate coefficients by two orders of magnitude resulted in a decrease in the dissolved phase concentration profiles relative to the no treatment scenario once permanganate left the system for a scenario that involved the continuous injection of oxidant for 1 year the collective evidence strongly suggests that treatment of the fmgp residuals explored in this work using chemical oxidants especially persulfate and permanganate is mass transfer limited acknowledgements financial support for this investigation was provided by teco

1621,methods to remediate soil and groundwater contamination at former manufactured gas plant fmgp sites are scarce the objective of this study was to investigate the ability of two chemical oxidants persulfate and permanganate to degrade fmgp residuals in a dynamic system representative of in situ conditions a series of physical model trials supported by aqueous and slurry batch experiments using impacted sediments collected from a fmgp site were conducted to explore treatment expectations a screening model constrained by the experimental data was employed the results from the aqueous experiments showed that dissolved components except for benzene were readily degraded by persulfate or permanganate in the well mixed slurry systems when contact with the oxidant was achieved 95 45 and 30 of the initial mass quantified was degraded by permanganate unactivated persulfate and alkaline activated persulfate respectively in stark contrast the total mass removed in the physical model trials was negligible for both permanganate and persulfate irrespective of the bleb or lense architecture used hence the net benefit of flushing 6 pore volumes of permanganate or persulfate at a concentration of 30 g l under the physical model operating conditions was minimal to achieve a substantial degradation of mass within the treatment system 40 results from the screening model indicated that the hydraulic resident time would need to be 10 days and the average lumped mass transfer coefficient increased by two orders of magnitude results from long term 5 years simulations showed that the dissolved concentrations of organic compounds are reduced temporarily as a result of the presence of permanganate but then rebound to a profile that is essentially coincident with a no treatment scenario following exposure to permanganate neither a lower velocity nor higher permanganate dosing affected the long term behavior of the dissolved phase concentrations however increasing the mass transfer rate coefficient had an impact the findings from this investigation indicate that the efficiency of permanganate or persulfate to treat for fmgp residuals is mass transfer limited keywords coal tar mgp persulfate permanganate mass transfer treatment end points long term expectations 1 introduction prior to 1950 thousands of manufacturing plants produced a combustible gas from coke coal or oil that was used in urban environments for lighting heating and cooking hatheway 2012 due to poor process operations and residual management practices there currently exists serious soil and groundwater contamination problems at many of these former manufactured gas plant fmgp sites cassidy et al 2015 wang et al 2015 hauswirth et al 2012 usepa 1999 fmgp residuals are usually found in the subsurface as non aqueous phase liquids napls that are typically denser and more viscous relative to water and are composed of hundreds to thousands of organic compounds mueller et al 1989 based on observations from various site characterization efforts the in situ architecture of these coal tar napls range from sheens stains tar blebs and tar coatings to saturated lenses or pools despite vast advancements in analytical methods it is currently only possible to quantify a portion of the organic compounds present in fmgp coal tars and even the analysis of this identified portion is extremely complicated birak and miller 2009 moreover the composition of fmgp tars varies between sites due to differences in source material and processing operations birak and miller 2009 luthy et al 1994 when fmgp tars are initially exposed to groundwater the more soluble compounds will gradually be depleted over time a phenomenon called aging or weathering and the higher molecular weight compounds which are generally the less soluble compounds will remain in the napl the presence of these fmgp tars in subsurface environments may pose a long term threat to groundwater quality and potentially human health if left untreated or if potential exposure pathways are not appropriately addressed remediation initiatives at many fmgp sites have been limited to isolation solidification or removal of the source materials usepa 2013 birak and miller 2009 luthy et al 1994 over the last 15 years in situ chemical oxidation isco has been growing steadily as a remediation technology used to treat a range of environmentally relevant contaminants siegrist et al 2011 although different types of chemical oxidants have been employed persulfate and permanganate are the two most frequently used as they are typically more persistent in subsurface systems petri et al 2011a 2011b usepa 2006 since chemical oxidation has been shown to successfully degrade a number of the dissolved organic compounds typically present at fmgp sites polyaromatic hydrocarbons pahs benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes btex sra et al 2013 forsey et al 2010 it is speculated that it could be a beneficial technology to treat fmgp tars in situ published studies dealing with the chemical oxidation of fmgp residuals have been diverse in scope with varied and often conflicting results table 1 provides a comprehensive summary of published bench scale studies which have used either persulfate or permanganate to degrade fmgp residuals in batch i e well mixed slurry or column systems some of the investigations detailed in table 1 have used impacted aquifer or river sediments collected from fmgp sites while others have used soils spiked with a mgp napl peng et al 2016 usman et al 2012 brown et al 2003 although spiked soil studies provide valuable insight into the chemical reactivity of different oxidants to attack mgp residuals the use of impacted materials collected from fmgp sites better represents the in situ chemical composition employing a series of batch experiments usman et al 2012 observed that magnetite activated persulfate was able to degrade 70 to 80 of the total pahs paht in spiked sand but when a fmgp soil was used no pah mass was removed in contrast cassidy et al 2015 reported mass removal of 55 to 65 using alkaline activated persulfate 37 g l in a batch system for soil material with an initial btex concentration of 0 58 g kg and a paht concentration of 3 06 g kg sum of 18 compounds nadim et al 2005 observed between 75 and 100 paht removal 7 compounds using iron activated persulfate 5 g l for a less impacted soil 0 01 g kg paht only a few studies have directly compared the effectiveness of different chemical oxidants to degrade organic mixtures lemaire et al 2013 ferrarese et al 2008 rivas 2006 gates anderson et al 2001 for example ferrarese et al 2008 identified that a 158 g l permanganate solution and a 120 g l persulfate solution were able to degrade 96 and 88 of the paht present in impacted soil with an initial paht concentration of 2 8 g kg respectively batch systems normally provide the most ideal environment to maximize treatment due to high oxidant dosing mass of oxidant mass of contaminant maximum contact between the oxidant and the napl well mixed and long reaction or residence times in contrast column systems are often considered more representative of a dynamic subsurface situation where preferential pathways exist there is less direct oxidant contact with the napl and the residence time is controlled by the flow system for example despite a paht removal of 47 14 compounds in a series of batch experiments richardson et al 2011 observed no reduction in pah mass from column experiments using a heat activated persulfate system in spite of a relatively low paht concentration of 0 3 g kg in comparison hauswirth and miller 2014 performed column experiments using fmgp impacted soils initial paht concentration of 1 99 g kg of tar 25 compounds and reported a 53 removal of paht after injecting 52 pore volumes pvs of a 50 g l alkaline activated persulfate solution since a typical field injection event is 1 pv huling et al 2017 crimi et al 2011 this high number of pvs is impractical at most field sites and hence the results from this column experiment should be viewed as highly optimistic in addition to the ability of chemical oxidants to degrade multi component napls such as fmgp residuals aquifer material and napl architecture in part dictate contaminant availability and consequently treatment effectiveness zhang et al 2007 the napl surface area to volume ratio is much less for a lense or pool architecture compared to bleb architecture and hence the relative surface or contact area is lower powers et al 1994a moreover the aqueous hydraulic conductivity is reduced within regions with a lense architecture and thus the ability to flush remedial fluids into these areas is limited zhang et al 2008 this will restrict the efficiency of a chemical oxidation system and in such conditions multiple injection episodes to effectively degrade the napl are required petri et al 2011a due to complex entrapment and multicomponent aspects of fmgp residuals it is generally not possible to remove all of the napl mass during treatment with a chemical oxidant soga et al 2004 for example thomson et al 2008 monitored the short term months and long term years behaviour of a plume originated from a multi component napl source zone after treatment with permanganate they concluded that while the short term organic compound concentrations were reduced significantly there was rebound of all of the monitored compounds after four years post treatment hence predicting the long term behaviour of dissolved phase concentrations following chemical oxidation treatment is necessary for the evaluation of post treatment expectations and risk assessment the few studies that have investigated the long term behavior of dissolved phase concentrations from fmgp residuals have indicated that dissolution kinetics depends on napl composition and the time scale for complete removal can vary between weeks to more than thousands of years for different napl architectures eberhardt and grathwohl 2002 based on the current literature table 1 it is unclear what the dissolved phase concentration behaviour is following treatment of fmgp tars with different napl architectures by various chemical oxidants the objective of this study was to investigate the performance of two chemical oxidants sodium persulfate na2s2o8 and potassium permanganate kmno4 to degrade fmgp residuals in a continuous flow system representative of in situ conditions specifically the focus was on the ability of each oxidant to remove fmgp residual mass and the impact on the dissolved phase concentrations following treatment supported by aqueous and slurry batch experiments a series of physical model trials were conducted using impacted sediments collected from a fmgp site the aqueous experiments focused on the ability of permanganate and three persulfate systems to degrade impacted groundwater collected from a fmgp site at both low and high initial oxidant concentrations in contrast the slurry experiments were used to quantify the potential of permanganate and three persulfate systems to remove mass from aquifer sediments containing fmgp residuals each physical model was subjected to three oxidant flushing episodes 6 pvs in total and the effluent was sampled between each episode at the termination of each trial sediment samples were collected from the physical model and analyzed for a suite of organic compounds to determine mass removed a simple single cell screening model constrained by the experimental results was used to investigate treatment expectations and the potential long term behaviour of dissolved phase concentrations as a result of treatment using these chemical oxidants 2 materials and methods 2 1 aquifer materials and napl impacted groundwater and fmgp residuals used in this study were obtained from the former west florida natural gas company site located in ocala florida from the late 1890s until about 1953 water gas or carbureted water gas was manufactured at this location by the lowe carbonization process or destructive distillation of bituminous coal and coke according to brown s directory of north american gas companies 1964 gas production was 48 103 m3 yr in 1900 and steadily increased to 900 103 m3 yr by 1950 in 1952 manufacturing stopped at the plant and the facility converted to the sale of butane propane air residues from the mgp process including tars and oily wastewaters were deposited in the area of the former gas plant facilities during operations there was an historic coal tar pit or area where residual tars were stored prior to sale for off site use as roofing materials groundwater samples were collected in 1000 ml amber glass containers from two monitoring wells screened from 19 8 to 21 3 and 36 0 to 39 6 m below ground surface bgs utilizing a low flow 0 2 l min purge sampling technique the samples were placed in coolers maintained at 4 c and transported to the university of waterloo where they were stored in a walk in refrigerator at 4 c during extensive drilling activities at the site both impacted and non impacted aquifer materials were collected from a weathered limestone unit using rotosonic drilling methods cores were recovered in 1 5 m runs using a 10 2 cm diameter core barrel with a button carbide drill bit core materials assigned as impacted weathered limestone unit material and non impacted weathered limestone unit material collected from inside the delineated source zone were used in this investigation the weathered limestone unit is part of an erosional surface of the miocene age and its composition includes clayey limestone sandy limestone and limey clay impacted aquifer material was immediately transferred into 500 ml glass jars sealed with a self sealing lid held in place with a metal screw top ring and stored on site in a freezer at 20 c see fig sm 1 a in the supplementary material sm section non impacted aquifer material was stored in polyethylene bags fig sm 1 b samples of impacted aquifer material were collected from two boreholes and are representative of depths ranging from 10 to 30 m bgs while non impacted aquifer materials were collected from five boreholes and are representative of depths ranging from 15 to 20 m bgs sufficient core materials were express shipped to the university of waterloo on ice samples of the impacted aquifer materials were stored at 40 c while samples of the non impacted aquifer materials were stored at 4 c the inventory of impacted aquifer materials received was visually inspected and separated into two categories based on napl presence lower impacted aquifer materials were reserved for the slurry treatability and the bleb architecture physical model experiments while the higher impacted aquifer materials were reserved for the saturated lense architecture physical model experiments fig sm 2 a napl sample density of 1 04 g cm3 collected from a well screened from 24 to 27 m bgs within the weathered limestone was submitted to alpha analytical laboratories westborough ma for analyses of btex total petroleum hydrocarbons tph and pahs a summary of these results are listed in table sm 1 and indicate that 34 of the napl mass was quantified 66 of the napl mass was unidentified consistent with the composition of other fmgp napls e g brown et al 2006 the most abundant compounds in the quantified portion of the napl are naphthalene 24 6 2 methylnaphthalene 13 7 1 methylnaphthalene 7 5 and acenaphthene 3 9 the benzene concentration represented 0 8 of the quantified portion of the napl for illustrative purposes in this paper we chose to report on the behaviour of naphthalene acenaphthene and benzene naphthalene and acenaphthene as a result of their higher napl concentration and benzene since it is typically a risk driver 2 2 natural oxidant interaction naturally occurring reductants and catalysts can be reactive and thus influence oxidant persistence typically the role of the dissolved groundwater species is overshadowed by the aquifer solids inorganic species containing iron fe manganese mn sulfur s and the natural organic matter nom associated with the aquifer solids are of concern the possibility of multiple inorganic species as well as a range of nom creates an extremely heterogeneous environment in which reactions may occur the result of the interaction between an oxidant and aquifer material leads to either an increase in the consumption of the oxidant by the aquifer solids or an enhancement in the oxidant decomposition rate when an oxidant is consumed by the aquifer solids the reactive species associated with the aquifer solids are finite and hence there exists a finite consumption or natural oxidant demand nod once the maximum nod is satisfied there is minimal additional oxidant aquifer material interaction and thus any additional oxidant delivered is available to interact with the contaminant conversely an enhancement in the oxidant decomposition rate implies that there is infinite interaction capacity available to capture these behavioral differences and the associated underlying processes for all oxidant behavior the term natural oxidant interaction noi is used rather than nod noi tests were used to estimate the potential in situ interaction of persulfate and permanganate with non impacted aquifer materials from three 3 representative locations for these noi tests the oxidant mass to solids ratio ranged from 5 to 40 g kg nominal noi tests were conducted for three persulfate systems 1 unactivated persulfate 2 chelated ferrous iron activated persulfate and 3 alkaline activated persulfate details of the experimental procedures employed are provided in the sm section 2 3 aqueous treatability experiments since the chemical oxidation of organic compounds occurs in the aqueous phase experiments were conducted using impacted groundwater exposed to permanganate or persulfate unactivated ferrous iron activated 300 mg l fe ii 0 5 mol citric acid mol fe ii or alkaline activated to determine aqueous degradation characteristics a suite of five 5 tests was executed in well mixed 20 ml batch reactors each test was performed in triplicate at a low 5 g l and a high 30 g l oxidant concentration in conjunction with experimental controls i e impacted groundwater and 0 2 ml of 10 nan3 and impacted groundwater adjusted with naoh to an initial ph of 11 impacted groundwater was added to each reactor followed by the activator solution if required and then the oxidant initial reactor solution volumes were adjusted with milli q water as required to ensure the same dilution of groundwater across all tests reactors were shaken gently by hand at least daily and left in the dark at an ambient temperature of 20 c aliquots of the solution were taken after a reaction period of 1 4 8 15 and 30 days and analyzed for the concentrations of a suite of 28 organic compounds table sm 4 and the oxidant the solution ph was also determined 2 4 slurry treatability experiments a series of experiments were performed to capture the ability of the various oxidant systems permanganate and persulfate to degrade impacted aquifer sediments the impacted weathered limestone unit material selected for these slurry treatability experiments were opened emptied onto a sterilized tray and homogenized minimal milli q water was added as required to improve mixing large size particles that were not suitable for the reactor design were removed by hand during mixing random samples from the homogenized mixture were used without additional alteration prior to filling the reactors five 5 sub samples from the homogenized mixture were collected and used to establish the initial bulk soil concentrations a 75 g random sample of the impacted sediments was added to a 125 ml reactor followed by a 30 g l oxidant solution permanganate unactivated persulfate and alkaline activated persulfate to achieve an oxidant mass to solids ratio of 30 g kg nominal all reactors were constructed in replicates 4 and constantly mixed on a shaker table in the dark at an ambient temperature of 20 c every 7 days for a 35 day period the oxidant concentration and ph were determined and a random sediment sub sample from each reactor was collected and analyzed to determine bulk soil concentrations if the results from a sampling episode indicated that the oxidant concentration was depleted additional oxidant mass was added to achieve a solution concentration of 30 g l 2 5 physical model experiments for the purpose of the evaluation conducted in this study we assumed that napl architecture that is characterized as sheens staining tar blebs and tar coatings have a similar architecture with respect to the ability of a reagent solution to interact with the napl when these napl forms are present in a permeable setting there is a good likelihood of contact between the reagent solution and the napl however when the napl is present as a napl saturated lense the ratio of napl surface area to volume is significantly smaller and reagent napl contact becomes problematic the series of small scale physical model experiments performed were designed with the intention to capture the two napl architecture end points blebs and tar coatings and saturated lenses the physical model was a 7 7 cm long flow through chamber with a cross sectional area of 8 37 cm2 3 1 2 7 cm fig 1 the influent and effluent ends of the chamber were packed with a 0 8 cm long zone of glass beads diameter 1 6 mm and a 20 stainless steel mesh to act as a flow distributor the remaining 6 1 cm length was wet packed with impacted aquifer sediments the chamber was sufficiently filled that when the lid was fastened it compressed the chamber contents ensuring a seal between the top of the chamber contents and the bottom of the lid to eliminate short circuiting of injected fluids for the bleb system impacted materials were packed gradually in several 0 5 cm thick layers into the central portion of the physical model for the saturated lense system impacted samples were emptied directly into the bottom of the physical model to a depth of 1 5 cm and the upper 1 5 cm portion of the chamber was then packed with non impacted material from the same borehole during the filling process five sub samples were taken and used to establish the initial bulk soil concentrations this system was then saturated with degassed milli q water and allowed to equilibrate for 7 days following the 7 day equilibration period flow was initiated at a nominal rate of 0 017 ml min approximate linear velocity of 10 cm day a peristaltic pump was connected to the influent end and a constant hydraulic head control was established at the outlet end an in line sampling system allowed aqueous samples to be collected from the effluent as required a tracer test using nabr was performed on each model system to ensure hydraulic consistency and packing following the tracer test three oxidant injection episodes were performed between each episode degassed milli q water was used to remove remnant oxidant from the system and facilitate the collection of aqueous effluent samples for analysis of organic compounds specifically each physical model system was operated in the following sequence of steps 1 one pv of degassed milli q water was injected to displace the pore water and allowed to equilibrate in the system for 7 days 2 three to four pvs of 100 mg l degassed nabr solution were injected during the tracer test effluent samples were collected every 4 h 3 at the end of the tracer test an effluent sample was collected to establish a baseline effluent organic compound concentration signature 4 two pvs of oxidant permanganate or persulfate at a concentration of 30 g l were injected during each oxidant injection episode the effluent was sampled at least 4 times for electrical conductivity ec ph and oxidant concentration 5 three pvs of degassed milli q water were injected the system effluent was monitored for ec ph and oxidant concentration during the initial 2 pvs to ensure remnant oxidant was removed from the system during the third pv an effluent sample was collected to determine the concentration of organic compounds in the effluent 6 steps 4 and 5 were then repeated twice more 3 oxidant injection episodes in total 7 when the experimental test was concluded the chamber lid was removed and three sub samples equally spaced along the length of the chamber were collected to establish post treatment bulk soil concentrations for the saturated lense system the sub samples were collected only from the lower 1 5 cm portion of the chamber that contained impacted material the sampling protocol followed in step 5 was adopted since the results from a series of preliminary experiments showed that when persulfate or permanganate was present in the effluent from the physical model the concentration of the organic compounds of interest were mdl for example see table sm 5 additionally our focus was on the rebound of the dissolved phase concentrations following treatment since this behavior is of interest to remediation practitioners and regulatory agencies thomson et al 2008 mcguire et al 2006 since the system pv and porosity was unknown at the start of each experiment a nominal pv of 19 33 ml was used this nominal pv was estimated from a porosity of 0 3 determined from a set of preliminary experiments and the packed chamber volume of 64 45 ml 7 7 cm 2 7 cm 3 1 cm the nominal hydraulic residence time was 20 h four physical systems were constructed for the bleb architecture and four systems for the saturated lense architecture permanganate 30 g l was used for two bleb systems identified as pm bleb 1 and pm bleb 2 and two saturated lense systems identified as pm lense 1 and pm lense 2 persulfate 30 g l was used for the remaining two bleb systems identified as ps bleb 1 and ps bleb 2 and two saturated lense systems identified as ps lense 1 and ps lense 2 based on the results from the aqueous and slurry batch experiments persulfate activator systems were not investigated in addition two systems were constructed as experimental controls and identified as co bleb and co lense the experimental controls received only degassed milli q water the oxidant concentration 30 g l was selected to mimic a potential concentration for a site where density driven advection of the injected oxidant solution is of

mdl for each quantified compound determined in the aqueous or sediment phase is presented in table sm 4 using these analytical methods we are able to track 28 compounds or 27 of the compounds in the napl mass table sm 1 the behaviour of the compounds that comprise the other 70 of the napl mass is unknown permanganate concentration was determined by spectrophotometry thermo scientific genesys 10s

dionex chromeleon software and the mdl was 0 5 mg l an orion ph meter model 290a and ec meter model a122 were used to measure ph and electrical conductivity 2 7 screening model to explore expectations for the treatment of fmgp residuals by chemical oxidants a single cell screening model was employed in this model a specified mass and composition of napl is assumed to be present within the sediment and the aqueous phase is presumed completely mixed the inlet oxidant concentration is prescribed and the effluent concentrations of the known soluble constituents are estimated from mass balance considerations the objective of this idealized modeling effort was to provide insight into treatment expectations under different operating conditions then those employed in the physical model experiments and over longer time scales it was not our intent to simulate in situ conditions but rather to investigate what might be possible under ideal circumstances and hence yield the most optimistic predictor of field behavior this screening model was deemed an appropriate tool to satisfy this requirement the mass balance of the individual soluble napl constituents is given by 1 dc k dt c k t r k ox k c ox c k λ k c k eff c k 2 dm k dt λ k θ c k eff c k v s with 3 c k eff x k γ k s k f s f l k 4 λ k β o d k w vp w μ w 0 598 θ n θ no 0 667 and 5 t r l s v θ l s q where c k is concentration of the k th constituent t r is the system hydraulic residence time k ox k is the second order reaction rate coefficient with respect to the oxidant for the k th constituent c ox is the oxidant concentration λ k is the lumped mass transfer rate coefficient for the k th constituent which is estimated from eq 4 adopted from powers et al 1994b c k eff is the effective saturation of the

of effective concentration the associated mass balance for the oxidant is given by 6 dc ax dt c ax c ax in t r β k k ox k c ox c k γ noi where c ox in is the inlet oxidant concentration β k is the stoichiometric mass ratio defined as the mass of oxidant consumed per mass of constituent degraded and γnoi is the rate of oxidant mass lost to the natural oxidant interaction sink reactions details of a representative γnoi expression for permanganate are provided by xu and thomson 2009 and for persulfate by sra et al 2010 eqs 1 and 6 are coupled and must be solved in association with eqs 2 to 4 numerically the following attributes are inherent in this screening model i a completely mixed system i e no preferential flow pathways and infinite dispersion ii mineralization of organic compounds iii the generation of by products e g manganese oxides carbon dioxide are ignored and iv there are no diffusion limitations within the napl 3 results and discussion 3 1 batch experiments the noi profiles average of replicates for the selected un impacted aquifer materials are presented in fig sm 3 for the three 3 aquifer materials tested the maximum observed consumption of permanganate expressed as nod after 30 days of exposure ranged from of 2 to 5 g kg the system ph remained stable between 8 and 9 the permanganate nod manifested in these batch experiments as an initial rapid increase until day 7 nod7 followed by a minor increase until day 30 as it asymptotically approached nodmax fig sm 3 a the variations between the six series of experiments indicated that consistent with xu and thomson 2009 a higher initial permanganate concentration as well as oxidant to solids mass ratio m ox s yielded a higher nodmax and a faster permanganate consumption rate for all three of the persulfate systems evaluated fig sm 3 b d there was very little loss of persulfate mass 10 after the 30 day reaction period except for the aquifer materials from one borehole location identified as sample 1 where the maximum change in persulfate concentration was 7 g l 17 5 decrease the stability of persulfate in the presence of these aquifer materials implies that there is minimal noi and hence persulfate should be persistent in situ the data generated from the aqueous treatability experiments indicated that all of the 17 dissolved phase compounds detected in the impacted groundwater were readily degraded with persulfate or permanganate except for benzene to mdl by day 10 for the high 30 g l oxidant concentration systems see fig 2 for benzene naphthalene and acenaphthene as expected the observed reaction rates for the dissolved phase compounds for the low 5 g l oxidant concentration systems were slower while the oxidant concentration was in excess in all the high oxidant concentration systems oxidant consumption followed the order iron activated persulfate permanganate persulfate alkaline activated persulfate except for benzene the order of reactivity of the remaining 16 quantified organic compounds was iron activated persulfate permanganate persulfate alkaline activated persulfate despite the fact that it was never the intention of these aqueous treatability experiments to generate data that could be used to develop kinetic rate coefficients a comprehensive analysis of the data was undertaken in an attempt to estimate second order reaction rate coefficients for all 17 compounds as expected due to limited temporal data 2 4 data points for some compounds the results yielded only sporadic values and thus no rate coefficients are reported temporal oxidant and the bulk soil concentration profiles for benzene naphthalene and acenaphthene from the slurry experimental systems are shown in fig 3 although all attempts were made to homogenize the impacted materials prior to adding them to the reactors there was some variability in the initial bulk soil concentrations of subsamples collected from the stock supply of impacted sediments and those emplaced in each reactor the oxidant mass in the permanganate slurry reactors was replenished at day 7 and day 14 while the oxidant mass in the unactivated persulfate and alkaline activated persulfate slurry reactors was replenished only at day 7 following replenishment permanganate continued to be depleted while the concentration of persulfate remained elevated compared to either of the persulfate systems explored permanganate was more effective in treating pahs e g naphthalene 1 methylnaphthalene 2 methylnaphthalene and acenaphthene over the 35 day reaction period for the permanganate unactivated persulfate and alkaline activated persulfate systems it was estimated that 95 45 and 30 of the initial mass quantified was degraded respectively these values are consistent with the spectrum of mass removal reported by others using batch systems with either permanganate or persulfate see table 1 the overall bulk stoichiometry for these slurry experiments was estimated as the ratio of permanganate or persulfate consumed to the quantified mass degraded these estimates corrected for noi varied from 100 g kmno4 g for the permanganate system and 95 g nas2o8 g for the unactivated persulfate system to 150 g nas2o8 g for the alkaline activated persulfate system these stoichiometric values are consistent in magnitude with those reported by sra et al 2013 for the total petroleum hydrocarbon tph of dissolved gasoline degraded by various persulfate systems this data set provides insight into the ability of the investigated oxidant systems to destroy mass present in impacted aquifer materials under ideal conditions i e well mixed excess oxidant long contact time and hence are the most optimistic 3 2 physical models after 1 to 2 pvs of nabr injection the effluent concentration of bromide reached 50 of the injected concentration 100 mg l and after 3 to 4 pvs reached 100 for all physical models based on the tracer breakthrough profiles the effective porosity for co bleb and co lense was 0 26 and 0 38 respectively and ranged from 0 27 to 0 38 for the treatment bleb physical models and from 0 33 to 0 36 for the treatment lense physical models for the control systems co bleb and co lense the effluent ph was steady between 7 5 and 8 and the ec was minimal 300 μs cm as expected the concentrations of the detectable organic compounds in the effluent from both control systems were relatively constant except for a notable decrease in the concentration of benzene the final bulk soil concentrations were essentially unchanged from the initial soil concentrations except for benzene benzene was quickly depleted from the system as a result of a higher solubility and lower initial soil concentration compared to other compounds for both permanganate systems pm bleb and pm lense the average naphthalene and acenaphthene effluent concentrations following each oxidant injection episode 2 pvs episode decreased fig 4a b see fig sm 4 for benzene in contrast the average naphthalene and acenaphthene effluent concentrations following each oxidant injection episode 2 pvs episode for the persulfate systems either remained relatively constant ps bleb or increased ps lense fig 4c d these trends were generally consistent for the other monitored compounds except for benzene that remained relatively constant following each persulfate injection episode in the ps bleb and ps lense systems fig sm 4 the average maximum permanganate effluent concentration was 15 g l during the first injection episode and increased to 17 g l during the second and third injection episodes for the pm bleb physical models and was 17 g l during the first injection episode and 20 g l during the second and third injection episodes for the pm lense systems the average maximum persulfate effluent concentration for the ps bleb physical models was 23 g l during the first injection episode and increased to 25 g l during the second and third injection episodes for the ps lense physical models the average maximum persulfate effluent concentration was 25 g l for all injection episodes the significant reduction of the effluent permanganate or persulfate concentration to near the mdl during the injection of 3 pvs of degassed milli q water see fig sm 5 indicated that remnant oxidant was removed from the experimental system prior to collection of the effluent sample for analyses of organic compounds the effluent ec profiles were consistent with the permanganate or persulfate effluent profiles the effluent ph for the pm bleb physical models increased from 7 3 to 9 5 with minor decreases when permanganate was present in the system in contrast the effluent ph for the pm lense physical models oscillated between 7 6 and 9 4 the effluent ph remained relatively stable at 7 9 for the ps belb and 7 6 for the ps lense systems an evaluation of the initial and final bulk soil concentration data indicated that there was no statistically significant reduction in the total quantifiable mass for all treatment systems at the 5 level of significance it is suspected that any decrease in mass was masked by the inherent variability in the soil sub sampling procedure used and the contaminant heterogeneity present in the physical models the minor decreases observed in the effluent concentrations following each oxidant injection episode at least for the permanganate systems fig 4a b indicate that 6 pvs of oxidant treatment had perhaps a minor impact on mass removal but it was not statistically significant the insignificant mass removal observed in these physical model systems is consistent with the findings from richardson et al 2011 who observed no reduction in pah mass from column experiments using a heat activated persulfate system see table 1 in contrast hauswirth and miller 2014 observed 53 removal in a column experiment after injecting 52 pvs of a 50 g l alkaline activated persulfate solution oxidant dose of 330 g g paht compared to the order of magnitude smaller oxidant dose of 10 g g paht used in this study oxidant mass balance calculations for the bleb systems indicated that 50 and 17 of the permanganate and persulfate mass injected was consumed respectively while for the lense systems 35 and 19 of the permanganate and persulfate mass injected was consumed respectively hence while persulfate consumption was similar in the bleb and lense systems permanganate consumption in the bleb systems was more significant and can be attributed to higher napl aqueous phase contact area during the 3 oxidant injection episodes 6 pvs total elevated oxidant concentrations 5 g l were present for a total residence or contact time of 8 days the oxidant resident time was controlled by the flow rate which was established to yield a moderate linear velocity of 10 cm day it was not the objective of these physical model experiments to degrade all the quantified mass present but rather to determine treatment expectations under realistic aggressive conditions if the intent were to degrade all the mass present then 33 8 g of oxidant would have been required to degrade 100 of the initial quantified mass in either the bleb or lenses system this oxidant demand estimate is based on a stoichiometry 100 g oxidant g of the initial quantified mass estimated from the slurry experiments the bulk soil concentration of the aquifer material used in the lense system was about 100 larger than that using in the bleb system but only half of the physical model was filled with impacted material each physical model received a total of 3 8 g of oxidant or about 10 of the stoichiometric requirement delivered in 6 pvs a typical injection event at the field scale is 1 pv huling et al 2017 crimi et al 2011 so it would be a significant effort involving multiple mobilizations over several months to deliver the stoichiometric requirement since the oxidant mass that can be delivered per injection event is limited in practice multiple mobilization events are required and tempered by site access and economic constraints overall the data from these experiments indicate that the behavior of the physical models with the lense architecture was comparable to those with the bleb architecture this similarity is likely a direct result of insufficient napl concentration in the aquifer materials used to pack the bottom half of the lense physical models permanganate outperformed persulfate in terms of affecting a change to the system effluent concentration albeit this change was minor there was an insignificant change for persulfate despite the observation of better efficiency in the permanganate systems the total mass removal was low for both systems and hence the benefit of flushing 6 pvs of permanganate or persulfate at a concentration of 30 g l under the physical model operating conditions was minimal 3 3 screening model simulations 3 3 1 parametrization consistent with the physical model dimensions the system length and cross sectional area were set equal to 7 7 cm and 8 37 cm2 respectively this screening model was able to capture the hydraulic and solute transport behaviour observed in the small scale physical model systems e g see fig sm 6 the effective porosity values estimated were 0 28 for pm bleb and 0 35 for pm lense ps bleb and ps lense these porosity values are close to the assumed value of 0 3 that was used for the initial nominal pv calculation the system velocity was assigned a value of 10 cm day which is consistent with the average flow rate cross sectional area and effective porosity used for the physical model systems to reduce model complexity 22 representative organic compounds table 2 were extracted from the napl analytical results table sm 1 and used to represent the initial napl composition these 22 compounds represent 29 of the napl mass and the remaining bulk napl mass include some identified compounds 5 and the unidentified fraction 66 napl saturation for each physical model system was estimated from the initial bulk soil concentration data bulk density and napl composition the average napl saturation values estimated were 6 4 for pm bleb 6 6 for pm lense 4 3 for ps bleb and 7 9 for ps lense representative napl constituent solubility and fugacity data were obtained from the literature lide 1999 eberhardt and grathwohl 2002 thomson et al 2008 peters et al 1997 since higher treatment efficiency was observed in the physical model systems using permanganate we chose to focus exclusively on permanganate in these screening model simulations literature values forsey 2004 thomson et al 2008 forsey et al 2010 for the second order oxidant reaction rate coefficients for permanganate were used for most of the 22 representative organic compounds table 2 missing values for the second order oxidant rate coefficient were assumed based on structure and trends observed from the aqueous batch experiments theoretical values were used for the permanganate organic compound stoichiometry mass ratio β table 2 to capture the consumption of permanganate by the aquifer material the nod kinetic model developed by xu and thomson 2009 was fit to the data from series 3 for sample 1 aquifer material see left panel in fig sm 3 a in this kinetic model the rate of change of permanganate is expressed by 7 d θ c ox v t dt k ox fast θ c

in eq 6 and eqs 8 10 were used to represent the mass balance of the fast and slow reacting oam the lumped mass transfer rate coefficient λ k captures the complex dissolution process within the system reflecting among other factors the napl architecture β o in eq 4 was determined through a calibration procedure that involved the minimization of the weighted sum of squares of the difference between the observed c i obs and simulated c i sim baseline concentrations as given by 11 rss i 1 n c i obs c i sim c i obs where n is the number of observations the observations from first sampling episode step 3 for the 2 pm bleb systems and for the 2 pm lense systems were separately pooled n 16 and used to determine a representative β o for each system the calibrated β o value for the pm bleb system was 0 61 and resulted in an average λ k of 0 08 day min of 0 072 day max of 0 088 day and the calibrated β o value for the pm lense system was 1 1 and resulted in an average λ k of 0 14 day min of 0 131 day max of 0 160 day the slightly higher average λ k value for the lense system is presumably due to the higher napl saturation that results in more napl water contact area and a higher dissolution rate the scatter plot for the pm bleb system fig sm 8 shows that the model under predicted the concentration xylene this is likely caused by slight differences in the napl composition assigned to the model and the composition of the impacted aquifer materials used in the physical models the observed tracer test behaviour in conjunction with the initial napl saturation estimates and the lumped mass transfer coefficient values indicate that despite all attempts to create two distinct napl architectures both the bleb and lense systems were very similar this is consistent with the experimental observations 3 3 2 benchmarking the parametrized model was used to simulate the two permanganate physical model systems pm bleb and pm lense not surprising the overall simulated mass of permanganate consumed was less than that observed within this screening model permanganate consumption results from the oxidation reactions with organic compounds eq 6 and the nod eq 7 the stoichiometric mass ratios mass of oxidant consumed per mass of organic compound degraded listed in table 2 are defined by representative mineralization reactions and are subject to uncertainty since the degradation pathways are not fully understood in addition there are likely dissolved compounds present in the system beyond those listed in table 2 to account for this additional permanganate mass consumed we assumed that a combination of incorrect stoichiometry and the presence of other dissolved compounds were responsible for the increased observed permanganate consumption as an alternative to adding an additional permanganate mass sink into the screening model we elected to multiple the stoichiometric mass ratios by a uniform and constant value this approach is reasonable since it both increases the stoichiometric mass ratio of those compounds directly simulated and accounts for a variety of other dissolved compounds that are not simulated in the model but may have similar dissolution behaviour as those simulated this multiplication factor was estimated by minimizing the sum of squares between the simulated effluent concentration profiles for the three injection episodes and the average observed effluent concentration profiles see upper left panel in figs 5 and 6 for example the stoichiometric mass ratio multiplication factor was 140 for the pm bleb system and resulted in 1 0 g of additional permanganate being consumed figs 5 and 6 show the simulated effluent concentrations for three representative organic compounds benzene naphthalene and acenaphthene for the pm bleb and pm lense systems respectively along with the observed concentrations from the physical model systems the concentration of all the organic compounds initially increase from zero initial condition until the first permanganate injection episode occurs at 6 pvs when permanganate is present in the system all the reactive compounds are degraded to mdl this behavior is consistent with observations from a series of preliminary experiments for example see data in table sm 5 and by extension was presumed to be to the case in the experimental data shown on figs 5 and 6 since the observed permanganate effluent concentrations are elevated once the injection solution was switched from permanganate to milli q water and the permanganate mass was depleted from the system there was a marked rebound in the effluent concentrations benzene is not reactive with permanganate and hence follows a steady dissolution profile the simulation results from the pm bleb system indicate that during 25 pvs of combined oxidant and water flushing conditions 0 74 mg or 0 2 of the initial quantified mass was removed and 1 3 g of permanganate was consumed since average parameter values were used for the simulations there is a minor mismatch in timing between the simulated and observed effluent observations the slight variation less than an order of magnitude between the simulated and observed rebound concentrations is a result of the heterogeneous nature of the mgp residuals loaded into each physical model and the assumed initial composition of mgp napl used in the simulations table 2 no attempt was made to alter the initial napl composition to improve the match between the simulated and observed rebound concentrations again based on a series of preliminary experiments it was presumed that when permanganate was present in the system the concentration of organic compounds of interest were mdl however we did not add this assumed behavior to the data shown on figs 5 and 6 despite these characteristics this screening level model was able to simulate the general observed concentration trends of 23 dissolved organic components as well as the concentration of permanganate for 25 pvs the performance of this simple screening level model constrained by the collective dataset was considered to be sufficient evidence for this model to be used to 1 investigate potential conditions required to achieve significant mass removal and 2 understand the long term behavior of dissolved phase concertations following treatment 3 3 3 oxidation of quantified mass the results from the physical model experiments and screening model revealed that while 50 of injected permanganate mass was not consumed the total mass removed dissolved and oxidized during 25 pvs of flushing was minimal in contrast the results from the slurry experiments indicated that under well mixed conditions with sufficient mass of oxidant present 95 the quantified mass was degraded fig 3 hence it is of interest to explore potential conditions that are required to achieve significant mass removal from the physical model system by oxidation when the stoichiometric mass of oxidant is delivered for this hypothetical investigation we ignored nod and the stoichiometric mass ratio multiplication factor and estimated the mass of permanganate required to degrade the total fmgp mass present in the system from 12 m pm t i 1 n β i c i n ρ n s n θ v t where m pm t is the total mass of kmno4 required to completely degrade the quantified mass c i n is napl concentration of each organic compound and ρ n is bulk napl density 1 04 g cm3 using the parameters for a representative pm bleb system in conjunction with data from table 2 the required mass of permanganate to satisfy the stoichiometric requirement is 6 4 g kmno4 for simulation purposes we assumed that this mass of permanganate was delivered continuous in 25 pvs injection concentration of 14 2 g kmno4 l as noted previously at an actual field site the delivery of 3 pvs of an oxidant solution would be considerate aggressive however we used 25 pvs here to be consistent with the total number of pvs flushed though the physical models e g see fig 5 the influence of variations in flow rate and mass transfer rate coefficient on the mass removed by oxidation was explored the flow rate affects the hydraulic residence time hrt or contact time while the mass transfer rate coefficient controls the availability of dissolved phase organic compounds since the mass transfer rate coefficient eq 4 depends on the organic compound and velocity and hence flow rate we multiplied λ k by a scaling factor λ scaling factor to capture first order variations in this important process the results of this numerical investigation are presented in fig 7 as the fraction of mass oxidized by permanganate to the initial mass quantified in the system in response to a range of hrt and λ scaling factor values the white arrow on fig 7 indicates the conditions average λ k of 0 08 day and hrt of 0 77 days representative of the pm bleb physical model experiments where 0 2 of the quantified mass was oxidized if λ k is increased by 104 for the same hrt of 0 77 days 60 of the initial mass is oxidized however to achieve a higher mass oxidized within the system the hrt needs to be increased flow rate reduced so that more oxidant remains in the system and is available for oxidation reactions for example if the hrt is increased to 35 days 90 of the mass is oxidized for a λ scaling factor of 104 to achieve 95 mass oxidized for a λ scaling factor of 104 the hrt would need to be 105 days 250 yrs which is clearly unrealistic and essentially mimics a batch reactor a lumped mass transfer rate coefficient for naphthalene of 4000 day was reported by ghoshal et al 1996 for a flow through system using coal tar coated silica beads this value is 5 104 larger than the average λ k 0 08 day determined from our physical model experiments suggesting that the larger λ values in fig 7 are possible under specific conditions we acknowledge that in an actual field setting oxidant mass that is not utilized within the treatment zone would be available to degrade downgradient mass if present however this is not considered here in addition this system behavior is subject to the idealized nature of this simple screening level model and associated assumptions 3 3 4 long term impacts on dissolved phase concentrations an understanding of the expected long term behaviour of dissolved phase concentrations following treatment is crucial to establish the benefit of a remedial effort and for risk assessment the analysis presented in the previous section focussed on the mass removed within the system as a result of reactions with permanganate in contrast we now are interested in the temporal dissolved phase concentrations profiles in the effluent from the treatment system to determine these concentration profiles the constrained screening model for the pm bleb system was used to simulate behaviour over a 5 year period permanganate consumption from nod reactions and the stoichiometric mass ratio multiplication factor were included the effects of a lower pore velocity 0 1 cm day compared to 10 cm day and higher mass transfer rate coefficient 100 times increase of the average λ k on the following three scenarios were separately investigated i no treatment scenario no permanganate injection ii 6 pv oxidant injection scenario 6 pvs of permanganate 30 g l injected in 3 episodes identical to the oxidant dosing pattern used in the physical model experiments iii one year oxidant injection scenario continuous permanganate injection for 1 year at 30 or 300 g l fig 8 shows the dissolved phase concentrations profiles over the 5 yr simulation period for three representative organic compounds benzene naphthalene and acenaphthene for all three scenarios naphthalene is the most abundant and soluble pah compound present in the system acenaphthene is soluble abundant and highly reactive with permanganate relative to naphthalene and benzene is also soluble and abundant but is not reactive with permanganate for the base condition velocity of 10 cm day used a total of 2400 pvs are flushed through the treatment zone over the 5 year period as expected except for benzene that does not react with permanganate the concentration of the organic compounds are reduced temporarily as a result of the presence of permanganate and then rebound to a profile that is essentially coincident with a no treatment scenario for both the 6 pv oxidant injection and one year oxidant injection scenarios table 3 provides a summary of the mass removed and oxidant consumption for all scenarios for the 6 pv oxidant injection scenario 0 1 of the quantified mass was degraded by permanganate and 50 of the injected permanganate mass was not consumed in contrast for one year of continuous oxidant injection the quantified mass oxidized increased to 4 but the total mass removed did not change significantly 16 7 compared to 16 5 and just 14 4 of the injected permanganate mass was consumed these results indicate that injecting a 30 g kmno4 l solution for 6 pvs or one year equivalent to 475 pvs both considered aggressive approaches will not materially affect the long term behavior of dissolved phase concentrations relative to the no treatment scenario as illustrated on fig 7 the pore velocity directly affects the contact or residence time and higher hrt values result in an increase in the mass oxidized within the system to evaluate how a larger hrt affects dissolved phase concentrations profiles the pore velocity was decreased by two orders of magnitude from 10 cm day to 0 1 cm day as a direct result of the lower velocity the total pvs flushed through the treatment system over 5 years is 100 times less 24 vs 2400 pvs with this larger hrt value most of the permanganate mass injected is consumed fig 9 and table 3 the effluent permanganate concentration reached a maximum of 0 07 and 0 1 g l for the 6 pv oxidant injection and one year oxidant injection scenarios respectively the effluent organic compound concentrations with the slower velocity higher hrt are 5 times higher than those generated for a velocity of 10 cm day the total mass removed and mass oxidized are identical for both the 6 pv oxidant injection and one year oxidant injection scenarios table 3 for the lower velocity only 4 75 pvs of permanganate are injected into the system in 1 year which is close to 6 pvs so the consistency between the results from these two scenarios is expected overall the total mass removed is significantly lower compared to the mass removed for a velocity of 10 cm day 1 1 vs 16 6 since the mass transfer rate coefficients for the lower velocity of 0 1 cm day are 16 times smaller average λ k of 0 005 day to provide the treatment system with additional oxidant mass the permanganate injection concentration was increased by an order of magnitude in the one year oxidant injection scenario from 30 to 300 g kmno4 l an unrealistic value since the solubility of kmno4 in water is only 64 g l at 20 c petri et al 2011a the results from this simulation show that only 17 of the injected permanganate mass was consumed and that the higher permanganate dosing was not able to increase mass removal table 3 nor affect the dissolved phase concentrations profiles fig 9 despite the two order of magnitude increase in system residence time no material changes in the total mass removed and dissolved phase concentrations profiles compared to the no treatment scenario were observed as expected by increasing the average lumped mass transfer rate coefficient by two orders of magnitude the effluent permanganate concentration decreased and the effluent concentration of organic compounds increased fig 10 increasing the lumped mass transfer rate coefficient increases the dissolution rate thus allowing more mass of organic compounds to be available in the aqueous phase for oxidation after 5 years 71 of the initial mass quantified is removed from the treatment system by oxidation and dissolution for the no treatment and 6 pv oxidant injection scenarios table 3 while 28 of the initial mass quantified is removed by oxidation in the one year oxidant injection scenario this only results in a slight increase of the total mass removed of 76 compared to a no treatment scenario by 100 days benzene is completely depleted from the system due to its higher solubility and the dissolved phase concentration profiles for other organic compounds e g naphthalene and acenaphthene rebound to concentrations below those for the no treatment scenario once permanganate is no longer present in the system for the one year oxidant injection scenario only fig 10 in summary these results indicate that scenarios that involved a lower velocity 0 1 cm day compared to 10 cm day and a higher oxidant dosing were unable to significantly alter the dissolved phase concentrations profiles in contrast an increase in the lumped mass transfer rate coefficients by two orders of magnitude did have an effect on the dissolved phase concentrations these results provide additional evidence that treatment efficiency by permanganate is mass transfer limited in this system 4 summary the focus of this research effort was to investigate the performance of persulfate and permanganate to degrade fmgp residuals in a flow system representative of in situ conditions and to explore treatment expectations including the long term behavior of dissolved phase concentrations the key findings determined are approximately 29 of the napl mass was quantified 72 unidentified and categorized as bulk napl hence our understanding of the behavior of the bulk napl mass is uncertain however based on analytical data collected the bulk napl is generally considered to consist of low solubility components and as a result is not readily treated by chemical oxidants the dissolved phase components were readily degraded with persulfate or permanganate except for benzene in well mixed aqueous and slurry batch systems for example in the slurry systems 95 45 and 30 of the initial mass quantified was degraded by permanganate unactivated persulfate and alkaline activated persulfate respectively as a result of the well mixed conditions employed the batch experiment results provide the most optimistic outcome and can be used to bound the expectations for the effectiveness of chemical oxidation of mgp residuals physical model experiments were performed to evaluate the effects of 6 pvs of oxidant treatment 3 injection episodes at 2 pvs episode by either persulfate or permanganate this is considered an aggressive isco approach permanganate outperformed persulfate in terms of affecting a change to the system effluent concentration despite this observation the total mass removed was insignificant for both systems and hence the benefit of flushing 6 pvs of permanganate or persulfate at a concentration of 30 g l under the physical model operating conditions was deemed minimal the developed screening model was able to capture the general behavior trends and concentration magnitude observed in the small scale physical model experiments since insignificant mass was degraded in the physical model experiments compared to the slurry batch reactors the developed screening model was used to determine the potential conditions required so that all of the quantified mass in the system is degraded when sufficient oxidant is present the results from this evaluation indicated that for larger λ scaling factor 100 and hrt 10 days values compared to those determined for the physical model experiments λ of 0 08 day hrt of 0 77 days permanganate can degrade 40 of the initial quantified mass the screening model was used to estimate dissolved phase concentrations for 5 years following exposure to permanganate the model input parameters were constrained by literature data and the physical model experimental results the model projected the following the concentration of the organic compounds are reduced temporarily as a result of the presence of permanganate and then rebound to a profile that is essentially coincident with a no treatment scenario despite the presence of excess mass of permanganate scenarios that involved a lower velocity 0 1 cm day compared to 10 cm day and higher permanganate dosing were unable to significantly alter the long term dissolved phase concentration profiles increasing the lumped mass transfer rate coefficients by two orders of magnitude resulted in a decrease in the dissolved phase concentration profiles relative to the no treatment scenario once permanganate left the system for a scenario that involved the continuous injection of oxidant for 1 year the collective evidence strongly suggests that treatment of the fmgp residuals explored in this work using chemical oxidants especially persulfate and permanganate is mass transfer limited acknowledgements financial support for this investigation was provided by teco

1622,the extensive use of pesticides in agricultural practices has been associated with human health problems and environmental contamination worldwide brazil is the largest consumer of pesticides in the world and espírito santo state stands out as the second brazilian producer of coffee however there is no information about environmental impact of coffee producing at itapemirim river basin irb region espírito santo state brazil hence a simple and quick method using open access softwares agroscre and araquá web to estimate surface entrainment and pesticide leaching potential was carried out agroscre evaluates the contamination risk of superficial and groundwater by active ingredients ais using goss method gus index and us epa criteria while araquá web estimates ai concentrations in water resources indicating their suitability based on water quality requirements for different uses regarding pesticides used in coffee plantations there is 44 7 chance of surface water and 23 7 chance of groundwater contamination results showed that ametryne cyproconazole diuron epoxiconazole flutriafol triadimenol and triazophos pose contamination risk to both surface water and groundwater in the irb region of these 10 5 of the total ais are triazoles and fall under environmental classes ii and iii product very dangerous to the environment the ais ametryne thiamethoxam iprodione flutriafol triazophos endosulfan triadimenol cyproconazole diuron pendimethalin chlorpyrifos copper ii hydroxide etion epoxiconazole and paraquat dichloride were found to be potentially toxic presenting environmental concentrations ranging from 123 40 μg l 1 to 0 14 μg l 1 which are higher than the safety standard for potable water 0 1 μg l 1 with respect to these ais chlorpyrifos ethion and triazophos showed concentrations higher than ec50 values for aquatic invertebrates and ametryne and diuron for algae thus local residents and environment may be at high risk of pesticide exposure when

modelling 1 introduction pesticides have been extensively used in agriculture to prevent and control pests baird 2002 kellogg et al 2002 it is believed that two thirds of the world population is exposed to their harmful effects either by labor activity or consumption of contaminated food peres et al 2005 de souza et al 2011 stehle and schulz 2015 although the risk of pesticides to humans through acute or cumulative exposure is not well understood scientific evidence shows that these products can cause often irreversible damage including late neuropathy by overexposure to organophosphates bolognesi 2003 salvagni et al 2011 de souza et al 2011 in recent years the use of pesticides in brazil has increased according to the latest data from the union of national industry products for agricultural defense brazil is the largest consumer of pesticides in the world sindag 2012 while the global consumption of pesticides increased by 96 7 between 2000 and 2010 brazilian consumption increased 189 6 for the same period sindag 2012 even in small amounts these products pose a risk for human health and the environment due to their mobility and persistence baird 2002 bozzo et al 2013 funari and vighi 1995 shuai et al 2012 this risk is aggravated when they are used in sensitive environments such as near to streams rivers dams and artesian wells andrade et al 2011 di guardo and finizio 2015 hall et al 2015 hiller et al 2008 queiroz et al 2013 the southern region of espírito santo state is composed of 16 municipalities with an area of 6 610 km2 including the itapemirim river basin irb the main agricultural activity in the region is coffee growing which comprises approximately 16 of agricultural production and comprises 22 of the total area planted with coffee within espírito santo state ibge 2013 seag 2008 the natural characteristics of the region together with the intensive pesticide use makes the local residents susceptible to contamination from pesticides calçavara and nascimento 2009 do nascimento et al 2006 seag 2008 although brazilian legislation sets limits on permissible pesticide concentrations in water intended for human consumption brazilian concessionaires of water and sewerage are not required to carry out such analyses brasil 2005 2004 environmental risk assessment is thus of utmost importance since to our knowledge there is no laboratory testing for pesticide presence in the southern region of the espírito santo state in addition it is the initial step required to ensure rational use of these products and hence minimize human and environmental exposure these substances cabrera et al 2008 di guardo and finizio 2015 queiroz et al 2013 ribeiro et al 2007 estimation of contamination risk has been the primary method for

crop applications and toxicological and environmental classifications from table 1 it can be observed that 59 commercial products are commonly used in the study area with 29 49 2 pesticides 17 28 8 herbicides and 13 22 0 fungicides there are 61 ais throughout all formulated products belonging to 29 different chemical classes of these 10 16 4 belong to the organophosphorus class 9 14 8 to the pyrethoid class and 6 9 8 to the triazole class a total of 33 55 9 commercial products are considered extremely or highly toxic classes i and ii which include formulated products belonging to organophosphorus and pyrethroid chemical classes although no studies have been found examining exposure to pesticides among agricultural workers of the arsb potential exposure to these pyrethroid and organophosphates is worrying as these represent 55 9 of ais and spray application is the method commonly used in the region de araújo et al 2007 reported high prevalence of signs and symptoms related to pesticide exposure among rural workers of the agricultural community with oscillations between periods of planting and crop harvesting workers over exposed to pyrethroids showed symptoms of facial flushing tearing rhinorrhea eye irritation and contact dermatitis toxicology test results also revealed episodes of mild and moderate acute intoxication to organophosphates there were also diagnosed cases of delayed neuropathy neurobehavioral syndrome and neuropsychiatric disorders associated with chronic use of organophosphorus copind i and ii the environmental classification of these products also raises concern with 42 71 2 formulated products distributed between classes i and ii product highly dangerous and very dangerous to the environment among these are formulated products containing the ais cypermethrin pyrethroid epoxiconazole triazole and chlorpyrifos organophosphate which have respective half life times in soil dt50 soil of 23 354 and 386 days chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin have half life times in water dt50 water of 53 5 to 70 days while epoxiconazole is stable ppdb 2018 although solar radiation temperature and soil microorganisms may alter the values of these half life times in the environment dt50 values in soil and water are useful for inferring the time needed for such ingredients to be degraded in nature hiller et al 2008 mackay et al 1997 shuai et al 2012 in general the greater the dt50 value for a molecule the greater its stability and therefore the longer its permanence in the soil or water the products discussed above can be distributed in soil or water and may cause health problems for the population either in their original form or as metabolites through inhalation of gases or particles water or food ingestion or skin absorption alavanja and bonner 2012 boas et al 2012 piccoli et al 2016 quansah et al 2016 recena et al 2006 fish invertebrates and algae can accumulate pesticides and or metabolites through water or contaminated food or contact with sediment as a result they may suffer adverse effects over short medium or long terms while continuing to transfer these chemical agents through the food chain jonsson and castro 2005 stehle and schulz 2015 taking into consideration dt50 values and the fact that products formulated with chlorpyrifos and epoxiconazole are applied during the rainy season the chance of these molecules reaching municipal water supply within the irb should be considered concern about surface water and groundwater contamination is particularly significant because of risks related to population health given that municipalities of the irb have around 506 000 inhabitants ibge 2013 late effects of intoxication on human health are difficult to predict due to methodological difficulties of extrapolating results however genotoxicity deserves special attention due to its irreversible nature bolognesi 2003 nunes and tajara 1998 salvagni et al 2011 these results emphasize the need for more detailed studies in the arsb and to review of the use of pesticides in agricultural activities in the region 3 1 risk of contamination of water by pesticides used in coffee production the importance of coffee to the southern espírito santo state is evident from table 1 which shows that 62 7 of all pesticides marketed in the region are used in coffee plantations these commercial products involve 38 ais distributed across 19 different chemical classes of which 8 21 0 7 18 4 and 4 10 5 belong to pyrethroid organophosphorus and triazole classes respectively of these 38 ais 10 26 3 20 52 6 and 4 10 5 were classified as having high medium and low respective potential for surface water contamination through sediment gsed while 11 28 9 19 50 0 and 4 10 5 were considered to have high medium and low potential for surface water contamination via dissolution gdis in water table 2 among the ais shown in table 2 17 44 7 showed high potential for contamination by at least one means of transport gsed and gdis and therefore have a higher risk of reaching surface water in the study area ametryne cyproconazole chlorpyrifos deltamethrin paraquat dichloride diuron endosulfan epoxiconazole esfenvalerate ethion flutriafol copper ii hydroxide iprodione pendimethalin thiamethoxam triadimenol and triazophos should be avoided when the coffee plantation is near to surface water streams springs and watercourses it is also recommended that these active ingredients are prioritized in environmental monitoring studies in the region the results of contamination risk analysis for surface water and groundwater were inconclusive for boscalid cartap hydrochloride aluminum phosphide and lufenuron since not all necessary information was available in the literature data not shown these ais correspond to 10 5 of the total it is recommended that they are used with caution in regional coffee growing in areas with conditions that render them susceptible to water contamination ais considered potential groundwater contaminants were acetochlor aldicarb ametryne cyproconazole diuron epoxiconazole flutriafol triadimenol and triazophos these accounted for 23 7 of the total pesticides used in regional coffee growing table 2 cohen et al 1995 noted that detailed studies should be conducted on compounds considered potential contaminants or which are identified by the gus index as belonging to the transition zone between potential and non contaminant compounds on the other hand compounds classified as non contaminants may be considered unlikely leaching candidates dores and de lamonica freire 2001 it is thus recommended that use of alachlor azocyclotin chlorpyrifos deltamethrin disulfoton endosulfan flumioxazin permethrin profenofos α cypermethrin β cyfluthrin and λ cyhalothrin needs to be prioritized in agricultural practices in areas with higher risk of contamination analysis of ais that qualified as non contaminants of groundwater under one criterion but as potential contaminants under another was considered inconclusive these ais were cypermethrin paraquat dichloride fenpropathrin glyphosate copper ii hydroxide pendimethalin piridafenthion and thiamethoxam ametryne cyproconazole diuron epoxiconazole flutriafol triadimenol and triazophos pose a contamination risk to both surface water and groundwater in the coffee growing region of the arsb table 2 of these 4 10 5 of total are triazoles and fall within the environmental classes ii and iii product very dangerous to the environment although climatic conditions topography and pesticide management may also influence water contamination by pesticides results obtained from this contamination risk analysis are consistent with those obtained from laboratory analysis of ais in tropical countries laabs et al 2002 primel et al 2005 primel et al 2005 evaluated contamination potential in order to select herbicide ais that pose a higher risk of water contamination in an irrigated rice growing region in order to prepare a monitoring program minimizing cost and time for development during laboratory analyses the authors found that clomazone and propanil were the most common ais at sampling stations confirming the contamination risk analysis results laabs et al 2002 conducted a laboratory study to evaluate pesticide leaching potential in latosols these authors found that chlorpyrifos endosulfan and λ cyhalothrin present no risk of groundwater contamination since they remain adsorbed on the surface layer of soil between 0 15 cm similar results were obtained in the present study the results from table 2 show that 44 7 and 23 7 of ais used in the coffee growing region present a high risk of reaching surface water and groundwater respectively it is not a favorable scenario given that coffee is the main source of income for about 68 of rural properties in espírito santo state and that this activity involves familial labor and provides around 500 000 jobs of which 70 are exercised by micro and small producers ferrão et al 2007 adoption of an integrated pest management ipm program by coffee growers represents an alternative to change the above mentioned scenario given that it contributes to reducing pesticide use the exposure of rural workers and the environment to these products and in global terms favors healthier foods an ipm approach incorporates a range of management decisions and resources to reduce insects disease and weed and could ensure the sustainability weeds ensuring sustainable coffee production in ipm programs chemical control is only used when the target organism reaches a level that promotes significant economic losses in crop productivity aristizábal et al 2016 silva and carvalho 2004 the analysis of coffee agroecosystems under conventional management and organic plantations realized by familial labor in southern of minas gerais state showed that organic production had the highest average productivity of the systems 45 bags ha 1 and that the price for a bag of coffee from the organic plantation was two times higher than from conventional management the authors showed that the control of the populations of coffee leaf miner leucoptera coffeella lepidoptera lyonetiidae and coffee berry borer hypothenemus hampei coleoptera curculionidae scolytinae in organic plantations was kept below the economic injury level by using castor bean bran bovine manure industrial organic products and wind breaks with bananas instead of conventional agrochemicals lopes et al 2012 the espírito santo state government has been seeking to develop and expand projects focused on agricultural production in organic agroecosystems as an alternative to conventional farming systems seag 2008 however there is still a prevalence of conventional production systems given that there is much information on coffee pest management practices available at research institutions but only a small amount of this reaches the farmers 3 2 surface entrainment and leaching potential table 3 shows concentration values for 17 ais that pose a high risk of contamination to surface water and 9 ais that are potential groundwater contaminants near the study area according to the results of table 3 it can be observed that the concentration values of the active ingredients in surface water were higher than the values of these in groundwater these results are directly related to the characteristics of the study area fig 3 which presents land use characterized by pasture fig 3c and f average elevation of 867 14 m fig 3g and j strongly undulating relief with average slope of 39 11 fig 3 and k and water flow direction tending to the east 26 66 fig 3i and l when farming occurs in areas with accentuated slope and good drainage ai runoff is favored compromising surface water especially when it is located near to the pesticide application site on the other hand areas with low slope high rainfall good drainage and low soil organic matter content favor percolation of ais through the soil increasing the risk of contamination of springs and artesian wells di guardo and finizio 2015 gomes et al 2002 paz and rubio 2006 reemtsma et al 2013 the concentration of ais in water is not only related to the value of loss after application and or to the amount of product applied in the field the type of soil and the physical chemical properties of the ai koc solubility and half life times in water dt50 water are also relevant factors that influence water contamination despite the amount g ha 1 of copper ii hydroxide applied in the field 1 479 50 is higher than the amount of the ais flutriafol 625 00 triazophos 400 00 triadimenol 250 00 and cyproconazole 125 00 the concentration value for copper ii hydroxide in surface water 1 85 μg l 1 is the lowest among these ais table 3 results for copper ii hydroxide corroborate those obtained by contamination risk analysis of surface waters since the potential contamination of this ai is greater when associated with sediment gsed than when dissolved in water gdis table 2 because copper ii hydroxide has higher transportation potential associated with sediment it is expected that its concentration value in surface water is actually lower than the other ais conversely the ais flutriafol triazophos triadimenol and cyproconazole have higher transportation potential when dissolved in water and higher concentration values in surface waters than copper ii hydroxide tables 2 and 3 the association of ai with sediment through adsorption is a process that affects the transport of pesticides determining the amount of these substances that is retained on the soil surface and reducing their mobility and hence concentration in water hiller et al 2008 shuai et al 2012 sparks 2002 according to lopes et al 2014 the maximum capacity of copper ii adsorption is high in latosols and this process seems to be specific and preferential to adsorption sites of oxides and hydroxides of highly weathered soils although the highest pesticide dose 4 900 g ha 1 in the study area was for that containing endosulfan the concentration value of this ai in surface water 6 14 μg l 1 is lower than that of ametryne 123 40 μg l 1 and thiamethoxam 111 80 μg l 1 this may be due to the solubility and dt50 in water of the ai in question both ametryne 200 mg l 1 and thiamethoxam 4 100 mg l 1 present solubility values in water higher than those of endosulfan 0 32 mg l 1 the value of dt50 water for endosulfan is 20 days while ametryne and thiamethoxam are stable ppdb 2018 among the ais presented in table 3 the highest concentration values μg l 1 in surface waters were observed for ais ametryne 123 40 thiamethoxam 111 80 iprodione 47 26 flutriafol 36 30 and triazophos 13 98 the others presented values between 6 14 and 0 00241 μg l 1 the ai concentration values adopted as a reference for water potability varied depending on country and region decree 2 914 2011 establishes threshold concentration values for water destined for human consumption but only for some of the pesticide ais marketed in brazil these include chlorpyrifos 30 μg l 1 diuron 90 μg l 1 endosulfan 20 μg l 1 and pendimethalin 20 μg l 1 with respect to decree 2 914 2011 the ais chlorpyrifos diuron endosulfan and pendimethalin meet the drinking water standard however according to an eu resolution the maximum level of each ai in water destined for human consumption cannot exceed 0 1 μg l 1 with a maximum value of 0 5 μg l 1 for the sum of all ais european union 2014 considering that the concentration values of 15 ais related in table 3 are higher than 0 1 μg l 1 there is a risk to human health mainly when the coffee plantation is closer to surface water such as springs and watercourses laabs et al 2002 primel et al 2005 stehle and schulz 2015 as shown in table 3 the pesticides with the higher values of loss by leaching in the soil profile g ha 1 were those containing the ais flutriafol 251 50 cyproconazole 3 72 10 5 triadimenol 8 05 10 6 and epoxiconazole 2 22 10 6 these ais also have the highest concentrations in groundwater μg l 1 20 30 3 01 10 6 6 49 10 7 and 1 79 10 7 respectively the highest leaching potentials were observed for flutriafol and cyproconazole despite their low application doses given that the risk of contamination of groundwater was tested for all the ais using the same scenario soil characteristics terrain slope plant interception and runoff the leaching potential values for these ais is related to their physical chemical properties both flutriafol 205 ml g 1 and cyproconazole 364 ml g 1 show low values for soil organic matter adsorption coefficient koc and high dt50 soil values in terms of the dt50 water values both were stable supplementary material 6 the ais chlorpyrifos ethion and triazophos were found to be potentially toxic with concentrations higher than ec50 values for daphnia magna aquatic invertebrates and the ametryne and diuron for algae the concentration values of other ais were below the values used as ecotoxicity parameters table 3 ecotoxicological parameters are evaluated in water quality monitoring programs in river basins of some brazilian states in minas gerais state the institute of water management of minas gerais igam performs ecotoxicity tests in areas where there is a predominance of pesticide reliant agriculture using microcrustacean d magna as a bioindicator igam 2016 however there have not yet been ecotoxicological tests to check water quality in areas surrounding the agricultural regions of espírito santo state potential impacts on population health are of concern when considering other contamination indicators from the coffee growing region of the arsb in a study examining the water quality of the alegre river zonta et al 2008 defined sampling stations based on land use in adjacent areas with a predominance of pesticide reliant agriculture the authors observed that the water quality index wqi ranged from bad to average at different points and at different times of the year and concluded that water quality is seriously compromised by human activities there was an increase in total phosphorus values at all points for samples obtained during the month of december this can probably be explained by phosphorus entrainment by surface runoff likely originating from fertilization performed in cultivation areas surrounding the arsb although the authors did not conduct environmental monitoring of pesticide ais in their study the possibility of surface entrainment of these ais cannot be ruled out when considering the above mentioned results neves et al 2008 observed that almost all the rural population that lives in the region near the arsb is supplied by groundwater the authors reported that the majority of the water wells presented lack of maintenance and some of them were located in the foothills surrounding coffee plantations alongside pigsties or polluted rivers another factor noted by the authors was the lack of awareness of the majority of users regarding the connection between surface water and groundwater with the belief that because the water table lies at depth it will always be protected from contamination based on these results and given the evidence of surface water contamination by agricultural pesticides along with the contamination of the water supply used by the rural population use of the studied ais in the region should be reviewed since the majority of these chemicals pose a high risk of contamination to surface water 4 conclusion this study represents the first environmental risk assessment for pesticides used in coffee growing practices in southern espírito santo brazil the present data suggests that both local residents and the environment may be at high risk of contamination this is due to pesticide application during the hot rainy season and the region s characteristics such as high rainfall areas with steep slopes good drainage low organic matter content in the soil and the presence of streams and wells near coffee plantations which make it susceptible to surface water and groundwater contamination these results highlight the need for reviewing agricultural practices and developing an accurate assessment of water quality regarding human consumption in the study area

1622,the extensive use of pesticides in agricultural practices has been associated with human health problems and environmental contamination worldwide brazil is the largest consumer of pesticides in the world and espírito santo state stands out as the second brazilian producer of coffee however there is no information about environmental impact of coffee producing at itapemirim river basin irb region espírito santo state brazil hence a simple and quick method using open access softwares agroscre and araquá web to estimate surface entrainment and pesticide leaching potential was carried out agroscre evaluates the contamination risk of superficial and groundwater by active ingredients ais using goss method gus index and us epa criteria while araquá web estimates ai concentrations in water resources indicating their suitability based on water quality requirements for different uses regarding pesticides used in coffee plantations there is 44 7 chance of surface water and 23 7 chance of groundwater contamination results showed that ametryne cyproconazole diuron epoxiconazole flutriafol triadimenol and triazophos pose contamination risk to both surface water and groundwater in the irb region of these 10 5 of the total ais are triazoles and fall under environmental classes ii and iii product very dangerous to the environment the ais ametryne thiamethoxam iprodione flutriafol triazophos endosulfan triadimenol cyproconazole diuron pendimethalin chlorpyrifos copper ii hydroxide etion epoxiconazole and paraquat dichloride were found to be potentially toxic presenting environmental concentrations ranging from 123 40 μg l 1 to 0 14 μg l 1 which are higher than the safety standard for potable water 0 1 μg l 1 with respect to these ais chlorpyrifos ethion and triazophos showed concentrations higher than ec50 values for aquatic invertebrates and ametryne and diuron for algae thus local residents and environment may be at high risk of pesticide exposure when these ais are used in coffee plantations next to surface water or groundwater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords agrochemicals contamination surface waters leaching potential mathematical modelling 1 introduction pesticides have been extensively used in agriculture to prevent and control pests baird 2002 kellogg et al 2002 it is believed that two thirds of the world population is exposed to their harmful effects either by labor activity or consumption of contaminated food peres et al 2005 de souza et al 2011 stehle and schulz 2015 although the risk of pesticides to humans through acute or cumulative exposure is not well understood scientific evidence shows that these products can cause often irreversible damage including late neuropathy by overexposure to organophosphates bolognesi 2003 salvagni et al 2011 de souza et al 2011 in recent years the use of pesticides in brazil has increased according to the latest data from the union of national industry products for agricultural defense brazil is the largest consumer of pesticides in the world sindag 2012 while the global consumption of pesticides increased by 96 7 between 2000 and 2010 brazilian consumption increased 189 6 for the same period sindag 2012 even in small amounts these products pose a risk for human health and the environment due to their mobility and persistence baird 2002 bozzo et al 2013 funari and vighi 1995 shuai et al 2012 this risk is aggravated when they are used in sensitive environments such as near to streams rivers dams and artesian wells andrade et al 2011 di guardo and finizio 2015 hall et al 2015 hiller et al 2008 queiroz et al 2013 the southern region of espírito santo state is composed of 16 municipalities with an area of 6 610 km2 including the itapemirim river basin irb the main agricultural activity in the region is coffee growing which comprises approximately 16 of agricultural production and comprises 22 of the total area planted with coffee within espírito santo state ibge 2013 seag 2008 the natural characteristics of the region together with the intensive pesticide use makes the local residents susceptible to contamination from pesticides calçavara and nascimento 2009 do nascimento et al 2006 seag 2008 although brazilian legislation sets limits on permissible pesticide concentrations in water intended for human consumption brazilian concessionaires of water and sewerage are not required to carry out such analyses brasil 2005 2004 environmental risk assessment is thus of utmost importance since to our knowledge there is no laboratory testing for pesticide presence in the southern region of the espírito santo state in addition it is the initial step required to ensure rational use of these products and hence minimize human and environmental exposure these substances cabrera et al 2008 di guardo and finizio 2015 queiroz et al 2013 ribeiro et al 2007 estimation of contamination risk has been the primary method for selecting agrochemically active ingredients ais and should be prioritized during laboratory analysis in order to avoid field tests which are more time consuming and cost intensive andrade et al 2011 cohen et al 1995 goss 1992 gustafson 1989 paz and rubio 2006 primel et al 2005 in this context the present study was performed with open access softwares to simply and quickly estimate the risk of

pesticide contamination oxisols predominant in the study area have good drainage and are poor in organic matter brasil 1999 the presence of oxisols in areas near springs and artesian wells favors vertical movement of solutes and hence groundwater contamination gomes and spadotto 2004 hall et al 2015 hiller et al 2008 2 2 environmental risk assessment the methodological flowchart containing the three steps required for the implementation of the methodology is shown in fig 2 2 3 step 1 characterization of the pesticides and active ingredients two semi structured questionnaires were used to investigate pesticide use in the region as well as the form and time of application one was addressed to retail outlets and cooperatives that sell pesticides in the region supplementary material 1 and the other to landowners and rural workers supplementary material 2 the identification of the ai and its toxicological and environmental classifications was performed in consultation with the

crop applications and toxicological and environmental classifications from table 1 it can be observed that 59 commercial products are commonly used in the study area with 29 49 2 pesticides 17 28 8 herbicides and 13 22 0 fungicides there are 61 ais throughout all formulated products belonging to 29 different chemical classes of these 10 16 4 belong to the organophosphorus class 9 14 8 to the pyrethoid class and 6 9 8 to the triazole class a total of 33 55 9 commercial products are considered extremely or highly toxic classes i and ii which include formulated products belonging to organophosphorus and pyrethroid chemical classes although no studies have been found examining exposure to pesticides among agricultural workers of the arsb potential exposure to these pyrethroid and organophosphates is worrying as these represent 55 9 of ais and spray application is the method commonly used in the region de araújo et al 2007 reported high prevalence of signs and symptoms related to pesticide exposure among rural workers of the agricultural community with oscillations between periods of planting and crop harvesting workers over exposed to pyrethroids showed symptoms of facial flushing tearing rhinorrhea eye irritation and contact dermatitis toxicology test results also revealed episodes of mild and moderate acute intoxication to organophosphates there were also diagnosed cases of delayed neuropathy neurobehavioral syndrome and neuropsychiatric disorders associated with chronic use of organophosphorus copind i and ii the environmental classification of these products also raises concern with 42 71 2 formulated products distributed between classes i and ii product highly dangerous and very dangerous to the environment among these are formulated products containing the ais cypermethrin pyrethroid epoxiconazole triazole and chlorpyrifos organophosphate which have respective half life times in soil dt50 soil of 23 354 and 386 days chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin have half life times in water dt50 water of 53 5 to 70 days while epoxiconazole is stable ppdb 2018 although solar radiation temperature and soil microorganisms may alter the values of these half life times in the environment dt50 values in soil and water are useful for inferring the time needed for such ingredients to be degraded in nature hiller et al 2008 mackay et al 1997 shuai et al 2012 in general the greater the dt50 value for a molecule the greater its stability and therefore the longer its permanence in the soil or water the products discussed above can be distributed in soil or water and may cause health problems for the population either in their original form or as metabolites through inhalation of gases or particles water or food ingestion or skin absorption alavanja and bonner 2012 boas et al 2012 piccoli et al 2016 quansah et al 2016 recena et al 2006 fish invertebrates and algae can accumulate pesticides and or metabolites through water or contaminated food or contact with sediment as a result they may suffer adverse effects over short medium or long terms while continuing to transfer these chemical agents through the food chain jonsson and castro 2005 stehle and schulz 2015 taking into consideration dt50 values and the fact that products formulated with chlorpyrifos and epoxiconazole are applied during the rainy season the chance of these molecules reaching municipal water supply within the irb should be considered concern about surface water and groundwater contamination is particularly significant because of risks related to population health given that municipalities of the irb have around 506 000 inhabitants ibge 2013 late effects of intoxication on human health are difficult to predict due to methodological difficulties of extrapolating results however genotoxicity deserves special attention due to its irreversible nature bolognesi 2003 nunes and tajara 1998 salvagni et al 2011 these results emphasize the need for more detailed studies in the arsb and to review of the use of pesticides in agricultural activities in the region 3 1 risk of contamination of water by pesticides used in coffee production the importance of coffee to the southern espírito santo state is evident from table 1 which shows that 62 7 of all pesticides marketed in the region are used in coffee plantations these commercial products involve 38 ais distributed across 19 different chemical classes of which 8 21 0 7 18 4 and 4 10 5 belong to pyrethroid organophosphorus and triazole classes respectively of these 38 ais 10 26 3 20 52 6 and 4 10 5 were classified as having high medium and low respective potential for surface water contamination through sediment gsed while 11 28 9 19 50 0 and 4 10 5 were considered to have high medium and low potential for surface water contamination via dissolution gdis in water table 2 among the ais shown in table 2 17 44 7 showed high potential for contamination by at least one means of transport gsed and gdis and therefore have a higher risk of reaching surface water in the study area ametryne cyproconazole chlorpyrifos deltamethrin paraquat dichloride diuron endosulfan epoxiconazole esfenvalerate ethion flutriafol copper ii hydroxide iprodione pendimethalin thiamethoxam triadimenol and triazophos should be avoided when the coffee plantation is near to surface water streams springs and watercourses it is also recommended that these active ingredients are prioritized in environmental monitoring studies in the region the results of contamination risk analysis for surface water and groundwater were inconclusive for boscalid cartap hydrochloride aluminum phosphide and lufenuron since not all necessary information was available in the literature data not shown these ais correspond to 10 5 of the total it is recommended that they are used with caution in regional coffee growing in areas with conditions that render them susceptible to water contamination ais considered potential groundwater contaminants were acetochlor aldicarb ametryne cyproconazole diuron epoxiconazole flutriafol triadimenol and triazophos these accounted for 23 7 of the total pesticides used in regional coffee growing table 2 cohen et al 1995 noted that detailed studies should be conducted on compounds considered potential contaminants or which are identified by the gus index as belonging to the transition zone between potential and non contaminant compounds on the other hand compounds classified as non contaminants may be considered unlikely leaching candidates dores and de lamonica freire 2001 it is thus recommended that use of alachlor azocyclotin chlorpyrifos deltamethrin disulfoton endosulfan flumioxazin permethrin profenofos α cypermethrin β cyfluthrin and λ cyhalothrin needs to be prioritized in agricultural practices in areas with higher risk of contamination analysis of ais that qualified as non contaminants of groundwater under one criterion but as potential contaminants under another was considered inconclusive these ais were cypermethrin paraquat dichloride fenpropathrin glyphosate copper ii hydroxide pendimethalin piridafenthion and thiamethoxam ametryne cyproconazole diuron epoxiconazole flutriafol triadimenol and triazophos pose a contamination risk to both surface water and groundwater in the coffee growing region of the arsb table 2 of these 4 10 5 of total are triazoles and fall within the environmental classes ii and iii product very dangerous to the environment although climatic conditions topography and pesticide management may also influence water contamination by pesticides results obtained from this contamination risk analysis are consistent with those obtained from laboratory analysis of ais in tropical countries laabs et al 2002 primel et al 2005 primel et al 2005 evaluated contamination potential in order to select herbicide ais that pose a higher risk of water contamination in an irrigated rice growing region in order to prepare a monitoring program minimizing cost and time for development during laboratory analyses the authors found that clomazone and propanil were the most common ais at sampling stations confirming the contamination risk analysis results laabs et al 2002 conducted a laboratory study to evaluate pesticide leaching potential in latosols these authors found that chlorpyrifos endosulfan and λ cyhalothrin present no risk of groundwater contamination since they remain adsorbed on the surface layer of soil between 0 15 cm similar results were obtained in the present study the results from table 2 show that 44 7 and 23 7 of ais used in the coffee growing region present a high risk of reaching surface water and groundwater respectively it is not a favorable scenario given that coffee is the main source of income for about 68 of rural properties in espírito santo state and that this activity involves familial labor and provides around 500 000 jobs of which 70 are exercised by micro and small producers ferrão et al 2007 adoption of an integrated pest management ipm program by coffee growers represents an alternative to change the above mentioned scenario given that it contributes to reducing pesticide use the exposure of rural workers and the environment to these products and in global terms favors healthier foods an ipm approach incorporates a range of management decisions and resources to reduce insects disease and weed and could ensure the sustainability weeds ensuring sustainable coffee production in ipm programs chemical control is only used when the target organism reaches a level that promotes significant economic losses in crop productivity aristizábal et al 2016 silva and carvalho 2004 the analysis of coffee agroecosystems under conventional management and organic plantations realized by familial labor in southern of minas gerais state showed that organic production had the highest average productivity of the systems 45 bags ha 1 and that the price for a bag of coffee from the organic plantation was two times higher than from conventional management the authors showed that the control of the populations of coffee leaf miner leucoptera coffeella lepidoptera lyonetiidae and coffee berry borer hypothenemus hampei coleoptera curculionidae scolytinae in organic plantations was kept below the economic injury level by using castor bean bran bovine manure industrial organic products and wind breaks with bananas instead of conventional agrochemicals lopes et al 2012 the espírito santo state government has been seeking to develop and expand projects focused on agricultural production in organic agroecosystems as an alternative to conventional farming systems seag 2008 however there is still a prevalence of conventional production systems given that there is much information on coffee pest management practices available at research institutions but only a small amount of this reaches the farmers 3 2 surface entrainment and leaching potential table 3 shows concentration values for 17 ais that pose a high risk of contamination to surface water and 9 ais that are potential groundwater contaminants near the study area according to the results of table 3 it can be observed that the concentration values of the active ingredients in surface water were higher than the values of these in groundwater these results are directly related to the characteristics of the study area fig 3 which presents land use characterized by pasture fig 3c and f average elevation of 867 14 m fig 3g and j strongly undulating relief with average slope of 39 11 fig 3 and k and water flow direction tending to the east 26 66 fig 3i and l when farming occurs in areas with accentuated slope and good drainage ai runoff is favored compromising surface water especially when it is located near to the pesticide application site on the other hand areas with low slope high rainfall good drainage and low soil organic matter content favor percolation of ais through the soil increasing the risk of contamination of springs and artesian wells di guardo and finizio 2015 gomes et al 2002 paz and rubio 2006 reemtsma et al 2013 the concentration of ais in water is not only related to the value of loss after application and or to the amount of product applied in the field the type of soil and the physical chemical properties of the ai koc solubility and half life times in water dt50 water are also relevant factors that influence water contamination despite the amount g ha 1 of copper ii hydroxide applied in the field 1 479 50 is higher than the amount of the ais flutriafol 625 00 triazophos 400 00 triadimenol 250 00 and cyproconazole 125 00 the concentration value for copper ii hydroxide in surface water 1 85 μg l 1 is the lowest among these ais table 3 results for copper ii hydroxide corroborate those obtained by contamination risk analysis of surface waters since the potential contamination of this ai is greater when associated with sediment gsed than when dissolved in water gdis table 2 because copper ii hydroxide has higher transportation potential associated with sediment it is expected that its concentration value in surface water is actually lower than the other ais conversely the ais flutriafol triazophos triadimenol and cyproconazole have higher transportation potential when dissolved in water and higher concentration values in surface waters than copper ii hydroxide tables 2 and 3 the association of ai with sediment through adsorption is a process that affects the transport of pesticides determining the amount of these substances that is retained on the soil surface and reducing their mobility and hence concentration in water hiller et al 2008 shuai et al 2012 sparks 2002 according to lopes et al 2014 the maximum capacity of copper ii adsorption is high in latosols and this process seems to be specific and preferential to adsorption sites of oxides and hydroxides of highly weathered soils although the highest pesticide dose 4 900 g ha 1 in the study area was for that containing endosulfan the concentration value of this ai in surface water 6 14 μg l 1 is lower than that of ametryne 123 40 μg l 1 and thiamethoxam 111 80 μg l 1 this may be due to the solubility and dt50 in water of the ai in question both ametryne 200 mg l 1 and thiamethoxam 4 100 mg l 1 present solubility values in water higher than those of endosulfan 0 32 mg l 1 the value of dt50 water for endosulfan is 20 days while ametryne and thiamethoxam are stable ppdb 2018 among the ais presented in table 3 the highest concentration values μg l 1 in surface waters were observed for ais ametryne 123 40 thiamethoxam 111 80 iprodione 47 26 flutriafol 36 30 and triazophos 13 98 the others presented values between 6 14 and 0 00241 μg l 1 the ai concentration values adopted as a reference for water potability varied depending on country and region decree 2 914 2011 establishes threshold concentration values for water destined for human consumption but only for some of the pesticide ais marketed in brazil these include chlorpyrifos 30 μg l 1 diuron 90 μg l 1 endosulfan 20 μg l 1 and pendimethalin 20 μg l 1 with respect to decree 2 914 2011 the ais chlorpyrifos diuron endosulfan and pendimethalin meet the drinking water standard however according to an eu resolution the maximum level of each ai in water destined for human consumption cannot exceed 0 1 μg l 1 with a maximum value of 0 5 μg l 1 for the sum of all ais european union 2014 considering that the concentration values of 15 ais related in table 3 are higher than 0 1 μg l 1 there is a risk to human health mainly when the coffee plantation is closer to surface water such as springs and watercourses laabs et al 2002 primel et al 2005 stehle and schulz 2015 as shown in table 3 the pesticides with the higher values of loss by leaching in the soil profile g ha 1 were those containing the ais flutriafol 251 50 cyproconazole 3 72 10 5 triadimenol 8 05 10 6 and epoxiconazole 2 22 10 6 these ais also have the highest concentrations in groundwater μg l 1 20 30 3 01 10 6 6 49 10 7 and 1 79 10 7 respectively the highest leaching potentials were observed for flutriafol and cyproconazole despite their low application doses given that the risk of contamination of groundwater was tested for all the ais using the same scenario soil characteristics terrain slope plant interception and runoff the leaching potential values for these ais is related to their physical chemical properties both flutriafol 205 ml g 1 and cyproconazole 364 ml g 1 show low values for soil organic matter adsorption coefficient koc and high dt50 soil values in terms of the dt50 water values both were stable supplementary material 6 the ais chlorpyrifos ethion and triazophos were found to be potentially toxic with concentrations higher than ec50 values for daphnia magna aquatic invertebrates and the ametryne and diuron for algae the concentration values of other ais were below the values used as ecotoxicity parameters table 3 ecotoxicological parameters are evaluated in water quality monitoring programs in river basins of some brazilian states in minas gerais state the institute of water management of minas gerais igam performs ecotoxicity tests in areas where there is a predominance of pesticide reliant agriculture using microcrustacean d magna as a bioindicator igam 2016 however there have not yet been ecotoxicological tests to check water quality in areas surrounding the agricultural regions of espírito santo state potential impacts on population health are of concern when considering other contamination indicators from the coffee growing region of the arsb in a study examining the water quality of the alegre river zonta et al 2008 defined sampling stations based on land use in adjacent areas with a predominance of pesticide reliant agriculture the authors observed that the water quality index wqi ranged from bad to average at different points and at different times of the year and concluded that water quality is seriously compromised by human activities there was an increase in total phosphorus values at all points for samples obtained during the month of december this can probably be explained by phosphorus entrainment by surface runoff likely originating from fertilization performed in cultivation areas surrounding the arsb although the authors did not conduct environmental monitoring of pesticide ais in their study the possibility of surface entrainment of these ais cannot be ruled out when considering the above mentioned results neves et al 2008 observed that almost all the rural population that lives in the region near the arsb is supplied by groundwater the authors reported that the majority of the water wells presented lack of maintenance and some of them were located in the foothills surrounding coffee plantations alongside pigsties or polluted rivers another factor noted by the authors was the lack of awareness of the majority of users regarding the connection between surface water and groundwater with the belief that because the water table lies at depth it will always be protected from contamination based on these results and given the evidence of surface water contamination by agricultural pesticides along with the contamination of the water supply used by the rural population use of the studied ais in the region should be reviewed since the majority of these chemicals pose a high risk of contamination to surface water 4 conclusion this study represents the first environmental risk assessment for pesticides used in coffee growing practices in southern espírito santo brazil the present data suggests that both local residents and the environment may be at high risk of contamination this is due to pesticide application during the hot rainy season and the region s characteristics such as high rainfall areas with steep slopes good drainage low organic matter content in the soil and the presence of streams and wells near coffee plantations which make it susceptible to surface water and groundwater contamination these results highlight the need for reviewing agricultural practices and developing an accurate assessment of water quality regarding human consumption in the study area

mass discharge or flux averaged concentration from dense nonaqueous phase liquid dnapl source zones as a function of time provide a quantitative model of dnapl source zone behavior such information is useful for calibration of screening level models to assist with site management decisions we investigate the use of historic data collected during long term monitoring ltm activities at a site in rhode island to predict the ssf based on temporal mass discharge measurements at a fixed location as well as ssf estimation using mass discharge measurements at a fixed time from three spatially distributed control planes mass discharge based on ltm data decreased from 300 g day in 1996 to 70 g day in 2012 at a control plane downgradient of the suspected dnapl source zone and indicates an overall decline of 80 in 16 years these measurements were compared to current mass discharge measurements across three spatially distributed control planes results indicate that mass discharge increased in the downgradient direction and was 6 g day 37 g day and 400 g day at near intermediate and far distances from the suspected source zone respectively this behavior was expected given the decreasing trend observed in the ltm data at a fixed location these two data sets were compared using travel time as a means to plot the data sets on a common axis the similarity between the two data sets gives greater confidence to the use of this combined data set for site specific ssf estimation relative to either the sole use of ltm or spatially distributed data sets keywords mass flux mass discharge source strength function source zone characterization passive flux meters long term monitoring data 1 introduction research conducted over the last fifteen years has shown that dense nonaqueous phase liquid dnapl source zone response and dissolution behavior are strongly influenced by the dnapl architecture sale and mcwhorter 2001 christ et al 2006 falta et al 2005a fure et al 2006 jawitz et al 2005 lemke et al 2004 parker and park 2004 consequently the utility of site management decisions based on predictive models depends on the extent to which the dnapl architecture can be appropriately and reliably quantified the dnapl architecture can generally be defined as the distribution of the dnapl relative to the distribution of pore water velocities in the flow field and a complete description of the dnapl architecture would entail a complete description of the spatial dnapl distribution and groundwater flow field field scale characterization needed to obtain the necessary level of detail to make meaningful site specific predictions of source zone behavior from a process based model with spatially distributed parameters is difficult and expensive the level of source zone characterization needed to ensure these types of models provide reliable site specific results is not collected in many cases presumably due to resource limitations data requirements needed for meaningful site specific predictions can be relaxed by adopting a stochastic modeling framework conditioned to field measurements e g troldberg et al 2012 koch and nowak 2016 however application of inverse stochastic modeling concepts requires a level of expertise and modeling resources that are not routinely used in practice as such more practical albeit less rigorous methods of dnapl source zone characterization are needed at the very least these methods could be viewed as important steps in the process of data collection and evaluation when building towards the more ambitious goals of site specific distributed parameter process based models whether deterministic or stochastic in nature over the last decade a variety of simplified screening level models have been introduced to describe dnapl source zone behavior parker and park 2004 zhu and sykes 2004 falta et al 2005a falta et al 2005b newell and adamson 2005 christ et al 2006 marble et al 2008 difilippo and brusseau 2011 johnston et al 2013 these models reduce the level of complexity of the real systems through the use of up scaled lumped parameters to represent the details of the dnapl source zone architecture and are fundamentally related because they express mass flux as a power law function of dnapl mass alternative approaches have also been proposed in which the source zone architecture is described using stream tubes with statistical distributions of travel time and dnapl saturation jawitz et al 2005 enfield et al 2005 select comparisons between models have been made by basu et al 2008 parker and falta 2008 difilippo and brusseau 2011 johnston et al 2013 and kokkinaki et al 2014 an important question to be addressed in the application of these models is what consistent and appropriate level of characterization is needed to make meaningful site specific predictions of source behavior recently flux based site management concepts have been proposed for dnapl site management purposes e g basu et al 2006 annable et al 2014 johnston et al 2014 key source zone attributes to be characterized in this framework are the spatial advective flux j ml 2 t 1 distribution flux averaged concentration c f ml 3 and mass discharge m mt 1 across control planes the term source strength function ssf is used to refer to m or c f from the dnapl source zone as a function of time the ssf is a valuable tool for site management purposes because of its use in predicting source zone behavior assessing responses to various remedial approaches and providing insights to site wide mass balance in addition it can be used to characterize other contaminant sources such as secondary diffusion domains a related relationship is that between m and the dnapl mass in the source zone which has recently been called a defining characteristic of system behavior brusseau et al 2013 these relationships are inherently a function of dnapl architecture characterization of the ssf from field data therefore provides a means to characterize the dnapl architecture a benefit for using ssf data to calibrate screening level models is that m measurements integrate information over a large spatial scale i e control plane relative to the scale of local processes and therefore match the up scaled approach of screening level models another benefit to dnapl source zone characterization using m measurements relative to the characterization of dnapl mass for example is that the latter is inherently a three dimensional problem while the former is inherently a two dimensional problem thus the scale of the domain to be investigated is reduced consequently using ssf data based on m or c f measurements is considered a beneficial approach for calibrating screening level source zone models as noted above annable et al 2014 identify five methods that might be used to estimate the ssf from field data two of which are based on m measurements at control planes oriented perpendicular to the mean groundwater flow direction one of these is based on multiple temporal measurements at a fixed location and the other is based on measurements at multiple locations at a fixed point in time difilippo and brusseau 2008 refer to the case of only two temporal measurements before and after remediation at one location as an end point analysis and reviewed results from this type of analysis for 21 remediation projects brooks et al 2008 reported results from two sites where source control planes were installed for the specific purpose of comparing pre and post remedial m measurements as an assessment of dnapl source remediation as noted by difilippo and brusseau 2008 the limitation of only two points in this approach means a higher level of uncertainty when it comes to estimating the ssf of the remaining methods identified by annable et al 2014 to estimate the ssf two are based on concentration time series data from monitoring wells at the site and differ in whether a single ssf model is fit to all data simultaneously or whether individual ssf models are fit to each well with respect to the use of concentration time series data from monitoring wells most dnapl contaminated sites have extensive multi year data sets that were collected to define the scope of the problem evaluate remediation options and meet long term monitoring ltm requirements such data sets typically include contaminant concentration time series information from at least a select set of wells and some level of testing to estimate hydraulic conductivity at one or more locations well locations however may not be ideal for the estimation of ssfs nonetheless these historic data sets are a valuable source of information and may provide rough predictions of the ssf moreover these predictions may be improved when combined with a limited number of flux measurements in select locations as an example basu et al 2009 used concentration time series data from three monitoring wells within the source zone to estimate source depletion behavior although the ssf was not estimated from explicit estimates of m the last method for estimating ssfs as identified by annable et al 2014 is based on flux averaged concentration time series data measured from one or more extraction wells examples of this method can be found in difilippo and brusseau 2008 brusseau et al 2013 johnston et al 2013 and wang et al 2014 what is particularly interesting to note about the three more recent cases based on extraction well data is that initial source mass was one of the fitting parameters in the calibration process and the estimate of the dnapl mass based on ssf calibration was comparable to independent estimates of dnapl source mass estimates of dnapl mass are important for the design and evaluation of source zone remediation systems however they can be difficult to obtain and may have high uncertainty consequently their estimation based on ssf calibration to field data offers an alternative and possibly more convenient means to obtain them to our knowledge what has not been explored to date is the characterization of the ssf using m measurements at multiple locations at a fixed point in time this approach is the central focus of this manuscript and we demonstrate ssf estimation using m measurements at a fixed time from three spatially distributed control planes at a site a comparison is provided of these results to the ssf obtained using temporal m measurements at a fixed location moreover a hybrid approach is used for the latter in which m estimates are derived predominately from a 16 year record of concentration time series data associated with ltm activities the advantages and disadvantages of each approach are evaluated and it is shown that the two approaches complement one another their combined use results in a more robust ssf estimate for site management purposes by providing two lines of evidence of source zone behavior as an illustration an exponential model is fit to the ssf data and used in a site wide mass balance assessment 2 site description and history the calf pasture point site is located in north kingstown rhode island on a coastal peninsula surrounded to the west south and east by allen harbor an entrance channel and narragansett bay respectively a site location map is shown in fig si 1 in supplementary information a description of the site geology is provided by ea engineering science and technology 1998 and church and brandon 1999 and consists of surficial sand underlain by silt till and a lower sand these unconsolidated units over lie a quartzite and phyllite bedrock that slopes to the southeast and south the thickness of the unconsolidated units above the rock vary from 9 to 30 m and the silt till and lower sand layers are discontinuous across the site however the silt and till layers were present in the immediate vicinities of the three control planes used in this study ea engineering science and technology 1998 reported hydraulic conductivities ranging from approximately 0 03 m day in the silt to 120 m day in the till an outcrop of rock occurs in the northwest portion of the site and groundwater is considered to conceptually flow in a semi radial pattern from this vicinity to the coastline the site is tidally influenced and daily variations in groundwater elevations due to tidal action range from approximately 1 m for wells close to the shoreline to 0 003 m for select inland shallow wells based on measurements completed during the study data not shown moreover salinity likewise varies from saline or brackish water at the coastline to freshwater inland church and brandon 1999 density corrections to groundwater elevations measured in the vicinities of the contaminant flux transects used in this study were deemed unnecessary based on the salinity distribution as described by church and brandon 1999 see figs si 2 and si 3 and table si 1 in supplementary information for further information the site was formerly part of the naval construction battalion center davisville which was operational from 1942 until its closure in 1994 it is estimated that between 1968 and 1974 28 000 l of a decontaminating agent non corrosive danc were buried in the region bounded by wells 04d 05d and 14d fig 1 and figures from various reports show an inferred release location immediately south of 14d e g ea engineering science and technology 2002 tetra tech 2013 site characterization activity was initiated in the mid 1980s and has continued since the limits of the dnapl source zone have not been defined through specific characterization activities to assess the presence and spatial extents of dnapl however dnapl is still suspected because recent aqueous trichloroethylene tce concentrations in monitoring well 17d with a ten foot screen section are 40 mg l or higher a record of decision for the site was signed in 1999 which specified deed restrictions and long term monitoring activities to manage the contaminant risk remedial action was taken in 2011 consisting of excavation between wells 15d and 14d shown as the cross hatched pattern in fig 1 due to the observance of a geophysical anomaly in this area the excavation extended to 1 8 m below ground surface bgs over an area of 186 m2 remnants of drums were found but no evidence of dnapl was observed it is uncertain if this activity had any impact on the ssf at the site given the absence of dnapl observations in the excavated area and the fact that the unconsolidated material extends to 11 3 m bgs or greater in this area based on the boring logs for wells 14d and 15d smart 2005 describes danc as a two part mixture a dry chlorine based powder and the solvent 1 1 2 2 tetrachloroethane pca that were mixed together when used for decontamination purposes it was reportedly stored in either 11 l or 17 l containers with two sections the top section contained the powder and the bottom section contained the solvent using a density of 1 6 g cm3 for pca montgomery 2000 the estimated mass assuming 28 000 l of pca is 45 000 kg as typically is the case the estimated release mass has a high degree of uncertainty given the predominance of tce in the plume relative to pca 1 2 dichloroethylene dce or vinyl chloride pca is presumed to rapidly degrade to tce through a hydrolysis reaction e g washington 1995 but further degradation is not considered significant at the site therefore the two main contaminants of concern for this study were pca and tce 3 methods 3 1 ssf based on

flux lt 1 and reflects the transect method for estimating mass discharge e g itrc interstate technology and regulatory council 2010 farhat et al 2011 comparisons between this method and other flux measurement methods can be found elsewhere e g brooks et al 2008 and it was selected here to specifically make use of the ltm data finally as expressed in eq 1 it was assumed that the only sources of temporal variability were c i and i i the location of the szcp relative to the source was subject to uncertainty given uncertainty in the location of the dnapl source zone for this analysis the szcp location was based on a wells with ltm data b the proximity of the wells to the inferred dnapl release location and c the location of the wells relative to the groundwater flow field the wells included in the ltm program with closest proximity to the inferred release location were 04d 05d 17d 22d and 38d fig 1 of these wells 04d 05d and 17d had the highest concentrations with 17d being highest other wells in the vicinity of the inferred release location included 03d 14d 15d and 31i but these wells were not included in the ltm program high concentrations were not noted in shallow wells near the inferred source zone and the shallow zone was therefore excluded from the ssf analysis based on ltm data consequently the szcp was primarily based on wells 04d 05d and 17d the historic high concentration wells downgradient of the inferred dnapl release area an analysis of the groundwater flow field indicated non uniform flow conditions and a curvilinear szcp was therefore used the szcp was defined to be parallel to groundwater contours based on the average groundwater elevation groundwater elevations from 23 measurement episodes completed between july 1995 and april 2010 were averaged at each well location within the d horizon not all wells were measured within each episode and that information was used with a kriging algorithm in a commercial software contouring package surfer to generate groundwater elevation contours fig 1 finally consideration was given in the placement of the szcp to generally minimize the distance of the wells from the szcp resulting in the szcp as shown in fig 1 once the szcp was established the well locations were projected either upstream or downstream along flowlines perpendicular to the average groundwater elevation contours the resulting szcp consisted of three interior wells 04d 05d and 17d with end locations defined by 03d to the east and 10d to the west the two end well locations were assumed to have zero concentrations for the purposes of estimating the ssf based on historic data due to the low concentrations measured in these wells relative to the interior wells roughly 1 or less the horizontal length of the szcp assigned to each well was equal to one half the distance to each neighboring well along the curvilinear szcp the total length of the szcp was 100 m with an average well spacing of 34 m information was not available on the vertical distribution of contaminant near the inferred source zone therefore the vertical depth was assumed to equal the 3 05 m screened interval of the wells the relatively small variability in the groundwater elevations coefficient of variations 25 near the inferred source area suggested temporal variability in i i may not be significant moreover when considering the importance of temporal variability short term sporadic behavior is of less importance compared to long term trends in the development of screening level models for source behavior from ltm data comparisons of the linear trend line to the average water elevation in wells near the inferred source zone 03d 04d 05d 15d and 17d did show a gradual increase in water elevation over time see fig si 4 in supplementary information therefore as further assessment a plane was fit to the water elevation data from these five wells using multiple linear regression for 22 measurement episodes the first was neglected due to missing measurements the magnitude and direction of the plane vector serves as a measure of the hydraulic gradient magnitude and direction next a linear control plane was defined to be perpendicular to the mean direction of the hydraulic gradient variations in the direction of the hydraulic gradient were accounted for by calculating the component of the hydraulic gradient normal to the control plane results are shown in fig 2 while short term variability is evident the long term trend in the data as represented by the linear trend line is only slightly different from the average hydraulic gradient of 0 0094 consequently temporal variations in i i t were neglected and a temporally averaged estimate for each well hereafter denoted as i i was used evaluation of the average groundwater elevation contours fig 1 yielded well specific estimates of i i 0 01 for 04d 05d and 17d each values of k i 0 03 1 4 0 98 m day were used for wells 04d 05d and 17d respectively and were from slug test results reported by ea engineering science and technology 1998 the resulting well specific groundwater flux estimates were q i 0 03 1 40 0 98 cm day for wells 04d 05d and 17d respectively where the tilde is used to indicate an estimate based on i i the concentration time series for wells 04d 05d and 17d consisted of twelve measurements associated with ltm activities between 1996 and 2012 see fig si 5 in supplementary information calculations for m were based on the sum of dce tce and pca where dce and pca were converted to an equivalent tce mass concentration on a molar basis because tce is the predominant contaminant in the plume other chlorinated chemical species were not included in the historic data analysis because they were generally an order of magnitude smaller than pca and tce concentrations 3 2 ssf based on spatially distributed measurements at a fixed time to obtain a ssf using spatially distributed m measurements contaminant flux measurements were completed in a number of existing and newly installed wells distributed across the site in general flux measurements can be completed using either point measurement methods or pumping methods and each of these approaches have unique advantages and disadvantages for this study point measurement methods were deemed the better option because there was no onsite infrastructure to manage or treat pumping effluent as such pumping effluent would have had to be collected in transportable tanks and shipped offsite for disposal which would have made this option very expensive moreover access to the site was only possible through a paved pedestrian walk and heavy vehicular traffic while possible would have been disruptive to the local community utilizing the walk point measurement methods have traditionally been completed using either multilevel samplers or passive flux meters pfms the former requires the construction and or installation of specific equipment while the latter has the advantage of being deployed in conventional wells which meant existing wells at the site could be utilized for measurements of j moreover pfms provide measurements of both q and j consequently pfms were used to complete flux measurements in this study the pfm theory is described by hatfield et al 2004 experimental methods for the deployment and recovery of pfms are described by annable et al 2005 and a comparison of pfm measurements to conventional characterization measurements can be found in verreydt et al 2013 see section si 2 in supplementary information for pfm method details the depth averaged flux at the i th horizontal location j i was calculated weighting the local contaminant flux measurement j i k by the length of the k th vertical interval b i k l over which a segment of the pfm had been homogenized 2 j i k 1 p j i k b i k k 1 p b i k where p is the number of vertical sampling intervals in most cases b i k 0 25 m in which case eq 2 reduces to an arithmetic average an exception was the first pfm deployment where the lower 1 5 m of the pfm deployment was divided into b i k 0 13 m segments to investigate potential fine scale variations in soil descriptions as reported in the well completion records for wells 4d and 5d the j i values were then numerically integrated over the width of the control plane to estimate m using 3 m t i 1 n a i j i this was procedurally identical to the method used in the analysis discussed in section 3 1 a curvilinear control was defined parallel to groundwater contours generated in surfer using averaged groundwater elevations based on pressure transducer data collected during the pfm deployment streamlines also defined in surfer using pressure transducer data were used to project well positions onto the curvilinear control plane the segment of the control plane assigned to each well is one half the distance to the neighboring wells along the control plane with the exception of the end wells where the distance is equal to the distance along the control plane to the lone neighboring well alternative straight line control planes were also explored and similar results were obtained see section si 3 in supplementary information four pfm deployment events occurred over the course of the study as summarized in table 1 well locations for pfm events 1 and 2 are shown in fig 3 and well locations for pfm events 3 and 4 are shown in fig 4 moreover a detailed well map for the fourth pfm event is shown in fig si 6 and monitoring wells assigned to each control plane are shown in table si 2 in supplementary information the first pfm event was conducted to investigate groundwater and contaminant flux within and near the inferred source zone moreover the intent was to use the pfm results to reduce the uncertainty of source strength estimate based on the ltm data analysis the second pfm event was conducted to evaluate conditions within the plume results from this event are included in supplementary information but are not discussed further the third deployment was the first deployment considered to provide complete flux measurements across three control planes the most upgradient control plane was called cp15 because it was based on existing well 15d the middle control plane was called cp17 because it was based on existing well 17d and the furthest downgradient control plane was called cp39 because it was based in part on existing well 39d control plane locations are shown in fig 4 additional wells were installed after the third pfm episode to augment the well distribution in cp39 consequently a fourth and final pfm deployment was subsequently conducted during this last event the lower pfm installed in well 17 2d could not be retrieved to account for its loss m for this well was estimated by scaling the m results of the upper pfm using the ratio of m for the entire well from pfm event 3 to m from the upper half only from pfm event 3 pressure transducers were used to assess groundwater flow direction during the third and fourth pfm events hydraulic head measurements were collected every 15 min and were subsequently used to calculate the average hydraulic head field during pfm deployments pressure transducers were deployed in 15 wells across the site during the third pfm event but two of these failed while deployed leaving a total of 13 hydraulic head measurement locations of these one was installed in a shallow well four were installed in intermediate wells fig 4b and the remaining in deep wells fig 4c for the shallow zone one well was insufficient to define groundwater flow direction therefore the shallow groundwater contours based on pressure transducer measurements during a previous period were assumed to apply this previous period was march 21 2012 to june 11 2012 and it included 11 shallow wells across the site fig 4a three wells are located outside the area of interest shown the purpose of measurements during this period was to assess tidal influences at the site pressure transducers were deployed in 36 monitoring wells across the site during the fourth pfm deployment and were likewise used to monitor the direction of the hydraulic gradient however 2 of these failed leaving 34 pressure transducers of these 11 were deployed in shallow wells fig 4d two wells are located outside the area of interest shown 9 were deployed in intermediate wells fig 4e and the remaining in deep wells fig 4f flux measurements were completed in both existing monitoring wells and newly installed monitoring wells well installation and construction details for existing wells varied somewhat but typically consisted of 5 1 cm 2 in diameter pvc or stainless steel well screens 3 05 m 10 ft in length and were installed with a surrounding sand filter pack the new wells were constructed using geoprobe 3 8 cm 1 5 in id pre packed pvc well screens and 3 8 cm 1 5 in id pvc casing most of these wells were installed using direct push technology in a few instances however hollow stem augers were used due to difficulties getting to target depths 4 results and discussion 4 1 ssf based on temporally distributed measurements at a fixed location using ltm data the estimated m at the szcp ranged from 300 g day in 1996 to 70 g day in 2012 fig 5a these values are similar to m measurements for chlorinated contaminants at other sites e g brooks et al 2008 and this range is among the most frequently reported values of m as reported by newell et al 2011 the data indicates a decreasing trend with an overall decline of 80 in m over 16 years one notable exception to the decreasing trend occurs at october 2008 where m 219 g day was significantly different from results immediately before 61 g day and after 76 g day this date this increase reflects increases in the aqueous concentrations measured in well 17d as no significant increases in concentration were noted in wells 4d or 5d the reason for the increase in concentration at 17d on this date is unknown but similar results were obtained from the first pfm event using the data from the first pfm event completed in september and october 2010 the m across the szcp is estimated to be 188 g day this is comparable to the estimate of 219 g day based on the ltm data from october 2008 but 3 times higher than the estimate of 54 g day based on data from the previous ltm sampling episode in april 2010 the higher m can again be attributed to results from 17d the pfm flux averaged tce concentration defined as the ratio j q for well 17d is 182 mg l and differs from the previous ltm concentration for that well by a factor of 4 it is however similar to the tce concentration measured in well 17d during the ltm sample from october 2008 150 mg l the fact that the pfm results are similar to the october 2008 ltm results suggests the latter should not be dismissed as a potential sampling artifact but rather suggest variability stemming from some currently unknown source sporadic behavior is not uncommon in monitoring data sets e g mchugh et al 2011 and while important to understand in the context of overall site management the long term data trend is more important in the evaluation of the 16 year data record to estimate the ssf results from the first pfm event were also used to evaluate estimates of q used in the historic data analysis measurements of q i k in all wells ranged from 0 3 to 3 7 cm day with a spatial average of 1 0 cm day and a spatial standard deviation of 0 4 cm day table 2 in general the groundwater flux appeared fairly uniform with depth profile plots for the first pfm event are included as fig si 7 in supplementary information and estimates of m from the ltm analysis that assumed constant q over the well screen interval appear to have been reliable in this regard the depth averaged estimates from pfm data were q i 0 96 1 49 0 90 cm day for wells 04d 05d and 17d respectively well 04d had the largest discrepancy in q i estimates based on slug test and pfm results 0 03 cm day versus 0 96 cm day respectively however when comparing these estimates it is important to note that pfm theory assumes advective dominated flow and flow rates as low as 0 03 cm day may hinder pfm accuracy because advective flow may not dominate the transport process e g hatfield et al 2004 nonetheless if the pfm estimate of q i for well 04d is used in the m calculations without presuming which of the two q i estimates is more correct the revised m estimate increases by only 11 this is due to the fact that the m estimate is dominated by the m contribution from well 17d consequently there would have been significant changes in the estimate of the ssf if there had been a similar discrepancy in the value of q i used for well 17d having data from the first pfm event that corroborates the value of q i used provided additional confidence to estimates of m based on the ltm data 4 2 ssf based on spatially distributed measurements at a fixed time results from all four pfm sampling events are summarized in table 2 which lists the minimum median average and maximum values of q equivalent tce j and equivalent tce c f the equivalent tce was based on the molar summation of pca tce and dce table 3 summarizes the m estimates based on the third and fourth pfm deployments for the three depth horizons at each control plane and fig 5b shows the m based on the third and fourth pfm deployments for the three control planes as a function of down gradient horizontal distance profile plots for measurements completed in all wells during pfm events 1 2 3 and 4 are included as figs si 7 si 8 si 9 and si 10 respectively in supplementary information differences in summary statistics table 2 between events may reflect the impact of different sampling locations and changes in hydrologic conditions between pfm sampling events for comparison histograms of q for each of the four pfm deployments is shown in fig 6 and results from pfm event 4 appear notably different from the other three the average and maximum q increased by factors of 2 5 and 1 9 respectively between pfm events 3 and 4 the maximum q from pfm event 3 6 0 cm day occurred in well 39i at an elevation of 7 18 m while the maximum q from pfm event 4 11 3 cm day occurred in well 19s at an elevation of 3 46 m differences in the distribution of q between pfm events 3 and 4 are believed to be in large part the result from a significant rain event which occurred early in the fourth pfm deployment rainfall records from two nearby climate stations national oceanic and atmospheric administration 2017 were reviewed for the east greenwich station located 4 km to the north of the site data was available from 2008 to 2014 and the rainfall amount received on march 30 2014 was the second largest for this station for the providence station located 11 km to the north of the site data from 2004 to 2014 was reviewed and the rainfall amount received on march 30 2014 was the third largest see fig si 11 in supplementary information further support for this is evident by comparing the groundwater elevation contours in fig 4f to those in figs 1 4c and si 3 taking well 17d as a reference for example the contour during pfm event 4 is 0 3 m higher than the contour based on the ltm pfm event 3 and tidal study data sets consequently hydrological conditions are believed to be the primary factor for the difference in pfm events 3 and 4 this was further tested by analyzing a subset of the pfm event 4 results restricted to those wells included in pfm event 3 and the results are not significantly different from those obtained with the entire pfm event 4 sample set see table 2 and fig 6d indicating differences between results from pfm event 3 and 4 are not associated with the additional wells included in pfm event 4 measurements of m across control planes cp15 cp17 and cp39 differ by factors of 23 2 and 18 respectively between pfm events 3 and 4 in contrast to average q which differs by a factor of 85 between pfm events 3 and 4 consequently the average equivalent tce c f differs by 114 between pfm events 3 and 4 indicating concentration dilution if as suspected differences in the q distribution between pfm events 3 and 4 result from the unusually high rainfall event that occurred early in the pfm event 4 deployment then increases in q were offset by concentration dilution resulting in similar m estimates between pfm events 3 and 4 consequently pfm event 4 is still valuable to the original goal to provide a m measurement at cp39 with greater certainty compared to that in pfm event 3 through the installation of additional cp39 wells results from pfm events 3 and 4 indicate that m increases in the downgradient direction ranging from approximately 5 to 7 g day at cp15 38 g day at cp17 and 400 to 500 g day at cp39 fig 5b illustrates increasing m for the three control planes as a function of down gradient horizontal distance using results from pfm events 3 and 4 this behavior is expected given the decreasing trend in m versus time observed at the szcp based on the ltm data analysis fig 5a since a ssf relates m and time the spatial distribution under this approach as depicted in fig 5b must be related to time as depicted in fig 5a this can be accomplished under simplified conditions i e neglecting longitudinal dispersion and mass loss processes by using the definition of travel time τ ηrℓ q where η is porosity r is the retardation factor and ℓ is distance in the flow direction l for convenience the spatial origin is taken to be cp17 and the temporal origin is selected as may 1996 the first date for which historical monitoring data is available and a relative elapsed travel time is defined as t t t 0 τ where t 0 may 1996 consequently t 0 at cp17 in may 1996 a m measurement completed at cp17 in may 1996 reflects m at cp15 at t τ 1 where τ 1 is the travel time from cp15 to cp17 likewise it reflects m at cp39 at t τ 2 where τ 2 is the travel time from cp17 to cp39 estimates of τ were based on η 25 which was the value assumed in previous characterization work tetra tech 2013 the geometric mean value of q as measured in pfm events 3 and 4 was used as an estimate of the site wide spatially averaged groundwater flux denoted by q resulting in q 1 4 4 6 cm day for pfm events 3 and 4 respectively an estimate of r 5 came from assuming linear partitioning therefore r 1 ρ b k d η where ρ b is bulk density ml 3 and k d is the distribution coefficient l3 m 1 a value of ρ b 1 4 g cm3 was used as assumed in previous characterization work tetra tech 2013 an estimate of k d was based on the product k oc f oc where k oc is the organic carbon partitioning coefficient l3 m 1 for tce and f oc is the organic carbon fraction mm 1 a value of 94 l kg was used for the former based on the geometric mean calculated in u s environmental protection agency 1996 using 21 measurements reported in the literature and a value of 0 0077 kg kg was used for the latter based on the geometric mean of 64 total organic carbon measurements from the site as reported in ea engineering science and technology 1998 and tetra tech 2013 fig 7 presents the resulting ssf data set based on the spatially distributed m estimates from pfm events 3 and 4 as well as the ssf data set from the ltm analysis data from pfm events 3 and 4 are dissimilar and the data from pfm event 3 appears to match the ltm data much more favorably than data from pfm event 4 since m estimates based on the third and fourth pfm deployments were within 20 of one another differences between the two data sets as represented in fig 7 are predominately due to differences in τ which in turn reflect differences in q between the two deployments as discussed earlier it is believed that measurements of q during pfm event 4 were unduly influenced by a rainfall event at the start of the deployment this highlights the importance of evaluating groundwater and mass flux measurements in the broader context of historic site conditions as interpreting any one event in isolation may lead to misleading conclusions 4 3 evaluation of the two approaches the estimate of the ssf based on temporally distributed m measurements at a fixed location relied on data that had been collected as part of initial characterization and ltm activities as such it did not require the installation of any addition wells nor the use of any specialized methods for the measurement of q or j it was therefore by far the less expensive of the two approaches two large sources of uncertainty in this approach if not the largest are the well spacing within the control plane and the estimates of q i especially given the dependence of the ssf on results from a single well 17d well spacing impacts the uncertainty of m estimates and therefore the ssf and the large un sampled space between the available wells suggested high uncertainty for example the average well spacing and screen interval depth result in a depth averaged sampling density of 0 01 points per square meter results from mackay et al 2012 suggest relative percent difference between measured and true mass discharges may range from 100 the minimum possible to 150 for this sampling density while results from chen et al 2014 and brooks et al 2015 suggest the uncertainty expressed as the standard deviation of error and coefficient of variation in m respectively may be 300 depending on the plume width and maximum j the other source of large uncertainty with this approach stems from the estimate of q i based on k i and i i uncertainty may exist in both measurements and it may arise in the product of the two when the support volumes associated with the two measurements are not similar e g kübert and finkel 2006 as conducted in this study an independent measurement e g pfms was used to confirm the value of q i at least in the well with the greatest impact on the ssf and therefore reduce the uncertainty associated with this estimate the agreement between the two measurements in our study however does not mean similar confirmation is unwarranted at other sites finally this approach provides estimates of m at one control plane if attempts had been made to use these m measurements to predict m at downgradient locations there would have been uncertainty in the predictions because of various fate and transport properties between the locations the second approach relied on spatially distributed m at a fixed time to measure the ssf in this study these were completed using pfms to measure j in a combination of existing and newly installed monitoring wells the sampling density was 0 6 points per square meter for both control planes cp15 and cp17 during both pfm events 3 and 4 as a result it is estimated that the uncertainty in m estimates based on pfm measurements is an order of magnitude less than uncertainty in m estimates based on ltm data in the first approach the sampling densities used in control plane cp39 were not as high and for pfm events 3 and 4 were 0 1 and 0 2 points per square meter respectively however uncertainty in m estimates are still believed to be an order of magnitude less than those based on the ltm data supporting details for these statements are provided in section si 4 of supplementary information the second approach also relied on an estimate of q to calculate the τ between control planes however given that j measurements were completed using pfms a device which also provides estimates of q data was available upon which to base an estimate nonetheless a source of uncertainty in this approach is the need to estimate q in a heterogeneous environment in theory only one deployment in time would be needed to estimate a ssf using spatially distributed m measurements however results from the fourth pfm deployment illustrate the potential hazards of doing so if unaverage conditions prevail during the deployment moreover it might be difficult to assess how well conditions during the deployment represent average conditions over the life of the contaminant plume while estimates of m did not appear to be sensitive to changes in hydrologic conditions that occurred during pfm events 3 and 4 the estimate of q was different resulting in a ssf different from those based on the ltm and pfm event 3 data sets relative to the first approach the second approach required significantly more expense to complete this expense may have been reduced by using less wells at greater spacing or by averaging pfm samples over larger intervals which reflects the tradeoff between cost and certainty however the utility of the generated data extends beyond that associated with estimation of the ssf alone and it is useful for other site management purposes for example while details of the spatial j distributions across a given control plane were not discussed in this work it is useful to note that further efforts at addressing the risk associated with the remaining dnapl mass could be guided by this distribution for example the m associated with cp17 is predominately centered on the lower part of well 17d this indicates that the best place for any further dnapl characterization activities is the area upgradient of this location but downgradient of cp15 at a depth comparable to the hotspot in 17d moreover spatial flux distributions could also be used to target remediation activities whether in the source or plume the combined use of both approaches provided complimentary lines of evidence for a site specific estimate of the ssf similarity between ssfs based on the ltm and pfm event 3 data sets helped address uncertainty in τ estimates based on an estimate of q and the dissimilarity in results between ltm and pfm event 4 highlighted the unusual hydrologic conditions during that deployment likewise the similarity between the ltm and pfm event 3 data sets helped address uncertainty associated with the wells spacing and q i estimates in the approached based on the ltm data the similarity in the data sets also supports the use of the ssf estimate as a site wide estimate given the spatial distribution of the three control planes in the second approach the m data can be used for ssf model calibration which then can be used to support site management decisions perhaps the most common and simplest model to adopt is an exponential function 4 m m 0 exp m 0 m 0 t where m 0 and m 0 are the initial mass discharge mt 1 and mass m respectively another reason for selecting an exponential model for illustration is that results from chen and jawitz 2009 indicate that as the dnapl source zone ages the ssf converges to an exponentially decreasing model the exponential model was fit to the data by treating m 0 and m 0 as fitting parameters to minimize the difference between the modeled and measured data as noted above measurements upon which to base the model fits were first collected in may 1996 and that date was therefore used as the initial year model fits are summarized in table 4 for the ltm pfm event 3 and pfm event 4 data sets as well the combined ltm pfm event 3 data set moreover the model fit for the ltm data is shown in fig 5a and the combined ltm pfm event 3 model is shown in fig 7 model parameters are within a factor of two for the ltm data and pfm event 3 data however parameters differ by as much as two orders of magnitude for the fit associated with pfm event 4 given the similarity in m estimates between pfm events 3 and 4 this difference must stem primarily from the high value of q for pfm event 4 4 4 modeling to demonstrate the complementary nature of the two approaches the similarity between the ltm and pfm event 3 data as illustrated in fig 7 gives confidence to the use of this combined data set for site specific ssf calibration relative to either the ltm or pfm event 3 data sets being solely used to illustrate how both approaches provide data to support a common ssf modeling simulations were completed using remchlor falta 2008 based on the input parameters summarized in table 5 remchlor assumes a power law model plm to describe the dnapl architecture and dissolution behavior and an exponent of 1 was used to represent an exponential function as used in the previous section the values for m 0 and m 0 were based on the exponential model fit to the combined ltm pfm event 3 data set as shown in fig 7 the basis for the remaining values used are summarized in table 5 and are generally based on conditions at this site however use of this model with the parameters shown in table 5 is not meant to be a strict calibration exercise but rather an exercise to illustrate the similarity in m obtained by temporal measurements at a fixed location versus spatially distributed measurements at a fixed time two cases were investigated case 1 with minimal longitudinal dispersion and case 2 with moderate longitudinal dispersion remchlor uses a streamtube based approach for simulating longitudinal dispersion which results in a scale dependent dispersivity value i e dispersivity is a linear function of travel distance or the ratio of dispersivity to travel distance is constant for case 1 the ratio of dispersivity to travel distance was assumed to be 5e 11 and for case 2 the ratio was assumed to be 0 02 these values result in sigmav 0 00001 0 2 respectively as shown in table 5 where sigmav represents the groundwater velocity coefficient of variation falta 2008 modeling results are shown in fig 8 the r 2 value based on fitting an exponential model to both data sets is 0 999 in case 1 and the slope in linear natural log space is 0 00043 days 1 which is equal to the source decay term i e m 0 m 0 used as input to the plm case 1 illustrates that in the absence of longitudinal dispersion and decay processes the original source function is recovered using either approach moreover estimation of the ssf is insensitive to transverse dispersion since m is based on the integration of measurements across the control plane case 2 illustrates that for the modeling simulation investigated longitudinal dispersion has a minor impact on the estimation of the ssf the r 2 value based on fitting an exponential model to the simulated data in this case is 0 996 and the slope in linear natural log space is still 0 00043 days 1 again equal to the input source decay term a comparison of the spatially distributed m data at a fixed time to the temporally distributed m at a fixed location in case 2 indicates the former appears to have a slightly more negative slope than the latter this same pattern is evident in fig 7 when comparing the ltm data to that from pfm event 3 4 5 mass balance applications using the ssf based on the combined ltm pfm event 3 data sets with the assumed exponential ssf it is estimated that m 0 400 g day and m 0 1000 kg these numbers reflect m at cp17 in may 1996 and the mass remaining upgradient of cp17 at that time an estimate of the remaining dnapl as of 2017 based on the ssf is 60 kg lacking data to suggest more specific uncertainty bounds on the estimate of remaining dnapl plus or minus an order of magnitude is assumed i e 6 to 600 kg one way by which to gage the significance of this number is to compare it to the contaminant mass in the plume this comparison has been used to define the relative age of a dnapl source by chen and jawitz 2009 a relatively young site has the majority of contaminant mass in the source zone and a relatively aged site has the majority of the contaminant mass in the plume tetra tech 2010 estimated an average equivalent tce dissolved phase mass of 2000 kg for the period between 2005 and 2009 this estimate accounts for abiotic and biotic degradation using a molar sum of pca tce and dce further degradation is not considered significant to plume mass estimates because dce concentrations have been roughly an order of magnitude smaller than tce concentrations mass loss due to volatilization was neglected an assumption supported by the fact that a large fraction of the contaminant mass is located well below the water table sorbed mass is accounted for using r 5 as estimated previously values of retardation factors specific to pca and dce are not used which is not considered to be a significant issue since the dominant chemical species in the plume is tce the plume mass accounting for sorbed mass is therefore 10 000 kg mass estimates were presumably restricted to the borders of the site and did not account for any mass that may have migrated beyond the site borders another source of uncertainty is the potential loss of mass to the underlying rock formation consequently plume mass estimates may have a negative bias this is likewise suggested by comparing the estimate of 10 000 kg to the estimate of the total mass released 45 000 kg based on historic data assuming little to no dnapl remains however given the potential uncertainty in both estimates a factor of 4 5 difference may not be significant finally comparisons between the source and plume mass when considering the relative age of the dnapl source are made within an assumed framework of a single source that creates the entire contaminant plume for the site there is uncertainty that this is the case for the calf pasture point site given the extent of contamination to the west of the control planes however the majority of the contaminant plume is captured by the control plane locations and as such the evaluation of relative age is useful for a screening level analysis using the ssf an estimate of the dnapl mass upgradient of cp17 at the midpoint of the time frame for the plume mass estimate 2007 is 200 kg the difference between dnapl mass in 2007 200 kg and 2017 60 kg is 140 kg adding this mass to the estimate of plume mass from 2007 10 000 kg gives a 2017 plume mass estimate of 10 140 kg which given the uncertainty of the former essentially results in the same plume mass estimate moreover given the relative insignificance of 60 kg compared to 10 140 kg the site is considered to be an aged site with the majority of the dnapl mass in the plume this statement is valid even with the assumed order of magnitude uncertainty range on dnapl mass given the relative amount of dnapl mass compared to the plume mass it is estimated that the source has limited potential to enlarge the contaminant plume and that since the plume contains the majority of the contaminant mass addressing the remaining dnapl mass may represent a secondary priority compared to eliminating or minimizing the risk associated with the contaminant plume other factors however may impact evaluations of relative risk and comparisons of dnapl mass to plume mass is but one facet of such an evaluation 5 summary and conclusions source strength functions provide a quantitative model of dnapl source zone behavior and as such are useful for contaminated site management two approaches were used to estimate ssfs for the calf pasture point site one based on temporally distributed m measurements at a fixed control plane and the other based on spatially distributed m measurements across three control planes at the same time the combined use of both approaches provided complimentary lines of evidence for a site specific estimate of the ssf the former was based exclusively on data that had been collected as part of site characterization and as part of the ltm activities and demonstrates the utility of this type of data in flux based site management results of this analysis indicated m across a control plane downgradient of the assumed source location had been as high as 300 g day in 1996 and has decreased to 70 g day in 2012 a limited set of groundwater and contaminant flux measurements using passive flux meters were used to provide additional support for these measurements and showed that in this particular application detailed vertical information did not significantly impact m estimates in large part this outcome stemmed from the fact that m estimates were largely impacted by results from a single well 17d and estimates of concentration and groundwater flux compared favorably between pfm results and the ltm analysis at this well however this outcome is dependent on location specific conditions of heterogeneity and similar results at other locations are not necessarily expected a ssf was also estimated for the site using m measurements across three spatially distributed control planes at a fixed point in time and is the first such demonstration to our knowledge these measurements were completed using pfm deployments the control planes were located at increasing distances downgradient from the assumed source zone moving downgradient from the source is comparable to moving backwards in time moreover for the decreasing trend in m as measured based on the ltm data moving downgradient from the source should yield increasing m measurements assuming mass loss processes such as biotic and abiotic degradation are negligible for this site measurements at control planes cp15 cp17 and cp39 listed in order of increasing downgradient direction were 6 g day 37 g day and 400 g day respectively these measurements were compared to those from the ltm data using estimates of travel time for one of two complete pfm measurement events m from the spatially distributed control planes compared favorably with the estimates from the ltm data which provides a data set with more confidence upon which to calibrate a ssf model because each approach offered complimentary strengths for the second complete pfm measurement event m from the spatially distributed control planes also compared favorably with the estimates from the ltm data relative to the magnitude of m e g the m estimates from pfm events 3 and 4 were within 20 of one another however the timing of the m estimates using travel time did not compare well this discrepancy was attributed with an unusually large rainfall event that occurred at the start of the pfm event and highlights the need to evaluate conditions during deployment relative to conditions that usually prevail at a given site using ssf estimates from both approaches provided the means of comparison by which to identify the abnormal hydrologic conditions associated with the second complete measurement event a number of ssf models are available and can be used for assisting with contaminated site management decisions as an illustration an exponential model was assumed and the measured data was used for model calibration the ssf model was used to estimate dnapl mass and this was compared to the dissolved contaminant mass in the plume the latter was roughly two to three orders of magnitude greater than the former this comparison indicates an aged site and suggests that the dissolution of any remaining dnapl should not have a huge impact on contaminant mass in the plume acknowledgements the work

mass discharge or flux averaged concentration from dense nonaqueous phase liquid dnapl source zones as a function of time provide a quantitative model of dnapl source zone behavior such information is useful for calibration of screening level models to assist with site management decisions we investigate the use of historic data collected during long term monitoring ltm activities at a site in rhode island to predict the ssf based on temporal mass discharge measurements at a fixed location as well as ssf estimation using mass discharge measurements at a fixed time from three spatially distributed control planes mass discharge based on ltm data decreased from 300 g day in 1996 to 70 g day in 2012 at a control plane downgradient of the suspected dnapl source zone and indicates an overall decline of 80 in 16 years these measurements were compared to current mass discharge measurements across three spatially distributed control planes results indicate that mass discharge increased in the downgradient direction and was 6 g day 37 g day and 400 g day at near intermediate and far distances from the suspected source zone respectively this behavior was expected given the decreasing trend observed in the ltm data at a fixed location these two data sets were compared using travel time as a means to plot the data sets on a common axis the similarity between the two data sets gives greater confidence to the use of this combined data set for site specific ssf estimation relative to either the sole use of ltm or spatially distributed data sets keywords mass flux mass discharge source strength function source zone characterization passive flux meters long term monitoring data 1 introduction research conducted over the last fifteen years has shown that dense nonaqueous phase liquid dnapl source zone response and dissolution behavior are strongly influenced by the dnapl architecture sale and mcwhorter 2001 christ et al 2006 falta et al 2005a fure et al 2006 jawitz et al 2005 lemke et al 2004 parker and park 2004 consequently the utility of site management decisions based on predictive models depends on the extent to which the dnapl architecture can be appropriately and reliably quantified the dnapl architecture can generally be defined as the distribution of the dnapl relative to the distribution of pore water velocities in the flow field and a complete description of the dnapl architecture would entail a complete description of the spatial dnapl distribution and groundwater flow field field scale characterization needed to obtain the necessary level of detail to make meaningful site specific predictions of source zone behavior from a process based model with spatially distributed parameters is difficult and expensive the level of source zone characterization needed to ensure these types of models provide reliable site specific results is not collected in many cases presumably due to resource limitations data requirements needed for meaningful site specific predictions can be relaxed by adopting a stochastic modeling framework conditioned to field measurements e g troldberg et al 2012 koch and nowak 2016 however application of inverse stochastic modeling concepts requires a level of expertise and modeling resources that are not routinely used in practice as such more practical albeit less rigorous methods of dnapl source zone characterization are needed at the very least these methods could be viewed as important steps in the process of data collection and evaluation when building towards the more ambitious goals of site specific distributed parameter process based models whether deterministic or stochastic in nature over the last decade a variety of simplified screening level models have been introduced to describe dnapl source zone behavior parker and park 2004 zhu and sykes 2004 falta et al 2005a falta et al 2005b newell and adamson 2005 christ et al 2006 marble et al 2008 difilippo and brusseau 2011 johnston et al 2013 these models reduce the level of complexity of the real systems through the use of up scaled lumped parameters to represent the details of the dnapl source zone architecture and are fundamentally related because they express mass flux as a power law function of dnapl mass alternative approaches have also been proposed in which the source zone architecture is described using stream tubes with statistical distributions of travel time and dnapl saturation jawitz et al 2005 enfield et al 2005 select comparisons between models have been made by basu et al 2008 parker and falta 2008 difilippo and brusseau 2011 johnston et al 2013 and kokkinaki et al 2014 an important question to be addressed in the application of these models is what consistent and appropriate level of characterization is needed to make meaningful site specific predictions of source behavior recently flux based site management concepts have been proposed for dnapl site management purposes e g basu et al 2006 annable et al 2014 johnston et al 2014 key source zone attributes to be characterized in this framework are the spatial advective flux j ml 2 t 1 distribution flux averaged concentration c f ml 3 and mass discharge m mt 1 across control planes the term source strength function ssf is used to refer to m or c f from the dnapl source zone as a function of time the ssf is a valuable tool for site management purposes because of its use in predicting source zone behavior assessing responses to various remedial approaches and providing insights to site wide mass balance in addition it can be used to characterize other contaminant sources such as secondary diffusion domains a related relationship is that between m and the dnapl mass in the source zone which has recently been called a defining characteristic of system behavior brusseau et al 2013 these relationships are inherently a function of dnapl architecture characterization of the ssf from field data therefore provides a means to characterize the dnapl architecture a benefit for using ssf data to calibrate screening level models is that m measurements integrate information over a large spatial scale i e control plane relative to the scale of local processes and therefore match the up scaled approach of screening level models another benefit to dnapl source zone characterization using m measurements relative to the characterization of dnapl mass for example is that the latter is inherently a three dimensional problem while the former is inherently a two dimensional problem thus the scale of the domain to be investigated is reduced consequently using ssf data based on m or c f measurements is considered a beneficial approach for calibrating screening level source zone models as noted above annable et al 2014 identify five methods that might be used to estimate the ssf from field data two of which are based on m measurements at control planes oriented perpendicular to the mean groundwater flow direction one of these is based on multiple temporal measurements at a fixed location and the other is based on measurements at multiple locations at a fixed point in time difilippo and brusseau 2008 refer to the case of only two temporal measurements before and after remediation at one location as an end point analysis and reviewed results from this type of analysis for 21 remediation projects brooks et al 2008 reported results from two sites where source control planes were installed for the specific purpose of comparing pre and post remedial m measurements as an assessment of dnapl source remediation as noted by difilippo and brusseau 2008 the limitation of only two points in this approach means a higher level of uncertainty when it comes to estimating the ssf of the remaining methods identified by annable et al 2014 to estimate the ssf two are based on concentration time series data from monitoring wells at the site and differ in whether a single ssf model is fit to all data simultaneously or whether individual ssf models are fit to each well with respect to the use of concentration time series data from monitoring wells most dnapl contaminated sites have extensive multi year data sets that were collected to define the scope of the problem evaluate remediation options and meet long term monitoring ltm requirements such data sets typically include contaminant concentration time series information from at least a select set of wells and some level of testing to estimate hydraulic conductivity at one or more locations well locations however may not be ideal for the estimation of ssfs nonetheless these historic data sets are a valuable source of information and may provide rough predictions of the ssf moreover these predictions may be improved when combined with a limited number of flux measurements in select locations as an example basu et al 2009 used concentration time series data from three monitoring wells within the source zone to estimate source depletion behavior although the ssf was not estimated from explicit estimates of m the last method for estimating ssfs as identified by annable et al 2014 is based on flux averaged concentration time series data measured from one or more extraction wells examples of this method can be found in difilippo and brusseau 2008 brusseau et al 2013 johnston et al 2013 and wang et al 2014 what is particularly interesting to note about the three more recent cases based on extraction well data is that initial source mass was one of the fitting parameters in the calibration process and the estimate of the dnapl mass based on ssf calibration was comparable to independent estimates of dnapl source mass estimates of dnapl mass are important for the design and evaluation of source zone remediation systems however they can be difficult to obtain and may have high uncertainty consequently their estimation based on ssf calibration to field data offers an alternative and possibly more convenient means to obtain them to our knowledge what has not been explored to date is the characterization of the ssf using m measurements at multiple locations at a fixed point in time this approach is the central focus of this manuscript and we demonstrate ssf estimation using m measurements at a fixed time from three spatially distributed control planes at a site a comparison is provided of these results to the ssf obtained using temporal m measurements at a fixed location moreover a hybrid approach is used for the latter in which m estimates are derived predominately from a 16 year record of concentration time series data associated with ltm activities the advantages and disadvantages of each approach are evaluated and it is shown that the two approaches complement one another their combined use results in a more robust ssf estimate for site management purposes by providing two lines of evidence of source zone behavior as an illustration an exponential model is fit to the ssf data and used in a site wide mass balance assessment 2 site description and history the calf pasture point site is located in north kingstown rhode island on a coastal peninsula surrounded to the west south and east by allen harbor an entrance channel and narragansett bay respectively a site location map is shown in fig si 1 in supplementary information a description of the site geology is provided by ea engineering science and technology 1998 and church and brandon 1999 and consists of surficial sand underlain by silt till and a lower sand these unconsolidated units over lie a quartzite and phyllite bedrock that slopes to the southeast and south the thickness of the unconsolidated units above the rock vary from 9 to 30 m and the silt till and lower sand layers are discontinuous across the site however the silt and till layers were present in the immediate vicinities of the three control planes used in this study ea engineering science and technology 1998 reported hydraulic conductivities ranging from approximately 0 03 m day in the silt to 120 m day in the till an outcrop of rock occurs in the northwest portion of the site and groundwater is considered to conceptually flow in a semi radial pattern from this vicinity to the coastline the site is tidally influenced and daily variations in groundwater elevations due to tidal action range from approximately 1 m for wells close to the shoreline to 0 003 m for select inland shallow wells based on measurements completed during the study data not shown moreover salinity likewise varies from saline or brackish water at the coastline to freshwater inland church and brandon 1999 density corrections to groundwater elevations measured in the vicinities of the contaminant flux transects used in this study were deemed unnecessary based on the salinity distribution as described by church and brandon 1999 see figs si 2 and si 3 and table si 1 in supplementary information for further information the site was formerly part of the naval construction battalion center davisville which was operational from 1942 until its closure in 1994 it is estimated that between 1968 and 1974 28 000 l of a decontaminating agent non corrosive danc were buried in the region bounded by wells 04d 05d and 14d fig 1 and figures from various reports show an inferred release location immediately south of 14d e g ea engineering science and technology 2002 tetra tech 2013 site characterization activity was initiated in the mid 1980s and has continued since the limits of the dnapl source zone have not been defined through specific characterization activities to assess the presence and spatial extents of dnapl however dnapl is still suspected because recent aqueous trichloroethylene tce concentrations in monitoring well 17d with a ten foot screen section are 40 mg l or higher a record of decision for the site was signed in 1999 which specified deed restrictions and long term monitoring activities to manage the contaminant risk remedial action was taken in 2011 consisting of excavation between wells 15d and 14d shown as the cross hatched pattern in fig 1 due to the observance of a geophysical anomaly in this area the excavation extended to 1 8 m below ground surface bgs over an area of 186 m2 remnants of drums were found but no evidence of dnapl was observed it is uncertain if this activity had any impact on the ssf at the site given the absence of dnapl observations in the excavated area and the fact that the unconsolidated material extends to 11 3 m bgs or greater in this area based on the boring logs for wells 14d and 15d smart 2005 describes danc as a two part mixture a dry chlorine based powder and the solvent 1 1 2 2 tetrachloroethane pca that were mixed together when used for decontamination purposes it was reportedly stored in either 11 l or 17 l containers with two sections the top section contained the powder and the bottom section contained the solvent using a density of 1 6 g cm3 for pca montgomery 2000 the estimated mass assuming 28 000 l of pca is 45 000 kg as typically is the case the estimated release mass has a high degree of uncertainty given the predominance of tce in the plume relative to pca 1 2 dichloroethylene dce or vinyl chloride pca is presumed to rapidly degrade to tce through a hydrolysis reaction e g washington 1995 but further degradation is not considered significant at the site therefore the two main contaminants of concern for this study were pca and tce 3 methods 3 1 ssf based on temporally distributed measurements at a fixed location the ssf m t based on temporally distributed measurements at a fixed location used concentration time series information collected as part of ltm

used here and elsewhere in the manuscript to denote a spatially averaged property associated with the monitoring well as a whole eq 1 makes use of j cq and q ki where q is the darcy or groundwater flux lt 1 and reflects the transect method for estimating mass discharge e g itrc interstate technology and regulatory council 2010 farhat et al 2011 comparisons between this method and other flux measurement methods can be found elsewhere e g brooks et al 2008 and it was selected here to specifically make use of the ltm data finally as expressed in eq 1 it was assumed that the only sources of temporal variability were c i and i i the location of the szcp relative to the source was subject to uncertainty given uncertainty in the location of the dnapl source zone for this analysis the szcp location was based on a wells with ltm data b the proximity of the wells to the inferred dnapl release location and c the location of the wells relative to the groundwater flow field the wells included in the ltm program with closest proximity to the inferred release location were 04d 05d 17d 22d and 38d fig 1 of these wells 04d 05d and 17d had the highest concentrations with 17d being highest other wells in the vicinity of the inferred release location included 03d 14d 15d and 31i but these wells were not included in the ltm program high concentrations were not noted in shallow wells near the inferred source zone and the shallow zone was therefore excluded from the ssf analysis based on ltm data consequently the szcp was primarily based on wells 04d 05d and 17d the historic high concentration wells downgradient of the inferred dnapl release area an analysis of the groundwater flow field indicated non uniform flow conditions and a curvilinear szcp was therefore used the szcp was defined to be parallel to groundwater contours based on the average groundwater elevation groundwater elevations from 23 measurement episodes completed between july 1995 and april 2010 were averaged at each well location within the d horizon not all wells were measured within each episode and that information was used with a kriging algorithm in a commercial software contouring package surfer to generate groundwater elevation contours fig 1 finally consideration was given in the placement of the szcp to generally minimize the distance of the wells from the szcp resulting in the szcp as shown in fig 1 once the szcp was established the well locations were projected either upstream or downstream along flowlines perpendicular to the average groundwater elevation contours the resulting szcp consisted of three interior wells 04d 05d and 17d with end locations defined by 03d to the east and 10d to the west the two end well locations were assumed to have zero concentrations for the purposes of estimating the ssf based on historic data due to the low concentrations measured in these wells relative to the interior wells roughly 1 or less the horizontal length of the szcp assigned to each well was equal to one half the distance to each neighboring well along the curvilinear szcp the total length of the szcp was 100 m with an average well spacing of 34 m information was not available on the vertical distribution of contaminant near the inferred source zone therefore the vertical depth was assumed to equal the 3 05 m screened interval of the wells the relatively small variability in the groundwater elevations coefficient of variations 25 near the inferred source area suggested temporal variability in i i may not be significant moreover when considering the importance of temporal variability short term sporadic behavior is of less importance compared to long term trends in the development of screening level models for source behavior from ltm data comparisons of the linear trend line to the average water elevation in wells near the inferred source zone 03d 04d 05d 15d and 17d did show a gradual increase in water elevation over time see fig si 4 in supplementary information therefore as further assessment a plane was fit to the water elevation data from these five wells using multiple linear regression for 22 measurement episodes the first was neglected due to missing measurements the magnitude and direction of the plane vector serves as a measure of the hydraulic gradient magnitude and direction next a linear control plane was defined to be perpendicular to the mean direction of the hydraulic gradient variations in the direction of the hydraulic gradient were accounted for by calculating the component of the hydraulic gradient normal to the control plane results are shown in fig 2 while short term variability is evident the long term trend in the data as represented by the linear trend line is only slightly different from the average hydraulic gradient of 0 0094 consequently temporal variations in i i t were neglected and a temporally averaged estimate for each well hereafter denoted as i i was used evaluation of the average groundwater elevation contours fig 1 yielded well specific estimates of i i 0 01 for 04d 05d and 17d each values of k i 0 03 1 4 0 98 m day were used for wells 04d 05d and 17d respectively and were from slug test results reported by ea engineering science and technology 1998 the resulting well specific groundwater flux estimates were q i 0 03 1 40 0 98 cm day for wells 04d 05d and 17d respectively where the tilde is used to indicate an estimate based on i i the concentration time series for wells 04d 05d and 17d consisted of twelve measurements associated with ltm activities between 1996 and 2012 see fig si 5 in supplementary information calculations for m were based on the sum of dce tce and pca where dce and pca were converted to an equivalent tce mass concentration on a molar basis because tce is the predominant contaminant in the plume other chlorinated chemical species were not included in the historic data analysis because they were generally an order of magnitude smaller than pca and tce concentrations 3 2 ssf based on spatially distributed measurements at a fixed time to obtain a ssf using spatially distributed m measurements contaminant flux measurements were completed in a number of existing and newly installed wells distributed across the site in general flux measurements can be completed using either point measurement methods or pumping methods and each of these approaches have unique advantages and disadvantages for this study point measurement methods were deemed the better option because there was no onsite infrastructure to manage or treat pumping effluent as such pumping effluent would have had to be collected in transportable tanks and shipped offsite for disposal which would have made this option very expensive moreover access to the site was only possible through a paved pedestrian walk and heavy vehicular traffic while possible would have been disruptive to the local community utilizing the walk point measurement methods have traditionally been completed using either multilevel samplers or passive flux meters pfms the former requires the construction and or installation of specific equipment while the latter has the advantage of being deployed in conventional wells which meant existing wells at the site could be utilized for measurements of j moreover pfms provide measurements of both q and j consequently pfms were used to complete flux measurements in this study the pfm theory is described by hatfield et al 2004 experimental methods for the deployment and recovery of pfms are described by annable et al 2005 and a comparison of pfm measurements to conventional characterization measurements can be found in verreydt et al 2013 see section si 2 in supplementary information for pfm method details the depth averaged flux at the i th horizontal location j i was calculated weighting the local contaminant flux measurement j i k by the length of the k th vertical interval b i k l over which a segment of the pfm had been homogenized 2 j i k 1 p j i k b i k k 1 p b i k where p is the number of vertical sampling intervals in most cases b i k 0 25 m in which case eq 2 reduces to an arithmetic average an exception was the first pfm deployment where the lower 1 5 m of the pfm deployment was divided into b i k 0 13 m segments to investigate potential fine scale variations in soil descriptions as reported in the well completion records for wells 4d and 5d the j i values were then numerically integrated over the width of the control plane to estimate m using 3 m t i 1 n a i j i this was procedurally identical to the method used in the analysis discussed in section 3 1 a curvilinear control was defined parallel to groundwater contours generated in surfer using averaged groundwater elevations based on pressure transducer data collected during the pfm deployment streamlines also defined in surfer using pressure transducer data were used to project well positions onto the curvilinear control plane the segment of the control plane assigned to each well is one half the distance to the neighboring wells along the control plane with the exception of the end wells where the distance is equal to the distance along the control plane to the lone neighboring well alternative straight line control planes were also explored and similar results were obtained see section si 3 in supplementary information four pfm deployment events occurred over the course of the study as summarized in table 1 well locations for pfm events 1 and 2 are shown in fig 3 and well locations for pfm events 3 and 4 are shown in fig 4 moreover a detailed well map for the fourth pfm event is shown in fig si 6 and monitoring wells assigned to each control plane are shown in table si 2 in supplementary information the first pfm event was conducted to investigate groundwater and contaminant flux within and near the inferred source zone moreover the intent was to use the pfm results to reduce the uncertainty of source strength estimate based on the ltm data analysis the second pfm event was conducted to evaluate conditions within the plume results from this event are included in supplementary information but are not discussed further the third deployment was the first deployment considered to provide complete flux measurements across three control planes the most upgradient control plane was called cp15 because it was based on existing well 15d the middle control plane was called cp17 because it was based on existing well 17d and the furthest downgradient control plane was called cp39 because it was based in part on existing well 39d control plane locations are shown in fig 4 additional wells were installed after the third pfm episode to augment the well distribution in cp39 consequently a fourth and final pfm deployment was subsequently conducted during this last event the lower pfm installed in well 17 2d could not be retrieved to account for its loss m for this well was estimated by scaling the m results of the upper pfm using the ratio of m for the entire well from pfm event 3 to m from the upper half only from pfm event 3 pressure transducers were used to assess groundwater flow direction during the third and fourth pfm events hydraulic head measurements were collected every 15 min and were subsequently used to calculate the average hydraulic head field during pfm deployments pressure transducers were deployed in 15 wells across the site during the third pfm event but two of these failed while deployed leaving a total of 13 hydraulic head measurement locations of these one was installed in a shallow well four were installed in intermediate wells fig 4b and the remaining in deep wells fig 4c for the shallow zone one well was insufficient to define groundwater flow direction therefore the shallow groundwater contours based on pressure transducer measurements during a previous period were assumed to apply this previous period was march 21 2012 to june 11 2012 and it included 11 shallow wells across the site fig 4a three wells are located outside the area of interest shown the purpose of measurements during this period was to assess tidal influences at the site pressure transducers were deployed in 36 monitoring wells across the site during the fourth pfm deployment and were likewise used to monitor the direction of the hydraulic gradient however 2 of these failed leaving 34 pressure transducers of these 11 were deployed in shallow wells fig 4d two wells are located outside the area of interest shown 9 were deployed in intermediate wells fig 4e and the remaining in deep wells fig 4f flux measurements were completed in both existing monitoring wells and newly installed monitoring wells well installation and construction details for existing wells varied somewhat but typically consisted of 5 1 cm 2 in diameter pvc or stainless steel well screens 3 05 m 10 ft in length and were installed with a surrounding sand filter pack the new wells were constructed using geoprobe 3 8 cm 1 5 in id pre packed pvc well screens and 3 8 cm 1 5 in id pvc casing most of these wells were installed using direct push technology in a few instances however hollow stem augers were used due to difficulties getting to target depths 4 results and discussion 4 1 ssf based on temporally distributed measurements at a fixed location using ltm data the estimated m at the szcp ranged from 300 g day in 1996 to 70 g day in 2012 fig 5a these values are similar to m measurements for chlorinated contaminants at other sites e g brooks et al 2008 and this range is among the most frequently reported values of m as reported by newell et al 2011 the data indicates a decreasing trend with an overall decline of 80 in m over 16 years one notable exception to the decreasing trend occurs at october 2008 where m 219 g day was significantly different from results immediately before 61 g day and after 76 g day this date this increase reflects increases in the aqueous concentrations measured in well 17d as no significant increases in concentration were noted in wells 4d or 5d the reason for the increase in concentration at 17d on this date is unknown but similar results were obtained from the first pfm event using the data from the first pfm event completed in september and october 2010 the m across the szcp is estimated to be 188 g day this is comparable to the estimate of 219 g day based on the ltm data from october 2008 but 3 times higher than the estimate of 54 g day based on data from the previous ltm sampling episode in april 2010 the higher m can again be attributed to results from 17d the pfm flux averaged tce concentration defined as the ratio j q for well 17d is 182 mg l and differs from the previous ltm concentration for that well by a factor of 4 it is however similar to the tce concentration measured in well 17d during the ltm sample from october 2008 150 mg l the fact that the pfm results are similar to the october 2008 ltm results suggests the latter should not be dismissed as a potential sampling artifact but rather suggest variability stemming from some currently unknown source sporadic behavior is not uncommon in monitoring data sets e g mchugh et al 2011 and while important to understand in the context of overall site management the long term data trend is more important in the evaluation of the 16 year data record to estimate the ssf results from the first pfm event were also used to evaluate estimates of q used in the historic data analysis measurements of q i k in all wells ranged from 0 3 to 3 7 cm day with a spatial average of 1 0 cm day and a spatial standard deviation of 0 4 cm day table 2 in general the groundwater flux appeared fairly uniform with depth profile plots for the first pfm event are included as fig si 7 in supplementary information and estimates of m from the ltm analysis that assumed constant q over the well screen interval appear to have been reliable in this regard the depth averaged estimates from pfm data were q i 0 96 1 49 0 90 cm day for wells 04d 05d and 17d respectively well 04d had the largest discrepancy in q i estimates based on slug test and pfm results 0 03 cm day versus 0 96 cm day respectively however when comparing these estimates it is important to note that pfm theory assumes advective dominated flow and flow rates as low as 0 03 cm day may hinder pfm accuracy because advective flow may not dominate the transport process e g hatfield et al 2004 nonetheless if the pfm estimate of q i for well 04d is used in the m calculations without presuming which of the two q i estimates is more correct the revised m estimate increases by only 11 this is due to the fact that the m estimate is dominated by the m contribution from well 17d consequently there would have been significant changes in the estimate of the ssf if there had been a similar discrepancy in the value of q i used for well 17d having data from the first pfm event that corroborates the value of q i used provided additional confidence to estimates of m based on the ltm data 4 2 ssf based on spatially distributed measurements at a fixed time results from all four pfm sampling events are summarized in table 2 which lists the minimum median average and maximum values of q equivalent tce j and equivalent tce c f the equivalent tce was based on the molar summation of pca tce and dce table 3 summarizes the m estimates based on the third and fourth pfm deployments for the three depth horizons at each control plane and fig 5b shows the m based on the third and fourth pfm deployments for the three control planes as a function of down gradient horizontal distance profile plots for measurements completed in all wells during pfm events 1 2 3 and 4 are included as figs si 7 si 8 si 9 and si 10 respectively in supplementary information differences in summary statistics table 2 between events may reflect the impact of different sampling locations and changes in hydrologic conditions between pfm sampling events for comparison histograms of q for each of the four pfm deployments is shown in fig 6 and results from pfm event 4 appear notably different from the other three the average and maximum q increased by factors of 2 5 and 1 9 respectively between pfm events 3 and 4 the maximum q from pfm event 3 6 0 cm day occurred in well 39i at an elevation of 7 18 m while the maximum q from pfm event 4 11 3 cm day occurred in well 19s at an elevation of 3 46 m differences in the distribution of q between pfm events 3 and 4 are believed to be in large part the result from a significant rain event which occurred early in the fourth pfm deployment rainfall records from two nearby climate stations national oceanic and atmospheric administration 2017 were reviewed for the east greenwich station located 4 km to the north of the site data was available from 2008 to 2014 and the rainfall amount received on march 30 2014 was the second largest for this station for the providence station located 11 km to the north of the site data from 2004 to 2014 was reviewed and the rainfall amount received on march 30 2014 was the third largest see fig si 11 in supplementary information further support for this is evident by comparing the groundwater elevation contours in fig 4f to those in figs 1 4c and si 3 taking well 17d as a reference for example the contour during pfm event 4 is 0 3 m higher than the contour based on the ltm pfm event 3 and tidal study data sets consequently hydrological conditions are believed to be the primary factor for the difference in pfm events 3 and 4 this was further tested by analyzing a subset of the pfm event 4 results restricted to those wells included in pfm event 3 and the results are not significantly different from those obtained with the entire pfm event 4 sample set see table 2 and fig 6d indicating differences between results from pfm event 3 and 4 are not associated with the additional wells included in pfm event 4 measurements of m across control planes cp15 cp17 and cp39 differ by factors of 23 2 and 18 respectively between pfm events 3 and 4 in contrast to average q which differs by a factor of 85 between pfm events 3 and 4 consequently the average equivalent tce c f differs by 114 between pfm events 3 and 4 indicating concentration dilution if as suspected differences in the q distribution between pfm events 3 and 4 result from the unusually high rainfall event that occurred early in the pfm event 4 deployment then increases in q were offset by concentration dilution resulting in similar m estimates between pfm events 3 and 4 consequently pfm event 4 is still valuable to the original goal to provide a m measurement at cp39 with greater certainty compared to that in pfm event 3 through the installation of additional cp39 wells results from pfm events 3 and 4 indicate that m increases in the downgradient direction ranging from approximately 5 to 7 g day at cp15 38 g day at cp17 and 400 to 500 g day at cp39 fig 5b illustrates increasing m for the three control planes as a function of down gradient horizontal distance using results from pfm events 3 and 4 this behavior is expected given the decreasing trend in m versus time observed at the szcp based on the ltm data analysis fig 5a since a ssf relates m and time the spatial distribution under this approach as depicted in fig 5b must be related to time as depicted in fig 5a this can be accomplished under simplified conditions i e neglecting longitudinal dispersion and mass loss processes by using the definition of travel time τ ηrℓ q where η is porosity r is the retardation factor and ℓ is distance in the flow direction l for convenience the spatial origin is taken to be cp17 and the temporal origin is selected as may 1996 the first date for which historical monitoring data is available and a relative elapsed travel time is defined as t t t 0 τ where t 0 may 1996 consequently t 0 at cp17 in may 1996 a m measurement completed at cp17 in may 1996 reflects m at cp15 at t τ 1 where τ 1 is the travel time from cp15 to cp17 likewise it reflects m at cp39 at t τ 2 where τ 2 is the travel time from cp17 to cp39 estimates of τ were based on η 25 which was the value assumed in previous characterization work tetra tech 2013 the geometric mean value of q as measured in pfm events 3 and 4 was used as an estimate of the site wide spatially averaged groundwater flux denoted by q resulting in q 1 4 4 6 cm day for pfm events 3 and 4 respectively an estimate of r 5 came from assuming linear partitioning therefore r 1 ρ b k d η where ρ b is bulk density ml 3 and k d is the distribution coefficient l3 m 1 a value of ρ b 1 4 g cm3 was used as assumed in previous characterization work tetra tech 2013 an estimate of k d was based on the product k oc f oc where k oc is the organic carbon partitioning coefficient l3 m 1 for tce and f oc is the organic carbon fraction mm 1 a value of 94 l kg was used for the former based on the geometric mean calculated in u s environmental protection agency 1996 using 21 measurements reported in the literature and a value of 0 0077 kg kg was used for the latter based on the geometric mean of 64 total organic carbon measurements from the site as reported in ea engineering science and technology 1998 and tetra tech 2013 fig 7 presents the resulting ssf data set based on the spatially distributed m estimates from pfm events 3 and 4 as well as the ssf data set from the ltm analysis data from pfm events 3 and 4 are dissimilar and the data from pfm event 3 appears to match the ltm data much more favorably than data from pfm event 4 since m estimates based on the third and fourth pfm deployments were within 20 of one another differences between the two data sets as represented in fig 7 are predominately due to differences in τ which in turn reflect differences in q between the two deployments as discussed earlier it is believed that measurements of q during pfm event 4 were unduly influenced by a rainfall event at the start of the deployment this highlights the importance of evaluating groundwater and mass flux measurements in the broader context of historic site conditions as interpreting any one event in isolation may lead to misleading conclusions 4 3 evaluation of the two approaches the estimate of the ssf based on temporally distributed m measurements at a fixed location relied on data that had been collected as part of initial characterization and ltm activities as such it did not require the installation of any addition wells nor the use of any specialized methods for the measurement of q or j it was therefore by far the less expensive of the two approaches two large sources of uncertainty in this approach if not the largest are the well spacing within the control plane and the estimates of q i especially given the dependence of the ssf on results from a single well 17d well spacing impacts the uncertainty of m estimates and therefore the ssf and the large un sampled space between the available wells suggested high uncertainty for example the average well spacing and screen interval depth result in a depth averaged sampling density of 0 01 points per square meter results from mackay et al 2012 suggest relative percent difference between measured and true mass discharges may range from 100 the minimum possible to 150 for this sampling density while results from chen et al 2014 and brooks et al 2015 suggest the uncertainty expressed as the standard deviation of error and coefficient of variation in m respectively may be 300 depending on the plume width and maximum j the other source of large uncertainty with this approach stems from the estimate of q i based on k i and i i uncertainty may exist in both measurements and it may arise in the product of the two when the support volumes associated with the two measurements are not similar e g kübert and finkel 2006 as conducted in this study an independent measurement e g pfms was used to confirm the value of q i at least in the well with the greatest impact on the ssf and therefore reduce the uncertainty associated with this estimate the agreement between the two measurements in our study however does not mean similar confirmation is unwarranted at other sites finally this approach provides estimates of m at one control plane if attempts had been made to use these m measurements to predict m at downgradient locations there would have been uncertainty in the predictions because of various fate and transport properties between the locations the second approach relied on spatially distributed m at a fixed time to measure the ssf in this study these were completed using pfms to measure j in a combination of existing and newly installed monitoring wells the sampling density was 0 6 points per square meter for both control planes cp15 and cp17 during both pfm events 3 and 4 as a result it is estimated that the uncertainty in m estimates based on pfm measurements is an order of magnitude less than uncertainty in m estimates based on ltm data in the first approach the sampling densities used in control plane cp39 were not as high and for pfm events 3 and 4 were 0 1 and 0 2 points per square meter respectively however uncertainty in m estimates are still believed to be an order of magnitude less than those based on the ltm data supporting details for these statements are provided in section si 4 of supplementary information the second approach also relied on an estimate of q to calculate the τ between control planes however given that j measurements were completed using pfms a device which also provides estimates of q data was available upon which to base an estimate nonetheless a source of uncertainty in this approach is the need to estimate q in a heterogeneous environment in theory only one deployment in time would be needed to estimate a ssf using spatially distributed m measurements however results from the fourth pfm deployment illustrate the potential hazards of doing so if unaverage conditions prevail during the deployment moreover it might be difficult to assess how well conditions during the deployment represent average conditions over the life of the contaminant plume while estimates of m did not appear to be sensitive to changes in hydrologic conditions that occurred during pfm events 3 and 4 the estimate of q was different resulting in a ssf different from those based on the ltm and pfm event 3 data sets relative to the first approach the second approach required significantly more expense to complete this expense may have been reduced by using less wells at greater spacing or by averaging pfm samples over larger intervals which reflects the tradeoff between cost and certainty however the utility of the generated data extends beyond that associated with estimation of the ssf alone and it is useful for other site management purposes for example while details of the spatial j distributions across a given control plane were not discussed in this work it is useful to note that further efforts at addressing the risk associated with the remaining dnapl mass could be guided by this distribution for example the m associated with cp17 is predominately centered on the lower part of well 17d this indicates that the best place for any further dnapl characterization activities is the area upgradient of this location but downgradient of cp15 at a depth comparable to the hotspot in 17d moreover spatial flux distributions could also be used to target remediation activities whether in the source or plume the combined use of both approaches provided complimentary lines of evidence for a site specific estimate of the ssf similarity between ssfs based on the ltm and pfm event 3 data sets helped address uncertainty in τ estimates based on an estimate of q and the dissimilarity in results between ltm and pfm event 4 highlighted the unusual hydrologic conditions during that deployment likewise the similarity between the ltm and pfm event 3 data sets helped address uncertainty associated with the wells spacing and q i estimates in the approached based on the ltm data the similarity in the data sets also supports the use of the ssf estimate as a site wide estimate given the spatial distribution of the three control planes in the second approach the m data can be used for ssf model calibration which then can be used to support site management decisions perhaps the most common and simplest model to adopt is an exponential function 4 m m 0 exp m 0 m 0 t where m 0 and m 0 are the initial mass discharge mt 1 and mass m respectively another reason for selecting an exponential model for illustration is that results from chen and jawitz 2009 indicate that as the dnapl source zone ages the ssf converges to an exponentially decreasing model the exponential model was fit to the data by treating m 0 and m 0 as fitting parameters to minimize the difference between the modeled and measured data as noted above measurements upon which to base the model fits were first collected in may 1996 and that date was therefore used as the initial year model fits are summarized in table 4 for the ltm pfm event 3 and pfm event 4 data sets as well the combined ltm pfm event 3 data set moreover the model fit for the ltm data is shown in fig 5a and the combined ltm pfm event 3 model is shown in fig 7 model parameters are within a factor of two for the ltm data and pfm event 3 data however parameters differ by as much as two orders of magnitude for the fit associated with pfm event 4 given the similarity in m estimates between pfm events 3 and 4 this difference must stem primarily from the high value of q for pfm event 4 4 4 modeling to demonstrate the complementary nature of the two approaches the similarity between the ltm and pfm event 3 data as illustrated in fig 7 gives confidence to the use of this combined data set for site specific ssf calibration relative to either the ltm or pfm event 3 data sets being solely used to illustrate how both approaches provide data to support a common ssf modeling simulations were completed using remchlor falta 2008 based on the input parameters summarized in table 5 remchlor assumes a power law model plm to describe the dnapl architecture and dissolution behavior and an exponent of 1 was used to represent an exponential function as used in the previous section the values for m 0 and m 0 were based on the exponential model fit to the combined ltm pfm event 3 data set as shown in fig 7 the basis for the remaining values used are summarized in table 5 and are generally based on conditions at this site however use of this model with the parameters shown in table 5 is not meant to be a strict calibration exercise but rather an exercise to illustrate the similarity in m obtained by temporal measurements at a fixed location versus spatially distributed measurements at a fixed time two cases were investigated case 1 with minimal longitudinal dispersion and case 2 with moderate longitudinal dispersion remchlor uses a streamtube based approach for simulating longitudinal dispersion which results in a scale dependent dispersivity value i e dispersivity is a linear function of travel distance or the ratio of dispersivity to travel distance is constant for case 1 the ratio of dispersivity to travel distance was assumed to be 5e 11 and for case 2 the ratio was assumed to be 0 02 these values result in sigmav 0 00001 0 2 respectively as shown in table 5 where sigmav represents the groundwater velocity coefficient of variation falta 2008 modeling results are shown in fig 8 the r 2 value based on fitting an exponential model to both data sets is 0 999 in case 1 and the slope in linear natural log space is 0 00043 days 1 which is equal to the source decay term i e m 0 m 0 used as input to the plm case 1 illustrates that in the absence of longitudinal dispersion and decay processes the original source function is recovered using either approach moreover estimation of the ssf is insensitive to transverse dispersion since m is based on the integration of measurements across the control plane case 2 illustrates that for the modeling simulation investigated longitudinal dispersion has a minor impact on the estimation of the ssf the r 2 value based on fitting an exponential model to the simulated data in this case is 0 996 and the slope in linear natural log space is still 0 00043 days 1 again equal to the input source decay term a comparison of the spatially distributed m data at a fixed time to the temporally distributed m at a fixed location in case 2 indicates the former appears to have a slightly more negative slope than the latter this same pattern is evident in fig 7 when comparing the ltm data to that from pfm event 3 4 5 mass balance applications using the ssf based on the combined ltm pfm event 3 data sets with the assumed exponential ssf it is estimated that m 0 400 g day and m 0 1000 kg these numbers reflect m at cp17 in may 1996 and the mass remaining upgradient of cp17 at that time an estimate of the remaining dnapl as of 2017 based on the ssf is 60 kg lacking data to suggest more specific uncertainty bounds on the estimate of remaining dnapl plus or minus an order of magnitude is assumed i e 6 to 600 kg one way by which to gage the significance of this number is to compare it to the contaminant mass in the plume this comparison has been used to define the relative age of a dnapl source by chen and jawitz 2009 a relatively young site has the majority of contaminant mass in the source zone and a relatively aged site has the majority of the contaminant mass in the plume tetra tech 2010 estimated an average equivalent tce dissolved phase mass of 2000 kg for the period between 2005 and 2009 this estimate accounts for abiotic and biotic degradation using a molar sum of pca tce and dce further degradation is not considered significant to plume mass estimates because dce concentrations have been roughly an order of magnitude smaller than tce concentrations mass loss due to volatilization was neglected an assumption supported by the fact that a large fraction of the contaminant mass is located well below the water table sorbed mass is accounted for using r 5 as estimated previously values of retardation factors specific to pca and dce are not used which is not considered to be a significant issue since the dominant chemical species in the plume is tce the plume mass accounting for sorbed mass is therefore 10 000 kg mass estimates were presumably restricted to the borders of the site and did not account for any mass that may have migrated beyond the site borders another source of uncertainty is the potential loss of mass to the underlying rock formation consequently plume mass estimates may have a negative bias this is likewise suggested by comparing the estimate of 10 000 kg to the estimate of the total mass released 45 000 kg based on historic data assuming little to no dnapl remains however given the potential uncertainty in both estimates a factor of 4 5 difference may not be significant finally comparisons between the source and plume mass when considering the relative age of the dnapl source are made within an assumed framework of a single source that creates the entire contaminant plume for the site there is uncertainty that this is the case for the calf pasture point site given the extent of contamination to the west of the control planes however the majority of the contaminant plume is captured by the control plane locations and as such the evaluation of relative age is useful for a screening level analysis using the ssf an estimate of the dnapl mass upgradient of cp17 at the midpoint of the time frame for the plume mass estimate 2007 is 200 kg the difference between dnapl mass in 2007 200 kg and 2017 60 kg is 140 kg adding this mass to the estimate of plume mass from 2007 10 000 kg gives a 2017 plume mass estimate of 10 140 kg which given the uncertainty of the former essentially results in the same plume mass estimate moreover given the relative insignificance of 60 kg compared to 10 140 kg the site is considered to be an aged site with the majority of the dnapl mass in the plume this statement is valid even with the assumed order of magnitude uncertainty range on dnapl mass given the relative amount of dnapl mass compared to the plume mass it is estimated that the source has limited potential to enlarge the contaminant plume and that since the plume contains the majority of the contaminant mass addressing the remaining dnapl mass may represent a secondary priority compared to eliminating or minimizing the risk associated with the contaminant plume other factors however may impact evaluations of relative risk and comparisons of dnapl mass to plume mass is but one facet of such an evaluation 5 summary and conclusions source strength functions provide a quantitative model of dnapl source zone behavior and as such are useful for contaminated site management two approaches were used to estimate ssfs for the calf pasture point site one based on temporally distributed m measurements at a fixed control plane and the other based on spatially distributed m measurements across three control planes at the same time the combined use of both approaches provided complimentary lines of evidence for a site specific estimate of the ssf the former was based exclusively on data that had been collected as part of site characterization and as part of the ltm activities and demonstrates the utility of this type of data in flux based site management results of this analysis indicated m across a control plane downgradient of the assumed source location had been as high as 300 g day in 1996 and has decreased to 70 g day in 2012 a limited set of groundwater and contaminant flux measurements using passive flux meters were used to provide additional support for these measurements and showed that in this particular application detailed vertical information did not significantly impact m estimates in large part this outcome stemmed from the fact that m estimates were largely impacted by results from a single well 17d and estimates of concentration and groundwater flux compared favorably between pfm results and the ltm analysis at this well however this outcome is dependent on location specific conditions of heterogeneity and similar results at other locations are not necessarily expected a ssf was also estimated for the site using m measurements across three spatially distributed control planes at a fixed point in time and is the first such demonstration to our knowledge these measurements were completed using pfm deployments the control planes were located at increasing distances downgradient from the assumed source zone moving downgradient from the source is comparable to moving backwards in time moreover for the decreasing trend in m as measured based on the ltm data moving downgradient from the source should yield increasing m measurements assuming mass loss processes such as biotic and abiotic degradation are negligible for this site measurements at control planes cp15 cp17 and cp39 listed in order of increasing downgradient direction were 6 g day 37 g day and 400 g day respectively these measurements were compared to those from the ltm data using estimates of travel time for one of two complete pfm measurement events m from the spatially distributed control planes compared favorably with the estimates from the ltm data which provides a data set with more confidence upon which to calibrate a ssf model because each approach offered complimentary strengths for the second complete pfm measurement event m from the spatially distributed control planes also compared favorably with the estimates from the ltm data relative to the magnitude of m e g the m estimates from pfm events 3 and 4 were within 20 of one another however the timing of the m estimates using travel time did not compare well this discrepancy was attributed with an unusually large rainfall event that occurred at the start of the pfm event and highlights the need to evaluate conditions during deployment relative to conditions that usually prevail at a given site using ssf estimates from both approaches provided the means of comparison by which to identify the abnormal hydrologic conditions associated with the second complete measurement event a number of ssf models are available and can be used for assisting with contaminated site management decisions as an illustration an exponential model was assumed and the measured data was used for model calibration the ssf model was used to estimate dnapl mass and this was compared to the dissolved contaminant mass in the plume the latter was roughly two to three orders of magnitude greater than the former this comparison indicates an aged site and suggests that the dissolution of any remaining dnapl should not have a huge impact on contaminant mass in the plume acknowledgements the work

1624,in situ thermal treatment istt technologies have been applied at sites impacted by non aqueous phase liquids napls there is a need to establish expectations for the treatment of semi volatile napls including those consisting primarily of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and the potential benefits and limitations of partial napl removal a series of laboratory experiments was conducted to investigate napl removal and soil concentrations during the heating of creosote impacted sand as well as aqueous concentrations during post heating dissolution the results showed co boiling near the water boiling temperature due to the low volatility of most creosote components with limited decreases in napl saturation from 30 to 21 of the pore space decreases in soil concentration were more substantial than decreases in napl saturation by a factor of 2 180 with greater removal for higher volatility components at higher treatment temperatures results of the dissolution experiments showed mixed results with decreases in the aqueous concentrations for 12 of 15 components but increases in aqueous concentrations for phenanthrene fluoranthene and pyrene after heating to 205 c or 320 c overall the results illustrate the utility of bench scale treatability tests in helping to establish istt goals and expectations keywords groundwater remediation in situ thermal treatment thermal conductive heating non aqueous phase liquid creosote polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 1 introduction in situ thermal treatment istt technologies are a group of remediation technologies used to address sites impacted by non aqueous phase liquids napls both above and below the water table istt technologies include thermal conductive heating tch electrical resistance heating erh and steam enhanced extraction see while the mechanism of delivering energy to the subsurface differs between these technologies the purpose of each is to increase subsurface temperatures this increase in temperature promotes mass transfer to the gas phase through phase change boiling and increased partitioning to facilitate the production mobilization and capture of a gas phase which is the primary treatment objective at most sites an increase in temperature can also increase napl mobility through reductions in viscosity and interfacial tension to facilitate liquid recovery and can increase the rate of hydrolysis reactions for some compounds triplett kingston et al 2014 gerkens and franklin 1989 gauthier and murphy 2003 istt technologies have been applied at a variety of sites including those impacted by volatile napls e g chlorinated solvents and petroleum fuels as well as semi volatile napls e g creosote and coal tar despite the application of istt technologies to treat both volatile organic compounds vocs and semi volatile organic compounds svocs including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs hansen et al 1998 baker et al 2006 baker et al 2007 much of the literature has been focused on vocs de voe and udell 1998 heron et al 1998 burghardt and kueper 2008 martin and kueper 2011 zhao et al 2014 hegele and mumford 2014 liu et al 2013 munholland et al 2016 there is a need to understand and establish expectations for the treatment of semi volatile napls including the concentrations of pahs in soil and groundwater following istt and the potential benefits and limitations of partial napl removal the removal of semi volatile napls generally defined here as those consisting primarily of svocs during istt is expected to progress differently than the removal of volatile napls during the istt of napl impacted soil the temperature at which gas production occurs is dictated by the sum of the vapour pressures of the water and the napl zhao et al 2014 1 p w v i n x i γ i p i v p w p c where p w v is the vapour pressure of water x i is the mole fraction of component i in the napl γ i is the activity coefficient of component i in the napl p i v is the vapour pressure of pure component i in the napl p w is the water pressure and p c is the capillary pressure p c is taken to be the capillary pressure characteristic of heterogeneous nucleation jones et al 1999 at the first formation of gas and is a function of gas saturation wettability and the pore throat size distribution of the porous medium at later times the second term on the left hand side of eq 1 raoult s law represents the total napl vapour pressure the vapour pressures of water and the napl components increase exponentially with temperature with more volatile compounds having a higher vapour pressure at any given temperature fig 1 the combination of napl and water vapour pressures to produce gas is referred to as co boiling and occurs at a temperature below the boiling point of water this results in gas formation during erh and tch and facilitates voc and svoc removal by steam distillation during see tzovolou et al 2011 nilsson et al 2011 for lower volatility compounds this can be close to water boiling i e 99 c at a pressure of 1 atm but for higher volatility compounds the co boiling temperature can be substantially lower for example tetrachloroethene pce napl and water will co boil at a temperature of 88 c at a pressure of 1 atm munholland et al 2016 whereas naphthalene and water will co boil at a temperature of 99 5 c the compounds shown in fig 1 have been divided into two groups separated by a curve that passes through a vapour pressure of 0 1 atm at 100 c where substantial removal at temperatures below the boiling point of water is expected for compounds above that curve many chlorinated solvents lie above that curve while pahs lie below that curve once gas production begins energy delivered to the subsurface during istt is converted to latent heat in the case of a single component napl this results in observations of a temperature plateau provided that temperature measurements are made sufficiently close to the napl water interface where co boiling occurs zhao et al 2014 in the case of a multicomponent napl the more volatile components are removed preferentially which reduces their mole fraction in the napl this leads to a decrease in the effective vapour pressure of those components and a continuing increase in temperature is required to increase the effective vapour pressures of the less volatile components and sustain a gas phase eq 1 as a result there is no clear co boiling plateau but a co boiling region during which temperature increases more slowly over time than prior to gas production as energy is converted to both sensible and latent heat the temperature of the co boiling plateau or region is controlled by the composition of the napl and whether water and napl are present the preferential removal of the more volatile components which are often the more soluble components has been suggested as the basis for successful istt of multicomponent napls even if the napl is only partially removed hayes and srivastava 2005 the decrease in the mole fraction of the more volatile components lowers the effective vapour pressure and the effective solubility of each volatile component thereby reducing partitioning post treatment and potentially decreasing risks associated with both the gas and aqueous phase pathways this effective solubility is given by a modified raoult s law peters et al 1999 fraser et al 2008 2 c s i e x i c s i where c s i e is the effective solubility of compound i and c s i is the solubility of pure compound i for individual compounds that are solids at standard conditions the sub cooled liquid solubility is the appropriate c s i lee et al 1992 which can be estimated from the aqueous solubility and a ratio of the solid and liquid fugacities peters et al 1999 further modifications can be made to account for non ideal mixtures banerjee 1984 however while the mole fractions of the more volatile components decrease the opposite is true for the less volatile components an increase in the mole fraction of the less volatile components leads to an increase in their effective vapour pressure and effective solubility similar changes in effective solubility are also expected during dissolution of multicomponent napls under natural conditions although over longer time frames peters et al 1999 fraser et al 2008 therefore the benefits of partial napl removal where the most volatile and soluble components are removed first may be limited by the increased effective solubility of other lower volatility components this may be particularly relevant to semi volatile multicomponent napls that contain compounds with a wide range of vapour pressures most of which are not substantially removed at temperatures lower than the boiling point of water one example of a semi volatile multicomponent napl is creosote which consists of volatile semi volatile and non volatile components creosote is an industrial wood preservative produced as a distillate of coal tar and an estimated 700 sites have been used in the united states for wood preservation mueller et al 1989 creosote can contain up to 200 individual compounds and although its composition varies between sites due to the coal tar source and distillation process thomson et al 2008 mueller et al 1989 reported an approximate composition of 85 pahs 10 phenolic compounds and 5 nitrogen sulfur and oxygen hetrocyclic compounds by mass the

these compounds range from 218 to 550 c from naphthalene to benzo ghi perylene and they co boil with water at temperatures 99 5 c yaws 2003 following from the above the purpose of this study was to investigate the treatment of creosote impacted sand by heating specific objectives were to i establish relationships between creosote removal and temperature ii determine the effect of different heating temperatures on pah concentrations in soil and iii determine the effect of different heating temperatures on pah concentrations in water following heating and post heating dissolution a series of bench scale experiments including heating experiments and dissolution experiments were conducted using laboratory prepared samples of creosote sand and water 2 materials and methods 2 1 heating experiments three experiments were conducted to investigate creosote removal by heating to approximately 130 c 205 c and 320 c table 1 an additional heating experiment h 130 v was conducted to specifically investigate the removal of vocs during heating which required different soil sampling times described below each of the experiments were conducted in custom designed and constructed 1 l stainless steel cylinders 13 2 cm tall 10 cm inner diameter the removable end plates of the cylinders were sealed to the body using quick clamps and high temperature silicone gaskets mcmaster carr 4520 k48 each top plate was equipped with four compression fittings swagelok ss 200 1 2bt ss 400 1 2bt two for thermocouples one for a pressure release valve and one for a vapour outlet tube 0 6 cm outer diameter copper pipe one thermocouple referred to as the inner thermocouple was positioned in the center of the top plate and the other referred to as the outer thermocouple was positioned at the midpoint between the inner thermocouple and the edge of the cylinder these thermocouples were inserted 5 cm below the top plate approximately 2 cm into the sand each cylinder was packed with a mixture of creosote sand and water to a porosity of 35 and an initial creosote saturation of 30 the creosote was used as received from the supplier stella jones inc the sand was 40 60 mesh size silica sand agsco corporation and was rinsed with distilled water prior to packing packing was conducted in three equally sized lifts and the creosote sand and water were mixed thoroughly with a glass stir rod between lifts to achieve a uniform distribution of creosote in the sand a stainless steel mesh 70 mesh size 0 17 wire diameter covered with a 3 cm thick layer of peastone gravel was placed on top of the sand to prevent sand displacement during boiling and prevent clogging of the pressure relief valve and vapour outlet tube four cylinders were used in each experiment three were heated together in a laboratory convection oven binder 9010 0131 ed fig 2 and one was left unheated to measure initial soil concentrations during heating temperatures were measured using both the inner and outer thermocouple in each cylinder and recorded every 30 s keithley 2700 data acquisition system with keithley 7709 multiplexer vapour was not extracted from the cylinders under vacuum but was allowed to escape through the vapour outlet tubes which discharged outside of the oven to a controlled exhaust the vapour outlet tubes were heated outside of the oven using heating tape omega htwc101 002 to prevent condensation in those tubes the vapour outlet tube for one cylinder per experiment was connected to a water cooled liebig condenser which discharged to a chilled graduated cylinder for the collection and measurement of condensate fig 2 preliminary experiments using only water and sand were used to verify mass balance and confirm vapour recovery by condensation cylinders were periodically removed from the oven sacrificed for the collection of soil samples with sacrificial samples collected from experiments h 130 h 205 and h 320 once the desired oven temperature had been reached at the position of the inner thermocouple and again 5 days and 10 days later in experiment h 130 v sacrificial samples were collected 5 11 and 24 h after heating had begun because earlier sampling times were required to observe decreases in the voc concentrations prior to their removal 2 2 dissolution experiments four dissolution experiments were conducted to determine the aqueous concentrations of pah compounds resulting from the dissolution of creosote from unheated sand control or from sand heated to 130 c 205 c or 320 c table 2 each of the dissolution experiments were conducted in stainless steel cylinders similar to those used in the heating experiments but were 5 28 cm tall 7 25 cm inner diameter each of the end plates of these cylinders included a perforated stainless steel plate and mesh to support the sand and a conical inside surface to distribute flow across the face of that plate hicknell 2017 the cylinders were packed either in the same manner as for the heating experiments for experiment d 21 or using a sub sample of sand and creosote collected at the end of the heating experiments for experiments d 130 d 205 and d 320 for these post heating experiments dry creosote and sand were packed into the cylinders and water was added as part of the dissolution procedure after packing 3 l 34 37 pore volumes of degassed deionized water was pumped upwards through the cylinders at a flow rate of 0 29 ml min at room temperature 21 c this flow rate was selected to be sufficiently slow to promote dissolution under local equilibrium conditions defined by predicted effluent concentrations 99 of the solubility based on published mass transfer correlations powers et al 1992 imhoff et al 1994 miller et al 1990 dissolution at this temperature represents conditions after istt has been completed and sufficient time has passed for subsurface temperatures to return to pre heating conditions all effluent from the cylinders was collected in 1 l amber bottles for analysis of dissolved pah concentrations 2 3 analysis of water and soil samples during the heating experiments soil samples were collected from sacrificed cylinders within 5 min of removing the cylinders from the oven the top plate gravel and stainless steel mesh were removed and the top 0 5 cm of sand was scraped and discarded a sub sample of creosote impacted sand approximately 125 ml was then collected from a depth interval of 0 5 5 cm and placed in an amber jar which was stored at 5 c until analyzed soil samples from experiment h 130 v were extracted using 10

measured by the inner and outer thermocouples during experiments h 130 and h 320 are shown in fig 3 these temperature profiles show heating of creosote impacted sand in four stages napl water heating napl water co boiling napl heating and sustained heating using temperatures measured in experiment h 130 as an example fig 3a napl water heating occurred at 0 0 17 days this appears as an upward curved profile in fig 3 because of the logarithmic scale used on the time axis but is in fact an approximately linear increase in temperature over time napl water co boiling then occurred at 0 17 0 7 days which is characterized by a temperature plateau at approximately 100 c because of the low volatility of most of the creosote components this was followed by napl heating at 0 7 1 1 days and sustained heating at 1 1 11 days the same four stages were observed during experiment h 320 fig 3b but the napl water heating and napl water co boiling stages were shorter and occurred earlier due to the higher temperature of the oven in all heating experiments and in all replicate cylinders temperature at the outer thermocouple increased earlier than at the inner thermocouple which is consistent with the outside to inside conductive heating of the cylinders in the oven short term decrease then increase in temperature e g at 0 25 and 5 3 days in experiment h 320 were caused by opening the oven door to retrieve the sacrificial cylinders for soil sampling and are an artefact of the procedure the temperature profiles shown in fig 3 are different than those observed in similar experiments using more volatile napl zhao et al 2014 in those experiments and as expected in field applications of istt for volatile napl heating includes a water heating stage and a water boiling stage that occur after napl water co boiling therefore temperature profiles for volatile napls contain two temperature plateaus i a distinct co boiling plateau for the case of a single component napl or a more slowly increasing co boiling region in the case of a multicomponent napl that occur below the water boiling temperature and ii a distinct water boiling plateau however only one plateau is essentially observed during the heating of creosote impacted sand because the napl water co boiling temperature is close to the water boiling temperature in addition while the removal of volatile napl at the co boiling temperature is limited by the mass of napl the removal of semi volatile napl at the co boiling temperature is limited by the mass of water that is heating of volatile napl moves from the napl water co boiling stage to the water heating stage when the napl is depleted whereas heating of semi volatile napl moves from the napl water co boiling stage to the napl heating stage when water is depleted therefore the removal of semi volatile napl components at the co boiling temperature could be prolonged by the addition of water supplied either by ambient groundwater flow or as part of an istt design additional water i e more than one pore volume is available for co boiling during field applications and could improve performance over what was observed here prolonged co boiling is also facilitated by the injection of steam during see applications 3 2 water gas and creosote saturations during heating saturations of all three fluids water gas and creosote during experiments h 130 and h 320 calculated from initial saturations and measurements of the condensate are also shown in fig 3 as expected decreases in water saturation and increases in gas saturation occurred during the co boiling stage in both experiments creosote removal began at the beginning of the co boiling stage and decreased from 30 to 26 by the end of co boiling this decrease did not continue in the h 130 experiment despite prolonged heating at 130 c but creosote saturations did decrease to 21 in the h 320 experiment to facilitate comparison between experiments as well as to previously conducted experiments using chlorinated solvents fig 4 shows the creosote saturation plotted against the temperature measured by the inner thermocouple the napl saturations are depicted as normalized to the initial napl saturation prior to heating profiles for heating of pce as well as a mixture of pce 1 2 dichloroethane and chlorobenzene in sand zhao et al 2014 show a decrease in napl saturation starting at the co boiling temperature which remained constant for pce and increased steadily for the multicomponent napl this decrease continued until it reached low napl saturations between 1 and 9 in these previous experiments when temperatures increased due to co boiling that was occurring away from the local temperature measurement location zhao et al 2014 the profile for heating creosote impacted sand was different than these previous profiles in three respects first as expected based on results shown in fig 3 there was no removal prior to reaching a co boiling temperature near the water boiling temperature consistent with the co boiling temperature of many creosote components e g pahs above 99 5 c second creosote removal did not occur as a steady decrease but as a predominantly two stage process at nearly 100 c and at 290 to 320 c with little change in saturation from 100 to 290 c this demonstrates that designing an istt application to a target temperature of 100 to 290 c to treat this creosote would result in increased energy cost with little benefit if the reduction of napl saturations was the treatment objective it is important to note that heating occurred much faster in these experiments than in field applications therefore any mass transport limitations on voc recovery as temperatures increased would play a larger role in these experiments than in field applications third creosote saturations were 20 67 of the initial creosote saturation even after prolonged heating at 320 c for 10 days attributed to the creosote components whose combined effective vapour pressures were not sufficient for removal at 320 c observations of staged removal based on the saturation and temperature data were supported by observations of the condensate soon after reaching the co boiling stage the condensate included both water and lighter than water napl lnapl as lighter molecular weight higher volatility components were removed from the cylinders at later time precipitate was observed at the water lnapl interface in the condensate identified as naphthalene in subsequent analyses at later times denser than water napl dnapl was also observed in the condensate and lnapl changed colour from yellow brown to brown black as heavier molecular weight lower volatility components were removed from the cylinders this multiphase recovery is important in the design of above ground treatment systems for istt applications but it is also an important consideration for the design of subsurface heating systems failure to provide adequate heating to sustain connected gas pathways between napl in target heating zones and gas extraction points can lead to napl condensation munholland et al 2016 and in the case of creosote and other pah containing napls to the formation of condensate napl or solid precipitates whose composition and risk differs substantially from the originally targeted napl 3 3 btex and pah concentrations in soil during heating btex concentrations in soil during the h 130 v experiment are shown in fig 5 toluene ethylbenzene p m xylene and o xylene concentrations were reduced to below their detection limits 0 8 0 4 2 and 0 8 mg kg respectively prior to the completion of napl water co boiling after 0 5 days compared to the end of co boiling at 0 7 days benzene concentrations were reduced to below their detection limit 0 2 mg kg in the sample collected at 1 day these results demonstrate the utility of istt even using moderate heating to the water boiling temperature to substantially reduce the concentrations of volatile components in napls such as creosote hansen et al 1998 hayes and srivastava 2005 baker et al 2006 pah concentrations in soil during the h 320 experiment are shown in fig 6 substantial decreases were observed for all compounds analyzed which occurred throughout all stages of heating concentrations in soil at the end of heating varied between compounds table 3 with greater removal of lower molecular weight higher volatility pahs compared to higher molecular weight lower volatility pahs for example final concentrations of acenaphthylene acenaphthene and fluorene ranged from 11 to 24 5 to 8 and 0 5 to 1 of their initial concentrations at the end of the h 130 h 205 and h 320 experiments respectively compared to the final concentrations of benzo bkj fluoranthene benzo a pyrene and dibenzo ah anthracene that ranged from 40 to 46 34 to 36 and 18 to 33 of their initial concentrations table 3 the pah soil concentrations were reduced by a factor of 2 180 depending on the compound and the heating temperature this is substantially greater than the reductions in creosote saturation which were reduced by a factor of 1 1 in the h 130 experiment and a factor of 1 4 in the h 320 experiment based on the condensate recovery fig 3 this demonstrates that for istt applications in which the treatment objectives are focused on reductions of individual soil concentrations overall removal of creosote mass will under predict treatment performance however it is important to note that even substantial reductions in individual soil concentrations may not be sufficient to meet regulatory standards 3 4 pah concentrations in water during dissolution sub samples of creosote impacted sand following completion of the h 130 h 205 and h 320 experiments were used in the dissolution experiments in all cases the heated sand could be emptied and re packed into new cylinders for dissolution this is in contrast to the solidification that has been reported previously following the heating of coal tar impacted soil to a maximum temperature of 120 c hayes and srivastava 2005 only sand from h 320 showed a change in texture with greater cohesion than the unheated creosote impacted sand but it was unclear whether this was due to the formation of solids or an increase in viscosity of the napl hicknell 2017 differences between previously reported results and those of this study may be due to the composition of the soil as well as the composition of creosote compared to coal tar and highlight that solidification should not necessarily be the expected outcome of heating semi volatile multicomponent napls pah concentrations in water following dissolution in the d 130 d 205 and d 320 experiments are shown in table 4 and fig 7 each of the concentrations are shown as normalized to the concentrations measured in the unheated control experiment d 21 and are listed in order of decreasing volatility increasing boiling temperature therefore a value of c c0 1 represents a concentration that is unchanged from the initial unheated condition the aqueous concentrations of 12 of the 15 pahs analyzed in the dissolution experiments decreased or were not significantly different relative to the unheated control experiment after heating to 130 c 205 c or 320 c note that aqueous concentrations of dibenzo ah anthracene indeno 123 cd pyrene and benzo ghi perylene were below their detection limits in the unheated control and in each of the dissolution experiments table 4 however three compounds phenanthrene fluoranthene and pyrene showed significant increases in dissolved concentration based on a confidence interval of one standard deviation after heating to 205 c and 320 c these are intermediate volatility pahs with for example vapour pressures at 200 c of 3 10 2 atm 9 10 3 atm and 6 10 3 atm for phenanthrene fluoranthene and pyrene respectively fig 1 for comparison naphthalene and acenaphthylene have vapour pressures at 200 c of 6 10 1 atm and 2 10 1 atm respectively and benzo a anthracene and benzo a pyrene have vapour pressures at 200 c of 1 10 3 atm and 3 10 4 atm respectively the increase in the dissolved concentrations of these intermediate volatility pahs is attributed to an increase in their mole fraction in the creosote as more volatile components are removed earlier and at lower temperatures this increased mole fraction leads to an increase in effective solubility eq 2 and an increase in the aqueous concentration under the local equilibrium dissolution conditions used in these experiments 4 summary and conclusions a series of heating and dissolution experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of heating on napl removal soil concentrations and aqueous concentrations in creosote impacted sand results demonstrated that temperature profiles during heating of creosote are different than those associated with heating more volatile napls with a co boiling plateau close 99 5 c to the boiling point of water with a duration that is limited by the mass of water available this is expected to be the case for any multicomponent napl that consists primarily of svocs including creosote and coal tar in these experiments decreases in creosote saturation were not substantial and decreased from 30 to 26 and 30 to 21 of the pore space for heating to 130 c and 320 c respectively this napl removal occurred in stages predominantly at approximately 100 c and at 290 320 c decreases in soil concentrations were greater than decreases in napl saturation with btex concentrations decreased to below detection limits before the complete removal of water and pah concentrations reduced by a factor of 2 180 as expected decreases in soil concentrations were greater for higher volatility compounds and higher heating temperatures following heating the aqueous concentrations resulting from the dissolution of the remaining creosote also decreased for 12 of the 15 compounds investigated however aqueous concentrations of phenanthrene fluoranthene and pyrene increased compared to the unheated control after heating to 205 c or 320 c overall these results demonstrate the potential utility of bench scale treatability tests including both heating and dissolution to help establish treatment goals and expectations they also show that complete creosote removal in istt applications is unlikely but that substantial reductions in soil concentrations and changes in napl composition can be achieved soil concentrations and aqueous concentrations after treatment should both be evaluated depending on treatment objectives at any particular site further research is required to investigate the potential to increase napl removal by prolonging the co boiling stage through water addition as well as to assess the added benefits of liquid napl and water recovery using multiphase extraction wells and higher treatment temperatures on napl removal acknowledgements funding for this research was provided

1624,in situ thermal treatment istt technologies have been applied at sites impacted by non aqueous phase liquids napls there is a need to establish expectations for the treatment of semi volatile napls including those consisting primarily of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and the potential benefits and limitations of partial napl removal a series of laboratory experiments was conducted to investigate napl removal and soil concentrations during the heating of creosote impacted sand as well as aqueous concentrations during post heating dissolution the results showed co boiling near the water boiling temperature due to the low volatility of most creosote components with limited decreases in napl saturation from 30 to 21 of the pore space decreases in soil concentration were more substantial than decreases in napl saturation by a factor of 2 180 with greater removal for higher volatility components at higher treatment temperatures results of the dissolution experiments showed mixed results with decreases in the aqueous concentrations for 12 of 15 components but increases in aqueous concentrations for phenanthrene fluoranthene and pyrene after heating to 205 c or 320 c overall the results illustrate the utility of bench scale treatability tests in helping to establish istt goals and expectations keywords groundwater remediation in situ thermal treatment thermal conductive heating non aqueous phase liquid creosote polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 1 introduction in situ thermal treatment istt technologies are a group of remediation technologies used to address sites impacted by non aqueous phase liquids napls both above and below the water table istt technologies include thermal conductive heating tch electrical resistance heating erh and steam enhanced extraction see while the mechanism of delivering energy to the subsurface differs between these technologies the purpose of each is to increase subsurface temperatures this increase in temperature promotes mass transfer to the gas phase through phase change boiling and increased partitioning to facilitate the production mobilization and capture of a gas phase which is the primary treatment objective at most sites an increase in temperature can also increase napl mobility through reductions in viscosity and interfacial tension to facilitate liquid recovery and can increase the rate of hydrolysis reactions for some compounds triplett kingston et al 2014 gerkens and franklin 1989 gauthier and murphy 2003 istt technologies have been applied at a variety of sites including those impacted by volatile napls e g chlorinated solvents and petroleum fuels as well as semi volatile napls e g creosote and coal tar despite the application of istt technologies to treat both volatile organic compounds vocs and semi volatile organic compounds svocs including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs hansen et al 1998 baker et al 2006 baker et al 2007 much of the literature has been focused on vocs de voe and udell 1998 heron et al 1998 burghardt and kueper 2008 martin and kueper 2011 zhao et al 2014 hegele and mumford 2014 liu et al 2013 munholland et al 2016 there is a need to understand and establish expectations for the treatment of semi volatile napls including the concentrations of pahs in soil and groundwater following istt and the potential benefits and limitations of partial napl removal the removal of semi volatile napls generally defined here as those consisting primarily of svocs during istt is expected to progress differently than the removal of volatile napls during the istt of napl impacted soil the temperature at which gas production occurs is dictated by the sum of the vapour pressures of the water and the napl zhao et al 2014 1 p w v i n x i γ i p i v p w p c where p w v is the vapour pressure of water x i is the mole fraction of component i in the napl γ i is the activity coefficient of component i in the napl p i v is the vapour pressure of pure component i in the napl p w is the water pressure and p c is the capillary pressure p c is taken to be the capillary pressure characteristic of heterogeneous nucleation jones et al 1999 at the first formation of gas and is a function of gas saturation wettability and the pore throat size distribution of the porous medium at later times the second term on the left hand side of eq 1 raoult s law represents the total napl vapour pressure the vapour pressures of water and the napl components increase exponentially with temperature with more volatile compounds having a higher vapour pressure at any given temperature fig 1 the combination of napl and water vapour pressures to produce gas is referred to as co boiling and occurs at a temperature below the boiling point of water this results in gas formation during erh and tch and facilitates voc and svoc removal by steam distillation during see tzovolou et al 2011 nilsson et al 2011 for lower volatility compounds this can be close to water boiling i e 99 c at a pressure of 1 atm but for higher volatility compounds the co boiling temperature can be substantially lower for example tetrachloroethene pce napl and water will co boil at a temperature of 88 c at a pressure of 1 atm munholland et al 2016 whereas naphthalene and water will co boil at a temperature of 99 5 c the compounds shown in fig 1 have been divided into two groups separated by a curve that passes through a vapour pressure of 0 1 atm at 100 c where substantial removal at temperatures below the boiling point of water is expected for compounds above that curve many chlorinated solvents lie above that curve while pahs lie below that curve once gas production begins energy delivered to the subsurface during istt is converted to latent heat in the case of a single component napl this results in observations of a temperature plateau provided that temperature measurements are made sufficiently close to the napl water interface where co boiling occurs zhao et al 2014 in the case of a multicomponent napl the more volatile components are removed preferentially which reduces their mole fraction in the napl this leads to a decrease in the effective vapour pressure of those components and a continuing increase in temperature is required to increase the effective vapour pressures of the less volatile components and sustain a gas phase eq 1 as a result there is no clear co boiling plateau but a co boiling region during which temperature increases more slowly over time than prior to gas production as energy is converted to both sensible and latent heat the temperature of the co boiling plateau or region is controlled by the composition of the napl and whether water and napl are present the preferential removal of the more volatile components which are often the more soluble components has been suggested as the basis for successful istt of multicomponent napls even if the napl is only partially removed hayes and srivastava 2005 the decrease in the mole fraction of the more volatile components lowers the effective vapour pressure and the effective solubility of each volatile component thereby reducing partitioning post treatment and potentially decreasing risks associated with both the gas and aqueous phase pathways this effective solubility is given by a modified raoult s law peters et al 1999 fraser et al 2008 2 c s i e x i c s i where c s i e is the effective solubility of compound i and c s i is the solubility of pure compound i for individual compounds that are solids at standard conditions the sub cooled liquid solubility is the appropriate c s i lee et al 1992 which can be estimated from the aqueous solubility and a ratio of the solid and liquid fugacities peters et al 1999 further modifications can be made to account for non ideal mixtures banerjee 1984 however while the mole fractions of the more volatile components decrease the opposite is true for the less volatile components an increase in the mole fraction of the less volatile components leads to an increase in their effective vapour pressure and effective solubility similar changes in effective solubility are also expected during dissolution of multicomponent napls under natural conditions although over longer time frames peters et al 1999 fraser et al 2008 therefore the benefits of partial napl removal where the most volatile and soluble components are removed first may be limited by the increased effective solubility of other lower volatility components this may be particularly relevant to semi volatile multicomponent napls that contain compounds with a wide range of vapour pressures most of which are not substantially removed at temperatures lower than the boiling point of water one example of a semi volatile multicomponent napl is creosote which consists of volatile semi volatile and non volatile components creosote is an industrial wood preservative produced as a distillate of coal tar and an estimated 700 sites have been used in the united states for wood preservation mueller et al 1989 creosote can contain up to 200 individual compounds and although its composition varies between sites due to the coal tar source and distillation process thomson et al 2008 mueller et al 1989 reported an approximate composition of 85 pahs 10 phenolic compounds and 5 nitrogen sulfur and oxygen hetrocyclic compounds by mass the pahs within creosote include those identified by the united states environmental protection agency usepa as priority pahs usepa 2014 naphthalene acenaphthylene acenaphthene fluorene phenanthrene

heating temperatures on pah concentrations in soil and iii determine the effect of different heating temperatures on pah concentrations in water following heating and post heating dissolution a series of bench scale experiments including heating experiments and dissolution experiments were conducted using laboratory prepared samples of creosote sand and water 2 materials and methods 2 1 heating

specifically investigate the removal of vocs during heating which required different soil sampling times described below each of the experiments were conducted in custom designed and constructed 1 l stainless steel cylinders 13 2 cm tall 10 cm inner diameter the removable end plates of the cylinders were sealed to the body using quick clamps and high temperature silicone gaskets mcmaster carr

outer diameter copper pipe one thermocouple referred to as the inner thermocouple was positioned in the center of the top plate and the other referred to as the outer thermocouple was positioned at the midpoint between the inner thermocouple and the edge of the cylinder these thermocouples were inserted 5 cm below the top plate approximately 2 cm into the sand each cylinder was packed with a mixture of creosote sand and water to a porosity of 35 and an initial creosote saturation of 30 the creosote was used as received from the supplier stella jones inc the sand was 40 60 mesh size silica

thermocouple in each cylinder and recorded every 30 s keithley 2700 data acquisition system with keithley 7709 multiplexer vapour was not extracted from the cylinders under vacuum but was allowed to escape through the vapour outlet tubes which discharged outside of the oven to a controlled exhaust the vapour outlet tubes were heated outside of the oven using heating tape omega htwc101 002 to prevent condensation in those tubes the vapour outlet tube for one cylinder per experiment was connected to a water cooled liebig condenser which discharged to a chilled graduated cylinder for the collection and measurement of condensate fig 2 preliminary experiments using only water and sand were used to verify mass balance and confirm vapour recovery by condensation cylinders were periodically removed from the oven sacrificed for the collection of soil samples with sacrificial samples collected from experiments h 130 h 205 and h 320 once the desired oven temperature had been reached at the position of the inner thermocouple and again 5 days and 10 days later in experiment h 130 v sacrificial samples were collected 5 11 and 24 h after heating had begun because earlier sampling times were required to observe decreases in the voc concentrations prior to their removal 2 2 dissolution experiments four dissolution experiments were conducted to determine the aqueous concentrations of pah compounds resulting from the dissolution of creosote from unheated sand control or from sand heated to 130 c 205 c or 320 c table 2 each of the dissolution experiments were conducted in stainless steel cylinders similar to those used in the heating experiments but were 5 28 cm tall 7 25 cm inner diameter each of the end plates of these cylinders included a perforated stainless steel plate and mesh to support the sand and a conical inside surface to distribute flow across the face of that plate hicknell 2017 the cylinders were packed either in the same manner as for the heating experiments for experiment d 21 or using a sub sample of sand and creosote collected at the end of the heating experiments for experiments d 130 d 205 and d 320 for these post heating experiments dry creosote and sand were packed into the cylinders and water was added as part of the dissolution procedure after packing 3 l 34 37 pore volumes of degassed deionized water was pumped upwards through the cylinders at a flow rate of 0 29 ml min at room temperature 21 c this flow rate was selected to be sufficiently slow to promote dissolution under local equilibrium conditions

represents conditions after istt has been completed and sufficient time has passed for subsurface temperatures to return to pre heating conditions all effluent from the cylinders was collected in 1 l amber bottles for analysis of dissolved pah concentrations 2 3 analysis of water and soil samples during the heating experiments soil samples were collected from sacrificed cylinders within 5 min of removing the cylinders from the oven the top plate gravel and stainless steel mesh were removed and the top 0 5 cm of sand was scraped and discarded a sub sample of creosote impacted sand

measured by the inner and outer thermocouples during experiments h 130 and h 320 are shown in fig 3 these temperature profiles show heating of creosote impacted sand in four stages napl water heating napl water co boiling napl heating and sustained heating using temperatures measured in experiment h 130 as an example fig 3a napl water heating occurred at 0 0 17 days this appears as an upward curved profile in fig 3 because of the logarithmic scale used on the time axis but is in fact an approximately linear increase in temperature over time napl water co boiling then occurred at 0 17 0 7 days which is characterized by a temperature plateau at approximately 100 c because of the low volatility of most of the creosote components this was followed by napl heating at 0 7 1 1 days and sustained heating at 1 1 11 days the same four stages were observed during experiment h 320 fig 3b but the napl water heating and napl water co boiling stages were shorter and occurred earlier due to the higher temperature of the oven in all heating experiments and in all replicate cylinders temperature at the outer thermocouple increased earlier than at the inner thermocouple which is consistent with the outside to inside conductive heating of the cylinders in the oven short term decrease then increase in temperature e g at 0 25 and 5 3 days in experiment h 320 were caused by opening the oven door to retrieve the sacrificial cylinders for soil sampling and are an artefact of the procedure the temperature profiles shown in fig 3 are different than those observed in similar experiments using more volatile napl zhao et al 2014 in those experiments and as expected in field applications of istt for volatile napl heating includes a water heating stage and a water boiling stage that occur after napl water co boiling therefore temperature profiles for volatile napls contain two temperature plateaus i a distinct co boiling plateau for the case of a single component napl or a more slowly increasing co boiling region in the case of a multicomponent napl that occur below the water boiling temperature and ii a distinct water boiling plateau however only one plateau is essentially observed during the heating of creosote impacted sand because the napl water co boiling temperature is close to the water boiling temperature in addition while the removal of volatile napl at the co boiling temperature is limited by the mass of napl the removal of semi volatile napl at the co boiling temperature is limited by the mass of water that is heating of volatile napl moves from the napl water co boiling stage to the water heating stage when the napl is depleted whereas heating of semi volatile napl moves from the napl water co boiling stage to the napl heating stage when water is depleted therefore the removal of semi volatile napl components at the co boiling temperature could be prolonged by the addition of water supplied either by ambient groundwater flow or as part of an istt design additional water i e more than one pore volume is available for co boiling during field applications and could improve performance over what was observed here prolonged co boiling is also facilitated by the injection of steam during see applications 3 2 water gas and creosote saturations during heating saturations of all three fluids water gas and creosote during experiments h 130 and h 320 calculated from initial saturations and measurements of the condensate are also shown in fig 3 as expected decreases in water saturation and increases in gas saturation occurred during the co boiling stage in both experiments creosote removal began at the beginning of the co boiling stage and decreased from 30 to 26 by the end of co boiling this decrease did not continue in the h 130 experiment despite prolonged heating at 130 c but creosote saturations did decrease to 21 in the h 320 experiment to facilitate comparison between experiments as well as to previously conducted experiments using chlorinated solvents fig 4 shows the creosote saturation plotted against the temperature measured by the inner thermocouple the napl saturations are depicted as normalized to the initial napl saturation prior to heating profiles for heating of pce as well as a mixture of pce 1 2 dichloroethane and chlorobenzene in sand zhao et al 2014 show a decrease in napl saturation starting at the co boiling temperature which remained constant for pce and increased steadily for the multicomponent napl this decrease continued until it reached low napl saturations between 1 and 9 in these previous experiments when temperatures increased due to co boiling that was occurring away from the local temperature measurement location zhao et al 2014 the profile for heating creosote impacted sand was different than these previous profiles in three respects first as expected based on results shown in fig 3 there was no removal prior to reaching a co boiling temperature near the water boiling temperature consistent with the co boiling temperature of many creosote components e g pahs above 99 5 c second creosote removal did not occur as a steady decrease but as a predominantly two stage process at nearly 100 c and at 290 to 320 c with little change in saturation from 100 to 290 c this demonstrates that designing an istt application to a target temperature of 100 to 290 c to treat this creosote would result in increased energy cost with little benefit if the reduction of napl saturations was the treatment objective it is important to note that heating occurred much faster in these experiments than in field applications therefore any mass transport limitations on voc recovery as temperatures increased would play a larger role in these experiments than in field applications third creosote saturations were 20 67 of the initial creosote saturation even after prolonged heating at 320 c for 10 days attributed to the creosote components whose combined effective vapour pressures were not sufficient for removal at 320 c observations of staged removal based on the saturation and temperature data were supported by observations of the condensate soon after reaching the co boiling stage the condensate included both water and lighter than water napl lnapl as lighter molecular weight higher volatility components were removed from the cylinders at later time precipitate was observed at the water lnapl interface in the condensate identified as naphthalene in subsequent analyses at later times denser than water napl dnapl was also observed in the condensate and lnapl changed colour from yellow brown to brown black as heavier molecular weight lower volatility components were removed from the cylinders this multiphase recovery is important in the design of above ground treatment systems for istt applications but it is also an important consideration for the design of subsurface heating systems failure to provide adequate heating to sustain connected gas pathways between napl in target heating zones and gas extraction points can lead to napl condensation munholland et al 2016 and in the case of creosote and other pah containing napls to the formation of condensate napl or solid precipitates whose composition and risk differs substantially from the originally targeted napl 3 3 btex and pah concentrations in soil during heating btex concentrations in soil during the h 130 v experiment are shown in fig 5 toluene ethylbenzene p m xylene and o xylene concentrations were reduced to below their detection limits 0 8 0 4 2 and 0 8 mg kg respectively prior to the completion of napl water co boiling after 0 5 days compared to the end of co boiling at 0 7 days benzene concentrations were reduced to below their detection limit 0 2 mg kg in the sample collected at 1 day these results demonstrate the utility of istt even using moderate heating to the water boiling temperature to substantially reduce the concentrations of volatile components in napls such as creosote hansen et al 1998 hayes and srivastava 2005 baker et al 2006 pah concentrations in soil during the h 320 experiment are shown in fig 6 substantial decreases were observed for all compounds analyzed which occurred throughout all stages of heating concentrations in soil at the end of heating varied between compounds table 3 with greater removal of lower molecular weight higher volatility pahs compared to higher molecular weight lower volatility pahs for example final concentrations of acenaphthylene acenaphthene and fluorene ranged from 11 to 24 5 to 8 and 0 5 to 1 of their initial concentrations at the end of the h 130 h 205 and h 320 experiments respectively compared to the final concentrations of benzo bkj fluoranthene benzo a pyrene and dibenzo ah anthracene that ranged from 40 to 46 34 to 36 and 18 to 33 of their initial concentrations table 3 the pah soil concentrations were reduced by a factor of 2 180 depending on the compound and the heating temperature this is substantially greater than the reductions in creosote saturation which were reduced by a factor of 1 1 in the h 130 experiment and a factor of 1 4 in the h 320 experiment based on the condensate recovery fig 3 this demonstrates that for istt applications in which the treatment objectives are focused on reductions of individual soil concentrations overall removal of creosote mass will under predict treatment performance however it is important to note that even substantial reductions in individual soil concentrations may not be sufficient to meet regulatory standards 3 4 pah concentrations in water during dissolution sub samples of creosote impacted sand following completion of the h 130 h 205 and h 320 experiments were used in the dissolution experiments in all cases the heated sand could be emptied and re packed into new cylinders for dissolution this is in contrast to the solidification that has been reported previously following the heating of coal tar impacted soil to a maximum temperature of 120 c hayes and srivastava 2005 only sand from h 320 showed a change in texture with greater cohesion than the unheated creosote impacted sand but it was unclear whether this was due to the formation of solids or an increase in viscosity of the napl hicknell 2017 differences between previously reported results and those of this study may be due to the composition of the soil as well as the composition of creosote compared to coal tar and highlight that solidification should not necessarily be the expected outcome of heating semi volatile multicomponent napls pah concentrations in water following dissolution in the d 130 d 205 and d 320 experiments are shown in table 4 and fig 7 each of the concentrations are shown as normalized to the concentrations measured in the unheated control experiment d 21 and are listed in order of decreasing volatility increasing boiling temperature therefore a value of c c0 1 represents a concentration that is unchanged from the initial unheated condition the aqueous concentrations of 12 of the 15 pahs analyzed in the dissolution experiments decreased or were not significantly different relative to the unheated control experiment after heating to 130 c 205 c or 320 c note that aqueous concentrations of dibenzo ah anthracene indeno 123 cd pyrene and benzo ghi perylene were below their detection limits in the unheated control and in each of the dissolution experiments table 4 however three compounds phenanthrene fluoranthene and pyrene showed significant increases in dissolved concentration based on a confidence interval of one standard deviation after heating to 205 c and 320 c these are intermediate volatility pahs with for example vapour pressures at 200 c of 3 10 2 atm 9 10 3 atm and 6 10 3 atm for phenanthrene fluoranthene and pyrene respectively fig 1 for comparison naphthalene and acenaphthylene have vapour pressures at 200 c of 6 10 1 atm and 2 10 1 atm respectively and benzo a anthracene and benzo a pyrene have vapour pressures at 200 c of 1 10 3 atm and 3 10 4 atm respectively the increase in the dissolved concentrations of these intermediate volatility pahs is attributed to an increase in their mole fraction in the creosote as more volatile components are removed earlier and at lower temperatures this increased mole fraction leads to an increase in effective solubility eq 2 and an increase in the aqueous concentration under the local equilibrium dissolution conditions used in these experiments 4 summary and conclusions a series of heating and dissolution experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of heating on napl removal soil concentrations and aqueous concentrations in creosote impacted sand results demonstrated that temperature profiles during heating of creosote are different than those associated with heating more volatile napls with a co boiling plateau close 99 5 c to the boiling point of water with a duration that is limited by the mass of water available this is expected to be the case for any multicomponent napl that consists primarily of svocs including creosote and coal tar in these experiments decreases in creosote saturation were not substantial and decreased from 30 to 26 and 30 to 21 of the pore space for heating to 130 c and 320 c respectively this napl removal occurred in stages predominantly at approximately 100 c and at 290 320 c decreases in soil concentrations were greater than decreases in napl saturation with btex concentrations decreased to below detection limits before the complete removal of water and pah concentrations reduced by a factor of 2 180 as expected decreases in soil concentrations were greater for higher volatility compounds and higher heating temperatures following heating the aqueous concentrations resulting from the dissolution of the remaining creosote also decreased for 12 of the 15 compounds investigated however aqueous concentrations of phenanthrene fluoranthene and pyrene increased compared to the unheated control after heating to 205 c or 320 c overall these results demonstrate the potential utility of bench scale treatability tests including both heating and dissolution to help establish treatment goals and expectations they also show that complete creosote removal in istt applications is unlikely but that substantial reductions in soil concentrations and changes in napl composition can be achieved soil concentrations and aqueous concentrations after treatment should both be evaluated depending on treatment objectives at any particular site further research is required to investigate the potential to increase napl removal by prolonging the co boiling stage through water addition as well as to assess the added benefits of liquid napl and water recovery using multiphase extraction wells and higher treatment temperatures on napl removal acknowledgements funding for this research was provided
