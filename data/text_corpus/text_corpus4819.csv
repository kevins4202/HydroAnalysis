24095,by changing the calculation of the pressure gradient we convert a 3 5 layer model to a 3 layer model that includes entrainment and detrainment as well as interfacial friction between layers in comparison with the reanalysis and satellite altimetry data the model can well reproduce the circulation and reveal the primary dynamics in the south china sea we then use the 3 layer model to investigate the vertical coupling of the south china sea circulation in the upper and middle layers it is found that the horizontal pressure gradient which reflects the depth integrated effect of the thickness variation across all layers plays a key role in the dynamical link between layers perturbations induced by changing the monsoonal wind or the kuroshio in two comparative experiments are able to excite cyclonically propagating slope trapped waves and the westward planetary rossby waves to modulate the basin wide circulation in all layers indicating the dynamically similar adjustments throughout the water column in the scs in both experiments even though the interface frictional dissipation and the entrainment detrainment induced momentum exchange are small analysis suggests that the exchange velocity between layers which varies as the waves pass by contributes considerably to the redistribution of the layer thickness hence the pressure gradient field in each layer to regulate the variability of the scs circulation keywords layered model south china sea circulation vertical coupling entrainment detrainment 1 introduction as the largest marginal sea in the western pacific ocean the south china sea scs has a deep semi enclosed basin surrounded by a steep slope and links to the adjacent seas via several straits fig 1 dominated by the east asian monsoon and the kuroshio intrusion xue et al 2004 gan et al 2006 chen and xue 2014 quan et al 2016 the scs not only shows some dynamical similarities with the open oceans e g the westward intensification of the circulation but also has the unique and complicated dynamics as a regional sea gan et al 2016 currently more and more studies suggest that there is a sandwich like circulation in the scs which is cyclonic in the upper and deep layers but anticyclonic in the middle layer wang et al 2011 shu et al 2014 lan et al 2015 gan et al 2016 closely related to the scs throughflow the scs circulation not only plays a key role in the mass energy and heat balances in the interior scs but also contributes to the fluxes between the pacific ocean and the indian ocean which has a significant effect on the regional climate qu et al 2006a 2009 gordon et al 2012 wei et al 2016 different from the circulation in the open oceans the scs circulation shows a prominent seasonality in the pattern and intensity especially for that in the upper 200 m which was firstly revealed by dale 1956 and wyrtki 1961 to date there have been many insightful and review studies on the circulation in the upper layer of the scs revealing its spatial structures temporary variations and the corresponding dynamical mechanisms e g xu et al 1982 fang et al 1998 hu et al 2000 su et al 2004 the general features of the middle and deep layers have been examined by the numerical models and the diagnoses based on the hydrological data wang et al 2011 shu et al 2014 lan et al 2015 gan et al 2016 however more investigations are still needed to form a comprehensive understanding of the three dimensional scs circulation the previous researches tried to explore the role of the vertical motion in linking the wind driven circulation to the thermohaline circulation and it was found that the mean upwelling rate below the main thermocline in the open ocean is so weak that it cannot become a material contributor to the vertical coupling of the two circulations e g luyten and stommel 1986 hautala and riser 1989 huang 1993 however in the scs where the mixing is very strong over the rough topography the mean upwelling rate is found to be on the order of 10 6 m s 1 qu et al 2006b zhu et al 2016 which is comparable to the magnitude of the ekman pumping therefore the vortex squashing due to the upwelling from the abyssal scs may induce an anticyclonic circulation component to significantly affect the wind driven circulation in the upper layer wang et al 2012 moreover shu et al 2014 used the hycom global reanalysis data glba0 08 to show that there are three layers of the meridional overturning cells in the scs which appear to link the sandwich like horizontal circulations in the vertical unfortunately due to the exiguous observations the detailed process of how the vertical motion could modulate the horizontal circulation is still not well understood answering this question will help us advance the dynamical understanding of the scs circulation and even provide a reference to the dynamics of the multi layer circulation in other marginal seas and open oceans different from the three dimensional models with a simplified framework the layered models can elucidate the concerned dynamics of the oceans by excluding the impacts from other processes therefore they become very useful tools to study the dynamical mechanism of the scs circulation wang et al 2006 cai et al 2007 yaremchuk et al 2009 yang et al 2015 unfortunately most of the existing layered models for the scs came short in meeting our goals in this study for example the models with all layers active were usually exclusive of the vertical exchange process that occurs in the slope region of the scs e g cai et al 2007 yang et al 2015 on the other hand the models with an infinitely deep layer did not adapt to the variable topography e g yu et al 2007 yaremchuk et al 2009 to overcome the defects of the two types of models we modified a 3 5 layer model mccreary and kundu 1988 1989 mccreay et al 1993 into a 3 layer one by maintaining its original vertical exchange module but changing the calculation of the pressure gradient to allow the inclusion of the continental slope as well as the shelf circulation in the scs moreover we also introduced the interface friction into the model to enhance the interactions between layers the 3 layer model results suggest that the pressure gradient pg is the key factor that transmits the influence from the monsoonal wind and the kuroshio through the water column it is also found in two comparative experiments that the perturbations induced by altering the monsoonal wind or the kuroshio propagate as the cyclonically moving slope trapped waves and the westward planetary rossby waves to modulate the basin wide circulation moreover the exchange velocity between layers hereafter ev which varies as the waves pass by and leads to the redistribution of the thickness in each layer can affect the pg field to facilitate the vertical coupling 2 ocean model in this study a 3 layer ocean model including entrainment and detrainment as well as the interface friction between layers is modified from the 3 5 layer one by mccreary and kundu 1988 1989 and mccreary et al 1993 to explore the vertical coupling of the scs circulation 2 1 model equations the model consists of three active isopycnal layers and the thermodynamic process was excluded for simplification the equations of motion are as follows 1 h 1 v 1 t v 1 h 1 v 1 f k h 1 v 1 h 1 p 1 τ w i n d τ 12 υ 2 h 1 v 1 v 2 w 12 θ

richardson number criterion ri 0 75 if the instantaneous thickness h i n is larger than he detrainment occurs and vice versa thus w 12 can be obtained by 19 w 12 w e w s 1 and w 23 is represented as 20 w 23 w s 2 2 3 model set up the computational domain fig 1 is similar to that in yu et al 2007 and the original water depth is from etopo1 amante and eakins 2009 in reference to the 3 layer scs circulations here we divided the upper layer of the sandwich like circulation 0 750 m in gan et al 2016 into two layers in our model due to the difference in forcing the wind driven 1st layer with the maximum initial thickness of 200 m above the thermocline depth chu et al 1999 cai et al 2007 yang et al 2015 and the 2nd layer driven by rising and falling of the thermocline i e the interface between the 1st and 2nd layers with the maximum initial thickness of 500 m the middle layer 750 1500 m of the sandwich like structure is represented by the 3rd layer in our model which has the maximum initial thickness of 800 m details of the initial layering are listed in table 1 hereafter we use the 1st 2nd and 3rd to refer to the model layers whereas the upper and middle to refer to the top two layers of the scs sandwich like structure since the thermodynamic process is not considered in our model the deep 1500 m circulation which is closely associated with the density difference across the luzon strait qu et al 2006b lan et al 2013 is excluded in this study the open boundaries north of the taiwan island and east of the luzon island are set to allow for the lateral forcing from the kuroshio another two open boundaries are set in the karimata strait and the mindoro strait respectively at the solid wall a free slip boundary condition is used and the velocity normal to the boundary is set as zero the resolution of the model is 0 1 0 1 and the time step is 20 s 2 4 forcing the climatological monthly wind from the cross calibrated multi platform ccmp atlas et al 2011 is adopted in our model which has a horizontal resolution of 0 25 0 25 and is interpolated onto the model grid the climatological monthly transports through the open boundaries a c and d the red solid lines in fig 1 are extracted from yu et al 2007 which are based on the data assimilative model results of yaremchuk and qu 2004 the transport at b is geostrophically adjusted by the model itself hurlburt and thompson 1980 transports imposed at the open boundaries are full depth values so they need to be allocated into each layer in reference to the observations and previous model results e g gilson and roemmich 2002 cai et al 2007 the vertical partition of the kuroshio transport at a is set as 2 3 2 9 and 1 9 for the 1st 2nd and 3rd layer respectively for c and d the transports are only imposed in the 1st layer due to the shallow water depth the model is spun up from a static state and runs for 20 years the outputs based on a 3 day sampling from the 11th to 20th model years are used for analysis 3 results in this section we took the model results based on the configuration in section 2 as the control run in addition we conducted two comparative experiments to explore the vertical coupling of the scs circulation note that in this study the winter summer is defined as the 3 month mean from december january and february of the following year june july and august 3 1 layered scs circulation and dynamics in comparison with the results averaged from 1992 to 2011 from the global simple ocean data assimilation soda carton et al 2000a b our model can well reproduce the circulations both in the basin and on the shelf of the scs figs 2 and 3 in winter the cyclonic circulation occupies the entire scs basin in the 1st layer with a mighty western boundary current wbc extending southward along the whole western slope over the shelf in the north and the southwest the water is driven southwestward by the winter monsoon note that the modeled currents fig 2a are generally stronger than the reanalysis results fig 2d probably due to the different wind forcing used in the models in the 2nd layer the wintertime circulation consists of a strong cyclonic gyre in the north and a weak anticyclonic gyre in the south fig 2b e in the 3rd layer there is an anticyclonic circulation in the basin with a wbc flowing northeastward along the western and northern slopes fig 2c f in summer the circulation is significantly weakened in each layer in the 1st layer there is a dipole for the circulation in the scs basin a cyclonic gyre in the north and an anticyclonic gyre in the south which are separated from each other by an offshore current at about 10 n driven by the southwesterly monsoon the water over the southwestern and northern shelves flows northeastward fig 3a d in the 2nd layer the basin is basically dominated by a weak cyclonic circulation fig 3b e the summertime circulation in the 3rd layer is similar to that in winter but much weaker fig 3c f it should be noted that the modeled flow fields are smoother than the results from soda due to the simplification of physical processes in our model the distribution of the thickness in each layer is consistent with the circulation in winter the water is transported onshore and piled up on the slope due to the cyclonic circulation consequently the layer thickness increases from the basin to the slope with the minimum value about 130 m in the west of the luzon island and the maximum value about 250 m in the northwestern slope fig 4 a in addition a convergence center also exists west of the luzon strait with the anticyclonic current loop intruding into the scs note the thickness is smaller on the shelf because of the decreasing water depth there in summer corresponding to the dipole circulation the mass of the 1st layer diverges in the northern basin with the minimum thickness about 160 m off the east of vietnam but converges in the southern basin fig 4b the convergence center associated with the kuroshio intrusion is weakened and shifted eastward to ensure the mass conservation the thicknesses of the 2nd and 3rd layers show an opposite distribution to that in the 1st layer fig 4c to f using the modeled layer thicknesses we calculated the sea surface height ssh according to eq 7 and compared it with the absolute dynamical topography averaged from 1993 to 2011 from the french archiving validation and interpretation of satellite oceanographic data project aviso ducet et al 2000 in general the seasonal patterns of the modeled ssh are consistent with the satellite observations fig 5 in winter there is a low ssh center west of the luzon island and the high ssh concentrates along the slope fig 5a c in summer there is also a dipole structure for the ssh corresponding to the upper layer circulation but the modeled pattern fig 5b is not as prominent as the satellite observation fig 5d according to the entrainment detrainment scheme in our model w 12 is determined by wind stirring and shear instability while w 23 is only driven by shear instability in winter between the 1st and the 2nd layers the entrainment to the 1st layer mainly occurs in the northern basin with the maximum of about 0 8 10 5 ms 1 in the area west of the luzon island while the detrainment occurs along the slope with the maximum of about 0 7 10 5 ms 1 in the northwest fig 6 a in addition the detrainment also occurs to the west of the luzon strait where the kuroshio intrudes into the scs as an anticyclonic current loop to balance the total mass the detrainment occurs at the entire interface between the 2nd and 3rd layers with the maximum of about 0 3 10 5 ms 1 west of the luzon island fig 6c in summer between the 1st and 2nd layers the entrainment mainly occurs east of vietnam with the maximum of about 0 3 10 5 ms 1 while the detrainment associated with the kuroshio intrusion occurs west of the luzon strait but becomes weaker than in winter fig 6b for the interface between the 2nd and 3rd layers the detrainment occurs in the whole domain with the maximum of about 0 2 10 5 ms 1 east of vietnam fig 6d to diagnose the dynamical balance in each layer the terms in eqs 1 3 were calculated for a better accuracy their values were directly output from the model instead of using the velocities based on a 3 day sampling by calculating the curl of these terms and then integrating them along the upper interface of the layer as taking the acc for example 21 ω a c c s a c c y x a c c x y d s we can acquire the domain and layer integrated vorticity equation in a unified format for all layers as the following 22 ω a c c ω a d v ω c o r ω p g ω u ω l ω h d ω e d i m e 0 where ω u is either the ws curl for the 1st layer or if curl at the upper interface for the 2nd and 3rd layers and ω l is the sum of if curl and bf curl at the lower interface of the layer note that the integral domain is only the scs basin where the water depth is more than 200 m the balance of the vorticity equation for each layer is shown in fig 7 in which positive negative values correspond to counter clockwise clockwise components for easier comparison with the result based on the three dimensional model by gan et al 2016 we added the 1st and 2nd layers together as the upper layer of the scs in winter fig 7a ω pg and ω cor are the largest terms in the upper layer and ω pg is balanced by the sum of ω cor and ω u i e ws curl ω adv ω hd and ω l are one order smaller in magnitude than the above in the middle layer the leading terms in the balance are ω pg ω cor and ω hd note in gan et al 2016 ω l is also a significant sink for the wintertime vorticity balance in the upper layer of the scs while ω hd is relatively small in the balance for the middle layer in summer fig 7b the upper layer terms have smaller magnitude than their counterparts in winter and their relative contributions to the vorticity balance also change ω cor becomes comparable to ω u and both together balance ω pg in addition ω adv plays a minor role in the balance in the middle layer the balance is similar to that in winter in gan et al 2016 ω adv is more significant than ω u in the vorticity balance in the upper layer however the primary balance in the middle layer remains the same as that in winter consistent with our finding in general the modeled scs circulations are dynamically similar to those in gan et al 2016 the differences likely result from the idealized framework in our model such as the exclusion of the thermodynamics and the simplification of the energy dissipation additionally different model forcing is also an important reason to induce the discrepancies according to the model equations in section 2 there are three terms acting as the dynamical link between layers namely pg edime and if pg reflects the depth integrated effect of the thickness variation across all layers edime represents the vertical momentum exchange induced by entrainment detrainment and if results from the velocity shear between layers however the vorticity balance shows that only the ω pg is dominant whereas the curls of edime and if are both negligibly small this suggests that pg plays a key role in linking the scs circulation between layers fig 8 shows the distribution of pg in each layer in winter pg in the 1st layer is very large along the entire northern and western slope while the large values in the 2nd and 3rd layers mainly occur in the northern basin turning to summer both the wind and the kuroshio intrusion change which can lead to the redistribution of the layer thickness shown in fig 4 according to eqs 4 9 the variation of thickness can change pg throughout the water column the summertime pg in the 1st and 2nd layers is similar to that in winter in the northern scs but tends to change sign in the south while that in the 3rd layer does not change in pattern but becomes weaker as a result the circulation in each layer is switched from that in fig 2 to that in fig 3 it should be noted that the above physical explanations actually do not depend on the temporal variability to keep the context consistent we still present the results of both wintertime and summertime to make the content more complete and easier to understand although edime is insignificant in the dynamical balance as shown in fig 7 ev can contribute to the change of the layer thickness to modulate the pg and then affect the circulation according to the continuity equation we calculated the variation of the layer thickness on each time step for each grid as follows 23 δ h i t t δ t w i i 1 w i 1 i d t t t δ t h i v i d t where the first term on the right hand side δhe represents the change induced by the entrainment detrainment mixing effect and the second term represents the change related to horizontal transport advective effect winter integrated δhe is positive negative in the northern basin along the slope due to entrainment detrainment for the 1st layer fig 9 a while that for the 2nd layer is opposite in space fig 9c because w 12 is greater than w 23 see fig 6a c the basin wide detrainment from the 2nd layer to the 3rd layer see fig 6c results in the positive δhe in the whole 3rd layer fig 9e the situation is similar in summer but the areas with significant values are located to the east of vietnam and west of the luzon strait fig 9b d and f by averaging the results in the whole basin over 10 years it is found that the change induced by the entrainment detrainment is 18 2 20 7 and 17 7 of the total change for the 1st 2nd and 3rd layer respectively wang et al 2012 and gan et al 2016 pointed out that the vortex stretching associated with the variation of the layer thickness is significant in the vorticity balance of the scs circulation but they did not show explicitly the relative contribution from entrainment detrainment to the variation of the layer thickness our results suggest that the material exchange between vertical layers likely plays a more active role than what has been perceived in regulating the variability of the scs circulation and perhaps the relevant climatic and ecological issues in the scs e g xie et al 2003 ning et al 2004 3 2 impact of the monsoonal wind on the scs circulation via the vertical coupling quan et al 2016 pointed out that the monsoonal wind over the scs is significantly weakened during el niño event which results in an attenuated upper layer circulation including wbc however whether and how the impact could be transmitted downward to affect the circulation in the lower layers are still not clear to answer this question we dramatically reduced the monsoonal wind used in the control run by 80 to conduct a comparative experiment exp 1 as a result the wintertime scs circulation in the 1st layer is significantly weakened and the current on the northern shelf even reverses to flow northeastward fig 10 a in the 2nd layer the weak anticyclonic gyre in the control run fig 2b disappears in exp 1 and the cyclonic gyre tends to occupy the entire basin fig 10b the anticyclonic circulation in the 3rd layer does not change in pattern but weakens fig 10c in summer the dipole circulation in the 1st layer is attenuated especially for the cyclonic gyre in the north fig 10d in the 2nd layer the cyclonic gyre still occupies the entire basin but weakens fig 10e similar to the winter case the summertime anticyclonic circulation in the 3rd layer also weakens but dose not change in pattern fig 10f as the return flow to balance the meridional flux of the interior basin the scswbc can be taken as an index for the intensity of the basin scale circulation to quantify the change of the scs circulation in the comparative experiments we calculated the scswbc transport through the 13 5 n transect east of vietnam blue solid line in fig 1 in exp 1 the seasonality of the scswbc transport is significantly attenuated in comparison with the control run with a relative change of 70 7 65 3 173 8 47 3 and 48 2 20 6 in magnitude for the 1st 2nd and 3rd layer in winter summer respectively red lines in fig 11 it indicates that the perturbation from the abnormal atmospheric forcing can be transmitted downward to affect the scs circulation in each layer via the dynamical coupling in the vertical the dynamical balance in exp 1 is similar to the control run not shown but the dominant term of pg is significantly reduced in each layer fig 12 in the 1st layer the wintertime pg in the wbc region along the northern and western slope is largely weakened as well as that in the eastern and southern basin both in the 2nd and 3rd layers changes of the wintertime pg occur mainly in the northern basin similar changes also occur in summer except for the differences in space and intensity consequently the change of pg across all layers can transmit the effect of the abnormal atmospheric forcing from the upper to the middle layer of the scs in exp 1 two kinds of processes lead to the full depth change of pg by redistributing the layer thickness on the one hand the weakened ws reduces the ekman transport so that the layer thickness is redistributed due to the advective effect in eq 23 the gradient of surface elevation is thus reduced due to the weakened convergence divergence of mass field on the other hand in comparison with the control run the perturbation is able to change the ev at the interface according to eqs 13 18 the weakened wind stirring reduces we and the altered circulations affect the shear instability to change wsi as a result between the 1st and 2nd layers both the entrainment in the basin and the detrainment along the slope are weakened in winter fig 13 a in summer the entrainment east of vietnam is weakened fig 13b however in winter the detrainment between the 2nd and 3rd layers is weakened in the basin but strengthened along the slope fig 13c while it gets weakened east of vietnam in summer fig 13d the changed ev can further redistribute the layer thickness due to the mixing effect in eq 23 and the corresponding contribution to the total change is 26 8 15 3 and 20 4 for the 1st to 3rd layer respectively due to these two processes the thickness in the whole basin is significantly redistributed not shown according to the depth integrated effect in eqs 4 9 the basin scale redistribution of the layer thickness alters the pg field in each layer consequently the entire scs circulation including the wbc which is vertically coupled is significantly weakened 3 3 impact of the kuroshio intrusion on the scs circulation via the vertical coupling the exp 1 illustrates how the perturbation from the abnormal atmospheric forcing is transmitted from the 1st layer downward to the 2nd and the 3rd layers via the vertical coupling to affect the scs circulation to explore how the perturbation from deep is transmitted upward we shut down the kuroshio including the inflow and outflow at the open boundaries in the 3rd layer to conduct another comparative experiment exp 2 note that the perturbation in exp 2 is much weaker than that in exp 1 as a result in exp 2 the basin circulation in each layer is very similar to the control run but slightly weakened in strength fig 14 using the control run as a reference in exp 2 there is a relative change of 4 5 6 2 6 7 18 4 and 18 2 22 5 for the wintertime summertime scswbc transport in the 1st 2nd and 3rd layer respectively blue lines in fig 11 it indicates that the impact from the abnormal oceanic forcing in the anticyclonic layer of the scs can also be transmitted into the upper cyclonic layer via the vertical coupling and affect the circulation in each layer in exp 2 the most significant change in dynamics is still related to pg which is dominant in the dynamical balance not shown the change of pg in exp 2 is very similar to that in exp 1 but much weaker fig 15 the most significant difference compare fig 12j with 15j occurs in the meridional pg during summer when the influence of perturbation from the luzon strait in the 3rd layer can be clearly seen in the 1st layer which directly reflects the depth integrated effect across all layers as a result the change of pg throughout the water column can transmit the perturbation from the middle to the upper layer of the scs after shutting down the kuroshio at the open boundaries of the 3rd layer the outflow in the luzon strait is reduced by 30 9 36 5 in winter summer which alters the thickness of the layer due to the advective effect in eq 23 moreover the perturbation can also change the ev at the interface especially for the slope region since the wind is unchanged in exp 2 the changed ev mainly results from the shear instability which is affected by the altered circulations between the 1st and 2nd layers both the entrainment in the basin and the detrainment along the slope are weakened in winter fig 16 a whereas the entrainment is intensified in the area east of vietnam but weakened along the slope in summer fig 16b for the interface between the 2nd and 3rd layers the detrainment is weakened in the whole domain fig 16c d unlike the exp 1 the change is largest in the 3rd layer and decreases upward in exp 2 as the perturbation is introduced in the 3rd layer as a result the adjusted entrainment and detrainment can further redistribute the layer thickness due to the mixing effect in eq 23 and the corresponding contribution to the total change is 16 2 22 1 and 27 5 for the 1st to 3rd layer respectively although the redistribution of the layer thickness is less significant in exp 2 than in exp 1 not shown through the depth integral effect of the pg in eqs 4 9 the impact can still be transmitted upward and induces changes in the 1st and the 2nd layers especially for the slope region which links the variation of the scs circulation between layers 4 discussion in both experiments the perturbations can excite two kinds of waves to transmit the signal around the whole scs to modulate the velocity and mass field in each layer one is the slope trapped wave propagating cyclonically along the continental slope and the other is the westward planetary rossby wave across the basin similarly these two types of waves are found in the hycom global reanalysis data glba008 and they can trigger each other separately at the western and eastern boundaries of the scs basin shu et al 2014 the slope trapped wave can be seen from the phase diagram of the difference of ev between the 2nd and 3rd layers between the comparative experiments and the control run along the 1000 m isobath fig 17 a c with a larger amplitude in the northern slope the signal propagates cyclonically along the slope with the speed of about 32 2 cm s 1 which is similar to the fast moving wave at about 26 cm s 1 reported by shu et al 2014 however the slowly moving one at about 7 6 cm s 1 on the northern slope is not found in our model the probable reason is that the idealized model is limited in reproducing the complete dynamical processes in this region the westward planetary rossby wave is demonstrated by the phase diagram of the difference of ev between the 2nd and 3rd layers between the comparative experiments and the control run along the transect in the central basin fig 17b d see fig 1 for the transect location the signal propagates westward at a mean speed of about 6 9 cm s 1 which is close to the speed of about 5 5 cm s 1 in shu et al 2014 it means that the wave will take about 3 months to propagate from the east to the west of the basin these waves can also be found on the interface between the 1st and 2nd layers not shown despite the difference in intensity the analogous waves in both comparative experiments suggest dynamically similar adjustments throughout the water column in the scs in response to perturbations from the wind and the kuroshio intrusion according to xu and oey 2015 the westward planetary rossby waves can modulate the heaving and depression of isopycnals i e surface interface in our model considering eqs 4 9 this process is able to have a direct effect on pg to affect the flow field in each layer not shown moreover shu et al 2014 pointed out that the upward downward motions in the deep scs could be resulted from the interplay between the cyclonically moving slope trapped waves and westward planetary rossby waves in fig 17 it is also found that ev varies as the waves pass by which can further redistribute the layer thickness to affect pg field to facilitate the vertical coupling of the scs circulation as demonstrated in section 3 5 summary by changing the calculation of the pressure gradient we modified a 3 5 layer model to a 3 layer one which includes the interface exchange as well as the interface friction between layers in comparison with the reanalysis and satellite altimetry data the model is able to well reproduce the circulation and reveal the primary dynamics in the scs using the model we then explored the vertical coupling of the scs circulation in the upper and middle layers by changing the wind and the kuroshio two comparative experiments are conducted to show how the different perturbations can be transmitted through the water column in exp 1 the reduced ws weakens the ekman transport to redistribute the thickness of each layer meanwhile the perturbation is also able to change the ev between layers which can further redistribute the layer thickness the adjusted thickness of each layer reduces the horizontal gradient of the surface interface elevation and results in a reduced pg field as a result the entire scs circulation including the wbc is coupled in the vertical and significantly weakened in exp 2 after shutting down the kuroshio in the 3rd layer the changed outflow in the luzon strait alters the 3rd layer thickness the perturbation can also change the ev at the interface which further redistributes the thickness of all layers to affect the pg field thus the variation of the scs circulation is linked in the vertical in both experiments the perturbations are found to propagate as the cyclonically moving slope trapped waves and the westward planetary rossby waves to modulate the basin wide circulation suggesting dynamically similar responses throughout the water column in the scs from both cases although the if and the edime are insignificant as the dynamical link between layers analysis indicates that ev which varies as the waves pass by can induce a considerable variation about 20 on average of the layer thickness to affect pg field hence plays an important role in regulating the variability of the scs circulation our aim in this study is to illuminate a probable way by which a multi layer dynamical system can interact with each other in the vertical this may be extended to other marginal seas or some special areas in the open oceans e g ferron et al 1998 ledwell et al 2000 marshall and speer 2012 where the vertical exchange process is as strong as that in the scs it should be noted that the estimation of the entrainment detrainment in our model is simplified as some relevant processes e g tidal mixing wang et al 2016 are not considered in the study moreover the deep layer of the sandwich like scs circulation is excluded in our model so its connection to the upper and middle layers is still unknown observations and a more comprehensive numerical model e g further development of the layered model to include the bottom cyclonic layer and thermodynamic forcing are needed in our future work to

24095,by changing the calculation of the pressure gradient we convert a 3 5 layer model to a 3 layer model that includes entrainment and detrainment as well as interfacial friction between layers in comparison with the reanalysis and satellite altimetry data the model can well reproduce the circulation and reveal the primary dynamics in the south china sea we then use the 3 layer model to investigate the vertical coupling of the south china sea circulation in the upper and middle layers it is found that the horizontal pressure gradient which reflects the depth integrated effect of the thickness variation across all layers plays a key role in the dynamical link between layers perturbations induced by changing the monsoonal wind or the kuroshio in two comparative experiments are able to excite cyclonically propagating slope trapped waves and the westward planetary rossby waves to modulate the basin wide circulation in all layers indicating the dynamically similar adjustments throughout the water column in the scs in both experiments even though the interface frictional dissipation and the entrainment detrainment induced momentum exchange are small analysis suggests that the exchange velocity between layers which varies as the waves pass by contributes considerably to the redistribution of the layer thickness hence the pressure gradient field in each layer to regulate the variability of the scs circulation keywords layered model south china sea circulation vertical coupling entrainment detrainment 1 introduction as the largest marginal sea in the western pacific ocean the south china sea scs has a deep semi enclosed basin surrounded by a steep slope and links to the adjacent seas via several straits fig 1 dominated by the east asian monsoon and the kuroshio intrusion xue et al 2004 gan et al 2006 chen and xue 2014 quan et al 2016 the scs not only shows some dynamical similarities with the open oceans e g the westward intensification of the circulation but also has the unique and complicated dynamics as a regional sea gan et al 2016 currently more and more studies suggest that there is a sandwich like circulation in the scs which is cyclonic in the upper and deep layers but anticyclonic in the middle layer wang et al 2011 shu et al 2014 lan et al 2015 gan et al 2016 closely related to the scs throughflow the scs circulation not only plays a key role in the mass energy and heat balances in the interior scs but also contributes to the fluxes between the pacific ocean and the indian ocean which has a significant effect on the regional climate qu et al 2006a 2009 gordon et al 2012 wei et al 2016 different from the circulation in the open oceans the scs circulation shows a prominent seasonality in the pattern and intensity especially for that in the upper 200 m which was firstly revealed by dale 1956 and wyrtki 1961 to date there have been many insightful and review studies on the circulation in the upper layer of the scs revealing its spatial structures temporary variations and the corresponding dynamical mechanisms e g xu et al 1982 fang et al 1998 hu et al 2000 su et al 2004 the general features of the middle and deep layers have been examined by the numerical models and the diagnoses based on the hydrological data wang et al 2011 shu et al 2014 lan et al 2015 gan et al 2016 however more investigations are still needed to form a comprehensive understanding of the three dimensional scs circulation the previous researches tried to explore the role of the vertical motion in linking the wind driven circulation to the thermohaline circulation and it was found that the mean upwelling rate below the main thermocline in the open ocean is so weak that it cannot become a material contributor to the vertical coupling of the two circulations e g luyten and stommel 1986 hautala and riser 1989 huang 1993 however in the scs where the mixing is very strong over the rough topography the mean upwelling rate is found to be on the order of 10 6 m s 1 qu et al 2006b zhu et al 2016 which is comparable to the magnitude of the ekman pumping therefore the vortex squashing due to the upwelling from the abyssal scs may induce an anticyclonic circulation component to significantly affect the wind driven circulation in the upper layer wang et al 2012 moreover shu et al 2014 used the hycom global reanalysis data glba0 08 to show that there are three layers of the meridional overturning cells in the scs which appear to link the sandwich like horizontal circulations in the vertical unfortunately due to the exiguous observations the detailed process of how the vertical motion could modulate the horizontal circulation is still not well understood answering this question will help us advance the dynamical understanding of the scs circulation and even provide a reference to the dynamics of the multi layer circulation in other marginal seas and open oceans different from the three dimensional models with a simplified framework the layered models can elucidate the concerned dynamics of the oceans by excluding the impacts from other processes therefore they become very useful tools to study the dynamical mechanism of the scs circulation wang et al 2006 cai et al 2007 yaremchuk et al 2009 yang et al 2015 unfortunately most of the existing layered models for the scs came short in meeting our goals in this study for example the models with all layers active were usually exclusive of the vertical exchange process that occurs in the slope region of the scs e g cai et al 2007 yang et al 2015 on the other hand the models with an infinitely deep layer did not adapt to the variable topography e g yu et al 2007 yaremchuk et al 2009 to overcome the defects of the two types of models we modified a 3 5 layer model mccreary and kundu 1988 1989 mccreay et al 1993 into a 3 layer one by maintaining its original vertical exchange module but changing the calculation of the pressure gradient to allow the inclusion of the continental slope as well as the shelf circulation in the scs moreover we also introduced the interface friction into the model to enhance the interactions between layers the 3 layer model results suggest that the pressure gradient pg is the key factor that transmits the influence from the monsoonal wind and the kuroshio through the water column it is also found in two comparative experiments that the perturbations induced by altering the monsoonal wind or the kuroshio propagate as the cyclonically moving slope trapped waves and the westward planetary rossby waves to modulate the basin wide circulation moreover the exchange velocity between layers hereafter ev which varies as the waves pass by and leads to the redistribution of the thickness in each layer can affect the pg field to facilitate the vertical coupling 2 ocean model in this study a 3 layer ocean model including entrainment and detrainment as well as the interface friction between layers is modified from the 3 5 layer one by mccreary and kundu 1988 1989 and mccreary et al 1993 to explore the vertical coupling of the scs circulation 2 1 model equations the model consists of three active

richardson number criterion ri 0 75 if the instantaneous thickness h i n is larger than he detrainment occurs and vice versa thus w 12 can be obtained by 19 w 12 w e w s 1 and w 23 is represented as 20 w 23 w s 2 2 3 model set up the computational domain fig 1 is similar to that in yu et al 2007 and the original water depth is from etopo1 amante and eakins 2009 in reference to the 3 layer scs circulations here we divided the upper layer of the sandwich like circulation 0 750 m in gan et al 2016 into two layers in our model due to the difference in forcing the wind driven 1st layer with the maximum initial thickness of 200 m above the thermocline depth chu et al 1999 cai et al 2007 yang et al 2015 and the 2nd layer driven by rising and falling of the thermocline i e the interface between the 1st and 2nd layers with the maximum initial thickness of 500 m the middle layer 750 1500 m of the sandwich like structure is represented by the 3rd layer in our model which has the maximum initial thickness of 800 m details of the initial layering are listed in table 1 hereafter we use the 1st 2nd and 3rd to refer to the model layers whereas the upper and middle to refer to the top two layers of the scs sandwich like structure since the thermodynamic process is not considered in our model the deep 1500 m circulation which is closely associated with the density difference across the luzon strait qu et al 2006b lan et al 2013 is excluded in this study the open boundaries north of the taiwan island and east of the luzon island are set to allow for the lateral forcing from the kuroshio another two open boundaries are set in the karimata strait and the mindoro strait respectively at the solid wall a free slip boundary condition is used and the velocity normal to the boundary is set as zero the resolution of the model is 0 1 0 1 and the time step is 20 s 2 4 forcing the climatological monthly wind from the cross calibrated multi platform ccmp atlas et al 2011 is adopted in our model which has a horizontal resolution of 0 25 0 25 and is interpolated onto the model grid the climatological monthly transports through the open boundaries a c and d the red solid lines in fig 1 are extracted from yu et al 2007 which are based on the data assimilative model results of yaremchuk and qu 2004 the transport at b is geostrophically adjusted by the model itself hurlburt and thompson 1980 transports imposed at the open boundaries are full depth values so they need to be allocated into each layer in reference to the observations and previous model results e g gilson and roemmich 2002 cai et al 2007 the vertical partition of the kuroshio transport at a is set as 2 3 2 9 and 1 9 for the 1st 2nd and 3rd layer respectively for c and d the transports are only imposed in the 1st layer due to the shallow water depth the model is spun up from a static state and runs for 20 years the outputs based on a 3 day sampling from the 11th to 20th model years are used for analysis 3 results in this section we took the model results based on the configuration in section 2 as the control run in addition we conducted two comparative experiments to explore the vertical coupling of the scs circulation note that in this study the winter summer is defined as the 3 month mean from december january and february of the following year june july and august 3 1 layered scs circulation and dynamics in comparison with the results averaged from 1992 to 2011 from the global simple ocean data assimilation soda carton et al 2000a b our model can well reproduce the circulations both in the basin and on the shelf of the scs figs 2 and 3 in winter the cyclonic circulation occupies the entire scs basin in the 1st layer with a mighty western boundary current wbc extending southward along the whole western slope over the shelf in the north and the southwest the water is driven southwestward by the winter monsoon note that the modeled currents fig 2a are generally stronger than the reanalysis results fig 2d probably due to the different wind forcing used in the models in the 2nd layer the wintertime circulation consists of a strong cyclonic gyre in the north and a weak anticyclonic gyre in the south fig 2b e in the 3rd layer there is an anticyclonic circulation in the basin with a wbc flowing northeastward along the western and northern slopes fig 2c f in summer the circulation is significantly weakened in each layer in the 1st layer there is a dipole for the circulation in the scs basin a cyclonic gyre in the north and an anticyclonic gyre in the south which are separated from each other by an offshore current at about 10 n driven by the southwesterly monsoon the water over the southwestern and northern shelves flows northeastward fig 3a d in the 2nd layer the basin is basically dominated by a weak cyclonic circulation fig 3b e the summertime circulation in the 3rd layer is similar to that in winter but much weaker fig 3c f it should be noted that the modeled flow fields are smoother than the results from soda due to the simplification of physical processes in our model the distribution of the thickness in each layer is consistent with the circulation in winter the water is transported onshore and piled up on the slope due to the cyclonic circulation consequently the layer thickness increases from the basin to the slope with the minimum value about 130 m in the west of the luzon island and the maximum value about 250 m in the northwestern slope fig 4 a in addition a convergence center also exists west of the luzon strait with the anticyclonic current loop intruding into the scs note the thickness is smaller on the shelf because of the decreasing water depth there in summer corresponding to the dipole circulation the mass of the 1st layer diverges in the northern basin with the minimum thickness about 160 m off the east of vietnam but converges in the southern basin fig 4b the convergence center associated with the kuroshio intrusion is weakened and shifted eastward to ensure the mass conservation the thicknesses of the 2nd and 3rd layers show an opposite distribution to that in the 1st layer fig 4c to f using the modeled layer thicknesses we calculated the sea surface height ssh according to eq 7 and compared it with the absolute dynamical topography averaged from 1993 to 2011 from the french archiving validation and interpretation of satellite oceanographic data project aviso ducet et al 2000 in general the seasonal patterns of the modeled ssh are consistent with the satellite observations fig 5 in winter there is a low ssh center west of the luzon island and the high ssh concentrates along the slope fig 5a c in summer there is also a dipole structure for the ssh corresponding to the upper layer circulation but the modeled pattern fig 5b is not as prominent as the satellite observation fig 5d according to the entrainment detrainment scheme in our model w 12 is determined by wind stirring and shear instability while w 23 is only driven by shear instability in winter between the 1st and the 2nd layers the entrainment to the 1st layer mainly occurs in the northern basin with the maximum of about 0 8 10 5 ms 1 in the area west of the luzon island while the detrainment occurs along the slope with the maximum of about 0 7 10 5 ms 1 in the northwest fig 6 a in addition the detrainment also occurs to the west of the luzon strait where the kuroshio intrudes into the scs as an anticyclonic current loop to balance the total mass the detrainment occurs at the entire interface between the 2nd and 3rd layers with the maximum of about 0 3 10 5 ms 1 west of the luzon island fig 6c in summer between the 1st and 2nd layers the entrainment mainly occurs east of vietnam with the maximum of about 0 3 10 5 ms 1 while the detrainment associated with the kuroshio intrusion occurs west of the luzon strait but becomes weaker than in winter fig 6b for the interface between the 2nd and 3rd layers the detrainment occurs in the whole domain with the maximum of about 0 2 10 5 ms 1 east of vietnam fig 6d to diagnose the dynamical balance in each layer the terms in eqs 1 3 were calculated for a better accuracy their values were directly output from the model instead of using the velocities based on a 3 day sampling by calculating the curl of these terms and then integrating them along the upper interface of the layer as taking the acc for example 21 ω a c c s a c c y x a c c x y d s we can acquire the domain and layer integrated vorticity equation in a unified format for all layers as the following 22 ω a c c ω a d v ω c o r ω p g ω u ω l ω h d ω e d i m e 0 where ω u is either the ws curl for the 1st layer or if curl at the upper interface for the 2nd and 3rd layers and ω l is the sum of if curl and bf curl at the lower interface of the layer note that the integral domain is only the scs basin where the water depth is more than 200 m the balance of the vorticity equation for each layer is shown in fig 7 in which positive negative values correspond to counter clockwise clockwise components for easier comparison with the result based on the three dimensional model by gan et al 2016 we added the 1st and 2nd layers together as the upper layer of the scs in winter fig 7a ω pg and ω cor are the largest terms in the upper layer and ω pg is balanced by the sum of ω cor and ω u i e ws curl ω adv ω hd and ω l are one order smaller in magnitude than the above in the middle layer the leading terms in the balance are ω pg ω cor and ω hd note in gan et al 2016 ω l is also a significant sink for the wintertime vorticity balance in the upper layer of the scs while ω hd is relatively small in the balance for the middle layer in summer fig 7b the upper layer terms have smaller magnitude than their counterparts in winter and their relative contributions to the vorticity balance also change ω cor becomes comparable to ω u and both together balance ω pg in addition ω adv plays a minor role in the balance in the middle layer the balance is similar to that in winter in gan et al 2016 ω adv is more significant than ω u in the vorticity balance in the upper layer however the primary balance in the middle layer remains the same as that in winter consistent with our finding in general the modeled scs circulations are dynamically similar to those in gan et al 2016 the differences likely result from the idealized framework in our model such as the exclusion of the thermodynamics and the simplification of the energy dissipation additionally different model forcing is also an important reason to induce the discrepancies according to the model equations in section 2 there are three terms acting as the dynamical link between layers namely pg edime and if pg reflects the depth integrated effect of the thickness variation across all layers edime represents the vertical momentum exchange induced by entrainment detrainment and if results from the velocity shear between layers however the vorticity balance shows that only the ω pg is dominant whereas the curls of edime and if are both negligibly small this suggests that pg plays a key role in linking the scs circulation between layers fig 8 shows the distribution of pg in each layer in winter pg in the 1st layer is very large along the entire northern and western slope while the large values in the 2nd and 3rd layers mainly occur in the northern basin turning to summer both the wind and the kuroshio intrusion change which can lead to the redistribution of the layer thickness shown in fig 4 according to eqs 4 9 the variation of thickness can change pg throughout the water column the summertime pg in the 1st and 2nd layers is similar to that in winter in the northern scs but tends to change sign in the south while that in the 3rd layer does not change in pattern but becomes weaker as a result the circulation in each layer is switched from that in fig 2 to that in fig 3 it should be noted that the above physical explanations actually do not depend on the temporal variability to keep the context consistent we still present the results of both wintertime and summertime to make the content more complete and easier to understand although edime is insignificant in the dynamical balance as shown in fig 7 ev can contribute to the change of the layer thickness to modulate the pg and then affect the circulation according to the continuity equation we calculated the variation of the layer thickness on each time step for each grid as follows 23 δ h i t t δ t w i i 1 w i 1 i d t t t δ t h i v i d t where the first term on the right hand side δhe represents the change induced by the entrainment detrainment mixing effect and the second term represents the change related to horizontal transport advective effect winter integrated δhe is positive negative in the northern basin along the slope due to entrainment detrainment for the 1st layer fig 9 a while that for the 2nd layer is opposite in space fig 9c because w 12 is greater than w 23 see fig 6a c the basin wide detrainment from the 2nd layer to the 3rd layer see fig 6c results in the positive δhe in the whole 3rd layer fig 9e the situation is similar in summer but the areas with significant values are located to the east of vietnam and west of the luzon strait fig 9b d and f by averaging the results in the whole basin over 10 years it is found that the change induced by the entrainment detrainment is 18 2 20 7 and 17 7 of the total change for the 1st 2nd and 3rd layer respectively wang et al 2012 and gan et al 2016 pointed out that the vortex stretching associated with the variation of the layer thickness is significant in the vorticity balance of the scs circulation but they did not show explicitly the relative contribution from entrainment detrainment to the variation of the layer thickness our results suggest that the material exchange between vertical layers likely plays a more active role than what has been perceived in regulating the variability of the scs circulation and perhaps the relevant climatic and ecological issues in the scs e g xie et al 2003 ning et al 2004 3 2 impact of the monsoonal wind on the scs circulation via the vertical coupling quan et al 2016 pointed out that the monsoonal wind over the scs is significantly weakened during el niño event which results in an attenuated upper layer circulation including wbc however whether and how the impact could be transmitted downward to affect the circulation in the lower layers are still not clear to answer this question we dramatically reduced the monsoonal wind used in the control run by 80 to conduct a comparative experiment exp 1 as a result the wintertime scs circulation in the 1st layer is significantly weakened and the current on the northern shelf even reverses to flow northeastward fig 10 a in the 2nd layer the weak anticyclonic gyre in the control run fig 2b disappears in exp 1 and the cyclonic gyre tends to occupy the entire basin fig 10b the anticyclonic circulation in the 3rd layer does not change in pattern but weakens fig 10c in summer the dipole circulation in the 1st layer is attenuated especially for the cyclonic gyre in the north fig 10d in the 2nd layer the cyclonic gyre still occupies the entire basin but weakens fig 10e similar to the winter case the summertime anticyclonic circulation in the 3rd layer also weakens but dose not change in pattern fig 10f as the return flow to balance the meridional flux of the interior basin the scswbc can be taken as an index for the intensity of the basin scale circulation to quantify the change of the scs circulation in the comparative experiments we calculated the scswbc transport through the 13 5 n transect east of vietnam blue solid line in fig 1 in exp 1 the seasonality of the scswbc transport is significantly attenuated in comparison with the control run with a relative change of 70 7 65 3 173 8 47 3 and 48 2 20 6 in magnitude for the 1st 2nd and 3rd layer in winter summer respectively red lines in fig 11 it indicates that the perturbation from the abnormal atmospheric forcing can be transmitted downward to affect the scs circulation in each layer via the dynamical coupling in the vertical the dynamical balance in exp 1 is similar to the control run not shown but the dominant term of pg is significantly reduced in each layer fig 12 in the 1st layer the wintertime pg in the wbc region along the northern and western slope is largely weakened as well as that in the eastern and southern basin both in the 2nd and 3rd layers changes of the wintertime pg occur mainly in the northern basin similar changes also occur in summer except for the differences in space and intensity consequently the change of pg across all layers can transmit the effect of the abnormal atmospheric forcing from the upper to the middle layer of the scs in exp 1 two kinds of processes lead to the full depth change of pg by redistributing the layer thickness on the one hand the weakened ws reduces the ekman transport so that the layer thickness is redistributed due to the advective effect in eq 23 the gradient of surface elevation is thus reduced due to the weakened convergence divergence of mass field on the other hand in comparison with the control run the perturbation is able to change the ev at the interface according to eqs 13 18 the weakened wind stirring reduces we and the altered circulations affect the shear instability to change wsi as a result between the 1st and 2nd layers both the entrainment in the basin and the detrainment along the slope are weakened in winter fig 13 a in summer the entrainment east of vietnam is weakened fig 13b however in winter the detrainment between the 2nd and 3rd layers is weakened in the basin but strengthened along the slope fig 13c while it gets weakened east of vietnam in summer fig 13d the changed ev can further redistribute the layer thickness due to the mixing effect in eq 23 and the corresponding contribution to the total change is 26 8 15 3 and 20 4 for the 1st to 3rd layer respectively due to these two processes the thickness in the whole basin is significantly redistributed not shown according to the depth integrated effect in eqs 4 9 the basin scale redistribution of the layer thickness alters the pg field in each layer consequently the entire scs circulation including the wbc which is vertically coupled is significantly weakened 3 3 impact of the kuroshio intrusion on the scs circulation via the vertical coupling the exp 1 illustrates how the perturbation from the abnormal atmospheric forcing is transmitted from the 1st layer downward to the 2nd and the 3rd layers via the vertical coupling to affect the scs circulation to explore how the perturbation from deep is transmitted upward we shut down the kuroshio including the inflow and outflow at the open boundaries in the 3rd layer to conduct another comparative experiment exp 2 note that the perturbation in exp 2 is much weaker than that in exp 1 as a result in exp 2 the basin circulation in each layer is very similar to the control run but slightly weakened in strength fig 14 using the control run as a reference in exp 2 there is a relative change of 4 5 6 2 6 7 18 4 and 18 2 22 5 for the wintertime summertime scswbc transport in the 1st 2nd and 3rd layer respectively blue lines in fig 11 it indicates that the impact from the abnormal oceanic forcing in the anticyclonic layer of the scs can also be transmitted into the upper cyclonic layer via the vertical coupling and affect the circulation in each layer in exp 2 the most significant change in dynamics is still related to pg which is dominant in the dynamical balance not shown the change of pg in exp 2 is very similar to that in exp 1 but much weaker fig 15 the most significant difference compare fig 12j with 15j occurs in the meridional pg during summer when the influence of perturbation from the luzon strait in the 3rd layer can be clearly seen in the 1st layer which directly reflects the depth integrated effect across all layers as a result the change of pg throughout the water column can transmit the perturbation from the middle to the upper layer of the scs after shutting down the kuroshio at the open boundaries of the 3rd layer the outflow in the luzon strait is reduced by 30 9 36 5 in winter summer which alters the thickness of the layer due to the advective effect in eq 23 moreover the perturbation can also change the ev at the interface especially for the slope region since the wind is unchanged in exp 2 the changed ev mainly results from the shear instability which is affected by the altered circulations between the 1st and 2nd layers both the entrainment in the basin and the detrainment along the slope are weakened in winter fig 16 a whereas the entrainment is intensified in the area east of vietnam but weakened along the slope in summer fig 16b for the interface between the 2nd and 3rd layers the detrainment is weakened in the whole domain fig 16c d unlike the exp 1 the change is largest in the 3rd layer and decreases upward in exp 2 as the perturbation is introduced in the 3rd layer as a result the adjusted entrainment and detrainment can further redistribute the layer thickness due to the mixing effect in eq 23 and the corresponding contribution to the total change is 16 2 22 1 and 27 5 for the 1st to 3rd layer respectively although the redistribution of the layer thickness is less significant in exp 2 than in exp 1 not shown through the depth integral effect of the pg in eqs 4 9 the impact can still be transmitted upward and induces changes in the 1st and the 2nd layers especially for the slope region which links the variation of the scs circulation between layers 4 discussion in both experiments the perturbations can excite two kinds of waves to transmit the signal around the whole scs to modulate the velocity and mass field in each layer one is the slope trapped wave propagating cyclonically along the continental slope and the other is the westward planetary rossby wave across the basin similarly these two types of waves are found in the hycom global reanalysis data glba008 and they can trigger each other separately at the western and eastern boundaries of the scs basin shu et al 2014 the slope trapped wave can be seen from the phase diagram of the difference of ev between the 2nd and 3rd layers between the comparative experiments and the control run along the 1000 m isobath fig 17 a c with a larger amplitude in the northern slope the signal propagates cyclonically along the slope with the speed of about 32 2 cm s 1 which is similar to the fast moving wave at about 26 cm s 1 reported by shu et al 2014 however the slowly moving one at about 7 6 cm s 1 on the northern slope is not found in our model the probable reason is that the idealized model is limited in reproducing the complete dynamical processes in this region the westward planetary rossby wave is demonstrated by the phase diagram of the difference of ev between the 2nd and 3rd layers between the comparative experiments and the control run along the transect in the central basin fig 17b d see fig 1 for the transect location the signal propagates westward at a mean speed of about 6 9 cm s 1 which is close to the speed of about 5 5 cm s 1 in shu et al 2014 it means that the wave will take about 3 months to propagate from the east to the west of the basin these waves can also be found on the interface between the 1st and 2nd layers not shown despite the difference in intensity the analogous waves in both comparative experiments suggest dynamically similar adjustments throughout the water column in the scs in response to perturbations from the wind and the kuroshio intrusion according to xu and oey 2015 the westward planetary rossby waves can modulate the heaving and depression of isopycnals i e surface interface in our model considering eqs 4 9 this process is able to have a direct effect on pg to affect the flow field in each layer not shown moreover shu et al 2014 pointed out that the upward downward motions in the deep scs could be resulted from the interplay between the cyclonically moving slope trapped waves and westward planetary rossby waves in fig 17 it is also found that ev varies as the waves pass by which can further redistribute the layer thickness to affect pg field to facilitate the vertical coupling of the scs circulation as demonstrated in section 3 5 summary by changing the calculation of the pressure gradient we modified a 3 5 layer model to a 3 layer one which includes the interface exchange as well as the interface friction between layers in comparison with the reanalysis and satellite altimetry data the model is able to well reproduce the circulation and reveal the primary dynamics in the scs using the model we then explored the vertical coupling of the scs circulation in the upper and middle layers by changing the wind and the kuroshio two comparative experiments are conducted to show how the different perturbations can be transmitted through the water column in exp 1 the reduced ws weakens the ekman transport to redistribute the thickness of each layer meanwhile the perturbation is also able to change the ev between layers which can further redistribute the layer thickness the adjusted thickness of each layer reduces the horizontal gradient of the surface interface elevation and results in a reduced pg field as a result the entire scs circulation including the wbc is coupled in the vertical and significantly weakened in exp 2 after shutting down the kuroshio in the 3rd layer the changed outflow in the luzon strait alters the 3rd layer thickness the perturbation can also change the ev at the interface which further redistributes the thickness of all layers to affect the pg field thus the variation of the scs circulation is linked in the vertical in both experiments the perturbations are found to propagate as the cyclonically moving slope trapped waves and the westward planetary rossby waves to modulate the basin wide circulation suggesting dynamically similar responses throughout the water column in the scs from both cases although the if and the edime are insignificant as the dynamical link between layers analysis indicates that ev which varies as the waves pass by can induce a considerable variation about 20 on average of the layer thickness to affect pg field hence plays an important role in regulating the variability of the scs circulation our aim in this study is to illuminate a probable way by which a multi layer dynamical system can interact with each other in the vertical this may be extended to other marginal seas or some special areas in the open oceans e g ferron et al 1998 ledwell et al 2000 marshall and speer 2012 where the vertical exchange process is as strong as that in the scs it should be noted that the estimation of the entrainment detrainment in our model is simplified as some relevant processes e g tidal mixing wang et al 2016 are not considered in the study moreover the deep layer of the sandwich like scs circulation is excluded in our model so its connection to the upper and middle layers is still unknown observations and a more comprehensive numerical model e g further development of the layered model to include the bottom cyclonic layer and thermodynamic forcing are needed in our future work to

24096,langmuir circulation lc is believed to be one of the leading causes of turbulent mixing in the upper ocean large eddy simulation les models that solve the craik leibovich equations are used to study lc in the upper ocean yielding new insights that could not be obtained from field observations or turbulent closure models alone the present study expands our previous les modeling investigations of lc to real ocean conditions with large scale environmental motion due to strong horizontal density gradient which is introduced to the les model through scale separation analysis the model is applied to field observations in the gulf of mexico when a measurement site was impacted by fresh water inflow model results suggest that lc can enhance turbulence in the water column and deepen the mixed layer ml with or without the large scale motions being consistent with previous studies the strong salinity gradient is shown to be able to reduce the mean flow in the ml align langmuir cells with the pressure gradient direction and inhibit turbulence in the ocean surface boundary layer 1 introduction langmuir circulation lc often represented by windrows on the water surface which are caused by buoyant materials such as gas bubbles in horizontal counter rotating cells aligned in the wind direction is believed to be one of the leading causes of turbulent mixing in the upper ocean li et al 1995 skylingstad and denbo 1995 kukulka et al 2009 kukulka et al 2010 mcwilliams et al 1997 hamlington et al 2014 it is important for momentum and heat exchange across the mixed layer ml and can directly impact dynamics and thermodynamics in the upper ocean and the lower atmosphere including the vertical distributions of chemical biological optical and acoustic properties the dynamical origin of lc is understood as wind driven shear instability in combination with stokes drift the prevailing theoretical interpretation of langmuir cells is derived by craik and leibovich 1976 who introduced effects of waves on eulerian mean flow into the navier stokes equations based on their theory large eddy simulation les models have been developed to simulate phase averaged over high frequency surface gravity waves equations for oceanic currents in the surface boundary layer and their interactions with surface gravity waves skylingstad and denbo 1995 mcwilliams et al 1997 these equations have additional terms proportional to the lagrangian stokes drift of the waves including vortex and coriolis forces and tracer advection les models have been used to simulate lc in the upper ocean yielding new insights that could not be obtained from field observations and turbulent closure models due to its high computational cost les models are usually limited to a finite domain with hundreds of meters at each horizontal direction and cannot resolve large scale flows furthermore most les models used in the lc simulations use periodic boundary conditions in the horizontal directions which assumes the physical properties i e temperature and salinity and expected flow patterns in the area of interest are of a periodically repeating nature so that the small les domain is representative for a larger area using periodic boundary conditions can significantly reduce computational effort and it is a good assumption for isotropic shear turbulence however lc is anisotropic mcwilliams et al 1997 and has been observed to be modulated by crosswind tidal currents kukulka et al 2011 martinat et al 2011 idealized les studies also indicate that lc could interact with oceanic fronts hamlington et al 2014 and standing internal waves chini and leibovich 2005 polton et al 2008 the present study expands our previous les modeling investigations of langmuir turbulence to real ocean conditions with large scale environmental motion that features fresh water inflow into the study region the outline of this paper is as follows a brief description of the implementation of large scale temperature and salinity variations in the les model the observations in the gulf of mexico and the experiment set up are given in section 2 results are analyzed in section 3 and discussion and concluding remarks are presented in section 4 2 method 2 1 observations in the gulf of mexico a comprehensive field experiment took placed in the gulf of mexico from 2 july to 22 july 2016 and was a part of turbulence in the ocean surface boundary layer project funded by the naval research laboratory it was conducted on the outer shelf in the gulf about 190 km southeast of galveston tx fig 1 the experiment took place after high discharges from the mississippi atchafalaya river system into the gulf in the first six months of 2016 with the 2016 mean discharge of 18 531 m3 s that was higher than the long term mean discharge value of 16 792 m3 s the mississippi discharge was above the long term mean between january 1 2016 and june 15 2016 and it varied between 18 531 m3 s and 37 661 m3 s it dropped below the 2016 and long term means just before the experiment began discharge data are from https nwis waterdata usgs gov as show by the nasa sea surface salinity sss in fig 1 the fresher water spread along the coast to the east and west of the river mouths and also slowly pushed southward the experimental site was located within a strong salinity gradient region 5 psu per 100 km temperature conductivity salinity and pressure observations were collected using sea bird electronics sbe 37 sm microcat instruments at the four corners of a nearly square 10 km by 10 km box s1 to s4 these water properties were measured at 7 levels in the top 11 m then every 7 m between 11 m and 50 m and every 10 m when deeper than 50 m additional measurements were collected at the center of the box at station s5 at this location a wirewalker pinkel et al 2011 collected detailed temperature sbe 3 and conductivity sbe 4 profiles at very fine vertical resolution 3 cm from near the bottom to 2 m below the sea surface fig 2 a 1200 khz teledyne rdi acoustic doppler current profiler adcp with a wave package deployed at 10 m below the sea surface delivered current velocity profiles fig 7a b pressure and echo intensity these observations were used to estimate surface wave parameters and spectra e g terray et al 1999 which are given in frequency bands range from 0 0083 to 0 9927 hz with a 0 0156 hz frequency band width an example of the wave spectra is given at 14 17 utc on july 13 in fig 3 d it clearly shows that most of the wave energy is concentrated in the frequency bands lower than 0 5 hz the 300 khz bottom mounted adcps were also deployed to measure current profiles at 5 mooring sites s1 s5 meteorology observations such as wind speed and direction fig 3a air temperature solar radiation and relative humidity were collected by sensors mounted on the research ship r v pelican that remained inside or just outside the study area during the entire experiment 2 2 model description the les model used in this study was first introduced by mcwilliams et al 1997 to solve the flow components using the wave phase averaged craik leibovich theory e g craik and leibovich 1976 suzuki and fox kemper 2016 with the effect of wave on current through the vortex force stokes coriolis force lagrangian mean advection associated with stokes drift and a wave averaged increment to pressure that arises through conservative wave current interactions the filtered craik leibovich momentum equation is given as mcwilliams et al 1997 1 d u d t f z u u s π g z ρ ρ 0 u s ω s g s where g is the gravitational acceleration d d t t u u u v w is the current velocity vector u s usx usy is the stokes drift vector and π p ρ 0 1 2 u u s 2 u 2 is a generalized pressure the details on the subgrid scale model which is only schematically indicated as sgs here can be found in sullivan et al 2007 who has introduced the stokes production into the sgs model the conservative wave induced additional diffusivity e g mcwilliams et al 2004 uchiyama et al 2010 is insignificant compared with other diffusivity sources and thus ignored in our model the dynamical equations are integrated in time using third order runge kutta methods horizontal derivatives are evaluated with fourier pseudo spectral method vertical derivatives are approximated with a high resolution scheme with flux limiter to suppress spurious oscillation e g sullivan et al 1996 and sullivan and patton 2011 the model has been shown to accurately reproduce observed upper ocean responses to a variety of meteorological conditions without the influence of lateral density gradient e g kukulka et al 2009 liang et al 2017 the model domain is set to be rectangular in three dimensions periodic boundary conditions are specified for the horizontal directions outward wave radiation and zero stress are set for the bottom and no normal flow and specified momentum and heat fluxes are applied at the surface obviously these treatments of boundary conditions have serious limitations in predicting turbulence in inhomogeneous flow fields especially those locations that are strongly influenced by larger scale ocean dynamical features such as density fronts river runoff or massive ice melt can create very strong salinity gradients large temperature and salinity gradients are commonly seen across fronts and eddies which are abundant in the ocean these submesoscale features can have significant impact on the dynamics and structure of the oceanic mixed layer it has been also established that small scale turbulence is also important in the dynamics and mixing of the upper ocean and lc is one of the leading causes of turbulent mixing in the upper ocean although considerable research has been conducted for both processes separately our understanding of the interactions between them remains very limited due to the large spatial and temporal scale differences between these two processes hamlington et al 2014 simulated the spin down of a temperature front using a les model and investigated the effect of lc on submesoscale processes the effect of submesoscale features on langmuir turbulence remains unclear to study effects of large scale temperature and salinity fluxes on lc large scale gradient forcing lsgf is introduced following wang et al 1998 computational constraints preclude the possibility of a 2 way coupling of the les model with a general ocean circulation model therefore a one way interaction approach is adopted the underlying assumption is the scale separation hypothesis it states that the horizontal scales of the large scale temperature and salinity fluxes are much larger than the scales of motions that are contained within the domain of the les model such that the horizontal derivatives of the large scale terms are unaffected by small scale motions by doing so we can account for the large scale influence on the small scale turbulence while still keeping the periodic boundary condition the advantage for this approach is that there is no need to impose vertical profiles of velocities temperature and salinity as horizontal boundary conditions which may cause wave reflections at the lateral boundaries and interfere with small scale turbulent motions inside the model domain the modified temperature and salinity equations with large scale gradient forcing are given as 2 d θ d t u s θ sgs 1 c p i z h θ 3 d s d t u s s sgs h s where θ is temperature s is salinity cp 4 1 106 j m 3 k 1 is the specific heat of seawater per unit volume and i is the net surface heat flux the surface freshwater flux term is omitted because there is no precipitation during the study period and the surface evaporation is negligible ht and hs are the large scale interaction terms for temperature and salinity 4 h θ u θ l x l v θ l y l 5 h s u s l x l v s l y l with the overbar and superscription l i e θ l stands for large scale motions effects of mesoscale eddy forcing of temperature and salinity are very weak in the study area as indicated by sea surface height anomalies shown in fig 1 and hence not considered in this study 2 3 model setup we focus our analysis on data collected at station s5 temperature and salinity profile time series at this station show deepening of the fresher and warmer upper layer with time with a temperature increase from 27 c to 30 c and a salinity decrease from 34 psu to 32 psu at 20 m between july 7 and july 13 fig 2 near surface temperature observations indicate a daily cycle of temperature however temperature variations in the upper 10 m are relatively small when compared to its variability below 10 m depth hence fig 2 displays only temperature variations below 10 m to capture this process we calculate the large scale temperature and salinity gradient h θ and hs using the observed temperature and salinity time series at the four corners of the box s1 to s4 since the measurements at s4 started right before july 9 we start our simulation from july 9 at 00 00 utc and run the model for 5 days to the end of july 13 at 23 00 utc the les model is configured on a domain of 500 m x 500 m in the horizontal and 70 m in vertical directions there were 250 grid points in both horizontal directions with a uniform spacing of 2 m the vertical grid was stretched with a smallest spacing of 0 15 m near the surface to better resolve the boundary layer turbulence mcwilliams et al 2014 all model simulations start from rest wirewalker measurements of temperature and salinity from july 8 23 45 utc to july 9 00 15 utc were averaged in time to create the initial condition for the les model on july 9 at 00 00 utc blue dash line in fig 5a and b stokes drift profile time series were computed from the wave spectra data e σ θ collected by the 1200 khz adcp at s5 according to kenyon 1969 6 u s 2 σ k e σ θ e 2 k z d σ d θ where σ θ and k are the frequency direction and wave number vector of the spectra since the wave spectra are measured in frequency bands range from 0 0083 to 0 9927 hz the contribution to stokes drift from the higher frequencies are omitted numerical experiments conducted using swan not shown have shown that the effect of high frequency tails on stokes drift profile is significant at the surface z 0 especially for low wind speeds but this effect becomes small around 0 15 m depth our first model layer and diminishes around 0 3 m depth for 6 m s wind or higher furthermore kukulka and harcourt 2017 found that only waves with wavelengths greater than about 20 of the osbl depth contribute substantially to deep lt for typical ocean wave ages and wind speeds between 5 and 20 ms 1 thus it is safe to assume that our model results are not affect by neglecting the contributions of high frequency tails to the stokes drift calculations model surface forcing includes wind stress and heat fluxes time varying wind stress latent and sensible heat fluxes were calculated based on field measurements using the vectorized coare 3 0a algorithm modified from fairall et al 2003 by woods hole oceanographic institution whoi our measurement site resembles typical open ocean wave conditions thus the option with surface gravity wave effect is not required fairall et al 2003 and thus turned off in the algorithm since the instrument measuring long short wave radiation was not recording data until the very end of the field experiment the assimilated coupled ocean atmosphere mesoscale prediction system coamps run at 1 km resolution was used to produce these heat fluxes at s5 all forcing wind stress latent and sensible heat fluxes long short wave radiation h θ and hs are given at hourly intervals four les experiments are conducted experiment 1 includes no effect from either the lsgf h θ and hs or stokes drift velocities experiment 2 includes the effect of lsgf only experiment 3 includes the effect of stokes drift only and experiment 4 includes both effects 3 results 3 1 water properties and langmuir circulation the salinity vertical profiles in the four experiments are presented in fig 4 from july 11 00 00 utc to the end of the model simulation on july 13 at 23 00 utc the mixed layer depth hm given by white solid dashed lines for the model observations is defined as the depth where changes of the potential density are referenced to surface less than 0 125 kg m3 it is apparent that the water column is much saltier in the top 10 15 m when lsgf is not included with the same lsgf set up the inclusion of the stokes drift always deepens the mixed layer indicating the enhancement of turbulence in the water column by lc interestingly the largest mixed layer depth discrepancy between model and observations is found in experiment 2 when we consider lsgf only fig 4b the variation of the salinity profiles with time also shows significant differences from the observations given in fig 2b such as the low salinity spike during july 12 that is not observed at the wirewalker location and the shallower intrusion of low salinity waters at the end of july 12 and beginning of july 13 these discrepancies indicate that only having the correct large scale dynamics without proper small scale turbulent mixing may lead to even a worse representation of the water columns the salinity variation of the water column in experiment 4 compares best with observations but due to the coarse resolution of adcp measurements in both temporal hourly and vertical resolution beneath 11 m every 7 m the salinity structures are much smoother in the model with shallower penetrations of fresher water especially for the two events during july 11 and 12 when the fresher water penetrates to almost 20 m in depth fig 2b the adcp measurements and hence the lsgf only caught part of these penetration resulting in much shallower mixed layer depth in the model the vertical profiles of temperature and salinity from the experiments 4 with lsgf and stokes drift and 2 with stokes drift but without lsgf were further compared with the wirewalker data on july 13 at 12 00 utc fig 5 a b when lsgf is included the modeled salinity profile red line matches with observations gray area pretty well except for the depths between 20 and 30 m while the modeled salinity in the experiment without lsgf was overestimated by 0 7 psu in the mixed layer and the overestimation persists for another 10 m or so beneath the mixed layer on the other hand the temperature profiles are almost identical between these two experiments this is because the spatial variation of salinity is mainly in the mixed layer which is sampled with high vertical resolution at the four corners of the box s1 s4 while the spatial variation of temperature is mainly beneath the mixed layer at 20 to 40 m in depth where the observations are too sparse to capture the vertical variation of the lsgf the mismatch of temperature profile beneath the mixed layer also affects the salinity simulation and causes the mismatch between 20 and 30 m during this 5 day simulation period the turbulent langmuir number lat u u s where u is the friction velocity is around 0 5 fig 3b indicating combined effects of the wind and wave forcing belcher et al 2012 since the wind direction oscillates within 30 of the true north most of the time and the wind magnitude varies from 3 8 to 10 6 m s fig 3a there are often misalignments between wind and waves lat may not be the best representation of the relative importance of langmuir turbulent to shear instability of the wind driven currents van roekel et al 2012 have attempted a new approach to capture the importance of langmuir turbulence under misaligned wind and wave forcing through a projected turbulence langmuir number which argues that the orientation of langmuir circulation should be decided through the tilting of vorticity in the flow field the concept is attractive but their formulation can only be applied to stable results usually found in idealized experiments with constant wind and wave forcing such as van roekel et al 2012 and not practical for real ocean simulations presented in this study towards the end of the simulation there is a 5 h wind event from 10 00 utc to 15 00 utc on july 13 when the wind is roughly unidirectional towards the north with small magnitude variations red arrows in fig 3a the hoenikker number h o 4 b 0 u s β u 2 where b0 is the surface buoyancy flux and β is the stokes drift current e folding depth vs turbulent langmuir number during this period fig 3c indicating langmuir turbulence dominance regime following li et al 2005 snapshots of vertical velocities at the end of this wind event show similar near surface patterns between the two experiments with organized langmuir circulation structures of elongated rolls aligned with the wind direction not shown the horizontal and vertical scales of the vortices increase with depth and their axis rotates clockwise due to the ekman spiral effect mcwilliams et al 1997 2012 around the bottom of the mixed layer the langmuir rolls rotate to about 50 to 60 relative to the wind direction they are more organized and align with the large scale pressure gradient direction in the experiment with lsgf than in the experiment without the background gradient fig 6 to understand the effect of lsgf on the mean flow and turbulence we analyze the mean flow reynold stress and turbulence profiles all statistics in fig 8 and 9 are averaged over one inertial period 25 5 h towards the end of the simulation and normalized by the friction velocity the boundary layer depth hb is defined using the maximum potential temperature gradient method proposed by sullivan et al 1998 3 2 mean velocity and momentum balance the mean flow averaged over the horizontal domain fields are dominated by inertial oscillations in both experiments fig 7 the downward propagation of the inertial energy in the model is much weaker compared with the observations for both experiments this is mainly due to the strong stratification in the study area that inhibits the downward propagation of the inertial energy in the model kim et al 2015 given the short simulation period furthermore the large discrepancies between the modeled and observed temperature and salinity profiles right beneath the mixed layer fig 5 alters the stratification in the model significantly which may further interfere with the downward propagation of the inertial energy due to the reduced downward propagation of the inertial energy wind inputted energy is trapped in the surface layer and significantly enhances the mean flow in the model the mean horizontal velocity u v profiles are very similar between these two cases for the v component while the u component shows differences from the mid mixed layer to several meters below the boundary layer fig 8 a b for the lsgf case the u component is slightly larger than that in the case without lsgf within the mixed layer and switched to smaller beneath the mixed layer resulting in the mean surface current direction above below the mixed layer to be slightly shifted in the clockwise counterclockwise direction relative to the case without lsgf this is because the horizontal pressure gradient due to the background salinity variations is strong and dominated by the westward component between the base of the mixed layer and the boundary layer fig 6c and e and thus causing the eastward component of the velocity to decrease although its effect on the magnitude of the mean flow is relatively small the lsgf seems to be able to rotate the axis of the langmuir cell rolls and align it with the pressure gradient direction the reynolds stress fig 8c d is dominated by the southward component v w that is very similar for both experiments while the westward component u w is smaller in the experiment with lsgf from the middle of the mixed layer to several meters beneath the boundary layer because they are strongly constrained by the imposed surface stress and the mean velocity profiles 3 3 turbulence both the u and v variance are smaller with the presence of the lsgf fig 9 a b with much larger difference in the v component from the surface all the way to the base of the boundary layer while there is no difference in the w variance between these two cases not shown as a result the total tke that contains both large eddy and subgrid scale components are significantly reduced when lsgf is included in the experiment fig 9c the turbulent vertical temperature flux w θ fig 9d appear to have its maximum value at the base of the mixed layer in the experiment with lsgf and then sharply declines with depth while in the experiment without lsgf the maximum of w θ is relatively smaller and its variation with depth is smoother with small changes from the bottom of the mixed layer to the base of the boundary layer the turbulent vertical flux of salinity w θ fig 9e is smaller in the experiment with lsgf throughout the water column the largest differences are found in the top 15 m or so where the lsgf significantly alters the salinity structure in the water column with the added fresher water inflow into the model domain fig 4d the horizontal averaged budget equation for the resolved turbulent kinetic energy tke e z is given as 7 e t t s b p s t ɛ where t 1 2 u 2 w z v 2 w z w 2 w z is the turbulent transport term s u w u z v w v z is the shear production term b αg θ w βg s w is the buoyancy production term p 1 ρ 0 p w z is the pressure transport term s t u w u s x z v w u s y z is the stokes production term and ε is the kinetic energy dissipation rate the angle bracket in the above equations represents horizontal average the superscript prime denotes a departure from horizontal average the sgs tke equation takes the same form as eq 7 except the fluxes are parameterized instead of being resolved for example the stokes production in the subgrid model is given as τ x s u b u s x z τ y s u b u s y z sullivan et al 2007 where the stress τ x s u b τ y s u b is calculated using parameterized viscosity and current shear in this study we will focus on the resolved tke only the tke balance for the experiment without lsgf is represented by dash lines in fig 10 a the shear and stokes productions are the primary energy sources through the entire boundary layer the turbulent transport is much weaker and acts to spread energy downward from the more energetic upper part to the lower part of the boundary layer its crossover depth from negative to positive is around 2 m which is 10 of the boundary layer depth interestingly the pressure transport is also large in the top 2 to 3 m and transports a large amount of tke down the water column it is a major contributor to the source terms close to the surface and quickly crosses over from positive to negative at 0 5 m and becomes one of the dominant energy sinks between 0 5 m and 2 m when lsgf is added to the system the main difference in the tke budget are found in the buoyancy production and the pressure transport in the boundary layer and below 2 m depth thus these two terms are zoomed in and compared for depths between 2 and 22 m in fig 10b when lsgf is included the buoyancy production is smaller and its crossover depth from positive to negative values is shallower indicating stabilizing effects in the boundary layer and thus inhibits turbulence in other words the fresh water inflow causes energy consumption through an increase in the potential energy of the water column through mixing correspondingly the crossover depth for the pressure transport from negative to positive is deeper with the lsgf included which means more energy is transported downward the joint effect of the lower buoyancy production and more negative pressure transport decreases the total tke and reduces the turbulence level in the water column changes in the buoyancy production and pressure transport also cause a redistribution of energy in the shear production turbulent transport and dissipation but interestingly the stokes production barely changes i e the difference between the two experiments is so small that it is not identified visually 4 discussions and conclusion langmuir circulation lc is believed to be one of the leading causes of turbulent mixing in the upper ocean les models have been used to study lc in the upper ocean for the past two decades due to its high computational cost the les studies are usually limited to a finite domain with hundreds of meters at each horizontal direction and are not able to resolve large scale flows most of these les models for lc simulations use periodic boundary conditions in the horizontal directions that can significantly reduce computational effort however such treatment of boundary conditions has serious limitations in predicting turbulence in inhomogeneous flow fields especially in those locations that are strongly influenced by larger scale oceanic dynamical features such as fronts that can have significant impact on the dynamics and structure of the oceanic mixed layer d asaro et al 2011 the present study expands the previous les modeling investigations of langmuir turbulence to real ocean conditions with large scale environmental motion due to the strong horizontal density gradient which are commonly seen along oceanic fronts eddies and river discharge areas large scale gradient forcing lsgf is introduced to the ncar les model through the scale separation analysis the model is applied to field observations from the gulf of mexico collected in july 2016 when the measurement site was impacted by the large fresh water inflow due to flooding from the mississippi atchafalaya river system model results agree with previous studies that lc enhances turbulence in the water column and deepens the mixed layer with or without lsgf the large horizontal density gradient can reduce the mean flow in the ml it also helps to organize the langmuir cells and align the roll axis along the pressure gradient direction because the fresh water inflow causes energy consumption through an increase in the potential energy of the water column through mixing the buoyancy production is smaller and its crossover depth from positive to negative values is shallower and thus helps to stabilize the water column correspondingly more energy is transported downward through the pressure transport and the total tke is reduced and hence the turbulence level is also diminished in the water column changes in the buoyancy production and the pressure transport also cause a redistribution of the energy in the shear production turbulent transport and dissipation while the stokes production remains unchanged we think that this stabilizing effect should be present whenever a strong horizontal density gradient is present but how important this effect is depends on the dynamics of the individual situation that is examined this study is limited in many ways such as the inadequate representation of the lsgf due to the coarse temporal and vertical resolution of the temperature and salinity measurements especially the inability of the proper approximation of the large scale temperature fluctuations beneath the mixed layer significantly alters the stratification in the model compared with observations and thus limits our understanding of the mechanisms that may impact the stabilizing effect more studies are required to further understand these effects for example current study is conducted within a marginal langmuir regime with weak stokes drift so the turbulent enhancement from the surface waves are relatively weak for strong langmuir dominated regimes we would expect the stabilizing effect to be less important while small scale turbulence is very important in the dynamics and mixing of the upper ocean submesoscale features can also have significant impact on the dynamics and structure of the oceanic mixed layer although considerable research has been conducted for both processes separately our understanding on the interactions between them remains very limited due to the large spatial and temporal scale differences between these two processes our study has emphasized the importance of large scale motions on small scale turbulence which is usually assumed to be isotropic while hamlington et al 2014 simulated the spin down of a temperature front using a les model and investigated the effect of lc on submesoscale processes more studies are required to study the two way interactions between these two processes multiscale numerical algorithm proposed by malecha et al 2013 to simulate langmuir circulation dynamics at submesoscales could be a good approach for this purpose acknowledgment the authors thank dr peter sullivan for providing the les model for this study this work was funded by the office of naval research under program

24096,langmuir circulation lc is believed to be one of the leading causes of turbulent mixing in the upper ocean large eddy simulation les models that solve the craik leibovich equations are used to study lc in the upper ocean yielding new insights that could not be obtained from field observations or turbulent closure models alone the present study expands our previous les modeling investigations of lc to real ocean conditions with large scale environmental motion due to strong horizontal density gradient which is introduced to the les model through scale separation analysis the model is applied to field observations in the gulf of mexico when a measurement site was impacted by fresh water inflow model results suggest that lc can enhance turbulence in the water column and deepen the mixed layer ml with or without the large scale motions being consistent with previous studies the strong salinity gradient is shown to be able to reduce the mean flow in the ml align langmuir cells with the pressure gradient direction and inhibit turbulence in the ocean surface boundary layer 1 introduction langmuir circulation lc often represented by windrows on the water surface which are caused by buoyant materials such as gas bubbles in horizontal counter rotating cells aligned in the wind direction is believed to be one of the leading causes of turbulent mixing in the upper ocean li et al 1995 skylingstad and denbo 1995 kukulka et al 2009 kukulka et al 2010 mcwilliams et al 1997 hamlington et al 2014 it is important for momentum and heat exchange across the mixed layer ml and can directly impact dynamics and thermodynamics in the upper ocean and the lower atmosphere including the vertical distributions of chemical biological optical and acoustic properties the dynamical origin of lc is understood as wind driven shear instability in combination with stokes drift the prevailing theoretical interpretation of langmuir cells is derived by craik and leibovich 1976 who introduced effects of waves on eulerian mean flow into the navier stokes equations based on their theory large eddy simulation les models have been developed to simulate phase averaged over high frequency surface gravity waves equations for oceanic currents in the surface boundary layer and their interactions with surface gravity waves skylingstad and denbo 1995 mcwilliams et al 1997 these equations have additional terms proportional to the lagrangian stokes drift of the waves including vortex and coriolis forces and tracer advection les models have been used to simulate lc in the upper ocean yielding new insights that could not be obtained from field observations and turbulent closure models due to its high computational cost les models are usually limited to a finite domain with hundreds of meters at each horizontal direction and cannot resolve large scale flows furthermore most les models used in the lc simulations use periodic boundary conditions in the horizontal directions which assumes the physical properties i e temperature and salinity and expected flow patterns in the area of interest are of a periodically repeating nature so that the small les domain is representative for a larger area using periodic boundary conditions can significantly reduce computational effort and it is a good assumption for isotropic shear turbulence however lc is anisotropic mcwilliams et al 1997 and has been observed to be modulated by crosswind tidal currents kukulka et al 2011 martinat et al 2011 idealized les studies also indicate that lc could interact with oceanic fronts hamlington et al 2014 and standing internal waves chini and leibovich 2005 polton et al 2008 the present study expands our previous les modeling investigations of langmuir turbulence to real ocean conditions with large scale environmental motion that features fresh water inflow into the study region the outline of this paper is as follows a brief description of the implementation of large scale temperature and salinity variations in the les model the observations in the gulf of mexico and the experiment set up are given in section 2 results are analyzed in section 3 and discussion and concluding remarks are presented in section 4 2 method 2 1 observations in the gulf of mexico a comprehensive field experiment took placed in the gulf of mexico from 2 july to 22 july 2016 and was a part of turbulence in the ocean surface boundary layer project funded by the naval research laboratory it was conducted on the outer shelf in the gulf about 190 km southeast of galveston tx fig 1 the experiment took place after high discharges from the mississippi atchafalaya river system into the gulf in the first six months of 2016 with the 2016 mean discharge of 18 531 m3 s that was higher than the long term mean discharge value of 16 792 m3 s the mississippi discharge was above the long term mean between january 1 2016 and june 15 2016 and it varied between 18 531 m3 s and 37 661 m3 s it dropped below the 2016 and long term means just before the experiment began discharge data are from https nwis waterdata usgs gov as show by the nasa sea surface salinity sss in fig 1 the fresher water spread along the coast to the east and west of the river mouths and also slowly pushed southward the experimental site was located within a strong salinity gradient region 5 psu per 100 km temperature conductivity salinity and pressure observations were collected using sea bird electronics sbe 37 sm microcat instruments at the four corners of a nearly square 10 km by 10 km box s1 to s4 these water properties were measured at 7 levels in the top 11 m then every 7 m between 11 m and 50 m and every 10 m when deeper than 50 m additional measurements were collected at the center of the box at station s5 at this location a wirewalker pinkel et al 2011 collected detailed temperature sbe 3 and conductivity sbe 4 profiles at very fine vertical resolution 3 cm from near the bottom to 2 m below the sea surface fig 2 a 1200 khz teledyne rdi acoustic doppler current profiler adcp with a wave package deployed at 10 m below the sea surface delivered current velocity profiles fig 7a b pressure and echo intensity these observations were used to estimate surface wave parameters and spectra e g terray et al 1999 which are given in frequency bands range from 0 0083 to 0 9927 hz with a 0 0156 hz frequency band width an example of the wave spectra is given at 14 17 utc on july 13 in fig 3 d it clearly shows that most of the wave energy is concentrated in the frequency bands lower than 0 5 hz the 300 khz bottom mounted adcps were also deployed to measure current profiles at 5 mooring sites s1 s5 meteorology observations such as wind speed and direction fig 3a air temperature solar radiation and relative humidity were collected by sensors mounted on the research ship r v pelican that remained inside or just outside the study area during the entire experiment 2 2 model description the les model used in this study was first introduced by mcwilliams et al 1997 to solve the flow components using the wave phase averaged craik leibovich theory e g craik and leibovich 1976 suzuki and fox kemper 2016 with the effect of wave on current through the vortex force stokes coriolis force lagrangian mean advection associated with stokes drift and a wave averaged increment to pressure that arises through conservative wave current interactions the filtered craik leibovich momentum equation is given as mcwilliams et al 1997 1 d u d t f z u u s π g z ρ ρ 0 u s ω s g s where g is the gravitational acceleration d d t t u u u v w is the current velocity vector u s usx usy is the stokes drift vector and π p ρ 0 1 2 u u s 2 u 2 is a generalized pressure the details on the subgrid scale model which is only schematically indicated as sgs here can be found in sullivan et al 2007 who has introduced the stokes production into the sgs model the conservative wave induced additional diffusivity e g mcwilliams et al 2004 uchiyama et al 2010 is insignificant compared with other diffusivity sources and thus ignored in our model the dynamical equations are integrated in time using third order runge kutta methods horizontal derivatives are evaluated with fourier pseudo spectral method vertical derivatives are approximated with a high resolution scheme with flux limiter to suppress spurious oscillation e g sullivan et al 1996 and sullivan and patton 2011 the model has been shown to accurately reproduce observed upper ocean responses to a variety of meteorological conditions without the influence of lateral density gradient e g kukulka et al 2009 liang et al 2017 the model domain is set to be rectangular in three dimensions periodic boundary conditions are specified for the horizontal directions outward wave radiation and zero stress are set for the bottom and no normal flow and specified momentum and heat fluxes are applied at the surface obviously these treatments of boundary conditions have serious limitations in predicting turbulence in inhomogeneous flow fields especially those locations that are strongly influenced by larger scale ocean dynamical features such as density fronts river runoff or massive ice melt can create very strong salinity gradients large temperature and salinity gradients are commonly seen across fronts and eddies which are abundant in the ocean these submesoscale features can have significant impact on the dynamics and structure of the oceanic mixed layer it has been also established that small scale turbulence is also important in the dynamics and mixing of the upper ocean and lc is one of the leading causes of turbulent mixing in the upper ocean although considerable research has been conducted for both processes separately our understanding of the interactions between them remains very limited due to the large spatial and temporal scale differences between these two processes hamlington et al 2014 simulated the spin down of a temperature front using a les model and investigated the effect of lc on submesoscale processes the effect of submesoscale features on langmuir turbulence remains unclear to study effects of large scale temperature and salinity fluxes on lc large scale gradient forcing lsgf is introduced following wang et al 1998 computational constraints preclude the possibility of a 2 way coupling of the les model with a general ocean circulation model therefore a one way interaction approach is adopted the underlying assumption is the scale separation hypothesis it states that the horizontal scales of the large scale temperature and salinity fluxes are much larger than the scales of motions that are contained within the domain of the les model such that the horizontal derivatives of the large scale terms are unaffected by small scale motions by doing so we can account for the large scale influence on the small scale turbulence while still keeping the periodic boundary condition the advantage for this approach is that there is no need to impose vertical profiles of velocities temperature and salinity as horizontal boundary conditions which may cause wave reflections at the lateral boundaries and interfere with small scale turbulent motions inside the model domain the modified temperature and salinity equations with large scale gradient forcing are given as 2 d θ d t u s θ sgs 1 c p i z h θ 3 d s d t u s s sgs h s where θ is temperature s is salinity cp 4 1 106 j m 3 k 1 is the specific heat of seawater per unit volume and i is the net surface heat flux the surface freshwater flux term is omitted because there is no precipitation during the study period and the surface evaporation is negligible ht and hs are the large scale interaction terms for temperature and salinity 4 h θ u θ l x l v θ l y l 5 h s u s l x l v s l y l with the overbar and superscription l i e θ l stands for large scale motions effects of mesoscale eddy forcing of temperature and salinity are very weak in the study area as indicated by sea surface height anomalies shown in fig 1 and hence not considered in this study 2 3 model setup we focus our analysis on data collected at station s5 temperature and salinity profile time series at this station show deepening of the fresher and warmer upper layer with time with a temperature increase from 27 c to 30 c and a salinity decrease from 34 psu to 32 psu at 20 m between july 7 and july 13 fig 2 near surface temperature observations indicate a daily cycle of temperature however temperature variations in the upper 10 m are relatively small when compared to its variability below 10 m depth hence fig 2 displays only temperature variations below 10 m to capture this process we calculate the large scale temperature and salinity gradient h θ and hs using the observed temperature and salinity time series at the four corners of the box s1 to s4 since the measurements at s4 started right before july 9 we start our simulation from july 9 at 00 00 utc and run the model for 5 days to the end of july 13 at 23 00 utc the les model is configured on a domain of 500 m x 500 m in the horizontal and 70 m in vertical directions there were 250 grid points in both horizontal directions with a uniform spacing of 2 m the vertical grid was stretched with a smallest spacing of 0 15 m near the surface to better resolve the boundary layer turbulence mcwilliams et al 2014 all model simulations start from rest wirewalker measurements of temperature and salinity from july 8 23 45 utc to july 9 00 15 utc were averaged in time to create the initial condition for the les model on july 9 at 00 00 utc blue dash line in fig 5a and b stokes drift profile time series were computed from the wave spectra data e σ θ collected by the 1200 khz adcp at s5 according to kenyon 1969 6 u s 2 σ k e σ θ e 2 k z d σ d θ where σ θ and k are the frequency direction and wave number vector of the spectra since the wave spectra are measured in frequency bands range from 0 0083 to 0 9927 hz the contribution to stokes drift from the higher frequencies are omitted numerical experiments conducted using swan not shown have shown that the effect of high frequency tails on stokes drift profile is significant at the surface z 0 especially for low wind speeds but this effect becomes small around 0 15 m depth our first model layer and diminishes around 0 3 m depth for 6 m s wind or higher furthermore kukulka and harcourt 2017 found that only waves with wavelengths greater than about 20 of the osbl depth contribute substantially to deep lt for typical ocean wave ages and wind speeds between 5 and 20 ms 1 thus it is safe to assume that our model results are not affect by neglecting the contributions of high frequency tails to the stokes drift calculations model surface forcing includes wind stress and heat fluxes time varying wind stress latent and sensible heat fluxes were calculated based on field measurements using the vectorized coare 3 0a algorithm modified from fairall et al 2003 by woods hole oceanographic institution whoi our measurement site resembles typical open ocean wave conditions thus the option with surface gravity wave effect is not required fairall et al 2003 and thus turned off in the algorithm since the instrument measuring long short wave radiation was not recording data until the very end of the field experiment the assimilated coupled ocean atmosphere mesoscale prediction system coamps run at 1 km resolution was used to produce these heat fluxes at s5 all forcing wind stress latent and sensible heat fluxes long short wave radiation h θ and hs are given at hourly intervals four les experiments are conducted experiment 1 includes no effect from either the lsgf h θ and hs or stokes drift velocities experiment 2 includes the effect of lsgf only experiment 3 includes the effect of stokes drift only and experiment 4 includes both effects 3 results 3 1 water properties and langmuir circulation the salinity vertical profiles in the four experiments are presented in fig 4 from july 11 00 00 utc to the end of the model simulation on july 13 at 23 00 utc the mixed layer depth hm given by white solid dashed lines for the model observations is defined as the depth where changes of the potential density are referenced to surface less than 0 125 kg m3 it is apparent that the water column is much saltier in the top 10 15 m when lsgf is not included with the same lsgf set up the inclusion of the stokes drift always deepens the mixed layer indicating the enhancement of turbulence in the water column by lc interestingly the largest mixed layer depth discrepancy between model and observations is found in experiment 2 when we consider lsgf only fig 4b the variation of the salinity profiles with time also shows significant differences from the observations given in fig 2b such as the low salinity spike during july 12 that is not observed at the wirewalker location and the shallower intrusion of low salinity waters at the end of july 12 and beginning of july 13 these discrepancies indicate that only having the correct large scale dynamics without proper small scale turbulent mixing may lead to even a worse representation of the water columns the salinity variation of the water column in experiment 4 compares best with observations but due to the coarse resolution of adcp measurements in both temporal hourly and vertical resolution beneath 11 m every 7 m the salinity structures are much smoother in the model with shallower penetrations of fresher water especially for the two events during july 11 and 12 when the fresher water penetrates to almost 20 m in depth fig 2b the adcp measurements and hence the lsgf only caught part of these penetration resulting in much shallower mixed layer depth in the model the vertical profiles of temperature and salinity from the experiments 4 with lsgf and stokes drift and 2 with stokes drift but without lsgf were further compared with the wirewalker data on july 13 at 12 00 utc fig 5 a b when lsgf is included the modeled salinity profile red line matches with observations gray area pretty well except for the depths between 20 and 30 m while the modeled salinity in the experiment without lsgf was overestimated by 0 7 psu in the mixed layer and the overestimation persists for another 10 m or so beneath the mixed layer on the other hand the temperature profiles are almost identical between these two experiments this is because the spatial variation of salinity is mainly in the mixed layer which is sampled with high vertical resolution at the four corners of the box s1 s4 while the spatial variation of temperature is mainly beneath the mixed layer at 20 to 40 m in depth where the observations are too sparse to capture the vertical variation of the lsgf the mismatch of temperature profile beneath the mixed layer also affects the salinity simulation and causes the mismatch between 20 and 30 m during this 5 day simulation period the turbulent langmuir number lat u u s where u is the friction velocity is around 0 5 fig 3b indicating combined effects of the wind and wave forcing belcher et al 2012 since the wind direction oscillates within 30 of the true north most of the time and the wind magnitude varies from 3 8 to 10 6 m s fig 3a there are often misalignments between wind and waves lat may not be the best representation of the relative importance of langmuir turbulent to shear instability of the wind driven currents van roekel et al 2012 have attempted a new approach to capture the importance of langmuir turbulence under misaligned wind and wave forcing through a projected turbulence langmuir number which argues that the orientation of langmuir circulation should be decided through the tilting of vorticity in the flow field the concept is attractive but their formulation can only be applied to stable results usually found in idealized experiments with constant wind and wave forcing such as van roekel et al 2012 and not practical for real ocean simulations presented in this study towards the end of the simulation there is a 5 h wind event from 10 00 utc to 15 00 utc on july 13 when the wind is roughly unidirectional towards the north with small magnitude variations red arrows in fig 3a the hoenikker number h o 4 b 0 u s β u 2 where b0 is the surface buoyancy flux and β is the stokes drift current e folding depth vs turbulent langmuir number during this period fig 3c indicating langmuir turbulence dominance regime following li et al 2005 snapshots of vertical velocities at the end of this wind event show similar near surface patterns between the two experiments with organized langmuir circulation structures of elongated rolls aligned with the wind direction not shown the horizontal and vertical scales of the vortices increase with depth and their axis rotates clockwise due to the ekman spiral effect mcwilliams et al 1997 2012 around the bottom of the mixed layer the langmuir rolls rotate to about 50 to 60 relative to the wind direction they are more organized and align with the large scale pressure gradient direction in the experiment with lsgf than in the experiment without the background gradient fig 6 to understand the effect of lsgf on the mean flow and turbulence we analyze the mean flow reynold stress and turbulence profiles all statistics in fig 8 and 9 are averaged over one inertial period 25 5 h towards the end of the simulation and normalized by the friction velocity the boundary layer depth hb is defined using the maximum potential temperature gradient method proposed by sullivan et al 1998 3 2 mean velocity and momentum balance the mean flow averaged over the horizontal domain fields are dominated by inertial oscillations in both experiments fig 7 the downward propagation of the inertial energy in the model is much weaker compared with the observations for both experiments this is mainly due to the strong stratification in the study area that inhibits the downward propagation of the inertial energy in the model kim et al 2015 given the short simulation period furthermore the large discrepancies between the modeled and observed temperature and salinity profiles right beneath the mixed layer fig 5 alters the stratification in the model significantly which may further interfere with the downward propagation of the inertial energy due to the reduced downward propagation of the inertial energy wind inputted energy is trapped in the surface layer and significantly enhances the mean flow in the model the mean horizontal velocity u v profiles are very similar between these two cases for the v component while the u component shows differences from the mid mixed layer to several meters below the boundary layer fig 8 a b for the lsgf case the u component is slightly larger than that in the case without lsgf within the mixed layer and switched to smaller beneath the mixed layer resulting in the mean surface current direction above below the mixed layer to be slightly shifted in the clockwise counterclockwise direction relative to the case without lsgf this is because the horizontal pressure gradient due to the background salinity variations is strong and dominated by the westward component between the base of the mixed layer and the boundary layer fig 6c and e and thus causing the eastward component of the velocity to decrease although its effect on the magnitude of the mean flow is relatively small the lsgf seems to be able to rotate the axis of the langmuir cell rolls and align it with the pressure gradient direction the reynolds stress fig 8c d is dominated by the southward component v w that is very similar for both experiments while the westward component u w is smaller in the experiment with lsgf from the middle of the mixed layer to several meters beneath the boundary layer because they are strongly constrained by the imposed surface stress and the mean velocity profiles 3 3 turbulence both the u and v variance are smaller with the presence of the lsgf fig 9 a b with much larger difference in the v component from the surface all the way to the base of the boundary layer while there is no difference in the w variance between these two cases not shown as a result the total tke that contains both large eddy and subgrid scale components are significantly reduced when lsgf is included in the experiment fig 9c the turbulent vertical temperature flux w θ fig 9d appear to have its maximum value at the base of the mixed layer in the experiment with lsgf and then sharply declines with depth while in the experiment without lsgf the maximum of w θ is relatively smaller and its variation with depth is smoother with small changes from the bottom of the mixed layer to the base of the boundary layer the turbulent vertical flux of salinity w θ fig 9e is smaller in the experiment with lsgf throughout the water column the largest differences are found in the top 15 m or so where the lsgf significantly alters the salinity structure in the water column with the added fresher water inflow into the model domain fig 4d the horizontal averaged budget equation for the resolved turbulent kinetic energy tke e z is given as 7 e t t s b p s t ɛ where t 1 2 u 2 w z v 2 w z w 2 w z is the turbulent transport term s u w u z v w v z is the shear production term b αg θ w βg s w is the buoyancy production term p 1 ρ 0 p w z is the pressure transport term s t u w u s x z v w u s y z is the stokes production term and ε is the kinetic energy dissipation rate the angle bracket in the above equations represents horizontal average the superscript prime denotes a departure from horizontal average the sgs tke equation takes the same form as eq 7 except the fluxes are parameterized instead of being resolved for example the stokes production in the subgrid model is given as τ x s u b u s x z τ y s u b u s y z sullivan et al 2007 where the stress τ x s u b τ y s u b is calculated using parameterized viscosity and current shear in this study we will focus on the resolved tke only the tke balance for the experiment without lsgf is represented by dash lines in fig 10 a the shear and stokes productions are the primary energy sources through the entire boundary layer the turbulent transport is much weaker and acts to spread energy downward from the more energetic upper part to the lower part of the boundary layer its crossover depth from negative to positive is around 2 m which is 10 of the boundary layer depth interestingly the pressure transport is also large in the top 2 to 3 m and transports a large amount of tke down the water column it is a major contributor to the source terms close to the surface and quickly crosses over from positive to negative at 0 5 m and becomes one of the dominant energy sinks between 0 5 m and 2 m when lsgf is added to the system the main difference in the tke budget are found in the buoyancy production and the pressure transport in the boundary layer and below 2 m depth thus these two terms are zoomed in and compared for depths between 2 and 22 m in fig 10b when lsgf is included the buoyancy production is smaller and its crossover depth from positive to negative values is shallower indicating stabilizing effects in the boundary layer and thus inhibits turbulence in other words the fresh water inflow causes energy consumption through an increase in the potential energy of the water column through mixing correspondingly the crossover depth for the pressure transport from negative to positive is deeper with the lsgf included which means more energy is transported downward the joint effect of the lower buoyancy production and more negative pressure transport decreases the total tke and reduces the turbulence level in the water column changes in the buoyancy production and pressure transport also cause a redistribution of energy in the shear production turbulent transport and dissipation but interestingly the stokes production barely changes i e the difference between the two experiments is so small that it is not identified visually 4 discussions and conclusion langmuir circulation lc is believed to be one of the leading causes of turbulent mixing in the upper ocean les models have been used to study lc in the upper ocean for the past two decades due to its high computational cost the les studies are usually limited to a finite domain with hundreds of meters at each horizontal direction and are not able to resolve large scale flows most of these les models for lc simulations use periodic boundary conditions in the horizontal directions that can significantly reduce computational effort however such treatment of boundary conditions has serious limitations in predicting turbulence in inhomogeneous flow fields especially in those locations that are strongly influenced by larger scale oceanic dynamical features such as fronts that can have significant impact on the dynamics and structure of the oceanic mixed layer d asaro et al 2011 the present study expands the previous les modeling investigations of langmuir turbulence to real ocean conditions with large scale environmental motion due to the strong horizontal density gradient which are commonly seen along oceanic fronts eddies and river discharge areas large scale gradient forcing lsgf is introduced to the ncar les model through the scale separation analysis the model is applied to field observations from the gulf of mexico collected in july 2016 when the measurement site was impacted by the large fresh water inflow due to flooding from the mississippi atchafalaya river system model results agree with previous studies that lc enhances turbulence in the water column and deepens the mixed layer with or without lsgf the large horizontal density gradient can reduce the mean flow in the ml it also helps to organize the langmuir cells and align the roll axis along the pressure gradient direction because the fresh water inflow causes energy consumption through an increase in the potential energy of the water column through mixing the buoyancy production is smaller and its crossover depth from positive to negative values is shallower and thus helps to stabilize the water column correspondingly more energy is transported downward through the pressure transport and the total tke is reduced and hence the turbulence level is also diminished in the water column changes in the buoyancy production and the pressure transport also cause a redistribution of the energy in the shear production turbulent transport and dissipation while the stokes production remains unchanged we think that this stabilizing effect should be present whenever a strong horizontal density gradient is present but how important this effect is depends on the dynamics of the individual situation that is examined this study is limited in many ways such as the inadequate representation of the lsgf due to the coarse temporal and vertical resolution of the temperature and salinity measurements especially the inability of the proper approximation of the large scale temperature fluctuations beneath the mixed layer significantly alters the stratification in the model compared with observations and thus limits our understanding of the mechanisms that may impact the stabilizing effect more studies are required to further understand these effects for example current study is conducted within a marginal langmuir regime with weak stokes drift so the turbulent enhancement from the surface waves are relatively weak for strong langmuir dominated regimes we would expect the stabilizing effect to be less important while small scale turbulence is very important in the dynamics and mixing of the upper ocean submesoscale features can also have significant impact on the dynamics and structure of the oceanic mixed layer although considerable research has been conducted for both processes separately our understanding on the interactions between them remains very limited due to the large spatial and temporal scale differences between these two processes our study has emphasized the importance of large scale motions on small scale turbulence which is usually assumed to be isotropic while hamlington et al 2014 simulated the spin down of a temperature front using a les model and investigated the effect of lc on submesoscale processes more studies are required to study the two way interactions between these two processes multiscale numerical algorithm proposed by malecha et al 2013 to simulate langmuir circulation dynamics at submesoscales could be a good approach for this purpose acknowledgment the authors thank dr peter sullivan for providing the les model for this study this work was funded by the office of naval research under program

24097,the along shelf momentum balance of the mid atlantic bight mab coastal ocean includes a significant contribution from the along shelf gradient in sea level this sea level tilt of order 10 7 and other features of the mean sea level are not captured well in global mean dynamic topography mdt derived from hydrographic observations or satellite altimetry and gravity data and is poorly represented in global and basin scale dynamical models this is problematic for applications that would use coastal satellite altimeter data to estimate total water level above datum we have produced a mdt for the mab using the regional ocean modeling system roms with 4 dimensional variational 4d var data assimilation configured to obtain climatological annual and monthly mean results the observations assimilated were a regional hydrographic climatology of temperature and salinity and long term mean velocity from hf radar shipboard adcp and current meters assimilation adjusts the 3 dimensional ocean state boundary conditions and air sea fluxes to minimize the model data misfit the assimilation of mean velocity data is vital to obtaining a realistic circulation result the mdt exhibits a strong across shelf sea level slope in geostrophic balance with the southwestward mean flow the subtle along shelf tilt is recovered and is relatively uniform throughout the mab inside the 50 m isobath but on the southern outer shelf it reverses sign and drives significant across isobath flow partially draining the southward mean transport in the north across shelf flow is offshore in the surface and bottom ekman layers but largely balanced locally by inflow in the interior depth range graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dynamic topography coastal circulation climatology mid atlantic bight data assimilation roms 1 introduction in applications of sea surface height observation by satellite altimetry incomplete or erroneous knowledge of the marine geoid and mean sea surface mss often demands that the long term multi decadal mean signal be subtracted from the data and that analysis proceeds working with the sea level anomaly this however also removes the mean dynamic topography mdt that arises from the geostrophic balance between sea level pressure gradient and the mean oceanic circulation and to infer absolute dynamic topography above a sea level datum and total geostrophic current mean plus variability it becomes necessary to provide an independent estimate of mdt calculations of mdt typically entail a combination of the direct approach subtracting the mss from the geoid with refinements to improve resolution and accuracy by incorporating added gravity altimetry hydrography drifter and other in situ observations maximenko et al 2009 rio et al 2011 rio et al 2014a such mdt products have enabled the widespread use of absolute dynamic topography for the analysis of ocean dynamics and as an input to mesoscale data assimilative ocean prediction systems in the open ocean progress over the past decade in extending the validity of altimeter data to within a few kilometers of the coast by the appropriate application of altimeter radar range corrections and re tracking of radar waveforms proximate to land cipollini et al 2017 vignudelli et al 2011 has opened up to coastal oceanographers the opportunity to exploit the dynamical information content of so called coastal altimeter data however in the coastal ocean where steep and variable bathymetry exacerbates uncertainty in the geoid and mss at short length scales several tens of kilometers the need to improve the precision of mdt products is acute in our region of interest the mid atlantic bight mab of the u s east coast fig 1 the cnes cls13 mdt rio et al 2014a also widely referred to as aviso mdt produced by cls space oceanography and distributed by aviso https aviso altimetry fr with support from cnes captures well the mean sea level associated with circulation in the slope sea gyre and the adjacent gulf stream chassignet and xu 2017 rio et al 2011 but in shallow water on the continental shelf there are characteristics that oceanographers familiar with the locale recognize as unrealistic these include contours of mdt strongly orthogonal to the coast suggestive of landward geostrophic flow some closed contours that imply isolated recirculation and an intense boundary current adjacent to the coast of northern virginia in contrast hydrographic observations current meters drifters and surface currents measured by hf radar codar have established that the mab shelf circulation exhibits a steady shelf wide southwestward mean along isobath flow of 5 10 cm s 1 beardsley and boicourt 1981 gong et al 2010 lentz 2008a roarty et al 2010 accordingly regional mdt should show height contours largely parallel to the bathymetry and a pronounced across shelf sea level slope these features are absent from aviso mdt analyses of the mab momentum balance lentz 2008a zhang et al 2011 have also shown that a subtle along shelf sea surface tilt of order 10 7 with sea level decreasing toward the south must be present which would amount to a 5 cm decrease in sea level from cape cod to cape hatteras it is too much to expect a global product such as aviso mdt to capture all the subtleties of coastal mean circulation in every shelf sea but nevertheless these details are vital to using coastal altimeter data in the mab therefore motivated by the desire to use these data in a regional data assimilative ocean prediction system we have produced our own local high resolution mdt for the mab the mab mdt was computed using the roms regional ocean modeling system 4 dimensional variational 4d var data assimilation da system configured to drive the solution to a steady climatological mean result the observations assimilated are velocity from hf radar long duration current meter deployments and shipboard adcp on an across shelf transect and temperature and salinity from a regional hydrographic climatology the model was forced by climatological mean river inflows and air sea fluxes with the da system adjusting the 3 dimensional 3 d ocean state boundary conditions and air sea fluxes to minimize the model data misfit the analysis was conducted for annual mean and seasonal mean conditions following standard practice in satellite altimetry mdt as we define it does not include the sea level gradient due to atmospheric pressure the mean inverted barometer effect incorporating models in the estimation of regional mdt is not entirely novel recognizing that in a da system mdt error manifests as an observation bias dobricic 2005 analyzed statistics from 3 years of simulations from the mediterranean forecast system pinardi et al 2003 to iteratively improve a regional mdt rio et al 2014b improved upon a model based prior mdt for the mediterranean sea by the inclusion of added in situ data using the model to inform the analysis of the topography of the geopotential reference surface for hydrographic profiles and to suggest correlation length scales for the mapping in a more geodetic than oceanographic analysis mazloff et al 2014 used altimeter observations and time varying dynamic topography from a da model of the california current to infer stationary errors they ascribed to uncertainties in the geoid at short wavelengths thereby subsequently decreasing geoid error to obtain a better mdt by the direct method the approach we take here differs from these efforts in that we treat mdt as a diagnostic quantity that arises when a high resolution circulation model enforces dynamical consistency and the influence of coastline and bathymetry on the flow field with data assimilation further constraining the 3 d flow to match what is known from long term observations in addition to providing an mdt for coastal altimetry in our data assimilative ocean forecast system having a self consistent 3 d temperature salinity velocity and sea level analysis allows us to make inferences about features of the regional mean circulation that go beyond idealized 2 d studies lentz 2008a zhang et al 2011 and also provides a dynamically balanced climatology suited to correcting biases in basin scale model products that we use to set the initial and boundary conditions of our regional forecast model the paper is structured as follows in section 2 we provide a brief overview of roms and its 4d var data assimilation system and follow with descriptions of the roms configuration for the mab the long term mean data sets assimilated and how we implement 4d var to compute a solution for the mean circulation section 3 presents results from a set of experiments that assimilate successively more comprehensive data sets features of the dynamic topography and 3 d ocean circulation are discussed in section 4 and outcomes are summarized in section 5 2 methods 2 1 roms model of the mab roms www myroms org is a hydrostatic boussinesq primitive equation ocean model in widespread use for coastal and mesoscale ocean applications shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2009 give a thorough review of the elements of the roms computational kernel among the features that make roms attractive for continental shelf applications are a terrain following coordinate system that can be stretched vertically to better resolve surface and bottom boundary layers and a formulation of the equation of state and the density jacobian that minimize pressure gradient truncation error in the terrain following coordinates together these enhance the representation of friction baroclinicity and the vortex stretching of flow adjacent to steep bathymetry that are fundamental to steering low frequency circulation in the coastal ocean the roms code offers three different implementations of the 4d var method for data assimilation here we use the incremental strong constraint is4dvar primal formulation moore et al 2011 moore et al 2013 weaver et al 2003 in is4dvar a tangent linear approximation to roms tl roms describes the evolution of small perturbations in the nonlinear model trajectory and the adjoint to the tangent linear model ad roms forced by perturbations proportional to the model data misfits is integrated backward in time to reveal the sensitivities of the control variables initial boundary and forcing conditions to this misfit the adjoint solution informs a gradient descent algorithm that adjusts the control variables to minimize a cost function that measures the differences between the observations and their model equivalent weighted by the observation error upon convergence the final model trajectory represents the best analysis of ocean conditions in the sense that it acknowledges all observations and their expected errors while also imposing the exact solution of the model dynamical equations over the analysis interval i e the strong constraint the domain configuration of roms used here is the same as that of the espresso experimental system for predicting shelf and slope optics real time forecast system operated by maracoos mid atlantic region coastal ocean observing system for the mab zavala garay et al 2014 the domain extends from cape hatteras to cape cod figure 1 and from the coast to beyond the shelf break with horizontal resolution of 7 km and 36 terrain following vertical levels the model has been used in numerous regional studies related to ecosystems hu et al 2012 xu et al 2013 biogeochemical cycles mannino et al

time models encompassing the mab region wilkin and hunter 2013 no model was more skillful than data assimilative espresso in capturing mab circulation in this study the surface forcing air sea heat and momentum fluxes are climatological annual or monthly means calculated from 10 years 1998 2007 of the national centers for environmental prediction ncep north american regional reanalysis narr mesinger et al 2006 coastal freshwater inputs are monthly averages of usgs river flow data adjusted for un gauged portions of the watershed open boundary conditions for temperature and salinity are from the mid atlantic bight hydrographic climatology of fleming 2016 described in the next section vertical turbulent mixing uses the k kl parameterization implemented by warner et al 2005 prior estimates of velocity and sea level open boundary conditions are assumed but these are adjusted by the assimilation analysis because this is a climatological mean analysis there are no tides a quadratic drag formulation is used to compute bottom stress which means that with the omission of tides there is the possibility that mean bottom stress is somewhat underestimated and may be one of the processes compensated for by assimilation adjustments 2 2 climatological observational data for assimilation several observational data sets have been analyzed to give mean annual and monthly estimates of roms state variables temperature salinity velocity and sea level at locations throughout the domain model while some such as temperature and salinity are in the form of a spatial analysis available at all model grid points others such as velocity from long term mooring deployments are at specific locations the 4d var system will spread the information in point observations according to assumed covariance lengths scales informed by the kinematic and dynamic equations embodied in the roms circulation model and its adjoint and weighted by respective errors in the observations and model the provenance of these data and the pre processing steps taken as described below 2 2 1 surface currents from high frequency radar a high frequency hf radar network operated by maracoos has observed surface currents in the mab since 2009 radial component data from individual radars are gridded by optimal interpolation into a 6 km resolution vector velocity product with mapping error depending on the number extent of overlap and relative direction of the individual radial current observations roarty et al 2010 in preparation for data assimilation these data were further binned to 30 km resolution but with velocities with large normalized optimal interpolation mapping errors ignored the size of the bins was chosen to provide a few super observations within the model de correlation scale of 50 km a harmonic analysis was applied to derive annual mean red arrows in fig 2 b and seasonal not shown climatological values 2 2 2 velocity from current meters numerous long term current meter cm deployments have been made in the mab over the last 35 years mostly located on the shelf but with several in the slope sea moored adcps offer good vertical resolution while other moorings might include just one or two observations in the vertical utilizing the same set of cm time series of 200 days duration or longer analyzed by lentz 2008a 2008b we computed monthly climatological means by annual cycle harmonic analysis for adcp profiles vertical binning of the data was applied in order to have similar vertical degrees of freedom in the model and observations in fig 2b current meter locations are indicated by blue dots and blue arrows depict the annual average of cm velocity at 20 m depth 2 2 3 velocity profiles from mv oleander adcp the container ship mv oleander transits from new york to bermuda monthly with an adcp instrument on board that performs autonomous collection of velocity data flagg et al 2006 rossby and gottlieb 1998 though the data are somewhat noisy and the ship track does not repeat exactly nevertheless the very large number of transects allows us to compute a useful climatological mean from data collected in 2005 2009 individual profiles were binned to equally spaced intervals along the rhumb line and in the vertical in each bin the data that fell more than two standard deviations 2 σ away from the mean were ignored to remove gulf stream ring events that would otherwise bias the mean flagg et al 2006 harmonic analysis was then performed to obtain monthly climatological profiles of velocity from 35 m to 400 m depth the magenta arrows in fig 2b illustrate the 35 m depth annual currents these data are the only such direct observational estimate of mean currents in the slope sea 2 2 4 velocity profiles from line w moored adcp the line w program was a long term study combining moorings and shipboard observations to investigate the deep limb of the atlantic meridional overturning circulation toole et al 2011 vertical profiles of the mean and annual cycle of velocity extracted from data collected at 4 moorings during 2001 2009 green arrows in fig 2b were assimilated in the model 2 2 5 sea surface height anomaly from jason altimeter the topex jason series of radar altimeter satellites measure sea surface height ssh along 6 ground tracks that traverse the espresso domain data that would ordinarily be rejected by conventional quality control of altimetry in coastal regimes can be reclaimed by judicious application of the data error flags and revised wet tropospheric radar range corrections feng and vandemark 2011 we extracted 1 hz along track approximately 6 km interval jason 1 and jason 2 data from the radar altimeter database system rads rads tudelft nl for 2006 2012 making range and geophysical corrections to retain data close to land up to the 25 m isobath standard altimetry corrections were applied to remove tides the inverted barometer effect and other high frequency sea level variability these data were averaged in 20 km along track bins and a 3 month running mean time filter applied outliers based on a 2 σ criterion were removed harmonic analysis was performed on the remaining observations to obtain the climatological seasonal cycle of ssh anomaly ssha fig 2c 2 2 6 temperature and salinity climatology a dataset of hydrographic observations in the mab drawn from the world ocean database wod boyer et al 2009 and augmented by ctd data from the noaa northeast fisheries science center nefsc and inner shelf ctd observations acquired by maracoos institutions has been mapped to an equal angle 0 05 grid 5 km on 57 standard depths by fleming 2016 using an adaptation of the weighted least squares method of ridgway et al 2002 this gridded monthly climatology mocha mid atlantic ocean climatological hydrographic analysis was interpolated to the espresso model grid for assimilation and adjusted to remove any statically unstable vertical profiles for illustration figure 2a shows mocha mean surface temperature other features of the mocha subsurface temperature analysis are shown in the left hand panels of fig 3 and are discussed in section 3 2 3 climatological 4d var assimilation methodology 2 3 1 prior model estimate creating an unbiased prior model estimate greatly assists the success of data assimilation we accomplished this in a sequence of distinct steps in the first step the roms espresso model configuration described in section 2 1 was run 12 times once for each month initialized with mocha temperature and salinity and forced by the respective monthly climatological air sea fluxes and river inflows held constant boundary sea level and velocity were taken from averages of the 2006 2012 daily analyses of the 1 12 resolution global hycom ncoda data assimilative model chassignet et al 2009 cummings 2005 these simulations were run for a period brief enough to let initial transients dissipate and for the velocity and sea level to approach dynamic equilibrium without allowing temperature and salinity to deviate too much from the climatology for summer months this adjustment was largely complete within a week so we averaged the second week of a 2 week simulation to obtain a prior estimate for those months for winter months this approach did not converge satisfactorily with unrealistically large currents arising at the shelf break during the dynamic adjustment so instead each winter month was initialized with mocha from the prior month then run changing the boundary conditions and surface forcing gradually over 45 days with the average of the last 30 days of simulation retained as a monthly estimate next these initial 12 estimates were averaged to produce a prior solution for an is4dvar analysis that assimilated the annual mean climatology data sets described in section 2 2 the final step was to re run the 12 climatological monthly forward model runs replacing hycom ncoda sea level and velocity open boundary and initial conditions with the annual mean adjusted values this was done in order to have a better balance between all the fields at initialization of the forward model this approach is admittedly ad hoc but it should be recalled that the objective is merely to obtain a reasonable first guess to be adjusted subsequently by data assimilation 2 3 2 error hypothesis is4dvar requires a prior estimate of the model background error covariance for initial boundary and air sea forcing conditions we specify these as a univariate correlation matrix scaled by standard deviations and spatial decorrelation scales estimated from the mesoscale variability in a multi year forward run i e no da of espresso the standard deviation in surface fluxes was halved to achieve better stability in the assimilation the initial condition error de correlation scale is 50 km in the horizontal and 50 m in the vertical boundary condition de correlation scale is 100 km in the horizontal and 100 m in the vertical surface forcing de correlation scale is 100 km an estimate of the observation errors is also required but this is a difficult choice for averaged climatological data sets observational errors should be small enough to keep the model as close as possible to a steady climatological solution yet large enough to allow the minimization algorithm to converge to a dynamically balanced solution we chose to set observational error for temperature and salinity to be 1 3 of the assumed model background error at the surface and to increase this to the mean model error over 150 m depth adjacent to the continental slope the error estimate for climatological temperature and salinity was elevated to prevent reintroducing unphysical currents near the shelf break velocity and ssh observational errors were set proportional to the standard deviation within each of the spatial averaging bins described above scaled to make the mean of the errors equal to the 1 10 of the mean model background standard deviation at the corresponding observation locations 2 3 3 analysis procedure is4dvar iterates forward and backward in time within an analysis interval here we use 2 days since we seek a steady climatological result time evolution of the solution over the interval is penalized by repeating the observations numerous times within the assimilation window temperature and salinity observations are repeated every 4 hours while velocity and ssh are repeated every 30 minutes an average of the converged model solution over the assimilation window becomes the completed analysis model data misfit decreased when boundary conditions and surface forcing were added to the control variable set in addition to the model initial conditions in particular adjusting the surface flux was instrumental in better fitting observations in the surface mixed layer although the surface wind stress and heat flux after assimilation were not particularly realistic adjustment of boundary conditions did not substantially improve the assimilation results we are not solving the time averaged roms governing equations by this approach and strictly speaking there is therefore a conceptual error in the dynamical model in strong constraint assimilation there is no explicit account of model errors that would require a weak constraint formulation sasaki 1970 by seeking initial and forcing conditions that pull the solution of the nonlinear model toward a steady model trajectory over the analysis window we are not allowing for the residual time trend that would be a small but non zero term in the monthly averaged dynamical equations this is clearly a shortcoming of our model design but a more precise configuration would require a time averaging observation operator in adjoint roms and a complete implementation of weak constraint assimilation such as the representer method of bennett 2002 these features are not presently available to us in roms 4dvar the improved outcome when surface fluxes are adjusted perhaps reflects that the climatological model set up needs the opportunity to accommodate model error and diverts this somewhat erroneously to adjusting the surface forcing we acknowledge this methodology is heuristic so should be judged by its ability to deliver a useful solution for the intended purpose namely computing 3 d ocean circulation analyses that are in near dynamic balance steered by coastal bathymetry and close to observed features of the long term mean ocean state where those are available this evaluation is the subject of section 3 where we contrast the results from assimilation experiments with successively more comprehensive observational constraints 2 3 4 three different assimilation experiments to test the relative influence of various types of observations for constraining climatological circulation several different monthly assimilation experiments were conducted in all cases initial and boundary conditions monthly surface forcing and monthly average observational data as described above were used in the first experiment denoted roms ts only the temperature and salinity climatology from mocha was assimilated in the second experiment we started with the same set of prior solutions as before but in addition to temperature and salinity we assimilated velocity from hf radar moored cm and oleander adcp this is experiment roms tsv these two experiments examine how well climatological in situ observations constrain the circulation in the absence of satellite based ssh climatology roms is4dvar requires observations that correspond to model state variables and therefore we cannot readily assimilate anomaly ssh because roms sea level is effectively absolute dynamic topography mdt included however since roms tsv provides an mdt estimate we add this to monthly jason ssh anomaly data and conduct a third assimilation experiment denoting this case as roms tsvh 3 results 3 1 roms ts and roms tsv results 3 1 1 annual mean and seasonal temperature fig 3 shows aspects of the mocha temperature climatology the roms tsv analysis and their difference views include winter top row and summer second ro bottom temperature on the shelf highlighting a well defined summertime subsurface cold pool houghton et al 1982 of waters less that 9 c on the shelf to characterize the overall pattern of vertical and across shelf stratification along isobath average winter and summer temperature for the shelf and slope are shown in the lower panels of fig 3 for northern and southern sub regions defined in fig 2a that echo quasi 2d climatological dynamical analyses of the mab lentz 2008a linder and gawarkiewicz 1998 temperature in the roms ts experiment not shown has a slightly better fit than in roms tsv but both fit the climatological temperature and salinity well as is to be expected since the data were assimilated the adjusted bottom temperature departure from climatology is greatest in the summer when the vertical decorrelation scale in the background error causes some loss of the sharp summer thermocline that is resolved well by the fine standard depth resolution in mocha in addition to the strong vertical thermal stratification and subsurface cold pool on the shelf the assimilation retains the bowl of warm subtropical water offshore in the slope sea the largest deviation from climatology occurs at the shelf break where the assimilation adjusts temperature and salinity to introduce more steeply sloping isotherms in accordance with the dynamics of the shelf break front 3 1 2 annual mean velocity while roms ts and tsv experiments are similar in terms of temperature and salinity they differ somewhat in their estimates of velocity fig 4 shows along shelf depth average velocity as a function of ocean depth in roms ts and tsv experiments grouped by northern and southern sub regions of the mab defined in fig 2a values in the estuaries and bays are not plotted and compared to values estimated by lentz 2008a from current meters on the shelf inshore of the 100 m isobath model depth averaged along shelf velocity is in reasonable agreement with current meter data in the northern mab but somewhat less so in the southern mab however it should be noted that the small dots in fig 4 are distributed throughout the shelf and the handful of current meter deployments from which depth averaged velocity was estimated may not be representative of the model spread model currents increase with water depth with a regression slope of 0 08 cm s 1 m 1 and an intercept of 1 2 cm s 1 values that are close to 0 07 cm s 1 m 1 and 1 8cm s 1 respectively that lentz 2008a estimated from cm data surface currents on the shelf are fit well in both experiments fig 5 depth average and surface currents in roms tsv are slightly closer to the observations by virtue of their being assimilated the assimilation of velocity data has moderate impact on the inner shelf but tends to decelerate the along shelf current on the outer shelf and near the shelf break in deeper water beyond the shelf break there are no observations over the full water column to constrain depth average velocity but limited surface current data from hf radar in the southern mab and upper water column data from oleander adcp show that with assimilation the flow is accelerated along the continental slope water depths 100 400 m and decelerated in the deep slope sea water depths 1000 m to bring roms tsv into better agreement with the observations these influences of the velocity assimilation are also evident in fig 5 which presents a map view of the surface current observations model results and their difference in roms ts the surface flow in the central mab is too fast and too strongly aligned with isobaths in roms tsv assimilation of hf radar and current meter observations is helpful in turning the surface flow offshore while assimilation of oleander data is instrumental in making the flow more uniform throughout the slope sea in the far southern mab the along shelf flow weakens in roms ts when in fact the convergence of isobaths sustains the strong current there even as much of the transport turns offshore assimilation restores the magnitude of the current on the shelf as the flow approaches cape hatteras the root mean square error between model and all velocity observations decreases from 0 049 m s 1 in roms ts to 0 031 m s 1 in roms tsv and 0 025 m s 1 in roms tsvh the vertical structure of velocity is shown in fig 6 where again the solution is averaged along isobaths and plotted as a function of water column depth in water shallower than 100 m both solutions show southwestward flow out of the page that intensifies moving seaward from the coast to the shelf break in roms ts fig 6 top row there is a reversal of the along shelf bottom flow immediately beyond the shelf break near 150 m water depth that we believe to be unrealistic this erroneous northward flow occurs throughout the mab but is most pronounced in the southwest where it allows the gulf stream to encroach onto the southern mab shelf when velocity data are assimilated in roms tsv fig 6 bottom row this undercurrent is greatly diminished the adjustment of roms tsv to show weaker northward flow at the seafloor at the 150 m isobath is accompanied by local strengthening of the surface current this suggests the vertical velocity shear and hence thermal wind density gradient are not appreciably altered and that 4dvar has accommodated the added velocity data by modifying the sea level gradient over the upper 400 m of the water column where oleander data are present the roms tsv comparison naturally improves and these changes in velocity propagate into the deeper slope sea it has been suggested lentz 2008a zhang et al 2011 that the across shelf circulation in the mab has a two layer structure in the inner shelf with offshore flow at the surface and on shore flow below and a three layer structure in the outer shelf with offshore flow at the surface and bottom and on shore at mid depths the presence of a mean geostrophic on shore flow at mid depths demands there be an along shelf pressure force due largely to a sloping sea level the right column in fig 6 shows the along isobath averaged across shelf velocity and along shelf pressure force expressed in terms of an equivalent sea level gradient when assimilating temperature and salinity alone roms ts the model did not generate significant across shelf flow in the inner shelf and on the outer shelf the across shelf circulation was rather weak in roms tsv we recover the across shore circulation in the inner and outer shelves as described by lentz 2008a and zhang et al 2011 on the inner shelf the model has 0 5 cm s 1 offshore surface currents weak on shore flow and upwelling through the water column on the outer shelf the across shelf flow increases to 1 cm s 1 at the surface 0 2 cm s 1 on shore through the mid depth range with weak down welling and 2 cm s 1 off shore in the bottom ekman layer upwelling of about 0 01 mm s 1 is reported in the inner portion of shelf break between 100 m and 1000 m isobaths which is consistent with the results of zhang et al 2011 in conjunction with the strenghtened across shore circulation there is an increase in along shore pressure gradient consistent with lentz result that this force is significant in the along shelf momentum balance 3 1 3 seasonal cycle of velocity the seasonal cycle of near surface velocity is shown in fig 7 in the form of ellipses computed by harmonic analysis for both the model and observational monthly fields and plotted at the observation locations while velocity data from the various observational platforms agree reasonably well with each other in the annual mean fig 5a there are some considerable differences between platforms in seasonal variability fig 7a current meter data show the largest amplitude of seasonal variability 5 cm s 1 hf radar observes smaller seasonal change of about 1 to 5 cm s 1 with the largest variability close to the coast seasonal variability is greatest toward the south near chesapeake bay and cape hatteras the magnitude of oleander seasonal variability on the shelf agrees with hf radar but is out of phase with it note that hf radar captures the flow at 2 m depth ullman et al 2006 whereas the shallowest reliable oleander adcp range bin is 35 m below the sea surface in the slope sea oleander exhibits larger variability up to 15 cm s 1 there are insufficient data at line w to obtain a meaningful seasonal cycle the seasonal variability of velocity in roms ts is not particularly realistic with large 20 cm s 1 discrepancies in the southern mab fig 7b this is unsurprising given that only temperature and salinity are assimilated and serves to emphasize that a diversity of observation types is required for effective multi variable state estimation by data assimilation the seasonal cycle in roms tsv fig 7c is much more similar to the observations but still with some differences in particular while trying to fit the two somewhat conflicting hf radar and near surface cm data sets the model has practically ignored the seasonal cycle in the cm in favor of hf radar seasonal cycle in the slope sea where oleander is the only source of data the model fits the observed seasonal cycle well this apparent preference of hf radar over coincident cm data may indicate imperfect observation error estimates that give excessive relative weight to hf radar or an imperfect background error model with overly long vertical covariance scale that connects velocity in the mixed layer to the underlying flow when these are in fact largely decoupled 3 1 4 mean dynamic topography and seasonal ssha variability the roms tsv solution gave an annual mean velocity and temperature analysis that compared well with the data in most of the domain and was constrained by roms model physics the corresponding model sea level solution represents an mdt that is dynamically consistent with the other fields and whose estimation is a key objective of our assimilation project comparing the roms mdt results to the independent aviso mdt fig 8 we see that model and aviso are broadly similar in the slope sea and gulf stream some modest variation between the two is to be expected because of the different methods used but also because aviso is based on hydrographic and drifter data from 1993 2012 whereas our solution uses hydrographic climatology for which 50 of the data were acquired before 1993 fleming 2016 to attempt an mdt analysis based strictly on observations acquired in the topex jason altimeter era we would also have to exclude more than half the moored current meter velocity data and for most of the mab hf radar data are available only in the last 5 years of the 1992 2012 period though the two mdts are similar offshore they differ dramatically on the shelf where the majority of velocity observations are located and where bathymetry and coastline strongly steer the flow assimilation of temperature and salinity provides information crucial to determining details of the mdt in the slope sea and in the gulf stream while velocity data add additional constraints on the shelf and upstream of the oleander line the strong constraint of the data assimilation introduces dynamically sensible mdt on the shelf the shelf sea level pattern is characterized by a steep across shelf slope of some 10 cm in 100 km that is quite uniform throughout the mab and which is consistent with the predominantly geostrophic balance of the mean along shelf flow lentz 2008a the amplitude and phase of seasonal sea level variability is shown in fig 9 which may be compared to jason ssha data in fig 2c variability in the slope sea is associated with a slow seasonal meander of the gulf stream but since this is close to the model boundary we do not put great faith in the result of more interest is the continental shelf where in the northern mab variation over the year is about 4 cm with a maximum in winter though the comparison to jason suggests the amplitude of variability may be underestimated in the southern mab there is little variability at all in the roms tsv results in terms of phase along track altimetry data agree with the roms ts and tsv solutions in the slope sea and the northern and central mab shelf but disagree in the southern mab and in the gulf stream area the roms ts solution suggests that the fit between modeled and observed ssha comes mostly from assimilating temperature and salinity the added assimilation of velocity data only improves the phase of the sea level cycle in the central and northern mab to bring modeled sea level variability into better agreement with satellite ssha we add altimeter data into the monthly assimilation analyses in the next experiment 3 2 assimilation of altimeter along track ssha thus far we have not assimilated satellite altimeter ssha data because we need to know mdt in order to formulate observations mdt ssha that correspond to the roms sea level state variable aviso mdt is unsatisfactory for this purpose on the shelf however we now have a good estimate of mdt from the roms tsv solution so we have conducted a further set of monthly assimilation experiments in which mdt added to jason ssha comprise a set of ssh observations to augment the suite of temperature salinity and velocity data we denote this set of monthly assimilations as roms tsvh all other parameters of the assimilation are kept the same changes with the addition of altimetry are not dramatic but they are consistently an improvement with ssh assimilation the modeled amplitude and phase of the seasonal cycle of sea level variability in the southern slope sea and southern mab shelf fig 9c is brought into agreement with observations as are the seasonal velocity ellipses in the central slope sea as observed by oleander but there is no significant change for better or worse in the variability in the northern mab nor overall are there any significant changes in the mean velocity fit figs 5f and 5g differ little and we retain the mdt from roms tsv as our best estimate of annual mean ocean conditions in the mab 4 features of the mean ocean circulation in the mab as we have noted earlier 2 d studies lentz 2008a linder and gawarkiewicz 1998 zhang et al 2011 have characterized across shelf circulation on the outer shelf as being predominantly offshore in the surface and bottom ekman layers with compensating on shore flow in a geostrophic interior in the full 3 d case these transports need not balance locally but may instead be matched by divergence of the along shelf transport using the annual mean result of the roms tsv experiment we examine how transports vary spatially along shelf we computed the across isobath component of flow by taking the inner product of the velocity with the gradient of bathymetry normalized to a unit vector i e h h a simple 9 point 2 d triangular filter was applied to the depth h prior to computing h to suppress noisiness in the calculation arising from depth variations on length scales of order 20 km or less the calculation was made separately for flow at the sea surface at the bottom and vertically averaged over the portion of the water column from 5 m below surface to 5 m above the seafloor so as to exclude boundary layer circulation from the mid depths result the across shore component of current is depicted by color shading in fig 10 with warm cool colors indicating offshore onshore flow arrows show the vector velocity in each layer average color coded by the sense of the across shore component for emphasis only vectors for every 3rd model cell are plotted but the color shading shows that patterns are coherent on length scales spanning several grid cells in accord with the 2 d studies there is a preponderance of offshore flow in the boundary layers and onshore flow in the interior but there is considerable local variability in the sense of the across isobath flow as the circulation wends its way southwestward throughout the mab some trends emerge in this spatial variability if we focus on the flow at an isobath on the outer shelf fig 11 shows conditions along a path coinciding with the 65 m isobath bracketed by across shelf transects that connect the isobath to the coast fig 11c therefore depicts across shelf flow where the transect follows the isobath but is augmented with strong along shelf flows that are into and out of the control volume at the two ends of the transect these saturate the color bar so contours of 0 05 and 0 075 m s 1 are added the abscissa of fig 11a c e is distance from the southern end of the path with green markers corresponding to those in fig 11b that delineate 3 southern central and northern sub regions that are averaged in fig 11d f in the surface and bottom boundary layers flow is offshore at the 65 m isobath throughout the mab but to varying intensity the interior flow is quite barotropic consistent with lentz 2008a assertion that following an isobath there is insufficient along shelf variation in density to sustain a thermal wind vertical shear in the across shelf current rather geostrophic balance of the across shelf interior flow must be achieved with an along shelf tilt to the sea level this across shelf interior flow is not consistently onshore as might be supposed from the 2 d studies but changes sign frequently as the flow gently meanders across isobaths to quantify this we plot depth integrated transport streamfunction along the section in fig 11c there is a net inflow of 0 136 sv through the northern end section and outflow of 0 109 sv at the southern extremity between these limits there is convergence and divergence of the across isobath flow that accumulates to the moderate net loss of 0 03 sv or 20 of the northern inflow considering averages in three approximately 200 km long sub sections fig 11d f we see that the northern and central sectors are indeed lentz like there is outflow in the boundary layers and inflow in the central water column and these are approximately volume conserving inspect the values of streamfunction at the green markers in fig 11c the along shelf current fig 11e is everywhere southward but accelerates as the flow moves toward the southern end of the 65 m isobath section because this flow reaches the seafloor it drives increasingly strong offshore transport in the bottom ekman layer in the southern sector fig 11d but the greatest difference compared to the northern sub sectors is that the interior flow is now directed offshore at all depths this is a region of significant leakage of the southward volume flux to deeper offshore waters whereas the north is not these features of the circulation are not peculiar to the 65 m isobath in fig 10b we see that anomalously onshore and offshore flow is organized into largely across shelf coherent bands indicating that where the current meanders horizontally it does so in an across shelf coordinated fashion we speculate that this meandering is the response of the depth integrated flow to vortex stretching induced by variations in the bathymetry on along shelf scales that are too short for the depth integrated potential vorticity to have adjusted so as to remain parallel to isobaths exploring this conjecture would best be pursued by analysis of a freely running model constrained by our mean solution only as open boundary conditions and unencumbered by data assimilation that upsets exact closure of the time averaged momentum and vorticity equations a change in along shelf dynamical balance that contributes to this offshore flow on the southern outer shelf becomes apparent if we plot mdt following selected isobaths fig 12 a positive slope indicates sea level is increasing toward the north on the inner and mid shelf 35 m and 50 m isobath sea level slopes of 4 5 5 6 10 8 are only moderately higher than the value 3 7 10 8 estimated by lentz 2008a which his conceptual model assumed to be spatially uniform however we find that in the southern mab seaward of the 50 m isobath there is a marked change in sea level tilt such that it opposes the southward current on the outer shelf even inside the 50 m isobath there is a local reversal in tilt before the slope continues its decrease approaching cape hatteras it is difficult to discern in fig 10b because the isobaths are so close in this part of the shelf but the flow in this region is consistently directed offshore at all depths if this sea level gradient were balanced by a uniform barotropic across shelf geostrophic flow it would drive 0 07 sv of offshore transport across the 65 m isobath in the southern sub region in fig 11c which unsurprisingly is very close to the volume loss in this sector suggested by the streamfunction calculation returning to the matter of across shelf variation in the along shelf sea level tilt our results are at odds with the idealized 2 d modeling study of zhang et al 2011 that suggested this tilt increases dramatically approaching the coast reaching as much as 1 3 10 7 in the annual mean whereas we see only one third this magnitude recalling that lentz 2008a assumed no across shelf variation in slope and focusing on the more lentz like northern mab where the mass balance appears to be approximately 2 d we actually see a modest increase table 1 in the along shelf sea level slope going from mid shelf 35 m isobath to the outer shelf however a clear point of agreement with zhang et al 2011 is a pronounced seasonal cycle in the sea level tilt greatest in winter and least in summer though the seasonal transitions correspond less well this being a regional diagnostic analysis we are none the wiser as to the dynamical origins of this variability 5 summary we have presented a mean 3 dimensional circulation analysis for the mid atlantic bight computed by variational data assimilation in a regional ocean model the data assimilated comprise climatological monthly mean ocean state conditions temperature salinity velocity and sea level anomaly derived from historical observations from all available platforms in the region the analysis was conducted for annual mean and monthly climatological mean conditions in the latter case the seasonal cycle in satellite altimeter sea surface height anomaly was included as a further data constraint exploiting the mean sea level estimate from the initial data assimilative analysis the model was forced by climatological mean river inflows and air sea fluxes but with the data assimilation system adjusting the latter in addition to the 3 d ocean state itself to further minimize the model data misfit by employing a strong constraint formulation of the assimilation algorithm the final state estimate is dynamically and kinematically constrained i e it satisfies the governing equations of continuity momentum temperature and salt conservation and the confines that bathymetry and coastline exert on the circulation a key motivation for this study was to compute a regional mdt that improved upon standard global products used in the satellite altimeter community this is to enable calculation of absolute sea level above datum as the sum of mdt and satellite observed sea level anomaly with respect to a mean sea surface the mss having been removed to circumvent uncertainties in the marine geoid at short length scales our mdt from the mean of the roms tsv experiment successfully remedies several conspicuous shortcomings in aviso mdt and in so doing exhibits features of the mean sea level that are required for consistency with well known observed aspects of the regional circulation notably contours of constant mdt shoreward of the shelf break now closely parallel isobaths recognizing that bathymetry strongly steers the depth integrated currents an along shelf sea level slope of approximately 0 5 10 7 is a ubiquitous feature of mid shelf waters in agreement with previous 2 d idealized studies that note this term is significant in the along shelf momentum balance on the northern outer shelf the sea level slope is moderately steeper but in the southern mab it reverses sign altogether which contributes to driving across isobath flow that partially drains the southwestward mean flow on the shelf despite this adverse pressure gradient the along shelf current steadily accelerates toward the south driving increasing offshore transport in the bottom ekman layer nevertheless the majority of along shelf transport still remains on the shelf continuing southward until it makes an abrupt turn seaward immediately north of cape hatteras the analysis has thus added quantitative 3 dimensional detail to our view of the mean circulation in the mab that was previously based principally on 2 d idealized or spatially localized studies or on forward modeling studies that were largely unconstrained by historical observations the analyzed mdt from the roms tsv experiment is now being used in conjunction with coastal altimeter data to routinely assimilate those observations in the espresso near real forecast system operated by maracoos the mdt 3 d velocity analysis and mocha hydrographic atlas are also being used as a dynamically self consistent ocean state climatology to adjust biases in sea level velocity temperature and salinity from global operational modeling systems before they are used as open boundary conditions data to the regional forecast system acknowledgments this work was supported by the nasa ocean surface topography science team and noaa integrated ocean observing

24097,the along shelf momentum balance of the mid atlantic bight mab coastal ocean includes a significant contribution from the along shelf gradient in sea level this sea level tilt of order 10 7 and other features of the mean sea level are not captured well in global mean dynamic topography mdt derived from hydrographic observations or satellite altimetry and gravity data and is poorly represented in global and basin scale dynamical models this is problematic for applications that would use coastal satellite altimeter data to estimate total water level above datum we have produced a mdt for the mab using the regional ocean modeling system roms with 4 dimensional variational 4d var data assimilation configured to obtain climatological annual and monthly mean results the observations assimilated were a regional hydrographic climatology of temperature and salinity and long term mean velocity from hf radar shipboard adcp and current meters assimilation adjusts the 3 dimensional ocean state boundary conditions and air sea fluxes to minimize the model data misfit the assimilation of mean velocity data is vital to obtaining a realistic circulation result the mdt exhibits a strong across shelf sea level slope in geostrophic balance with the southwestward mean flow the subtle along shelf tilt is recovered and is relatively uniform throughout the mab inside the 50 m isobath but on the southern outer shelf it reverses sign and drives significant across isobath flow partially draining the southward mean transport in the north across shelf flow is offshore in the surface and bottom ekman layers but largely balanced locally by inflow in the interior depth range graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dynamic topography coastal circulation climatology mid atlantic bight data assimilation roms 1 introduction in applications of sea surface height observation by satellite altimetry incomplete or erroneous knowledge of the marine geoid and mean sea surface mss often demands that the long term multi decadal mean signal be subtracted from the data and that analysis proceeds working with the sea level anomaly this however also removes the mean dynamic topography mdt that arises from the geostrophic balance between sea level pressure gradient and the mean oceanic circulation and to infer absolute dynamic topography above a sea level datum and total geostrophic current mean plus variability it becomes necessary to provide an independent estimate of mdt calculations of mdt typically entail a combination of the direct approach subtracting the mss from the geoid with refinements to improve resolution and accuracy by incorporating added gravity altimetry hydrography drifter and other in situ observations maximenko et al 2009 rio et al 2011 rio et al 2014a such mdt products have enabled the widespread use of absolute dynamic topography for the analysis of ocean dynamics and as an input to mesoscale data assimilative ocean prediction systems in the open ocean progress over the past decade in extending the validity of altimeter data to within a few kilometers of the coast by the appropriate application of altimeter radar range corrections and re tracking of radar waveforms proximate to land cipollini et al 2017 vignudelli et al 2011 has opened up to coastal oceanographers the opportunity to exploit the dynamical information content of so called coastal altimeter data however in the coastal ocean where steep and variable bathymetry exacerbates uncertainty in the geoid and mss at short length scales several tens of kilometers the need to improve the precision of mdt products is acute in our region of interest the mid atlantic bight mab of the u s east coast fig 1 the cnes cls13 mdt rio et al 2014a also widely referred to as aviso mdt produced by cls space oceanography and distributed by aviso https aviso altimetry fr with support from cnes captures well the mean sea level associated with circulation in the slope sea gyre and the adjacent gulf stream chassignet and xu 2017 rio et al 2011 but in shallow water on the continental shelf there are characteristics that oceanographers familiar with the locale recognize as unrealistic these include contours of mdt strongly orthogonal to the coast suggestive of landward geostrophic flow some closed contours that imply isolated recirculation and an intense boundary current adjacent to the coast of northern virginia in contrast hydrographic observations current meters drifters and surface currents measured by hf radar codar have established that the mab shelf circulation exhibits a steady shelf wide southwestward mean along isobath flow of 5 10 cm s 1 beardsley and boicourt 1981 gong et al 2010 lentz 2008a roarty et al 2010 accordingly regional mdt should show height contours largely parallel to the bathymetry and a pronounced across shelf sea level slope these features are absent from aviso mdt analyses of the mab momentum balance lentz 2008a zhang et al 2011 have also shown that a subtle along shelf sea surface tilt of order 10 7 with sea level decreasing toward the south must be present which would amount to a 5 cm decrease in sea level from cape cod to cape hatteras it is too much to expect a global product such as aviso mdt to capture all the subtleties of coastal mean circulation in every shelf sea but nevertheless these details are vital to using coastal altimeter data in the mab therefore motivated by the desire to use these data in a regional data assimilative ocean prediction system we have produced our own local high resolution mdt for the mab the mab mdt was computed using the roms regional ocean modeling system 4 dimensional variational 4d var data assimilation da system configured to drive the solution to a steady climatological mean result the observations assimilated are velocity from hf radar long duration current meter deployments and shipboard adcp on an across shelf transect and temperature and salinity from a regional hydrographic climatology the model was forced by climatological mean river inflows and air sea fluxes with the da system adjusting the 3 dimensional 3 d ocean state boundary conditions and air sea fluxes to minimize the model data misfit the analysis was conducted for annual mean and seasonal mean conditions following standard practice in satellite altimetry mdt as we define it does not include the sea level gradient due to atmospheric pressure the mean inverted barometer effect incorporating models in the estimation of regional mdt is not entirely novel recognizing that in a da system mdt error manifests as an observation bias dobricic 2005 analyzed statistics from 3 years of simulations from the mediterranean forecast system pinardi et al 2003 to iteratively improve a regional mdt rio et al 2014b improved upon a model based prior mdt for the mediterranean sea by the inclusion of added in situ data using the model to inform the analysis of the topography of the geopotential reference surface for hydrographic profiles and to suggest correlation length scales for the mapping in a more geodetic than oceanographic analysis mazloff et al 2014 used altimeter observations and time varying dynamic topography from a da model of the california current to infer stationary errors they ascribed to uncertainties in the geoid at short wavelengths thereby subsequently decreasing geoid error to obtain a better mdt by the direct method the approach we take here differs from these efforts in that we treat mdt as a diagnostic quantity that arises when a high resolution circulation model enforces dynamical consistency and the influence of coastline and bathymetry on the flow field with data assimilation further constraining the 3 d flow to match what is known from long term observations in addition to providing an mdt for coastal altimetry in our data assimilative ocean forecast system having a self consistent 3 d temperature salinity velocity and sea level analysis allows us to make inferences about features of the regional mean circulation that go beyond idealized 2 d studies lentz 2008a zhang et al 2011 and also provides a dynamically balanced climatology suited to correcting biases in basin scale model products that we use to set the initial and boundary conditions of our regional forecast model the paper is structured as follows in section 2 we provide a brief overview of roms and its 4d var data assimilation system and follow with descriptions of the roms configuration for the mab the long term mean data sets assimilated and how we implement 4d var to compute a solution for the mean circulation section 3 presents results from a set of experiments that assimilate successively more comprehensive data sets features of the dynamic topography and 3 d ocean circulation are discussed in section 4 and outcomes are summarized in section 5 2 methods 2 1 roms model of the mab roms www myroms org is a hydrostatic boussinesq primitive equation ocean model in widespread use for coastal and mesoscale ocean applications shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2009 give a thorough review of the elements of the roms computational kernel among the features that make roms attractive for continental shelf applications are a terrain following coordinate system that can be stretched vertically to better resolve surface and bottom boundary layers and a formulation of the equation of state and the density jacobian that minimize pressure gradient truncation error in the terrain following coordinates together these enhance the representation of friction baroclinicity and the vortex stretching of flow adjacent to steep bathymetry that are fundamental to steering low frequency circulation in the coastal ocean the roms code offers three different implementations of the 4d var method for data assimilation here we use the incremental strong constraint is4dvar primal formulation moore et al 2011 moore et al 2013 weaver et al 2003 in is4dvar a tangent linear approximation to roms tl roms describes the evolution of small perturbations in the nonlinear model trajectory and the adjoint to the tangent linear model ad roms forced by perturbations proportional to the model data misfits is integrated backward in time to reveal the sensitivities of the control variables initial boundary and forcing conditions to this misfit the adjoint solution informs a gradient descent algorithm that adjusts the control variables to minimize a cost function that measures the differences between the observations and their model equivalent weighted by the observation error upon convergence the final model trajectory represents the best analysis of ocean conditions in the sense that it acknowledges all observations and their expected errors while also imposing the exact solution of the model dynamical equations over the analysis interval i e the strong constraint the domain configuration of roms used here is the same as that of the espresso experimental system for predicting shelf and slope optics real time forecast system operated by maracoos mid atlantic region coastal ocean observing system for the mab zavala garay et al 2014 the domain extends from cape hatteras to cape cod figure 1 and from the coast to beyond the shelf break with horizontal resolution of 7 km and 36 terrain following vertical levels the model has been used in numerous regional studies related to ecosystems hu et al 2012 xu et al 2013 biogeochemical cycles mannino et al

time models encompassing the mab region wilkin and hunter 2013 no model was more skillful than data assimilative espresso in capturing mab circulation in this study the surface forcing air sea heat and momentum fluxes are climatological annual or monthly means calculated from 10 years 1998 2007 of the national centers for environmental prediction ncep north american regional reanalysis narr mesinger et al 2006 coastal freshwater inputs are monthly averages of usgs river flow data adjusted for un gauged portions of the watershed open boundary conditions for temperature and salinity are from the mid atlantic bight hydrographic climatology of fleming 2016 described in the next section vertical turbulent mixing uses the k kl parameterization implemented by warner et al 2005 prior estimates of velocity and sea level open boundary conditions are assumed but these are adjusted by the assimilation analysis because this is a climatological mean analysis there are no tides a quadratic drag formulation is used to compute bottom stress which means that with the omission of tides there is the possibility that mean bottom stress is somewhat underestimated and may be one of the processes compensated for by assimilation adjustments 2 2 climatological observational data for assimilation several observational data sets have been analyzed to give mean annual and monthly estimates of roms state variables temperature salinity velocity and sea level at locations throughout the domain model while some such as temperature and salinity are in the form of a spatial analysis available at all model grid points others such as velocity from long term mooring deployments are at specific locations the 4d var system will spread the information in point observations according to assumed covariance lengths scales informed by the kinematic and dynamic equations embodied in the roms circulation model and its adjoint and weighted by respective errors in the observations and model the provenance of these data and the pre processing steps taken as described below 2 2 1 surface currents from high frequency radar a high frequency hf radar network operated by maracoos has observed surface currents in the mab since 2009 radial component data from individual radars are gridded by optimal interpolation into a 6 km resolution vector velocity product with mapping error depending on the number extent of overlap and relative direction of the individual radial current observations roarty et al 2010 in preparation for data assimilation these data were further binned to 30 km resolution but with velocities with large normalized optimal interpolation mapping errors ignored the size of the bins was chosen to provide a few super observations within the model de correlation scale of 50 km a harmonic analysis was applied to derive annual mean red arrows in fig 2 b and seasonal not shown climatological values 2 2 2 velocity from current meters numerous long term current meter cm deployments have been made in the mab over the last 35 years mostly located on the shelf but with several in the slope sea moored adcps offer good vertical resolution while other moorings might include just one or two observations in the vertical utilizing the same set of cm time series of 200 days duration or longer analyzed by lentz 2008a 2008b we computed monthly climatological means by annual cycle harmonic analysis for adcp profiles vertical binning of the data was applied in order to have similar vertical degrees of freedom in the model and observations in fig 2b current meter locations are indicated by blue dots and blue arrows depict the annual average of cm velocity at 20 m depth 2 2 3 velocity profiles from mv oleander adcp the container ship mv oleander transits from new york to bermuda monthly with an adcp instrument on board that performs autonomous collection of velocity data flagg et al 2006 rossby and gottlieb 1998 though the data are somewhat noisy and the ship track does not repeat exactly nevertheless the very large number of transects allows us to compute a useful climatological mean from data collected in 2005 2009 individual profiles were binned to equally spaced intervals along the rhumb line and in the vertical in each bin the data that fell more than two standard deviations 2 σ away from the mean were ignored to remove gulf stream ring events that would otherwise bias the mean flagg et al 2006 harmonic analysis was then performed to obtain monthly climatological profiles of velocity from 35 m to 400 m depth the magenta arrows in fig 2b illustrate the 35 m depth annual currents these data are the only such direct observational estimate of mean currents in the slope sea 2 2 4 velocity profiles from line w moored adcp the line w program was a long term study combining moorings and shipboard observations to investigate the deep limb of the atlantic meridional overturning circulation toole et al 2011 vertical profiles of the mean and annual cycle of velocity extracted from data collected at 4 moorings during 2001 2009 green arrows in fig 2b were assimilated in the model 2 2 5 sea surface height anomaly from jason altimeter the topex jason series of radar altimeter satellites measure sea surface height ssh along 6 ground tracks that traverse the espresso domain data that would ordinarily be rejected by conventional quality control of altimetry in coastal regimes can be reclaimed by judicious application of the data error flags and revised wet tropospheric radar range corrections feng and vandemark 2011 we extracted 1 hz along track approximately 6 km interval jason 1 and jason 2 data from the radar altimeter database system rads rads tudelft nl for 2006 2012 making range and geophysical corrections to retain data close to land up to the 25 m isobath standard altimetry corrections were applied to remove tides the inverted barometer effect and other high frequency sea level variability these data were averaged in 20 km along track bins and a 3 month running mean time filter applied outliers based on a 2 σ criterion were removed harmonic analysis was performed on the remaining observations to obtain the climatological seasonal cycle of ssh anomaly ssha fig 2c 2 2 6 temperature and salinity climatology a dataset of hydrographic observations in the mab drawn from the world ocean database wod boyer et al 2009 and augmented by ctd data from the noaa northeast fisheries science center nefsc and inner shelf ctd observations acquired by maracoos institutions has been mapped to an equal angle 0 05 grid 5 km on 57 standard depths by fleming 2016 using an adaptation of the weighted least squares method of ridgway et al 2002 this gridded monthly climatology mocha mid atlantic ocean climatological hydrographic analysis was interpolated to the espresso model grid for assimilation and adjusted to remove any statically unstable vertical profiles for illustration figure 2a shows mocha mean surface temperature other features of the mocha subsurface temperature analysis are shown in the left hand panels of fig 3 and are discussed in section 3 2 3 climatological 4d var assimilation methodology 2 3 1 prior model estimate creating an unbiased prior model estimate greatly assists the success of data assimilation we accomplished this in a sequence of distinct steps in the first step the roms espresso model configuration described in section 2 1 was run 12 times once for each month initialized with mocha temperature and salinity and forced by the respective monthly climatological air sea fluxes and river inflows held constant boundary sea level and velocity were taken from averages of the 2006 2012 daily analyses of the 1 12 resolution global hycom ncoda data assimilative model chassignet et al 2009 cummings 2005 these simulations were run for a period brief enough to let initial transients dissipate and for the velocity and sea level to approach dynamic equilibrium without allowing temperature and salinity to deviate too much from the climatology for summer months this adjustment was largely complete within a week so we averaged the second week of a 2 week simulation to obtain a prior estimate for those months for winter months this approach did not converge satisfactorily with unrealistically large currents arising at the shelf break during the dynamic adjustment so instead each winter month was initialized with mocha from the prior month then run changing the boundary conditions and surface forcing gradually over 45 days with the average of the last 30 days of simulation retained as a monthly estimate next these initial 12 estimates were averaged to produce a prior solution for an is4dvar analysis that assimilated the annual mean climatology data sets described in section 2 2 the final step was to re run the 12 climatological monthly forward model runs replacing hycom ncoda sea level and velocity open boundary and initial conditions with the annual mean adjusted values this was done in order to have a better balance between all the fields at initialization of the forward model this approach is admittedly ad hoc but it should be recalled that the objective is merely to obtain a reasonable first guess to be adjusted subsequently by data assimilation 2 3 2 error hypothesis is4dvar requires a prior estimate of the model background error covariance for initial boundary and air sea forcing conditions we specify these as a univariate correlation matrix scaled by standard deviations and spatial decorrelation scales estimated from the mesoscale variability in a multi year forward run i e no da of espresso the standard deviation in surface fluxes was halved to achieve better stability in the assimilation the initial condition error de correlation scale is 50 km in the horizontal and 50 m in the vertical boundary condition de correlation scale is 100 km in the horizontal and 100 m in the vertical surface forcing de correlation scale is 100 km an estimate of the observation errors is also required but this is a difficult choice for averaged climatological data sets observational errors should be small enough to keep the model as close as possible to a steady climatological solution yet large enough to allow the minimization algorithm to converge to a dynamically balanced solution we chose to set observational error for temperature and salinity to be 1 3 of the assumed model background error at the surface and to increase this to the mean model error over 150 m depth adjacent to the continental slope the error estimate for climatological temperature and salinity was elevated to prevent reintroducing unphysical currents near the shelf break velocity and ssh observational errors were set proportional to the standard deviation within each of the spatial averaging bins described above scaled to make the mean of the errors equal to the 1 10 of the mean model background standard deviation at the corresponding observation locations 2 3 3 analysis procedure is4dvar iterates forward and backward in time within an analysis interval here we use 2 days since we seek a steady climatological result time evolution of the solution over the interval is penalized by repeating the observations numerous times within the assimilation window temperature and salinity observations are repeated every 4 hours while velocity and ssh are repeated every 30 minutes an average of the converged model solution over the assimilation window becomes the completed analysis model data misfit decreased when boundary conditions and surface forcing were added to the control variable set in addition to the model initial conditions in particular adjusting the surface flux was instrumental in better fitting observations in the surface mixed layer although the surface wind stress and heat flux after assimilation were not particularly realistic adjustment of boundary conditions did not substantially improve the assimilation results we are not solving the time averaged roms governing equations by this approach and strictly speaking there is therefore a conceptual error in the dynamical model in strong constraint assimilation there is no explicit account of model errors that would require a weak constraint formulation sasaki 1970 by seeking initial and forcing conditions that pull the solution of the nonlinear model toward a steady model trajectory over the analysis window we are not allowing for the residual time trend that would be a small but non zero term in the monthly averaged dynamical equations this is clearly a shortcoming of our model design but a more precise configuration would require a time averaging observation operator in adjoint roms and a complete implementation of weak constraint assimilation such as the representer method of bennett 2002 these features are not presently available to us in roms 4dvar the improved outcome when surface fluxes are adjusted perhaps reflects that the climatological model set up needs the opportunity to accommodate model error and diverts this somewhat erroneously to adjusting the surface forcing we acknowledge this methodology is heuristic so should be judged by its ability to deliver a useful solution for the intended purpose namely computing 3 d ocean circulation analyses that are in near dynamic balance steered by coastal bathymetry and close to observed features of the long term mean ocean state where those are available this evaluation is the subject of section 3 where we contrast the results from assimilation experiments with successively more comprehensive observational constraints 2 3 4 three different assimilation experiments to test the relative influence of various types of observations for constraining climatological circulation several different monthly assimilation experiments were conducted in all cases initial and boundary conditions monthly surface forcing and monthly average observational data as described above were used in the first experiment denoted roms ts only the temperature and salinity climatology from mocha was assimilated in the second experiment we started with the same set of prior solutions as before but in addition to temperature and salinity we assimilated velocity from hf radar moored cm and oleander adcp this is experiment roms tsv these two experiments examine how well climatological in situ observations constrain the circulation in the absence of satellite based ssh climatology roms is4dvar requires observations that correspond to model state variables and therefore we cannot readily assimilate anomaly ssh because roms sea level is effectively absolute dynamic topography mdt included however since roms tsv provides an mdt estimate we add this to monthly jason ssh anomaly data and conduct a third assimilation experiment denoting this case as roms tsvh 3 results 3 1 roms ts and roms tsv results 3 1 1 annual mean and seasonal temperature fig 3 shows aspects of the mocha temperature climatology the roms tsv analysis and their difference views include winter top row and summer second ro bottom temperature on the shelf highlighting a well defined summertime subsurface cold pool houghton et al 1982 of waters less that 9 c on the shelf to characterize the overall pattern of vertical and across shelf stratification along isobath average winter and summer temperature for the shelf and slope are shown in the lower panels of fig 3 for northern and southern sub regions defined in fig 2a that echo quasi 2d climatological dynamical analyses of the mab lentz 2008a linder and gawarkiewicz 1998 temperature in the roms ts experiment not shown has a slightly better fit than in roms tsv but both fit the climatological temperature and salinity well as is to be expected since the data were assimilated the adjusted bottom temperature departure from climatology is greatest in the summer when the vertical decorrelation scale in the background error causes some loss of the sharp summer thermocline that is resolved well by the fine standard depth resolution in mocha in addition to the strong vertical thermal stratification and subsurface cold pool on the shelf the assimilation retains the bowl of warm subtropical water offshore in the slope sea the largest deviation from climatology occurs at the shelf break where the assimilation adjusts temperature and salinity to introduce more steeply sloping isotherms in accordance with the dynamics of the shelf break front 3 1 2 annual mean velocity while roms ts and tsv experiments are similar in terms of temperature and salinity they differ somewhat in their estimates of velocity fig 4 shows along shelf depth average velocity as a function of ocean depth in roms ts and tsv experiments grouped by northern and southern sub regions of the mab defined in fig 2a values in the estuaries and bays are not plotted and compared to values estimated by lentz 2008a from current meters on the shelf inshore of the 100 m isobath model depth averaged along shelf velocity is in reasonable agreement with current meter data in the northern mab but somewhat less so in the southern mab however it should be noted that the small dots in fig 4 are distributed throughout the shelf and the handful of current meter deployments from which depth averaged velocity was estimated may not be representative of the model spread model currents increase with water depth with a regression slope of 0 08 cm s 1 m 1 and an intercept of 1 2 cm s 1 values that are close to 0 07 cm s 1 m 1 and 1 8cm s 1 respectively that lentz 2008a estimated from cm data surface currents on the shelf are fit well in both experiments fig 5 depth average and surface currents in roms tsv are slightly closer to the observations by virtue of their being assimilated the assimilation of velocity data has moderate impact on the inner shelf but tends to decelerate the along shelf current on the outer shelf and near the shelf break in deeper water beyond the shelf break there are no observations over the full water column to constrain depth average velocity but limited surface current data from hf radar in the southern mab and upper water column data from oleander adcp show that with assimilation the flow is accelerated along the continental slope water depths 100 400 m and decelerated in the deep slope sea water depths 1000 m to bring roms tsv into better agreement with the observations these influences of the velocity assimilation are also evident in fig 5 which presents a map view of the surface current observations model results and their difference in roms ts the surface flow in the central mab is too fast and too strongly aligned with isobaths in roms tsv assimilation of hf radar and current meter observations is helpful in turning the surface flow offshore while assimilation of oleander data is instrumental in making the flow more uniform throughout the slope sea in the far southern mab the along shelf flow weakens in roms ts when in fact the convergence of isobaths sustains the strong current there even as much of the transport turns offshore assimilation restores the magnitude of the current on the shelf as the flow approaches cape hatteras the root mean square error between model and all velocity observations decreases from 0 049 m s 1 in roms ts to 0 031 m s 1 in roms tsv and 0 025 m s 1 in roms tsvh the vertical structure of velocity is shown in fig 6 where again the solution is averaged along isobaths and plotted as a function of water column depth in water shallower than 100 m both solutions show southwestward flow out of the page that intensifies moving seaward from the coast to the shelf break in roms ts fig 6 top row there is a reversal of the along shelf bottom flow immediately beyond the shelf break near 150 m water depth that we believe to be unrealistic this erroneous northward flow occurs throughout the mab but is most pronounced in the southwest where it allows the gulf stream to encroach onto the southern mab shelf when velocity data are assimilated in roms tsv fig 6 bottom row this undercurrent is greatly diminished the adjustment of roms tsv to show weaker northward flow at the seafloor at the 150 m isobath is accompanied by local strengthening of the surface current this suggests the vertical velocity shear and hence thermal wind density gradient are not appreciably altered and that 4dvar has accommodated the added velocity data by modifying the sea level gradient over the upper 400 m of the water column where oleander data are present the roms tsv comparison naturally improves and these changes in velocity propagate into the deeper slope sea it has been suggested lentz 2008a zhang et al 2011 that the across shelf circulation in the mab has a two layer structure in the inner shelf with offshore flow at the surface and on shore flow below and a three layer structure in the outer shelf with offshore flow at the surface and bottom and on shore at mid depths the presence of a mean geostrophic on shore flow at mid depths demands there be an along shelf pressure force due largely to a sloping sea level the right column in fig 6 shows the along isobath averaged across shelf velocity and along shelf pressure force expressed in terms of an equivalent sea level gradient when assimilating temperature and salinity alone roms ts the model did not generate significant across shelf flow in the inner shelf and on the outer shelf the across shelf circulation was rather weak in roms tsv we recover the across shore circulation in the inner and outer shelves as described by lentz 2008a and zhang et al 2011 on the inner shelf the model has 0 5 cm s 1 offshore surface currents weak on shore flow and upwelling through the water column on the outer shelf the across shelf flow increases to 1 cm s 1 at the surface 0 2 cm s 1 on shore through the mid depth range with weak down welling and 2 cm s 1 off shore in the bottom ekman layer upwelling of about 0 01 mm s 1 is reported in the inner portion of shelf break between 100 m and 1000 m isobaths which is consistent with the results of zhang et al 2011 in conjunction with the strenghtened across shore circulation there is an increase in along shore pressure gradient consistent with lentz result that this force is significant in the along shelf momentum balance 3 1 3 seasonal cycle of velocity the seasonal cycle of near surface velocity is shown in fig 7 in the form of ellipses computed by harmonic analysis for both the model and observational monthly fields and plotted at the observation locations while velocity data from the various observational platforms agree reasonably well with each other in the annual mean fig 5a there are some considerable differences between platforms in seasonal variability fig 7a current meter data show the largest amplitude of seasonal variability 5 cm s 1 hf radar observes smaller seasonal change of about 1 to 5 cm s 1 with the largest variability close to the coast seasonal variability is greatest toward the south near chesapeake bay and cape hatteras the magnitude of oleander seasonal variability on the shelf agrees with hf radar but is out of phase with it note that hf radar captures the flow at 2 m depth ullman et al 2006 whereas the shallowest reliable oleander adcp range bin is 35 m below the sea surface in the slope sea oleander exhibits larger variability up to 15 cm s 1 there are insufficient data at line w to obtain a meaningful seasonal cycle the seasonal variability of velocity in roms ts is not particularly realistic with large 20 cm s 1 discrepancies in the southern mab fig 7b this is unsurprising given that only temperature and salinity are assimilated and serves to emphasize that a diversity of observation types is required for effective multi variable state estimation by data assimilation the seasonal cycle in roms tsv fig 7c is much more similar to the observations but still with some differences in particular while trying to fit the two somewhat conflicting hf radar and near surface cm data sets the model has practically ignored the seasonal cycle in the cm in favor of hf radar seasonal cycle in the slope sea where oleander is the only source of data the model fits the observed seasonal cycle well this apparent preference of hf radar over coincident cm data may indicate imperfect observation error estimates that give excessive relative weight to hf radar or an imperfect background error model with overly long vertical covariance scale that connects velocity in the mixed layer to the underlying flow when these are in fact largely decoupled 3 1 4 mean dynamic topography and seasonal ssha variability the roms tsv solution gave an annual mean velocity and temperature analysis that compared well with the data in most of the domain and was constrained by roms model physics the corresponding model sea level solution represents an mdt that is dynamically consistent with the other fields and whose estimation is a key objective of our assimilation project comparing the roms mdt results to the independent aviso mdt fig 8 we see that model and aviso are broadly similar in the slope sea and gulf stream some modest variation between the two is to be expected because of the different methods used but also because aviso is based on hydrographic and drifter data from 1993 2012 whereas our solution uses hydrographic climatology for which 50 of the data were acquired before 1993 fleming 2016 to attempt an mdt analysis based strictly on observations acquired in the topex jason altimeter era we would also have to exclude more than half the moored current meter velocity data and for most of the mab hf radar data are available only in the last 5 years of the 1992 2012 period though the two mdts are similar offshore they differ dramatically on the shelf where the majority of velocity observations are located and where bathymetry and coastline strongly steer the flow assimilation of temperature and salinity provides information crucial to determining details of the mdt in the slope sea and in the gulf stream while velocity data add additional constraints on the shelf and upstream of the oleander line the strong constraint of the data assimilation introduces dynamically sensible mdt on the shelf the shelf sea level pattern is characterized by a steep across shelf slope of some 10 cm in 100 km that is quite uniform throughout the mab and which is consistent with the predominantly geostrophic balance of the mean along shelf flow lentz 2008a the amplitude and phase of seasonal sea level variability is shown in fig 9 which may be compared to jason ssha data in fig 2c variability in the slope sea is associated with a slow seasonal meander of the gulf stream but since this is close to the model boundary we do not put great faith in the result of more interest is the continental shelf where in the northern mab variation over the year is about 4 cm with a maximum in winter though the comparison to jason suggests the amplitude of variability may be underestimated in the southern mab there is little variability at all in the roms tsv results in terms of phase along track altimetry data agree with the roms ts and tsv solutions in the slope sea and the northern and central mab shelf but disagree in the southern mab and in the gulf stream area the roms ts solution suggests that the fit between modeled and observed ssha comes mostly from assimilating temperature and salinity the added assimilation of velocity data only improves the phase of the sea level cycle in the central and northern mab to bring modeled sea level variability into better agreement with satellite ssha we add altimeter data into the monthly assimilation analyses in the next experiment 3 2 assimilation of altimeter along track ssha thus far we have not assimilated satellite altimeter ssha data because we need to know mdt in order to formulate observations mdt ssha that correspond to the roms sea level state variable aviso mdt is unsatisfactory for this purpose on the shelf however we now have a good estimate of mdt from the roms tsv solution so we have conducted a further set of monthly assimilation experiments in which mdt added to jason ssha comprise a set of ssh observations to augment the suite of temperature salinity and velocity data we denote this set of monthly assimilations as roms tsvh all other parameters of the assimilation are kept the same changes with the addition of altimetry are not dramatic but they are consistently an improvement with ssh assimilation the modeled amplitude and phase of the seasonal cycle of sea level variability in the southern slope sea and southern mab shelf fig 9c is brought into agreement with observations as are the seasonal velocity ellipses in the central slope sea as observed by oleander but there is no significant change for better or worse in the variability in the northern mab nor overall are there any significant changes in the mean velocity fit figs 5f and 5g differ little and we retain the mdt from roms tsv as our best estimate of annual mean ocean conditions in the mab 4 features of the mean ocean circulation in the mab as we have noted earlier 2 d studies lentz 2008a linder and gawarkiewicz 1998 zhang et al 2011 have characterized across shelf circulation on the outer shelf as being predominantly offshore in the surface and bottom ekman layers with compensating on shore flow in a geostrophic interior in the full 3 d case these transports need not balance locally but may instead be matched by divergence of the along shelf transport using the annual mean result of the roms tsv experiment we examine how transports vary spatially along shelf we computed the across isobath component of flow by taking the inner product of the velocity with the gradient of bathymetry normalized to a unit vector i e h h a simple 9 point 2 d triangular filter was applied to the depth h prior to computing h to suppress noisiness in the calculation arising from depth variations on length scales of order 20 km or less the calculation was made separately for flow at the sea surface at the bottom and vertically averaged over the portion of the water column from 5 m below surface to 5 m above the seafloor so as to exclude boundary layer circulation from the mid depths result the across shore component of current is depicted by color shading in fig 10 with warm cool colors indicating offshore onshore flow arrows show the vector velocity in each layer average color coded by the sense of the across shore component for emphasis only vectors for every 3rd model cell are plotted but the color shading shows that patterns are coherent on length scales spanning several grid cells in accord with the 2 d studies there is a preponderance of offshore flow in the boundary layers and onshore flow in the interior but there is considerable local variability in the sense of the across isobath flow as the circulation wends its way southwestward throughout the mab some trends emerge in this spatial variability if we focus on the flow at an isobath on the outer shelf fig 11 shows conditions along a path coinciding with the 65 m isobath bracketed by across shelf transects that connect the isobath to the coast fig 11c therefore depicts across shelf flow where the transect follows the isobath but is augmented with strong along shelf flows that are into and out of the control volume at the two ends of the transect these saturate the color bar so contours of 0 05 and 0 075 m s 1 are added the abscissa of fig 11a c e is distance from the southern end of the path with green markers corresponding to those in fig 11b that delineate 3 southern central and northern sub regions that are averaged in fig 11d f in the surface and bottom boundary layers flow is offshore at the 65 m isobath throughout the mab but to varying intensity the interior flow is quite barotropic consistent with lentz 2008a assertion that following an isobath there is insufficient along shelf variation in density to sustain a thermal wind vertical shear in the across shelf current rather geostrophic balance of the across shelf interior flow must be achieved with an along shelf tilt to the sea level this across shelf interior flow is not consistently onshore as might be supposed from the 2 d studies but changes sign frequently as the flow gently meanders across isobaths to quantify this we plot depth integrated transport streamfunction along the section in fig 11c there is a net inflow of 0 136 sv through the northern end section and outflow of 0 109 sv at the southern extremity between these limits there is convergence and divergence of the across isobath flow that accumulates to the moderate net loss of 0 03 sv or 20 of the northern inflow considering averages in three approximately 200 km long sub sections fig 11d f we see that the northern and central sectors are indeed lentz like there is outflow in the boundary layers and inflow in the central water column and these are approximately volume conserving inspect the values of streamfunction at the green markers in fig 11c the along shelf current fig 11e is everywhere southward but accelerates as the flow moves toward the southern end of the 65 m isobath section because this flow reaches the seafloor it drives increasingly strong offshore transport in the bottom ekman layer in the southern sector fig 11d but the greatest difference compared to the northern sub sectors is that the interior flow is now directed offshore at all depths this is a region of significant leakage of the southward volume flux to deeper offshore waters whereas the north is not these features of the circulation are not peculiar to the 65 m isobath in fig 10b we see that anomalously onshore and offshore flow is organized into largely across shelf coherent bands indicating that where the current meanders horizontally it does so in an across shelf coordinated fashion we speculate that this meandering is the response of the depth integrated flow to vortex stretching induced by variations in the bathymetry on along shelf scales that are too short for the depth integrated potential vorticity to have adjusted so as to remain parallel to isobaths exploring this conjecture would best be pursued by analysis of a freely running model constrained by our mean solution only as open boundary conditions and unencumbered by data assimilation that upsets exact closure of the time averaged momentum and vorticity equations a change in along shelf dynamical balance that contributes to this offshore flow on the southern outer shelf becomes apparent if we plot mdt following selected isobaths fig 12 a positive slope indicates sea level is increasing toward the north on the inner and mid shelf 35 m and 50 m isobath sea level slopes of 4 5 5 6 10 8 are only moderately higher than the value 3 7 10 8 estimated by lentz 2008a which his conceptual model assumed to be spatially uniform however we find that in the southern mab seaward of the 50 m isobath there is a marked change in sea level tilt such that it opposes the southward current on the outer shelf even inside the 50 m isobath there is a local reversal in tilt before the slope continues its decrease approaching cape hatteras it is difficult to discern in fig 10b because the isobaths are so close in this part of the shelf but the flow in this region is consistently directed offshore at all depths if this sea level gradient were balanced by a uniform barotropic across shelf geostrophic flow it would drive 0 07 sv of offshore transport across the 65 m isobath in the southern sub region in fig 11c which unsurprisingly is very close to the volume loss in this sector suggested by the streamfunction calculation returning to the matter of across shelf variation in the along shelf sea level tilt our results are at odds with the idealized 2 d modeling study of zhang et al 2011 that suggested this tilt increases dramatically approaching the coast reaching as much as 1 3 10 7 in the annual mean whereas we see only one third this magnitude recalling that lentz 2008a assumed no across shelf variation in slope and focusing on the more lentz like northern mab where the mass balance appears to be approximately 2 d we actually see a modest increase table 1 in the along shelf sea level slope going from mid shelf 35 m isobath to the outer shelf however a clear point of agreement with zhang et al 2011 is a pronounced seasonal cycle in the sea level tilt greatest in winter and least in summer though the seasonal transitions correspond less well this being a regional diagnostic analysis we are none the wiser as to the dynamical origins of this variability 5 summary we have presented a mean 3 dimensional circulation analysis for the mid atlantic bight computed by variational data assimilation in a regional ocean model the data assimilated comprise climatological monthly mean ocean state conditions temperature salinity velocity and sea level anomaly derived from historical observations from all available platforms in the region the analysis was conducted for annual mean and monthly climatological mean conditions in the latter case the seasonal cycle in satellite altimeter sea surface height anomaly was included as a further data constraint exploiting the mean sea level estimate from the initial data assimilative analysis the model was forced by climatological mean river inflows and air sea fluxes but with the data assimilation system adjusting the latter in addition to the 3 d ocean state itself to further minimize the model data misfit by employing a strong constraint formulation of the assimilation algorithm the final state estimate is dynamically and kinematically constrained i e it satisfies the governing equations of continuity momentum temperature and salt conservation and the confines that bathymetry and coastline exert on the circulation a key motivation for this study was to compute a regional mdt that improved upon standard global products used in the satellite altimeter community this is to enable calculation of absolute sea level above datum as the sum of mdt and satellite observed sea level anomaly with respect to a mean sea surface the mss having been removed to circumvent uncertainties in the marine geoid at short length scales our mdt from the mean of the roms tsv experiment successfully remedies several conspicuous shortcomings in aviso mdt and in so doing exhibits features of the mean sea level that are required for consistency with well known observed aspects of the regional circulation notably contours of constant mdt shoreward of the shelf break now closely parallel isobaths recognizing that bathymetry strongly steers the depth integrated currents an along shelf sea level slope of approximately 0 5 10 7 is a ubiquitous feature of mid shelf waters in agreement with previous 2 d idealized studies that note this term is significant in the along shelf momentum balance on the northern outer shelf the sea level slope is moderately steeper but in the southern mab it reverses sign altogether which contributes to driving across isobath flow that partially drains the southwestward mean flow on the shelf despite this adverse pressure gradient the along shelf current steadily accelerates toward the south driving increasing offshore transport in the bottom ekman layer nevertheless the majority of along shelf transport still remains on the shelf continuing southward until it makes an abrupt turn seaward immediately north of cape hatteras the analysis has thus added quantitative 3 dimensional detail to our view of the mean circulation in the mab that was previously based principally on 2 d idealized or spatially localized studies or on forward modeling studies that were largely unconstrained by historical observations the analyzed mdt from the roms tsv experiment is now being used in conjunction with coastal altimeter data to routinely assimilate those observations in the espresso near real forecast system operated by maracoos the mdt 3 d velocity analysis and mocha hydrographic atlas are also being used as a dynamically self consistent ocean state climatology to adjust biases in sea level velocity temperature and salinity from global operational modeling systems before they

technology stevinweg 1 delft 2628cn the netherlands corresponding author ice induced variability of tides in the canadian arctic archipelago including baffin bay and hudson strait hudson bay system was studied by means of a new high resolution tidal model here we show that the seasonal variations of the tidal constants are significant in the major part of the domain month to month changes of the tidal phases can reach 180 degrees due to changes in the number and positions of the amphidromic points whereas the amplitude variations are especially large in the near resonant basins we also show that the tidal seasonality has undergone dramatic changes in the past decades due the decaying extent of the arctic sea ice these seasonal decadal scale changes not only vary tidal dissipation on the shelf but also impact tides in the adjacent open ocean and therefore cannot be neglected keywords canadian arctic archipelago tide ocean modeling sea ice unstructured mesh seasonal variation arctic ocean 1 introduction the canadian arctic archipelago shown in fig 1 is a collection of islands located on the northern north american continental shelf it is known to be an important gateway for water ice and tidal energy exchange between the arctic ocean and north atlantic changes in the circulation of freshened seawater and ice through its narrow passages have the potential to influence both regional and global climate it can significantly affect the distribution of sea ice in the arctic recirculation of the surface waters and freshwater fluxes around greenland as well as the strength of ocean circulation in the atlantic joyce and proshutinsky 2007 accurate tide prediction is crucial for many purposes such as investigating the variability of the sea surface currents and eddy activities tidal motion influences the turbulent mixing and heat anomalies required for polynya formation and therefore affects sea ice properties and distribution wang et al 2003 makinson et al 2011 furevik and foldvik 1996 have shown that near critical latitude the boundary layer thickens and it encompasses the entire water column at critical latitude the thickened boundary layer imparts vertical shears in the horizontal velocities to more of the water column and can lead to mixing as a result of the increased baroclinicity of the water column due to internal tides enhanced mixing resonant effects with the inertial frequency even weak tidal regimes play a significant role in ice shelf melting when they are subject to critical latitude effects robertson 2013 while global ocean tide models improved dramatically in the recent years due to combination of data assimilation based on satellite altimetry analysis with sophisticated hydrodynamic assimilation modeling the accurate representation of shallow water depth 1000 m and high latitude polewards from 66 tides still remain a challenge cheng and andersen 2011 stammer et al 2014 the model limitations in polar regions arise from a poorly known bathymetry and relatively sparse and poor quality data for model validation and assimilation another source of errors is the ice induced seasonal variability of the tidal constituents which is insufficiently studied the existing tidal models represent an annual mean state of the tidal constants the presence of ice cover and its effects are often ignored completely or represented via imposing a stationary mean ice concentration field the rationale behind this is that the ice induced changes do not exceed the model errors this conclusion is however drawn based only on a few tide gauge records along the white sea coastline off the siberian continental shelf and in the canadian arctic henry and foreman 1977 murty and polavarapu 1979 godin and barber 1980 murty 1985 prinsenberg 1988 st laurent et al 2008 there is no data and there are only a few numerical studies dedicated to the temporal variability of tidal constants on a larger scale kowalik 1981 saucier et al 2004 kagan and romanenkov 2007 kagan et al 2007 kagan and sofina 2010 müller et al 2014 the majority of the mentioned studies only compare winter and summer january vs september regimes none of them show monthly variations of the tidal constituents and cover the complete area considered here in this paper a new tidal model of the canadian arctic archipelago including baffin bay hudson strait and hudson bay is developed and validated against available observations the simulations were performed using adcirc unstructured model modified to account for the presence of an under ice frictional layer unlike other existing models the user defined ice concentration field used to calculate the ice ocean drag coefficient is assumed to vary in time fig 2 since the majority of the available tide gauge records are too short to account for the tide seasonality only a part of the simulated time series corresponding to the specific tidal record was used for comparison after the initial model validation step seasonality of the tidal constants in the entire domain was assessed by means of monthly harmonic analysis the modelled variations were compared to the observations at a number of tide gauges with records spanning multiple years the model behaviour in the hudson bay hudson strait regions was also compared to the analytical model of the semi diurnal response developed by cummins et al 2010 although the model does not account for a separate quarter wavelength resonance exited at leaf basin in ungava bay it gives a good indication of the range of semi diurnal amplitude variation that can be expected in the resonant system due to the additional friction associated with the seasonal ice cover estimates of m2 tidal energy dissipation from topex poseidon altimeter data by egbert and ray 2001 has shown that the most important region of the world ocean for dissipating tidal energy is the area around hudson bay high energy dissipation on a shelf is usually associated with tidal resonances indeed results of webb 2014 indicate that the hudson bay region has four significant resonances close to and straddling the semi diurnal tidal band here we show that additional friction associated with the seasonally varying ice cover significantly influences tidal constants in the hudson bay region including baffin bay and canadian arctic straits this in turn changes the amount of energy dissipated in the hudson bay and thus has potential to introduce seasonal variations of tides in the northern labrador sea the paper is organized as follows section 2 gives a short description of adcirc including the implementation of the ice ocean integration design of the numerical experiment observation data and error metrics used for the model validation model results are presented in sections 3 5 and summarized in section 6 extended model validation results are given in appendix 2 model description 2 1 description of the numerical method in this study we use a modified version of adcirc adcirc advanced circulation luettich and westerink 2004 a multi scale multi physics coastal circulation model that is widely used for a range of modeling applications the model runs on highly flexible unstructured triangular meshes and is therefore highly scalable with linear performance scaling up to 16 000 cores see e g dietrich et al 2012 adcirc is a continuous galerkin finite element shallow water model which utilizes the generalized wave continuity equation gwce formulation to determine the water levels velocities are obtained from the vertically integrated momentum equation in order to account for the under ice friction a potential damping mechanism that dissipates tidal energy is the friction produced at the interface between the ice and the ocean adcirc was modified as described below the ocean currents and sea ice interaction is usually represented through a simple quadratic stress proportional to the relative velocity between ice and water pease et al 1983 dissipation of long wave energy under drifting ice is negligible however during high ice concentration periods ice plates are confined by shorelines and their mobility is hampered the relative velocity between the ice and the tidal current increases and the stress becomes significant a practical approach to simulate under ice friction effect in a 2d model is combine the surface and bottom drag into a single friction parameter 1 c d c d b o t c d s u r f similarly to dunphy et al 2005 hannah et al 2008 and collins et al 2011 the ice ocean drag coefficient c d s u r f is computed based

since ice floes are believed to move freely along with the surface waters the maximum value c d s u r f at a 1 accounts for increased friction due to the keel effect in ridged ice tang and fissel 1991 another important effect of ice cover is that it also acts as a barrier to the meteorological forcing of the water mass macklin 1983 and pease et al 1983 found that measurements of wind drag coefficients over first year sea ice typically yielded values that were significantly larger and varied less with wind speed than that predicted for open water it is important to account for the changes of wind drag coefficient due to presence of ice when modeling storm surges and the associated flooding however they are unlikely to have significant effect on the long term tidal constants and are therefore not considered in this study 2 2 model domain the size of the domain is determined not only by the complexity of geometry but also by the tidal dynamics in the area to ensure the correct development and propagation of tides open boundaries should be placed outside of the resonant basins and should not located near the tidal amphidromes the chosen model domain and bathymetry is shown in fig 1 the bathymetric data were extracted from the version 3 0 of international bathymetric chart of the arctic ocean ibcao jakobsson et al 2012 which includes new bathymetric data from a number of sources such as the fishing vessels us navy submarines and research ships from various nations for the areas south of 64 n not covered by ibcao data set the bottom heights were drawn from the gebco 2014 grid weatherall et al 2015 the model grid was produced using gmsh grid generator by geuzaine and remacle 2009 which was modified by van scheltinga et al 2012 to allow for efficient meshing of highly irregular oceanic domains the mesh has about 390 thousand nodes and 750 thousand triangular elements with resolution varying from approximately 300 m to 10 km 2 3 observation data over many years canada has carried out tidal recordings at many locations spread over the arctic archipelago a number of tide gauges were operated for long periods of time however the majority of observations were collected during short campaigns run in the late 1970s 80s and typically cover time intervals of 30 to 80 days since the installation of tidal instruments during the short summer season is often hindered by moving ice floes and bergs and the uncertainty of finding open water the majority of short term tidal records have been collected using instruments deployed in the winter through the ice cover tait et al 1986 conditions suitable for operation usually occur in a two month window between mid to late february and late april to early may depending on latitude most of the observed water level data are available for download from a digital data inventory at the marine environmental data service meds fisheries and oceans canada in order to provide broad spatial coverage we chose to use records with length of at least 29 days the tidal constituents were calculated from the water level time series using utide package codiga 2011 additionally the tidal constants were extracted from collins et al 2011 chen et al 2009 and the danish tidal office report farvandsvæsenet 2000 locations of the tide gauges used for model validation are depicted in the top panel of the fig 3 and together with the record period there known are listed in the supplement the fact that the tide gauge data were acquired during different periods and that the majority of the records are very short and do not account for the tidal seasonality poses a problem for comparison with the model result to overcome the difficulty only a part of the simulated time series corresponding to a specific tidal record the same length and season was used for comparison during the model step we believe this approach also helps to eliminate possible errors associated with short record length similarly to collins et al 2011 for the purpose of reporting statistics the archipelago was divided into a number of regions based on the tidal range the regions are defined in table 1 and tide gauges belonging to different regions are shown in different colours in fig 3 for evaluation of the tidal currents in the central arctic archipelago we use stations from collins et al 2011 fig 3 shows approximate locations of the moorings 2 4 simulation parameters and boundary settings the simulation is forced by prescribing the tidal motion on the open boundaries the amplitude and phases of the 8 major constituents were compiled from tpxo8v1 atlas and two versions of fes global tide models the tpxo8v1 atlas is the current version of a global model of ocean tides obtained with otis osu tidal inversion software the methods used to compute the model are described in detail by egbert et al 1994 and further by egbert and erofeeva 2002 the fes finite element solution tide models lyard et al 2006 carrère et al 2013 are based on the resolution of the tidal barotropic equations t ugo model in a spectral configuration the ice concentration field used by the model is shown in fig 2 the data are drawn from walsh et al 2015 monthly gridded sea ice concentration product based on observations from historical sources from 1850 onward for each month we take a median value of the respective monthly ice concentrations from the period between january 1961 and december 1990 that is every pane of fig 2 represents a median of the 30 monthly values the chosen period corresponds to the date range when majority of the observations were collected we have used the median rather than mean or a single year concentration to reduce the effect of extreme years on the final field the drawback of this approach is the possibility to increase the model errors in the areas where the ice induced seasonal and decadal variations are significant adcirc was run in barotropic two dimensional depth integrated 2ddi mode using the fully consistent gwce and momentum equation formulations a quadratic friction law was used with friction coefficient c d b o t set to 0 0025 following dupont et al 2002 and dunphy et al 2005 the model was run for 383 days which included 17 days of spin up time 2 5 error metrics to assess the quality of a tidal model an error metric has to be specified similarly to dunphy et al 2005 we use a single metric which combines both elevation and phase error and allows us to measure how well each constituent was modelled at each station and for each constituent the error is defined as the magnitude of the observed constituent minus the modelled constituent evaluated in the complex plane 3 e r r h 0 e i ϕ 0 h m e i ϕ m where h 0 ϕ 0 are the observed amplitude and phase and hm ϕm are the modelled values to evaluate the solutions for one constituent over broader areas the root mean square rms values over regions defined in table 1were calculated 3 model validation tidal amplitudes vary from a few centimeters in the west along the arctic shelf to over 1 m in the eastern areas of the archipelago generally the m2 component is the largest with the exception of boothia bay where the k1 diurnal tide dominates fig 4 the tidal motion in the canadian arctic archipelago primarily originates from the tides in the atlantic ocean the mainly semi diurnal tidal signal enters the hudson strait at the eastern entrance with an amplitude about 3 m and reaches its maximum in leaf basin further the tidal wave propagates westward though the strait around the coast of hudson bay in an anti clockwise direction and forms two amphidromic points in the west central and east central parts of the bay and a degenerate one in james bay the maximum m2 tidal amplitude of 1 25 m occurs along the west coast of hudson bay a small portion of the tidal signal entering through the labrador sea flows into baffin bay forming an amphidromic system there the semi diurnal tidal wave propagates north along the west coast of greenland reaches the maximum amplitude of over 1 m in kane basin and enters the archipelago through barrow strait 3 1 comparison with the tide gauges the rms errors of the 8 major constituents evaluated over each region are shown in fig 5 the prediction errors vary from region to region reflecting the regional tidal range however in some cases the regional errors are dominated by larger errors at few locations this is especially true for the k2 p1 and q1 tidal constituents due to partially missing data the largest regional errors for the semi diurnal constituents are observed in hudson strait ungava bay it is worth noting that the tidal range in ungava bay competes with the bay of fundy for the title of the world s highest tides o reilly et al 2005 the obtained regional rms error of 55 cm is about 21 of the local tidal range and is therefore acceptable errors for the diurnal tide constituents are dominated by the errors in the arctic south central and southeast regions the semi diurnal and diurnal tidal resonances in ungava bay and boothia bay respectively make these regions very sensitive to any inadequacy in bathymetric details and therefore difficult to model accurately the maps of the computed tidal characteristics together with the amplitude and phase errors at the tide gauge stations are shown in figs a 17 a 24 in general the model seems to under predict tidal amplitudes more often than over predict large amplitude errors for semi diurnal constituents around kane basin suggest that the nares strait is not properly resolved this can also contribute to the under prediction of the tidal amplitudes on the eastern part of devon island large phase errors in the arctic west region can indicate a problem with the open boundary forcing 3 2 tidal currents in the central region the comparison of the observed and modelled tidal ellipse parameters for m2 and k1 is shown in fig 6 as can be seen the modelled amplitude of the m2 major axis agrees quite well with the observations with the exception of the currents at hm1 hm2 and hm3 which are under predicted the largest errors in the amplitude of the modelled k1 major axis are again observed at the js2 and hm stations the model data comparison for the tidal currents shows the same strange features as in collins et al 2011 such as good agreement at js1 and poor at js2 large differences in phases at various locations etc in general the modeled and observed currents show reasonable agreement when the observations cover most of the water column and are for long periods of time that is some of the model data mismatch can be due to important seasonal changes in the tidal currents and important vertical structure in the tidal currents therefore a three dimensional model which accounts for vertical stratification and horizontal density gradients is required to address this issue 4 ice induced variability of tidal constants 4 1 seasonal variations of the tidal constants the ice induced variability of the tidal constituents are examined by partitioning the simulated yearly time series into slightly overlapping monthly segments and performing a harmonic analysis for each segment separately section appendix b shows a detailed comparison of the modelled and observed seasonal cycle of the m2 amplitude at a number of tide gauges tidal motion in the entire model domain exhibits a certain degree of variability as can be seen from fig 7 seasonal changes in the m2 amplitude i e the difference between maximum and minimum range between 5 and 10 cm in south baffin bay kane basin m clintock channel lancaster sound and norwegian bay the amplitude variations reach about 50 cm along the west coast of hudson bay and james bay southwest of foxe basin summer to winter changes in m2 amplitude exceeding 1 m are observed in roes welcome sound hudson strait and ungava bay as shown by arbic et al 2007 these regions are nearly resonant with the tidal forcing and therefore are very sensitive to the frictional effects of ice cover in the section 4 2 we will study the seasonality of the tidal dynamics in the hudson bay hudson strait system in more details month to month changes in the amplitude of m2 tidal constituent are shown in fig 8 month to month changes in the tidal phases shown in fig 9 are generally of order 10 20 degrees however in some locations the differences up to 180 degrees are observed these large phase variations are typically found in the vicinity of the amphidromic points and are due to their movement see video in supplementary material during the winter months the two amphidromic points in the west and east central parts of hudson bay move southward resulting in the earlier arrival of the tide this agrees with the theoretical considerations by prinsenberg 1988 the amphidrome in the baffin bay moves westward and the one to the south west of banks island moves towards the east 4 2 seasonality of tides in the hb hs system from the analytical model by cummins et al 2010 in this section we will use the simple analytical model by cummins et al 2010 to study seasonality of tides in the hudson bay hudson strait system cummins et al 2010 studied the semi diurnal response in the hudson bay hudson strait region by means of a simple model of a channel connected to an inner basin taking into account the mechanical impedance presented to the channel by hudson bay they have shown that the fundamental channel mode has a natural period of oscillations close to that of the semi diurnal tides the idealised model domain shown in fig 10 consists of a basin of a surface area ab connected to the ocean via a channel of uniform width w length l and depth h the channel is assumed to be sufficiently narrow so that rotational effects can be neglected assuming that water level and along channel velocity have a simple harmonic form h u h x u x e i ω t the linearized continuity equations can be combined with the along strait momentum equation to form the second order boundary value problem for the complex water level amplitude 4 d 2 h d x 2 k 2 h 0 here k 2 k 0 2 1 i δ is the complex wavenumber with k 0 2 ω 2 g h the linear drag coefficient r and the non dimensional channel friction parameter δ r ω the boundary condition for eq 4 at the channel entrance x 0 is 5 h 0 h 0 where h 0 is the amplitude of the sea level displacement associated with a prescribed incoming wave at the channel basin junction x l conservation of mass is required assuming that the amplitude of sea surface displacement averaged over the basin can be written in terms of the channel elevation at the basin junction as h b α h l this gives 6 d h d x α γ k 2 l h with γ a c a b the generally complex constant α represents basin impedance and is a function of frequency that depends on the size and geometry of the basin an appropriate value for α can be determined using results from the numerical tidal model solution of eq 4 subject to the boundary conditions 5 and 6 is derived by cummins et al 2010 and is given by 7 h x h 0 cos k x sin k l α k l γ cos k l cos k l α k l γ sin k l sin k x the water level elevation is then expressed in terms of an amplitude and phase as h x t h x cos ω t ϕ x with ϕ x atan2 i m h x r e h x the channel response to the tidal forcing given by eq 7 is governed by the amplitude of the forcing h 0 and three non dimensional parameters α γ δ and k 0 l depending on the forcing frequency the bottom drag coefficient and dimensions of the basin and channel the parameter γ representing ratio of the basin to channel area is set to 0 15 similarly to cummins et al 2010 we make an empirical estimate of α using results from the numerical model forced at the m2 frequency since the basin impedance is related to the dissipation of energy it could vary seasonally due to the additional friction associated with the ice cover we therefore estimated αsummer and αwinter from two model runs representing summer and winter conditions the value of c d i c e was set to 2 5 10 3 variation over an m2 tidal cycle of the modelled surface elevation averaged over the hudson bay foxe basin and along its junction with hudson strait is shown in fig 11 a these are related by the complex constants α a r g α s u m m e r 0 091 130 and α a r g α w i n t e r 0 088 127 for the summer and winter seasons respectively during the summer season the hudson strait hudson bay area is mostly ice free whereas during the winter season it is characterized by nearly 100 ice coverage the linear friction coefficient r cdu h was therefore calculated based on c d c d b o t 2 5 10 3 for the summer season and on c d c d b o t c d i c e 5 10 3 for the winter using a tidal speed of u 1 m s and the average channel depth h of 235 m for the semi diurnal frequency ω 1 4 10 4 these give δ 0 076 and 0 152 for summer and winter respectively inspecting the dependency of the sea level elevation at the middle of the channel on the value of k 0 l shown in fig 11 b gave the value of 2 7 at resonance the amplitude of the forcing at the mouth of the channel was set to 1 5 m fig 12 shows the amplitude of along channel displacement given by eq 7 with the parameters as defined above for the summer and winter seasons the analytical model predicts the maximum amplitude of 3 2 m in the summer 2 6 m in the winter to be found at x l 0 55 at the basin channel junction the amplitude is predicted to reduce from approximately 1 7 m in the summer to 1 4 m in the winter these values agree reasonably well with the results of the numerical model 3 05 m in the summer 2 55 m in the winter at the midchannel and 1 66 m 1 49 m at the basin channel junction using a taylor solution of a reflecting kelvin wave in a rectangular basin prinsenberg 1988 has demonstrated that the ice cover causes nearly the same amount of damping for the tides as that used to represent bottom friction the additional friction due to the ice cover causes about 10 m2 amplitude decrease at the churchill station assuming that the amplitude at the basin entrance does not change if as results above suggest amplitude of the m2 tide entering the hudson bay is reduced by 19 during winter then the amplitude at churchill should decrease by approximately 27 as can be seen from fig b 26 f dotted line the modelled amplitude reduces by 25 in january 100 ice coverage compared to september ice free period thus the amplitude reduction shown by the numerical model agrees very well with the simple analytical model of the channel resonance and reflected kelvin wave moreover arbic et al 2009 and arbic and garrett 2010 have shown that the open ocean tide can be affected generally reduced by the presence of a resonant shelf the back effect is especially large if the open ocean itself is close to resonance and the shelf friction is small therefore an increase of shelf friction due to presence of ice cover should lead to an increase in ocean tides in the northern labrador sea increased amplitudes of the m2 tidal constituent during winter months observed at nain and qaqortoq stations see fig b 26 g and h support these conjecture thus the discrepancy with the observed seasonal variations in the western hudson bay may be due to the forcing on the eastern entrance of the hudson strait which was kept constant by the domain s open boundary conditions therefore the range of seasonal variations of the tidal constants at the model domain open boundary and its influence on the tidal dynamics in the area needs to be further investigated this will be done in a separate paper 4 3 decadal scale variations of the ice induced tidal seasonality evidence of the climate change comes among others from the decrease in extent and thickness of the arctic sea ice stroeve et al 2007 comiso et al 2008 rothrock et al 1999 these changes could significantly impact the tidal dynamics in the canadian arctic archipelago in this section we explore how the ice induced tidal seasonality has changed in the course of the past six decades we used the model setup as described in section 2 4 with two different ice concentration fields shown in figs c 27 and c 28 the fields are drawn from walsh et al 2015 and correspond to the periods from 1958 to 1962 and from 2008 to 2012 fig 13 depicts the difference in the monthly ice concentration between the periods during the winter months the area remains fully ice covered with the exception of the northern labrador sea which remains ice free throughout the year the extent of the winter ice changed only slightly between the lustrums the ice started to melt approximately a month earlier and the extent of summer ice decreased significantly in the 2008 2012 period compared to the period of 1958 1962 although the areas which were ice free during the summer started to freeze later in the 2008 2012 period the ice cover formed faster as a result december ice concentrations in these areas were higher during the 2008 2012 period please note that the decadal scale results are sensitive to the quality of the early observations as described in walsh et al 2015 the data for the earlier period depends on ship logs and naval records the resulting monthly m2 amplitudes and phases for both periods are shown in figs c 29 c 32 changes in the monthly amplitudes shown in fig 14 reflect closely the changes in the monthly ice concentrations lower ice concentrations result in higher amplitudes and vise versa the largest amplitude differences are predicted in the hudson strait hudson bay area as we have shown earlier the area is very sensitive to friction due to its closeness to resonance with the semi diurnal tidal frequencies the amplitude increase of 12 cm is predicted in june of 2008 2012 comparing to june of 1958 1962 correspond to the earlier melting of ice during that period faster freezing during the 2008 2012 period resulted in approximately 5 cm lower amplitudes along the western coast of hudson bay in november and december changes in the monthly m2 phases are shown in fig 15 yellow red colours indicate that the tide arrived later in the 2008 2012 period than in 1958 1962 the relation between the ice concentrations and the phase of the tide is more complicated decreased ice concentrations could lead to later as well as earlier arrival of tide depending on the wave form of the tide in a specific area if the tide propagates more or less along a straight coast then decrease in the ice friction will lead to an increase of the phase velocity prinsenberg 1988 the increased phase velocity causes an advancement of the arrival time as predicted in the arctic west northwest central and south central regions from july to august of 2008 2012 see fig 3 and table 1 for the definition of the regions in hudson bay the earlier melting and reduced july august ice friction causes the amphidromic points to be located more northward compared to the 1958 1962 period this causes delay in arrival of the tide along the hudson bay west coast during the summer of 2008 2012 the opposite is predicted in november and december due to the faster freezing 5 tidal mixing tides have long been recognized to be an important mixing mechanism in shallow seas positions of tidal mixing fronts are commonly identified using a stratification parameter originally developed by simpson and hunter 1974 for thermally stratified seas however as shown by bowman and esaias 1981 it can be considered a general parameter relating a constant buoyancy input to tidal mixing energy irregardless of the nature of the input therefore despite the fact that fresh water addition via ice melting or river run off has large effect on the density structure in the canadian arctic archipelago the parameter can also be used to identify tidal mixing front positions here drinkwater and jones 1987 rudels et al 1991 here we calculated distribution of the tidal mixing parameter as defined by pingree and griffiths 1978 λ log 10 h c d u s 3 where h denotes the water depth cd is the bottom drag coefficient and us is the depth averaged tidal stream velocity amplitude the root mean square rms of tidal currents were reconstructed from the eight tidal constituents as given by the model for the winter january to march and summer august to october periods the drag coefficient cd was calculated according to eq 1 using the ice concentration field shown in fig 2 although the tidal currents vary significantly throughout the year the larger part of the domain has values of λ greater than 2 for both winter and summer periods indicating a stratified water column the well mixed areas λ 1 are found in the southeast of foxe basin along the southwest coast of hudson bay and james bay ungava bay and in several areas with narrow channels or shallow sills shown in fig 16 these are the areas with strong tidal currents and tidal energy dissipation the upward heat transfer which occurs through vertical mixing of warmer deep water towards the surface can enhance melting of the ice cover or even prevent ice from forming smith et al 1990 therefore as shown by hannah et al 2008 the parameter λ can be used to identify areas where tidal mixing can contribute to the formation and maintenance of the sensible heat polynyas for both the maximum summer and minimum winter stream velocity magnitude the tidal mixing parameter λ is found to be less than 2 in many areas where recurring polynyas are known to form see for example barber and massom 2007 our study indicate that besides the ones shown in hannah et al 2008 a polynya in roes welcome sound akimiski strait frobisher bay and two polynyas in foxe basin could be of tidal nature 6 discussion tidal models have undergone a dramatic improvement since the first topex poseidon satellite altimeter mission was launched the open ocean barotropic tides in the latitude band covered by the altimeters are now known with about 98 accuracy 0 5 0 7 cm error compared to a signal of 30 cm although our knowledge of shelf and coastal tides has also advanced in the recent years the relative errors here are still much higher up to 16 according to stammer et al 2014 than for open ocean barotropic tides significant efforts are required to develop an accurate tidal model of each specific shelf coastal region this is especially true for the high latitude areas such as canadian arctic archipelago considered here besides issues common to the majority of shelf regions such as uncertainties in bathymetric data and sparse observations the presence of seasonally varying ice cover poses additional difficulties here a tidal prediction system for the canadian arctic archipelago has been completed for the eight major constituents m2 n2 s2 k2 k1 o1 p1 and q1 using adcirc boundary conditions are a combination of fes2004 2012 and tpxo8 global solutions the rms error of the tidal constituents averaged over the entire model domain is about 21 cm for m2 and 8 5 6 5 11 1 and 5 cm for s2 n2 k2 o1 k1 q1 and p1 respectively the errors for the semi diurnal constituents are dominated by the errors in the hudson strait ungava bay system the poorly known bathymetry is an important factor which limits accuracy of the tidal modeling in this resonant area in order to study the ice induced variability of the tidal constants the simulated water level time series were partitioned into monthly segments and analysed separately the analysis shows that the tidal dynamics of the entire model domain are subject to seasonal variations larger phase differences are often observed in the vicinity of the amphidromic points and are caused by their relocation the larger amplitude differences are observed in the resonant basins these are also the areas where the seasonal variations have changed significantly in the past six decades more specifically earlier melting of ice in the hudson bay hudson strait area during the last decade resulted in up to 12 cm amplitude increase in june compared to early 60s note also that large rms error of the m2 tidal constituent in the region can be partially attributed to this change discrepancy between the observed and modelled seasonal variability of the tidal constants in the hudson bay system could be due to the open boundary conditions which were assumed to be independent of the coastal dynamics it was shown by arbic et al 2009 and arbic and garrett 2010 that continental shelfs can significantly impact tides in the deep ocean especially if the shelf region is close to resonance with tidal forcing as shown by webb 2014 tidal dynamics in the hudson bay system are dominated by four nearly overlapping tidal resonances these resonances acting together make the region around hudson bay including the labrador sea baffin bay and canadian arctic straits the most important area for tidal energy dissipation egbert and ray 2001 chevalier et al 2013 has demonstrated using the fes2012 hydrodynamic solution that the tidal dissipation in hudson bay is crucial for the accuracy of global tidal solutions especially in the atlantic varying ice cover seasonally changes tidal dissipation in the hudson bay area and therefore not only modifies tidal characteristics locally but also impacts tides in the remote areas tidal seasonality in the subarctic ocean is also evident from the satellite altimeter data fig 1 from fok et al 2013 clearly shows that ssh anomaly residual during the winter season is 15 30 larger than that during the summer season this also means that the accuracy of the global tidal solutions can vary significantly between the seasons therefore the ice induced seasonal and decadal variations of barotropic tides remains an outstanding subject for further research acknowledgments the authors would like to thank david greenberg and florent lyard for their detailed comments on an early stage of this paper we are immensely grateful to van scheltinga arjen terwisscha van scheltinga for his help with generation of the grid we would also like to show our gratitude to joannes westerink and the

this work is financed by the netherlands organisation for scientific research nwo appendix a comparison with the tide gauges figs a 17 a 24 show the maps of the computed tidal characteristics together with the amplitude and phase errors at the tide gauge stations a colour scale shown to the left of every figure refers to the amplitude phase range of the tidal constituents the absolute amplitude phase error values are shown by means of triangular markers coloured according to the colour scale on the figure s right a triangle pointing upward indicates that the observed amplitude phase exceeds the modelled value under prediction and a downward pointing triangle indicates that the modelled amplitude phase exceeds the observed one over prediction appendix b ice induced variability of tidal constants comparison to observations to assess ability of the model to reproduce seasonality of the tidal constants a number of tide gauges with records spanning multiple years were selected the approximate locations of the tide gauges are shown in fig b 25 monthly elevations of m2 tide obtained from the tide gauge records are plotted against the model results in fig b 26 here we used two different values for the ice drag coefficient defined in eq 2 namely c d i c e 1 8 10 2 the value used throughout this paper dashed line and c d i c e 2 5 10 3 as typically used in global tidal models for the fast ice cells dotted line in all cases the amplitude anomaly is shown relative to september the temporal variability of the m2 amplitude at the four most western stations is reproduced by the model reasonably well when the higher value of the ice drag coefficient is used there is however slight shift in the phase of the modulation for sachs harbor and ulukhaktok stations the amplitude variations at the cambridge bay are underestimated in both the cases whereas at the remaining stations it is highly overestimated the ice ocean drag coefficient is determined as a function of the undersurface sea ice roughness length since under surface sea ice roughness can vary considerably according to the estimation method and the level of the sea ice deformation so does the calculated drag coefficient the estimated value typically ranges from 1 32 10 3 to 26 8 10 3 see for example pease et al 1983 langleben 1982 and madsen and bruno 1987 moreover the aerodynamic properties of the ice cover change seasonally due to growth and decay for the numerical model however a single value of the ice ocean drag coefficient is chosen by the modeler and is kept constant for the entire duration of the simulation a possibility to include space and time varying ice ocean drag coefficient requires additional research appendix c decadal scale variations of the ice induced tidal

technology stevinweg 1 delft 2628cn the netherlands corresponding author ice induced variability of tides in the canadian arctic archipelago including baffin bay and hudson strait hudson bay system was studied by means of a new high resolution tidal model here we show that the seasonal variations of the tidal constants are significant in the major part of the domain month to month changes of the tidal phases can reach 180 degrees due to changes in the number and positions of the amphidromic points whereas the amplitude variations are especially large in the near resonant basins we also show that the tidal seasonality has undergone dramatic changes in the past decades due the decaying extent of the arctic sea ice these seasonal decadal scale changes not only vary tidal dissipation on the shelf but also impact tides in the adjacent open ocean and therefore cannot be neglected keywords canadian arctic archipelago tide ocean modeling sea ice unstructured mesh seasonal variation arctic ocean 1 introduction the canadian arctic archipelago shown in fig 1 is a collection of islands located on the northern north american continental shelf it is known to be an important gateway for water ice and tidal energy exchange between the arctic ocean and north atlantic changes in the circulation of freshened seawater and ice through its narrow passages have the potential to influence both regional and global climate it can significantly affect the distribution of sea ice in the arctic recirculation of the surface waters and freshwater fluxes around greenland as well as the strength of ocean circulation in the atlantic joyce and proshutinsky 2007 accurate tide prediction is crucial for many purposes such as investigating the variability of the sea surface currents and eddy activities tidal motion influences the turbulent mixing and heat anomalies required for polynya formation and therefore affects sea ice properties and distribution wang et al 2003 makinson et al 2011 furevik and foldvik 1996 have shown that near critical latitude the boundary layer thickens and it encompasses the entire water column at critical latitude the thickened boundary layer imparts vertical shears in the horizontal velocities to more of the water column and can lead to mixing as a result of the increased baroclinicity of the water column due to internal tides enhanced mixing resonant effects with the inertial frequency even weak tidal regimes play a significant role in ice shelf melting when they are subject to critical latitude effects robertson 2013 while global ocean tide models improved dramatically in the recent years due to combination of data assimilation based on satellite altimetry analysis with sophisticated hydrodynamic assimilation modeling the accurate representation of shallow water depth 1000 m and high latitude polewards from 66 tides still remain a challenge cheng and andersen 2011 stammer et al 2014 the model limitations in polar regions arise from a poorly known bathymetry and relatively sparse and poor quality data for model validation and assimilation another source of errors is the ice induced seasonal variability of the tidal constituents which is insufficiently studied the existing tidal models represent an annual mean state of the tidal constants the presence of ice cover and its effects are often ignored completely or represented via imposing a stationary mean ice concentration field the rationale behind this is that the ice induced changes do not exceed the model errors this conclusion is however drawn based only on a few tide gauge records along the white sea coastline off the siberian continental shelf and in the canadian arctic henry and foreman 1977 murty and polavarapu 1979 godin and barber 1980 murty 1985 prinsenberg 1988 st laurent et al 2008 there is no data and there are only a few numerical studies dedicated to the temporal variability of tidal constants on a larger scale kowalik 1981 saucier et al 2004 kagan and romanenkov 2007 kagan et al 2007 kagan and sofina 2010 müller et al 2014 the majority of the mentioned studies only compare winter and summer january vs september regimes none of them show monthly variations of the tidal constituents and cover the complete area considered here in this paper a new tidal model of the canadian arctic archipelago including baffin bay hudson strait and hudson bay is developed and validated against available observations the simulations were performed using adcirc unstructured model modified to account for the presence of an under ice frictional layer unlike other existing models the user defined ice concentration field used to calculate the ice ocean drag coefficient is assumed to vary in time fig 2 since the majority of the available tide gauge records are too short to account for the tide seasonality only a part of the simulated time series corresponding to the specific tidal record was used for comparison after the initial model validation step seasonality of the tidal constants in the entire domain was assessed by means of monthly harmonic analysis the modelled variations were compared to the observations at a number of tide gauges with records spanning multiple years the model behaviour in the hudson bay hudson strait regions was also compared to the analytical model of the semi diurnal response developed by cummins et al 2010 although the model does not account for a separate quarter wavelength resonance exited at leaf basin in ungava bay it gives a good indication of the range of semi diurnal amplitude variation that can be expected in the resonant system due to the additional friction associated with the seasonal ice cover estimates of m2 tidal energy dissipation from topex poseidon altimeter data by egbert and ray 2001 has shown that the most important region of the world ocean for dissipating tidal energy is the area around hudson bay high energy dissipation on a shelf is usually associated with tidal resonances indeed results of webb 2014 indicate that the hudson bay region has four significant resonances close to and straddling the semi diurnal tidal band here we show that additional friction associated with the seasonally varying ice cover significantly influences tidal constants in the hudson bay region including baffin bay and canadian arctic straits this in turn changes the amount of energy dissipated in the hudson bay and thus has potential to introduce seasonal variations of tides in the northern labrador sea the paper is organized as follows section 2 gives a short description of adcirc including the implementation of the ice ocean integration design of the numerical experiment observation data and error metrics used for the model validation model results are presented in sections 3 5 and summarized in section 6 extended model validation results are given in appendix 2 model description 2 1 description of the numerical method in this study we use a modified version of adcirc adcirc advanced circulation luettich and westerink 2004 a multi scale multi physics coastal circulation model that is widely used for a range of modeling applications the model runs on highly flexible unstructured triangular meshes and is therefore highly scalable with linear performance scaling up to 16 000 cores see e g dietrich et al 2012 adcirc is a continuous galerkin finite element shallow water model which utilizes the generalized wave continuity equation gwce formulation to determine the water levels velocities are obtained from the vertically integrated momentum equation in order to account for the under ice friction a potential damping mechanism that dissipates tidal energy is the friction produced at the interface between the ice and the ocean adcirc was modified as described below the ocean currents and sea ice interaction is usually represented through a simple quadratic stress proportional to the relative velocity between ice and water pease et al 1983 dissipation of long wave energy under drifting ice is negligible however during high ice concentration periods ice plates are confined by shorelines and their mobility is hampered the relative velocity between the ice and the tidal current increases and the stress becomes significant a practical approach to simulate under ice friction effect in a 2d model is combine the surface and bottom drag into a single friction parameter 1 c d c d b o t c d s u r f similarly to dunphy et al 2005 hannah et al 2008 and collins et al 2011 the ice ocean drag coefficient c d s u r f is computed based on the fractional sea ice coverage as 2 c d s u r f c d i c e m a x 0 2 a 1 2 where c d i c e 1 8 10 2 and a is the fractional sea ice coverage at the node of interest c d s u r f is zero for a 1 2 since ice floes are believed to move freely along with the surface waters the maximum value c d s u r f at a 1 accounts for increased friction due to the keel effect in ridged ice tang and fissel 1991 another important effect of ice cover is that it also acts as a barrier to the meteorological forcing of the water mass macklin 1983 and pease et al 1983 found that measurements of wind drag coefficients over first year sea ice typically yielded values that were significantly larger and varied less with wind speed than that predicted for open water it is important to account for the changes of wind drag coefficient due to presence of ice when modeling storm surges and the associated flooding however they are unlikely to have significant effect on the long term tidal constants and are therefore not considered in this study 2 2 model domain the size of the domain is determined not only by the complexity of geometry but also by the tidal dynamics in the area to ensure the correct development and propagation of tides open boundaries should be placed outside of the resonant basins and should not located near the tidal amphidromes the chosen model domain and bathymetry is shown in fig 1 the bathymetric data were extracted from the version 3 0 of international bathymetric chart of the arctic ocean ibcao jakobsson et al 2012 which includes new bathymetric data from a number of sources such as the fishing vessels us navy submarines and research ships from various nations for the areas south of 64 n not covered by ibcao data set the bottom heights were drawn from the gebco 2014 grid weatherall et al 2015 the model grid was produced using gmsh grid generator by geuzaine and remacle 2009 which was modified by van scheltinga et al 2012 to allow for efficient meshing of highly irregular oceanic domains the mesh has about 390 thousand nodes and 750 thousand triangular elements with resolution varying from approximately 300 m to 10 km 2 3 observation data over many years canada has carried out tidal recordings at many locations spread over the arctic archipelago a number of tide gauges were operated for long periods of time however the majority of observations were collected during short campaigns run in the late 1970s 80s and typically cover time intervals of 30 to 80 days since the installation of tidal instruments during the short summer season is often hindered by moving ice floes and bergs and the uncertainty of finding open water the majority of short term tidal records have been collected using instruments deployed in the winter through the ice cover tait et al 1986 conditions suitable for operation usually occur in a two month window between mid to late february and late april to early may depending on latitude most of the observed water level data are available for download from a digital data inventory at the marine environmental data service meds fisheries and oceans canada in order to provide broad spatial coverage we chose to use records with length of at least 29 days the tidal constituents were calculated from the water level time series using utide package codiga 2011 additionally the tidal constants were extracted from collins et al 2011 chen et al 2009 and the danish tidal office report farvandsvæsenet 2000 locations of the tide gauges used for model validation are depicted in the top panel of the fig 3 and together with the record period there known are listed in the supplement the fact that the tide gauge data were acquired during different periods and that the majority of the records are very short and do not account for the tidal seasonality poses a problem for comparison with the model result to overcome the difficulty only a part of the simulated time series corresponding to a specific tidal record the same length and season was used for comparison during the model step we believe this approach also helps to eliminate possible errors associated with short record length similarly to collins et al 2011 for the purpose of reporting statistics the archipelago was divided into a number of regions based on the tidal range the regions are defined in table 1 and tide gauges belonging to different regions are shown in different colours in fig 3 for evaluation of the tidal currents in the central arctic archipelago we use stations from collins et al 2011 fig 3 shows approximate locations of the moorings 2 4 simulation parameters and boundary settings the simulation is forced by prescribing the tidal motion on the open boundaries the amplitude and phases of the 8 major constituents were compiled from tpxo8v1 atlas and two versions of fes global tide models the tpxo8v1 atlas is the current version of a global model of ocean tides obtained with otis osu tidal inversion software the methods used to compute the model are described in detail by egbert et al 1994 and further by egbert and erofeeva 2002 the fes finite element solution tide models lyard et al 2006 carrère et al 2013 are based on the resolution of the tidal barotropic equations t ugo model in a spectral configuration the ice concentration field used by the model is shown in fig 2 the data are drawn from walsh et al 2015 monthly gridded sea ice concentration product based on observations from historical sources from 1850 onward for each month we take a median value of the respective monthly ice concentrations from the period between january 1961 and december 1990 that is every pane of fig 2 represents a median of the 30 monthly values the chosen period corresponds to the date range when majority of the observations were collected we have used the median rather than mean or a single year concentration to reduce the effect of extreme years on the final field the drawback of this approach is the possibility to increase the model errors in the areas where the ice induced seasonal and decadal variations are significant adcirc was run in barotropic two dimensional depth integrated 2ddi mode using the fully consistent gwce and momentum equation formulations a quadratic friction law was used with friction coefficient c d b o t set to 0 0025 following dupont et al 2002 and dunphy et al 2005 the model was run for 383 days which included 17 days of spin up time 2 5 error metrics to assess the quality of a tidal model an error metric has to be specified similarly to dunphy et al 2005 we use a single metric which combines both elevation and phase error and allows us to measure how well each constituent was modelled at each station and for each constituent the error is defined as the magnitude of the observed constituent minus the modelled constituent evaluated in the complex plane 3 e r r h 0 e i ϕ 0 h m e i ϕ m where h 0 ϕ 0 are the observed amplitude and phase and hm ϕm are the modelled values to evaluate the solutions for one constituent over broader areas the root mean square rms values over regions defined in table 1were calculated 3 model validation tidal amplitudes vary from a few centimeters in the west along the arctic shelf to over 1 m in the eastern areas of the archipelago generally the m2 component is the largest with the exception of boothia bay where the k1 diurnal tide dominates fig 4 the tidal motion in the canadian arctic archipelago primarily originates from the tides in the atlantic ocean the mainly semi diurnal tidal signal enters the hudson strait at the eastern entrance with an amplitude about 3 m and reaches its maximum in leaf basin further the tidal wave propagates westward though the strait around the coast of hudson bay in an anti clockwise direction and forms two amphidromic points in the west central and east central parts of the bay and a degenerate one in james bay the maximum m2 tidal amplitude of 1 25 m occurs along the west coast of hudson bay a small portion of the tidal signal entering through the labrador sea flows into baffin bay forming an amphidromic system there the semi diurnal tidal wave propagates north along the west coast of greenland reaches the maximum amplitude of over 1 m in kane basin and enters the archipelago through barrow strait 3 1 comparison with the tide gauges the rms errors of the 8 major constituents evaluated over each region are shown in fig 5 the prediction errors vary from region to region reflecting the regional tidal range however in some cases the regional errors are dominated by larger errors at few locations this is especially true for the k2 p1 and q1 tidal constituents due to partially missing data the largest regional errors for the semi diurnal constituents are observed in hudson strait ungava bay it is worth noting that the tidal range in ungava bay competes with the bay of fundy for the title of the world s highest tides o reilly et al 2005 the obtained regional rms error of 55 cm is about 21 of the local tidal range and is therefore acceptable errors for the diurnal tide constituents are dominated by the errors in the arctic south central and southeast regions the semi diurnal and diurnal tidal resonances in ungava bay and boothia bay respectively make these regions very sensitive to any inadequacy in bathymetric details and therefore difficult to model accurately the maps of the computed tidal characteristics together with the amplitude and phase errors at the tide gauge stations are shown in figs a 17 a 24 in general the model seems to under predict tidal amplitudes more often than over predict large amplitude errors for semi diurnal constituents around kane basin suggest that the nares strait is not properly resolved this can also contribute to the under prediction of the tidal amplitudes on the eastern part of devon island large phase errors in the arctic west region can indicate a problem with the open boundary forcing 3 2 tidal currents in the central region the comparison of the observed and modelled tidal ellipse parameters for m2 and k1 is shown in fig 6 as can be seen the modelled amplitude of the m2 major axis agrees quite well with the observations with the exception of the currents at hm1 hm2 and hm3 which are under predicted the largest errors in the amplitude of the modelled k1 major axis are again observed at the js2 and hm stations the model data comparison for the tidal currents shows the same strange features as in collins et al 2011 such as good agreement at js1 and poor at js2 large differences in phases at various locations etc in general the modeled and observed currents show reasonable agreement when the observations cover most of the water column and are for long periods of time that is some of the model data mismatch can be due to important seasonal changes in the tidal currents and important vertical structure in the tidal currents therefore a three dimensional model which accounts for vertical stratification and horizontal density gradients is required to address this issue 4 ice induced variability of tidal constants 4 1 seasonal variations of the tidal constants the ice induced variability of the tidal constituents are examined by partitioning the simulated yearly time series into slightly overlapping monthly segments and performing a harmonic analysis for each segment separately section appendix b shows a detailed comparison of the modelled and observed seasonal cycle of the m2 amplitude at a number of tide gauges tidal motion in the entire model domain exhibits a certain degree of variability as can be seen from fig 7 seasonal changes in the m2 amplitude i e the difference between maximum and minimum range between 5 and 10 cm in south baffin bay kane basin m clintock channel lancaster sound and norwegian bay the amplitude variations reach about 50 cm along the west coast of hudson bay and james bay southwest of foxe basin summer to winter changes in m2 amplitude exceeding 1 m are observed in roes welcome sound hudson strait and ungava bay as shown by arbic et al 2007 these regions are nearly resonant with the tidal forcing and therefore are very sensitive to the frictional effects of ice cover in the section 4 2 we will study the seasonality of the tidal dynamics in the hudson bay hudson strait system in more details month to month changes in the amplitude of m2 tidal constituent are shown in fig 8 month to month changes in the tidal phases shown in fig 9 are generally of order 10 20 degrees however in some locations the differences up to 180 degrees are observed these large phase variations are typically found in the vicinity of the amphidromic points and are due to their movement see video in supplementary material during the winter months the two amphidromic points in the west and east central parts of hudson bay move southward resulting in the earlier arrival of the tide this agrees with the theoretical considerations by prinsenberg 1988 the amphidrome in the baffin bay moves westward and the one to the south west of banks island moves towards the east 4 2 seasonality of tides in the hb hs system from the analytical model by cummins et al 2010 in this section we will use the simple analytical model by cummins et al 2010 to study seasonality of tides in the hudson bay hudson strait system cummins et al 2010 studied the semi diurnal response in the hudson bay hudson strait region by means of a simple model of a channel connected to an inner basin taking into account the mechanical impedance presented to the channel by hudson bay they have shown that the fundamental channel mode has a natural period of oscillations close to that of the semi diurnal tides the idealised model domain shown in fig 10 consists of a basin of a surface area ab connected to the ocean via a channel of uniform width w length l and depth h the channel is assumed to be sufficiently narrow so that rotational effects can be neglected assuming that water level and along channel velocity have a simple harmonic form h u h x u x e i ω t the linearized continuity equations can be combined with the along strait momentum equation to form the second order boundary value problem for the complex water level amplitude 4 d 2 h d x 2 k 2 h 0 here k 2 k 0 2 1 i δ is the complex wavenumber with k 0 2 ω 2 g h the linear drag coefficient r and the non dimensional channel friction parameter δ r ω the boundary condition for eq 4 at the channel entrance x 0 is 5 h 0 h 0 where h 0 is the amplitude of the sea level displacement associated with a prescribed incoming wave at the channel basin junction x l conservation of mass is required assuming that the amplitude of sea surface displacement averaged over the basin can be written in terms of the channel elevation at the basin junction as h b α h l this gives 6 d h d x α γ k 2 l h with γ a c a b the generally complex constant α represents basin impedance and is a function of frequency that depends on the size and geometry of the basin an appropriate value for α can be determined using results from the numerical tidal model solution of eq 4 subject to the boundary conditions 5 and 6 is derived by cummins et al 2010 and is given by 7 h x h 0 cos k x sin k l α k l γ cos k l cos k l α k l γ sin k l sin k x the water level elevation is then expressed in terms of an amplitude and phase as h x t h x cos ω t ϕ x with ϕ x atan2 i m h x r e h x the channel response to the tidal forcing given by eq 7 is governed by the amplitude of the forcing h 0 and three non dimensional parameters α γ δ and k 0 l depending on the forcing frequency the bottom drag coefficient and dimensions of the basin and channel the parameter γ representing ratio of the basin to channel area is set to 0 15 similarly to cummins et al 2010 we make an empirical estimate of α using results from the numerical model forced at the m2 frequency since the basin impedance is related to the dissipation of energy it could vary seasonally due to the additional friction associated with the ice cover we therefore estimated αsummer and αwinter from two model runs representing summer and winter conditions the value of c d i c e was set to 2 5 10 3 variation over an m2 tidal cycle of the modelled surface elevation averaged over the hudson bay foxe basin and along its junction with hudson strait is shown in fig 11 a these are related by the complex constants α a r g α s u m m e r 0 091 130 and α a r g α w i n t e r 0 088 127 for the summer and winter seasons respectively during the summer season the hudson strait hudson bay area is mostly ice free whereas during the winter season it is characterized by nearly 100 ice coverage the linear friction coefficient r cdu h was therefore calculated based on c d c d b o t 2 5 10 3 for the summer season and on c d c d b o t c d i c e 5 10 3 for the winter using a tidal speed of u 1 m s and the average channel depth h of 235 m for the semi diurnal frequency ω 1 4 10 4 these give δ 0 076 and 0 152 for summer and winter respectively inspecting the dependency of the sea level elevation at the middle of the channel on the value of k 0 l shown in fig 11 b gave the value of 2 7 at resonance the amplitude of the forcing at the mouth of the channel was set to 1 5 m fig 12 shows the amplitude of along channel displacement given by eq 7 with the parameters as defined above for the summer and winter seasons the analytical model predicts the maximum amplitude of 3 2 m in the summer 2 6 m in the winter to be found at x l 0 55 at the basin channel junction the amplitude is predicted to reduce from approximately 1 7 m in the summer to 1 4 m in the winter these values agree reasonably well with the results of the numerical model 3 05 m in the summer 2 55 m in the winter at the midchannel and 1 66 m 1 49 m at the basin channel junction using a taylor solution of a reflecting kelvin wave in a rectangular basin prinsenberg 1988 has demonstrated that the ice cover causes nearly the same amount of damping for the tides as that used to represent bottom friction the additional friction due to the ice cover causes about 10 m2 amplitude decrease at the churchill station assuming that the amplitude at the basin entrance does not change if as results above suggest amplitude of the m2 tide entering the hudson bay is reduced by 19 during winter then the amplitude at churchill should decrease by approximately 27 as can be seen from fig b 26 f dotted line the modelled amplitude reduces by 25 in january 100 ice coverage compared to september ice free period thus the amplitude reduction shown by the numerical model agrees very well with the simple analytical model of the channel resonance and reflected kelvin wave moreover arbic et al 2009 and arbic and garrett 2010 have shown that the open ocean tide can be affected generally reduced by the presence of a resonant shelf the back effect is especially large if the open ocean itself is close to resonance and the shelf friction is small therefore an increase of shelf friction due to presence of ice cover should lead to an increase in ocean tides in the northern labrador sea increased amplitudes of the m2 tidal constituent during winter months observed at nain and qaqortoq stations see fig b 26 g and h support these conjecture thus the discrepancy with the observed seasonal variations in the western hudson bay may be due to the forcing on the eastern entrance of the hudson strait which was kept constant by the domain s open boundary conditions therefore the range of seasonal variations of the tidal constants at the model domain open boundary and its influence on the tidal dynamics in the area needs to be further investigated this will be done in a separate paper 4 3 decadal scale variations of the ice induced tidal seasonality evidence of the climate change comes among others from the decrease in extent and thickness of the arctic sea ice stroeve et al 2007 comiso et al 2008 rothrock et al 1999 these changes could significantly impact the tidal dynamics in the canadian arctic archipelago in this section we explore how the ice induced tidal seasonality has changed in the course of the past six decades we used the model setup as described in section 2 4 with two different ice concentration fields shown in figs c 27 and c 28 the fields are drawn from walsh et al 2015 and correspond to the periods from 1958 to 1962 and from 2008 to 2012 fig 13 depicts the difference in the monthly ice concentration between the periods during the winter months the area remains fully ice covered with the exception of the northern labrador sea which remains ice free throughout the year the extent of the winter ice changed only slightly between the lustrums the ice started to melt approximately a month earlier and the extent of summer ice decreased significantly in the 2008 2012 period compared to the period of 1958 1962 although the areas which were ice free during the summer started to freeze later in the 2008 2012 period the ice cover formed faster as a result december ice concentrations in these areas were higher during the 2008 2012 period please note that the decadal scale results are sensitive to the quality of the early observations as described in walsh et al 2015 the data for the earlier period depends on ship logs and naval records the resulting monthly m2 amplitudes and phases for both periods are shown in figs c 29 c 32 changes in the monthly amplitudes shown in fig 14 reflect closely the changes in the monthly ice concentrations lower ice concentrations result in higher amplitudes and vise versa the largest amplitude differences are predicted in the hudson strait hudson bay area as we have shown earlier the area is very sensitive to friction due to its closeness to resonance with the semi diurnal tidal frequencies the amplitude increase of 12 cm is predicted in june of 2008 2012 comparing to june of 1958 1962 correspond to the earlier melting of ice during that period faster freezing during the 2008 2012 period resulted in approximately 5 cm lower amplitudes along the western coast of hudson bay in november and december changes in the monthly m2 phases are shown in fig 15 yellow red colours indicate that the tide arrived later in the 2008 2012 period than in 1958 1962 the relation between the ice concentrations and the phase of the tide is more complicated decreased ice concentrations could lead to later as well as earlier arrival of tide depending on the wave form of the tide in a specific area if the tide propagates more or less along a straight coast then decrease in the ice friction will lead to an increase of the phase velocity prinsenberg 1988 the increased phase velocity causes an advancement of the arrival time as predicted in the arctic west northwest central and south central regions from july to august of 2008 2012 see fig 3 and table 1 for the definition of the regions in hudson bay the earlier melting and reduced july august ice friction causes the amphidromic points to be located more northward compared to the 1958 1962 period this causes delay in arrival of the tide along the hudson bay west coast during the summer of 2008 2012 the opposite is predicted in november and december due to the faster freezing 5 tidal mixing tides have long been recognized to be an important mixing mechanism in shallow seas positions of tidal mixing fronts are commonly identified using a stratification parameter originally developed by simpson and hunter 1974 for thermally stratified seas however as shown by bowman and esaias 1981 it can be considered a general parameter relating a constant buoyancy input to tidal mixing energy irregardless of the nature of the input therefore despite the fact that fresh water addition via ice melting or river run off has large effect on the density structure in the canadian arctic archipelago the parameter can also be used to identify tidal mixing front positions here drinkwater and jones 1987 rudels et al 1991 here we calculated distribution of the tidal mixing parameter as defined by pingree and griffiths 1978 λ log 10 h c d u s 3 where h denotes the water depth cd is the bottom drag coefficient and us is the depth averaged tidal stream velocity amplitude the root mean square rms of tidal currents were reconstructed from the eight tidal constituents as given by the model for the winter january to march and summer august to october periods the drag coefficient cd was calculated according to eq 1 using the ice concentration field shown in fig 2 although the tidal currents vary significantly throughout the year the larger part of the domain has values of λ greater than 2 for both winter and summer periods indicating a stratified water column the well mixed areas λ 1 are found in the southeast of foxe basin along the southwest coast of hudson bay and james bay ungava bay and in several areas with narrow channels or shallow sills shown in fig 16 these are the areas with strong tidal currents and tidal energy dissipation the upward heat transfer which occurs through vertical mixing of warmer deep water towards the surface can enhance melting of the ice cover or even prevent ice from forming smith et al 1990 therefore as shown by hannah et al 2008 the parameter λ can be used to identify areas where tidal mixing can contribute to the formation and maintenance of the sensible heat polynyas for both the maximum summer and minimum winter stream velocity magnitude the tidal mixing parameter λ is found to be less than 2 in many areas where recurring polynyas are known to form see for example barber and massom 2007 our study indicate that besides the ones shown in hannah et al 2008 a polynya in roes welcome sound akimiski strait frobisher bay and two polynyas in foxe basin could be of tidal nature 6 discussion tidal models have undergone a dramatic improvement since the first topex poseidon satellite altimeter mission was launched the open ocean barotropic tides in the latitude band covered by the altimeters are now known with about 98 accuracy 0 5 0 7 cm error compared to a signal of 30 cm although our knowledge of shelf and coastal tides has also advanced in the recent years the relative errors here are still much higher up to 16 according to stammer et al 2014 than for open ocean barotropic tides significant efforts are required to develop an accurate tidal model of each specific shelf coastal region this is especially true for the high latitude areas such as canadian arctic archipelago considered here besides issues common to the majority of shelf regions such as uncertainties in bathymetric data and sparse observations the presence of seasonally varying ice cover poses additional difficulties here a tidal prediction system for the canadian arctic archipelago has been completed for the eight major constituents m2 n2 s2 k2 k1 o1 p1 and q1 using adcirc boundary conditions are a combination of fes2004 2012 and tpxo8 global solutions the rms error of the tidal constituents averaged over the entire model domain is about 21 cm for m2 and 8 5 6 5 11 1 and 5 cm for s2 n2 k2 o1 k1 q1 and p1 respectively the errors for the semi diurnal constituents are dominated by the errors in the hudson strait ungava bay system the poorly known bathymetry is an important factor which limits accuracy of the tidal modeling in this resonant area in order to study the ice induced variability of the tidal constants the simulated water level time series were partitioned into monthly segments and analysed separately the analysis shows that the tidal dynamics of the entire model domain are subject to seasonal variations larger phase differences are often observed in the vicinity of the amphidromic points and are caused by their relocation the larger amplitude differences are observed in the resonant basins these are also the areas where the seasonal variations have changed significantly in the past six decades more specifically earlier melting of ice in the hudson bay hudson strait area during the last decade resulted in up to 12 cm amplitude increase in june compared to early 60s note also that large rms error of the m2 tidal constituent in the region can be partially attributed to this change discrepancy between the observed and modelled seasonal variability of the tidal constants in the hudson bay system could be due to the open boundary conditions which were assumed to be independent of the coastal dynamics it was shown by arbic et al 2009 and arbic and garrett 2010 that continental shelfs can significantly impact tides in the deep ocean especially if the shelf region is close to resonance with tidal forcing as shown by webb 2014 tidal dynamics in the hudson bay system are dominated by four nearly overlapping tidal resonances these resonances acting together make the region around hudson bay including the labrador sea baffin bay and canadian arctic straits the most important area for tidal energy dissipation egbert and ray 2001 chevalier et al 2013 has demonstrated using the fes2012 hydrodynamic solution that the tidal dissipation in hudson bay is crucial for the accuracy of global tidal solutions especially in the atlantic varying ice cover seasonally changes tidal dissipation in the hudson bay area and therefore not only modifies tidal characteristics locally but also impacts tides in the remote areas tidal seasonality in the subarctic ocean is also evident from the satellite altimeter data fig 1 from fok et al 2013 clearly shows that ssh anomaly residual during the winter season is 15 30 larger than that during the summer season this also means that the accuracy of the global tidal solutions can vary significantly between the seasons therefore the ice induced seasonal and decadal variations of barotropic tides remains an outstanding subject for further research acknowledgments the authors would like to thank david greenberg and florent lyard for their detailed comments on an early stage of this paper we are immensely grateful to van scheltinga arjen terwisscha van scheltinga for his help with generation of the grid we would also like to show our gratitude to joannes westerink and the

this work is financed by the netherlands organisation for scientific research nwo appendix a comparison with the tide gauges figs a 17 a 24 show the maps of the computed tidal characteristics together with the amplitude and phase errors at the tide gauge stations a colour scale shown to the left of every figure refers to the amplitude phase range of the tidal constituents the absolute amplitude phase error values are shown by means of triangular markers coloured according to the colour scale on the figure s right a triangle pointing upward indicates that the observed amplitude phase exceeds the modelled value under prediction and a downward pointing triangle indicates that the modelled amplitude phase exceeds the observed one over prediction appendix b ice induced variability of tidal constants comparison to observations to assess ability of the model to reproduce seasonality of the tidal constants a number of tide gauges with records spanning multiple years were selected the approximate locations of the tide gauges are shown in fig b 25 monthly elevations of m2 tide obtained from the tide gauge records are plotted against the model results in fig b 26 here we used two different values for the ice drag coefficient defined in eq 2 namely c d i c e 1 8 10 2 the value used throughout this paper dashed line and c d i c e 2 5 10 3 as typically used in global tidal models for the fast ice cells dotted line in all cases the amplitude anomaly is shown relative to september the temporal variability of the m2 amplitude at the four most western stations is reproduced by the model reasonably well when the higher value of the ice drag coefficient is used there is however slight shift in the phase of the modulation for sachs harbor and ulukhaktok stations the amplitude variations at the cambridge bay are underestimated in both the cases whereas at the remaining stations it is highly overestimated the ice ocean drag coefficient is determined as a function of the undersurface sea ice roughness length since under surface sea ice roughness can vary considerably according to the estimation method and the level of the sea ice deformation so does the calculated drag coefficient the estimated value typically ranges from 1 32 10 3 to 26 8 10 3 see for example pease et al 1983 langleben 1982 and madsen and bruno 1987 moreover the aerodynamic properties of the ice cover change seasonally due to growth and decay for the numerical model however a single value of the ice ocean drag coefficient is chosen by the modeler and is kept constant for the entire duration of the simulation a possibility to include space and time varying ice ocean drag coefficient requires additional research appendix c decadal scale variations of the ice induced tidal

24099,many state of the art coupled sea ice ocean models use atmospheric and oceanic drag coefficients that are at best a function of the atmospheric stability but otherwise constant in time and space constant drag coefficients might lead to an incorrect representation of the ice air and ice ocean momentum exchange since observations of turbulent fluxes imply high variability of drag coefficients we compare three model runs two with constant drag coefficients and one with drag coefficients varying as function of sea ice characteristics the computed drag coefficients range between 0 88 10 3 and 4 68 10 3 for the atmosphere and between 1 28 10 3 and 13 68 10 3 for the ocean they fall in the range of observed drag coefficients and illustrate the interplay of ice deformation and ice concentration in different seasons and regions the introduction of variable drag coefficients improves the realism of the model simulation in addition using the average values of the variable drag coefficients improves simulations with constant drag coefficients when drag coefficients depend on sea ice characteristics the average sea ice drift speed in the arctic basin increases from 6 22 cm s 1 to 6 64 cm s 1 this leads to a reduction of ice thickness in the entire arctic and particularly in the lincoln sea with a mean value decreasing from 7 86 m to 6 62 m variable drag coefficients lead also to a deeper mixed layer in summer and to changes in surface salinity surface temperatures in the ocean are also affected by variable drag coefficients with differences of up to 0 06 c in the east siberian sea small effects are visible in the ocean interior keywords drag coefficients momentum fluxes arctic sea ice atmosphere sea ice ocean interaction deformation energy surface roughness length cost function 1 introduction the recently observed changes in arctic sea ice rothrock et al 1999 serreze et al 2003 2007 stroeve et al 2007 2012a 2012b laxon et al 2013 haas et al 2008 rabenstein et al 2010 castellani et al 2014 feed back into the global climate because sea ice is coupled to atmosphere and oceans sea ice insulates the oceans from the polar atmosphere it contributes to the ice albedo feedback mechanism curry et al 1995 and while drifting it exerts a drag on the oceanic surface layer this drag fluxes momentum into the ocean the momentum fluxes between ice and ocean affect the upper surface circulation with consequences for the interior ocean circulation and the outflow into the nordic seas as well as the pacific and atlantic ocean proshutinsky and johnson 1997 rudels et al 2005 latarius and quadfasel 2010 proshutinsky et al 2009 understanding the dynamic coupling between ice atmosphere and ocean requires a detailed representation of the momentum fluxes in this work we aim to contribute to improving the representation of physical processes in coupled sea ice ocean models by investigating how numerical simulations are affected by a description of ice atmosphere and ice ocean coupling that accounts for the sea ice roughness most sea ice codes resolve both dynamic and thermodynamic processes the sea ice momentum equations are solved for drift velocities that are then used to advect the ice variables the drift velocities also determine the stress acting on the ocean in most sea ice models hibler 1979 hunke 2010 both the atmospheric drag and the oceanic drag are described by a quadratic relationship see also the arctic ocean model intercomparison project aomip protocol proshutinsky et al 2001 depending on the relative velocity between atmospheric wind ocean currents and sea ice drift the intensity of the air ice and ocean ice interactions are described by the transfer coefficients called air drag coefficient ca and ocean drag coefficient cw these coefficients depend on sea ice surface characteristics table 1 lists direct observations of atmospheric drag coefficients and indirect estimates from linear castellani et al 2014 and 3d petty et al 2017 surface profiles all at a reference height of 10 m and oceanic drag coefficients that are generally referenced to geostrophic currents lu et al 2011 many sea ice models in coupled gcms today use constant drag coefficients thus they do not account for their observed spatial and temporal variability hunke et al 2010 in recent years many parameterizations have been developed to relate sea ice surface characteristics to drag coefficients garbrecht et al 2002 birnbaum and luepkes 2002 lüpkes and birnbaum 2005 lüpkes et al 2012 2013 andreas et al 2010 lu et al 2011 and some of these parameterizations have been implemented in numerical models for example tsamados et al 2014 present the results of a simulation with the los alamos sea ice model cice where some of the mentioned parameterizations are used to compute the atmospheric and oceanic neutral drag coefficients as a function of floe edges ridges and melt ponds moreover cice includes instability effects of the upper surface layer over sea ice thus the neutral atmospheric drag coefficient is corrected for the stability that depends on the thickness distribution hunke et al 2015 the approach of tsamados et al 2014 requires a dynamic ice thickness distribution itd as well as an explicit description of ridges and melt ponds formation flocco and felthman 2007 flocco et al 2010 and tracers of deformed ice and melt ponds in a different approach steiner et al 1999 steiner 2001 deformation energy accounts for surface roughness the deformation energy depends on the history of the mechanical deformation of sea ice and on changes in its thickness the drag coefficients are parameterized as a function of the deformation energy and of ice concentration steiner 2001 with this formulation it is possible to implement drag coefficients in sea ice models without additional parameterizations for ridges and melt ponds formation tsamados et al 2014 and steiner 2001 used stand alone sea ice models but variations of oceanic drag coefficients also affect the oceanic momentum through the drag coefficients and the drift velocities of the ice that are themselves functions of the atmospheric and oceanic stress for example castellani et al 2015 showed based on an idealized experiment that variations in the ekman vertical velocity associated with variable oceanic drag coefficients are on the same order of magnitude as the variations due to changes in the surface velocity of the ice roy et al 2015 compare simulations using different air ice and ocean ice roughness they show effects on the general features of sea ice concentration thickness drift and also on the liquid and solid fresh water budget of the arctic ocean in particular increased ice ocean roughness leads to higher arctic fresh water budget by increasing fresh water retention in the beaufort gyre martin et al 2014 investigate changes in momentum transfer to the ocean as consequence of ice thickness and areal extent decrease they conclude that the weaker ice cover in fall winter and spring and the increase in open water fraction in summer cause trends in the momentum transfer over the last three decades in a more recent work martin et al 2016 analyze the effects that the introduction of variable drag coefficients in numerical models have on the trend of annual mean ocean surface stress they show that a decrease in surface roughness over the years leads to a decline in surface ocean stress they conclude that a proper investigation of the trend of the air to ocean momentum transfer in presence of sea ice requires to represent sea ice surface variations in the present study we investigate how atmospheric and oceanic drag coefficients that depend on the degree of sea ice deformation and on ice concentration affect sea ice distribution and ocean circulation in a numerical model we follow the steiner 2001 deformation energy approach and apply it to a coupled sea ice ocean model we focus on the simulated sea ice properties but also on effects on and changes in the ocean circulation with the aim to investigate 1 which of the main physical parameters describing the large scale sea ice cover ice concentration thickness and drift is affected the most and 2 in which regions of the arctic these changes are more prominent finally we aim to 3 quantify to what extent the ocean is affected in section 2 we introduce the model configuration and the implemented parameterizations we also describe the sensitivity study performed to select the set of parameters used in the numerical experiment the results for sea ice and ocean are presented in section 3 and then discussed in section 4 a summary and conclusions follow in section 5 2 methods 2 1 model description and setup we use the massachusetts institute of technology general circulation model mitgcm marshall et al 1997 in a coupled ocean sea ice arctic ocean configuration the configuration is similar to the naosim configuration of karcher et al 2011 and was already described in castro morales et al 2014 the domain covers the arctic ocean the nordic seas and the north atlantic down to approximately 50 n fig 1 the horizontal resolution of 1 4 corresponds to 28 km on a rotated spherical grid with the equator passing though the north pole in the vertical the domain is discretized in 33 levels with thickness ranging from 10 m at the surface to 350 m at depth vertical mixing in the ocean is parameterized by a k profile parameterization kpp scheme large et al 1994 and tracers are advected with an unconditionally stable seventh order monotonicity preserving scheme daru and tenaud 2004 that requires no explicit diffusivity the mixed layer depth is diagnosed based on a density criterion kara et al 2000 to apply this criterion densities are linearly interpolated between model layers to determine the depth at which the density increases above a critical density relative to the surface density in strong stratification where density in the second layer is already much higher than in the first layer this can lead to mixed layer depths smaller than the 10 m of the surface layer thickness the model variable density is located at the center of the grid cells so that the topmost density is at 5 m depth the minimum mixed layer depth is thus 5 m the ocean model is coupled with a dynamic thermodynamic sea ice model losch et al 2010 the sea ice model of the mitgcm uses a viscous plastic rheology and so called zero layer thermodynamics i e zero heat capacity formulation semtner 1976 with a prescribed ice thickness distribution hibler 1979 1980 1984 castro morales et al 2014 in order to compute the net heat flux through the ice the latter is redistributed into seven ice thickness categories between 0 and a maximum thickness of twice the mean thickness the heat fluxes are computed individually for each thickness and then summed the shape of the distribution of these seven thicknesses is flat normalized and fixed in time see hibler 1984 castro morales et al 2014 their fig 1 we also use the same parameterization for the snow distribution in the present configuration the model does not include a dynamic ice thickness distribution itd the model is forced by realistic atmospheric fields we use data of the coordinated ocean research experiment core version 2 large and yeager 2009 for the spin up and the ncep climate forecast system version 2 saha et al 2014 for the analyzed simulations a monthly climatology of river runoff for the main arctic rivers follows the aomip protocol proshutinsky et al 2001 the model is spun up from the first day of january 1948 to the last day of december 1978 in a baseline control configuration with constant drag coefficients the subsequent simulations are forced with ncep reanalysis data saha et al 2014 from the first day of january 1979 to the last day of december 2010 2 2 parameterization of atmospheric and oceanic drag coefficients sea ice motion is determined mainly by three forces the internal stresses in the ice the atmospheric drag force and the oceanic drag force steele et al 1989 the momentum equations for the atmospheric drag τ a and the oceanic drag τ w are expressed through a quadratic drag relationship 1 τ a ρ a c a u a u r a u a u 2 τ w ρ w c w u w u r w u w u where ρa and ρw are the densities of air and sea water the drag depends on the relative velocities u a w u where u a is the atmospheric wind u w is the ocean current and u is the ice drift the ocean atmosphere rotation matrix rw ra accounts for unresolved ekman layers ca and cw are the transfer coefficients for momentum called air drag coefficient and water drag coefficient from the monin obukhov similarity theory and a stability corrected logarithmic profile garbrecht et al 2002 they can be expressed as 3 c d k l n z r z 0 ψ m z r l 2 where d a for the atmosphere and d w for the ocean zr is a reference height usually 10 m for the atmosphere or the depth at which the current equals geostrophic flow for the ocean lu et al 2011 z 0 is the roughness length of sea ice ψm is the dyer businger stability function l the monin obukhov length and k the von karman constant in case of neutral conditions eq 3 reduces to the expression for the neutral drag coefficients 4 c d n k l n z r z 0 2 the roughness length z 0 changes regionally and temporally due to the presence and formation of topographic elements over under the ice variability in z 0 implies variability in c d n in this study we focus on the neutral drag coefficients that is for the case of neutral stratification of the fluid water and air in the following the term drag coefficients always refer to neutral drag coefficients except when stated otherwise in the baseline configuration the sea ice ocean model runs with constant atmospheric and oceanic drag coefficients c a 1 10 3 and c w 5 4 10 3 the latter value corresponds the geostrophic drag coefficient proposed by mcphee 2008 these values are the results of an optimization procedure nguyen et al 2011 and were already used in the present model configuration castro morales et al 2014 they correspond to a roughness length z 0 of 5 10 5 m for the atmosphere ice interface and 22 10 3 m for the ocean ice interface in order to arrive at drag coefficients that depend on sea ice topography we introduce the deformation energy r as a prognostic variable into the sea ice model the deformation energy represents the sea ice roughness and evolves in time steiner et al 1999 deformation energy changes with the work of internal forces in the ice eint and with melting martin 2007 5 d r d t e i n t r min m 0 where m is the same melting rate that is used to thermodynamically change the ice volume divided by the ice thickness by definition m is negative during melting and positive during freezing the term eint is derived as the scalar product of the stress tensor σ and the strain rate tensor ɛ rothrock 1975 martin 2007 6 e int σ ɛ σ i ɛ i σ ii ɛ ii where 7 ɛ i ɛ 11 ɛ 22 ɛ i i ɛ 11 ɛ 22 2 4 ɛ 12 2 and 8 σ i 1 2 σ 11 σ 22 σ i i 1 2 σ 11 σ 22 2 4 σ 12 2 are invariants of the strain rate tensor ɛ and of the stress tensor σ rothrock 1975 this formulation for the deformation energy was previously implemented in uncoupled sea ice models steiner et al 1999 martin 2006 2007 many studies focusing on the dependency of neutral drag coefficients on surface roughness e g garbrecht et al 1999 2002 lüpkes et al 2012 2013 lüpkes and gryanik 2015 are based on the partitioning approach by arya 1973 1975 according to this approach the neutral drag coefficient is given as the sum of a skin drag accounting for small scale roughness and a form drag accounting for the influence of large obstacles due to a pressure difference before and behind the obstacle this can be written as 9 c d c d skin c d form the form drag is usually expressed based on geometric consideration of the obstacles such as ridges garbrecht et al 1999 2002 melt ponds and ice floes lüpkes et al 2012 2013 lüpkes and gryanik 2015 following steiner 2001 the drag coefficients are expressed as a function of deformation energy r and ice concentration a 10 c a r a b a m a r d a 1 4 a 1 2 2 11 c w r a b w m w r d w 1 4 a 1 2 2 the skin drag the terms ba and bw in eqs 10 and 11 accounts for small scale roughness and it is chosen following steiner 2001 according to the lowest observed drag coefficients b a 0 8 10 3 and b w 1 2 10 3 see e g shirasawa and aota 1991 shirasawa and ingram 1991 wamser and martinson 1993 the form drag accounts for large scale obstacles and it is parameterized as a function of deformation energy r second term on the right hand side of eqs 10 and 11 and of ice concentration third term on the right hand side of eqs 10 and 11 according to eqs 10 and 11 the drag coefficients increase linearly with the deformation energy and depend quadratically on ice concentration with a maximum of da dw at a 0 5 50 ice concentration see also fig 1 in steiner 2001 initially the values of the parameters ma mw da and dw are set to the values optimized via comparison with observed buoy drift velocities steiner 2001 see also table 2 in section 2 3 they are optimized by performing a quantitative comparison with sea ice observations note that in this configuration the deformation energy does not affect the sea ice or the ocean directly because the sea ice model does not employ a dynamic ice thickness distribution itd as in e g ungermann et al 2017 this means that we do not redistribute the ice between thickness categories according to variations of deformation energy the only feedback on the physics of the model is through the atmospheric and oceanic drag coefficients that enter the momentum equations of the sea ice and of the ocean even without an itd which may increase the general realism of the simulation ungermann et al 2017 the main feedback we would expect in the context of the drag coefficients is present in our model the shape of the itd is not enough to distinguish between an ensemble of flat thermodynamically grown floes with different thicknesses and comparably low drag coefficients or an ice pack with a high coverage of melt ponds pressure ridges and floe edges and comparably high drag coefficients for this reason even very detailed parameterizations of variable drag coefficients have only indirect connections between the itd and the drag coefficients via intermediate variables tsamados et al 2014 but the main feedback we would expect in this context is included in the model when ice ridges its thickness increases which should make it harder to deform yet at the same time the pressure ridges lead to a higher drag coefficient that should increase the deformation of already thick ice 2 3 choice of parameters eqs 10 and 11 contain 6 parameters ba bw ma mw da and dw the skin drags ba and bw are directly constrained by observations e g shirasawa and aota 1991 shirasawa and ingram 1991 wamser and martinson 1993 in order to find the best set of parameter values for ma mw da and dw we compare the model results with observations in a sensitivity study to evaluate our model results quantitatively we use a cost function from satellite observations as a measure for model quality ungermann et al 2017 in a second step we use a green s functions approach to obtain a set of optimal parameters for details see menemenlis et al 2005 ungermann et al 2017 the cost function for a given variable concentration thickness drift in a given time frame month season is defined as 12 f var i 1 n var 1 2 x i y i 2 n var ξ i 2 where yi is a single observation xi the model estimate at the same position and time and ξi the measurement uncertainty of this observation n var is the number of observations of the respective variable so that the contribution of each variable is normalized in table 3 we present the cost function for the different data sets and seasons that is the sum over the amount of data available for a specific variable in a certain time frame the total cost function is the sum of all contributions most if not all data assimilation and optimization methods e g massonnet et al 2014 roach et al 2018 are based on minimizing a cost function similar to ours the methods differ in the way the errors are treated and how the minimum of the cost function is found for example an ensemble kalman filter allows to estimate the error covariances of the state during the optimization procedure and use this information to refine the results e g massonnet et al 2014 the cost function can be linearized and an optimal set of parameters can be found with approximated gradient information for example with a gauss newton method roach et al 2018 in our approach all prior covariance information about the unknown parameters is neglected and the cost function is constructed with a diagonal error covariance matrix from the error estimates of the observations this allows us to use the green s function approach and to explicitly calculate an optimal set of parameters in each step without an additional line search that would be necessary in the more generally applicable gauss newton method we use four different datasets 1 the reprocessed concentration dataset from osisaf eumetsat ocean and sea ice satellite application facility 2011 and its error estimates 1979 2009 2 the icesat jpl thickness product kwok and cunningham 2008 with a local error estimated as in kauker et al 2015 yet with an upper limit of 1 m for the uncertainty march as well as october november 2003 2008 3 the osisaf winter sea ice drift lavergne et al 2010 october to april 2002 2006 and 4 the summer sea ice drift from kimura et al 2013 may to july 2003 2007 which both use passive microwave satellite data with error estimates of sumata et al 2014 2015 for ice concentration we compute the cost function separately for winter and for summer and for ice thickness separately for march and november the choice of model parameters follows nguyen et al 2011 their table 2 they include albedo dry ice wet ice dry snow wet snow air ice drag and similar with the other drags ice strength lead closing vertical diffusivity salt plume and a river runoff factor this set of parameters with a model configuration identical to ours was shown to yield simulations consistent with observations see castro morales et al 2014 their fig 7 since our main interest is in the drag coefficients we focus our sensitivity study only on the parameters ma mw da and dw in eqs 10 and 11 in table 2 we list the values of the original parameters and the final values after two optimization cycles in this study we compare three different model runs drags using the optimized parameters to compute variable drag coefficients mean using constant drag coefficients to keep the nansen number na ρ a c a ρ w c w comparable we use the mean values from drags as constant drag coefficients see table 4 and ctrl using constant drag coefficients with the original values castro morales et al 2014 the cost function values of these configurations are given in table 3 while our main results are obtained from a model to model comparison we show a qualitative comparison with observations of ice concentration and ice thickness for the drags run as results of the optimization procedure fig 2 to demonstrate the realism of our coupled ice ocean model the most remarkable model biases are an overestimation of the ice edge in the fram strait especially in winter and a dipole pattern in the thickness field march rmse 0 69 november rmse 0 59 with a thick bias in the barents sea and the east siberian sea and a thin bias over the central arctic both a common problem of many models of comparable complexity stroeve et al 2014 these model data comparisons place the realism of our model configuration well in the range of cmip5 sea ice components 3 results in this section we present results for climatologies obtained from the first day of january 1990 to the last day of december 2010 the first ten years 1979 1989 of the simulations are not used because during this time the model adapts to the new forcing and to the new physics we focus our analysis on the months of march maximum sea ice extent and september minimum sea ice extent the model domain with the following regions is shown in fig 1 lincoln sea ls central arctic ac beaufort sea bs east siberian sea ess and laptev sea laps 3 1 simulated deformation energy and drag coefficients values for deformation energy in the arctic basin vary between 20 and 300 kj m2 fig 3 lower values are found towards the marginal sea ice zone miz whereas values higher than 300 kj m2 characterize the coastal areas along the north coast of greenland and the north coasts of the arctic canadian archipelago where ice is usually pushed against land and thus more deformed in the central arctic the values vary between 25 and 95 kj m2 in agreement with steiner et al 1999 the distribution of drag coefficient values is governed by the linear dependence on the deformation energy eqs 10 and 11 the impact of ice concentration is only visible where a 1 not shown simulated atmospheric and oceanic drag coefficients are higher in summer than in winter table 5 maximum values of both atmospheric and oceanic drag coefficients are found in the lincoln sea minimum values in the laptev sea oceanic drag coefficients show a larger variability due to larger values of mw and dw compared to ma and da in eqs 10 and 11 in both summer and winter changes in drag coefficients reflect changes in the roughness length z 0 section 2 2 in order to calculate the roughness length for the atmosphere that is for the upper sea ice surface and for the ocean that is for the surface underneath the ice we use equation 4 with 10 m as reference height for the atmosphere and 5 m for the ocean as in shaw et al 2008 values of surface roughness length vary between 0 7 10 5 m and 0 027 m fig 4a b these results compare well with the values of roughness length for different ice classes in guest and davidson 1991 in particular the maximum value of 0 027 m is the same as the value of 0 027 m for very rough ice in guest and davidson 1991 the mean value in the lincoln sea table 6 agrees with the value of 2 0 10 3 for smooth myi whereas the mean values in bs ca ess and laps table 6 agree with the values for very smooth and smooth fyi guest and davidson 1991 values for the under ice roughness length varying from 0 05 10 3 m to 0 16 m fig 4c d are also in agreement with observations shaw et al 2008 johannessen 1970 shirasawa 1986 shirasawa and ingram 1991 3 2 contributions to atmospheric and oceanic drag coefficients to analyze the causes of the regional and seasonal differences in atmospheric and oceanic drag coefficients we look at the contribution in eqs 10 and 11 of the terms due to deformation energy and ice concentration as ratios between skin drag deformation energy term and ice concentration term over the total atmospheric drag coefficients fig 5 and oceanic drag coefficients not shown in winter the skin drag dominates both atmospheric and oceanic drag coefficients mainly in the eastern sector of the arctic ocean in summer the skin drag dominates in the miz where the deformation energy is low and the ice concentration is lower than 0 5 the deformation energy term dominates in the western sector of the arctic ocean and its contribution is generally higher in winter the contribution of the ice concentration term in winter is negligible almost everywhere in the arctic basin except for the miz which in winter extends to the barent sea and south of the svalbard islands in summer its contribution increases everywhere in the arctic ocean with maxima in the laptev sea of up to 80 of the total drag coefficient values to analyze in more detail the contribution of deformation and ice concentration in the computation of the atmospheric drag coefficients we show in fig 6 the time evolution from 1990 to 2010 of mean atmospheric drag coefficients due to deformation energy and due to ice concentration in some regions of interest in general the contribution due to ice concentration shows a larger seasonal variability since in winter the ice concentration approaches 1 almost everywhere in the arctic and the ice concentration term drops to zero the contribution of the two terms is different for different regions and shows also an interannual variability in the lincoln sea the total atmospheric drag is always dominated by deformation in the central arctic the deformation energy term dominates in winter whereas in summer the drag is dominated by the ice concentration term in the laptev sea not shown the contribution of the deformation energy remains always very small in the beaufort sea the contribution of the two terms varies with time the same holds for the east siberian sea not shown 3 3 sea ice mean summer ice concentration is lowest in the laptev sea and east siberian sea a 0 4 and highest in the lincoln sea and the central arctic a 0 8 in both drags and mean table 7 in winter the differences between the two runs drags mean in ice concentration are visible only in the miz fig 7 a in summer the ice concentration is reduced almost everywhere in the arctic basin when we introduce variable drag coefficients drags except for the beaufort sea fig 7b in both winter and summer the differences remain between 10 and 20 mean summer ice thickness in the arctic ocean ranges from 0 5 m in the east siberian sea and laptev sea to up to 7 m in the lincoln sea table 7 between drags and mean the ice thickness differences in the western sector of the arctic ocean are on the order of 0 5 m in both march and september in the lincoln sea differences are larger than 1 m in our simulations summer sea ice velocities are on the order of 5 cm s 1 in the arctic ocean faster ice is a characteristic of the beaufort sea with 5 25 cm s 1 in drags and 4 90 cm s 1 in mean very low values are found in the lincoln sea where the ice remains constrained between the coasts of greenland and ellesmere island and it is characterized by velocities smaller than 1 cm s 1 north of greenland and in the fram strait the ice moves faster in drags than in mean and the arrows indicate a larger export of ice through the fram strait in summer when the ice is more mobile differences are larger and the pattern of these differences is more pronounced the drift difference arrows show the anticyclonic pattern in the beaufort gyre fig 7f that usually dominates in summer thus showing an increased anticyclonic circulation in drags than in mean 3 4 ocean surface in order to evaluate the effects of the new drag formulation on the surface ocean we analyze sea surface temperature θ surface salinity and mixed layer depth mld in winter temperatures are equal to the freezing point everywhere in the arctic ocean except in the miz fig 8 and table 7 in summer fig 8b the coldest temperatures are found in the nansen basin mean values vary between 0 24 c in the east siberian sea and 1 66 c in the lincoln sea temperature differences between drags and means are no larger than 0 06 c surface salinity in winter ranges between 33 and 35 except for the beaufort sea and east siberian sea where values are lower than 32 fig 9 a the surface salinity differences in winter are on the order of 0 2 except for the laptev sea and kara sea with differences up to 0 5 on average the mean mld in september is deeper by 3 m in the drags run than in the mean run fig 10 a c this is a big difference because in the mean run the mld reaches average summer depths in the sea ice covered area of 8 m 2 m in winter the mixed layer is deeper everywhere in the arctic basin for both mean 39 11ṁ and drags 43 12 m the mld differences drags mean are smaller in winter than in summer note that the model layer thickness is 10 m at the surface and we use a density criterion section 2 to estimate mlds the impact of variable drag coefficients on the mld should be tested using an ocean model that can resolve the ocean surface at a finer scale 1 3 m in this case though the approach used in the present work i e using the computed drag coefficients to calculate the ocean currents in the first surface layer would result erroneous roy et al 2015 3 5 ocean interior we evaluate the effects of the new drag parameterization on the ocean interior by analyzing the september stream function which specifies the character cyclonic or anticyclonic of the flow a vertical salinity profile along an oceanic transect through a large freshwater reservoir in the beaufort sea in september fig 1 and the circulation in the mid atlantic water mid aw layer between 350 m and 800 m depth the stream function fig 10 is computed by vertically integrating the climatological horizontal velocity for september it illustrates the well known arctic circulation pattern with a more or less clear separation between the eurasian and canadian basin steiner et al 2004 there is a strong anticyclonic circulation in the beaufort sea that reflects the surface beaufort gyre whereas the central arctic ocean circulation is dominated by a cyclonic pattern of the atlantic water in the ocean interior the differences drags mean fig 10d point to a stronger beaufort gyre in drags in agreement with the ice drift stronger ice drift leads to an intensified anticyclonic circulation also in the upper ocean layer the cyclonic pattern in the central arctic ocean interior is also stronger the vertical salinity profile fig 11 a down to 250 m for the drags run shows the accumulation of fresher water at the surface of the beaufort sea the 32 isohaline reaches down to ca 150 m the difference map drags mean fig 11b shows a thin layer of saltier water at the surface first 10 m in agreement with fig 9d in the deep beaufort sea the difference map shows fresher water extending to 120 m depth in the central arctic ca the drags run water masses are saltier with differences extending down to 250 m depth finally we compare the circulation of the atlantic water in the mid aw layer in fig 12 a we show the mid aw circulation in the drags run the typical pattern as inferred from observations carmack et al 1995 rudels et al 1994 1999 swift et al 1997 and previous model results holland et al 1996 karcher and oberhuber 2002 karcher et al 2003 is represented the circulation is cyclonic in the beaufort sea canadian basin and in the makarov basin the inflow from the fram strait with a branch of mid aw flowing along the continental margins of the eurasian and makarov basin is also represented finally the mid aw flows along the continental slope of greenland and leaves through the fram strait the cyclonic circulation in the beaufort sea is slightly slower in the drags run fig 12b a stronger flow of mid aw between the alpha ridge and makarov basin is directed towards the fram strait also the flow along the lincoln shelf is enhanced in the makarov basin the cyclonic mid aw circulation is slowed down for drags compared to mean 3 6 differences between new mean drag coefficients and original values the newly implemented drag coefficients parameterization not only leads to more variability but also to mean drag coefficients that are generally larger atmosphere or smaller ocean than the default values of ctrl this implies a change in the nansen number between mean and ctrl that can lead to changes in sea ice drift and sea ice properties in particular we expect faster ice as a result of the higher atmospheric drag coefficients 1 36 10 3 compared to 1 10 3 and the lower oceanic ones 2 82 10 3 compared to 5 4 10 3 this motivates an additional comparison for the simulated sea ice properties between the mean run and the ctrl run mean values of sea ice concentration thickness and drift for the entire arctic basin and for regions of interested are listed in table 7 difference maps for sea ice concentration thickness and drift in march and september are shown in fig 13 differences in ice concentration are larger in september than in march during winter the ice concentration is 1 almost everywhere in the arctic ocean so differences are seen only in the miz fig 13a in summer the sea ice areal extent in mean is reduced in the central arctic basin lincoln sea and beaufort sea table 7 a stronger reduction is seen in the east siberian sea laptev sea and kara sea ice thickness fig 13c and d is reduced in large parts of the arctic basin in winter with the exception of the chukchi sea where the ice thickness in mean is 0 5 m larger than in ctrl in summer the pattern is the same with a general reduction of ice over the entire arctic ocean large differences are seen in the lincoln sea with mean summer ice thickness decreasing from 8 46 m in ctrl to 7 86 m in mean the ice moves faster in mean than in ctrl as expected by the change in the nansen number particularly the circulation patterns are enhanced in both winter and summer figs 13e and f show a stronger beaufort gyre and a stronger transpolar drift stream differences are relevant in the lincoln sea with changes in mean summer drift from 0 02 cm s 1 in ctrl to 0 11 cm s 1 in mean and in the central arctic with an increase from 1 58 cm s 1 in ctrl to 2 43 cm s 1 in mean 4 discussion with the implementation of eqs 10 and 11 drag coefficients vary according to season and region not shown between 0 88 10 3 and 4 68 10 3 for atmospheric drag coefficients and between 1 28 10 3 and 13 68 10 3 for the oceanic ones our computed atmospheric and oceanic drag coefficients fall into the range of observed and topography based estimated values see table 1 but never reach the extremes the steiner 2001 approach relies on the fraction of energy that goes into deformation and is thus responsible for an increase in surface roughness and in drag coefficients this contribution is expressed by the terms ma and mw in eqs 10 and 11 these terms cannot be measured directly in the field and thus represent a large uncertainty of the parameterization our results for different regions represent the general pattern shown in large scale estimates based on satellite data petty et al 2017 with higher values in regions where the ice is more deformed due to proximity to the coast lincoln sea and due to convergent drift central arctic and lower values in the marginal seas laptev sea and east siberian sea atmospheric drag coefficients computed in a different sea ice model tsamados et al 2014 and based on different parameterizations lüpkes et al 2013 than ours vary between 0 3 10 3 and 4 10 3 whereas oceanic drag coefficients vary between 2 10 3 and 20 10 3 in good agreement with our results the extra contribution of melt pond edges on the atmospheric drag coefficients not included explicitly in our parameterization is visible in summer particularly in july and august see tsamados et al 2014 their figure 7 in these months however the contribution of melt pond edges to the total drag coefficients is much smaller than the other terms deformation ice concentration skin drag the form drag contribution to the total drag in tsamados et al 2014 is based on an itd model where the amount of thick ridged ice in a grid cell is used to estimate geometric parameters i e sail height and distance between sails and keel depth and distance to be used in the parameterization for drag coefficients in contrast we rely on the deformation energy as an explicit function of internal forces in the ice and from which we derive the drag coefficients in spite of these differences our results are very similar to those of tsamados et al 2014 in many respects drag coefficients are higher in summer than in winter and the contribution of the different terms differ with season that is in winter the total drag is dominated by deformation whereas in summer the drag is dominated by the ice concentration term the newly implemented parameterization affects the simulated sea ice properties that is extent thickness and drift in general the ice moves faster is thinner and the overall area is reduced table 7 in particular the sea ice drift increase in the western part of the arctic results in a decrease of ice thickness particularly in the lincoln sea and along the north coast of greenland region where the highest atmospheric drag coefficients are found the larger sea ice velocities along the north coast of greenland directed towards the fram strait explain the reduction of ice concentration in the same region correlations between differences in ice thickness and ice velocities are significant but weak r 0 2 for the entire arctic basin and for most of the regions of interest exceptions are the lincoln sea with r 0 28 between changes in ice thickness and changes in sea ice drift and the central arctic with r 0 29 to compare the realism of the different simulations we use a cost function computed for the different sea ice variables in winter and in summer table 3 the total cost function value that is the model data misfit is smaller for the drags run than for the mean run in particular the ice concentration in both summer and winter the march ice thickness and the summer sea ice drift are better simulated with the variable drag coefficients the default values of constant drag coefficients in the ctrl run gives the largest model data misfit largest cost function except for winter ice concentration the differences drags ctrl in winter ice concentration not shown point to a southward shift of the marginal ice zone this is due to the larger nansen number in drags that makes the ice more mobile in general the differences between mean and ctrl are larger than between drags and mean we conclude that the variable drag parameterization improves the model simulation but to first order this improvement can already be achieved by adjusting the mean drag coefficients and hence the nansen number we can thus suggest a new set of constant drag coefficients that improve the simulated sea ice characteristics additional improvement in the model simulations is caused by the spatial variability of the drag coefficients with variable drag coefficients in the drags run mixing tends to be stronger leading to deeper mixed layers mlds estimates from observations are sparse in summer the few available ones range from 8 m to 20 m in the beaufort sea yang et al 2004 lemke and manley 1984 peralta ferriz and woodgate 2015 the mean mld of 10 m in the drags run agrees better with these estimates than the 7 m in the mean run mld data based on the noaa world ocean atlas monterey and dewitt 1997 give a mean value of 8 7 m and values up to 440 m for the entire arctic basin in september here the mean mld of 8 2 m in the mean run appears to be closer to observation than the mean of 11 2 m in the drags run but this is confounded by the large range of mlds in the observations and the ambiguous estimation methods in winter in the central arctic mld values are between 25 m and 50 m treshnikov and baranov 1973 compared to the simulated 42 m in both mean and drags in general the agreement with independent estimates of mlds is ambiguous and both drags and mean agree with observational estimates similarly well we remind that our numerical surface ocean layer is 10 m thick and mlds are sometimes smaller making our mld estimates less accurate than with a model with higher vertical resolution changes due to variable drag coefficients in sea surface temperatures are small in most regions note that in the present model study the heat exchange coefficients do not depend on the surface roughness thus the changes in surface temperature are only an indirect consequence of the changes in the sea ice properties the pattern in surface temperature changes does not suggest any trend in the lincoln sea the reduction in ice thickness correlates with an increase in temperature r 0 39 pointing to an increased heat flux that penetrates the thinner ice and reaches the ocean surface a similar strong correlation is found in the central arctic r 0 5 whereas in the other regions the correlation is significant but weak differences in salinity point to a more saline sea surface in summer and fresher water in the interior of the beaufort sea the amount of fresh water relative to a reference salinity of 34 8 proshutinsky et al 2009 roy et al 2015 in the beaufort sea not shown here is larger in drags than in mean this agrees with roy et al 2015 who show an increased fresh water retention in the beaufort gyre due to stronger ice ocean and air ice roughness the mean values of atmospheric and oceanic drag coefficients in the beaufort sea see table 5 point to a larger surface and bottom surface roughness in this region compared to the values in mean moreover fig 7f shows a stronger beaufort gyre which explains the retention of fresh water in that region the total liquid arctic fresh water budget is higher in mean than in the drags and in the ctrl runs but the differences remain very small 5 summary and conclusion atmospheric and oceanic drag coefficients vary in time and space as a consequence of the interplay between sea ice deformation and sea ice concentration in the present study we introduce variable atmospheric and oceanic drag coefficients in a coupled sea ice ocean model and we quantify the effects of the new parameterization on the main sea ice properties and on the ocean this is achieved by comparing three simulations two simulations with constant drag coefficients and a simulation where the drag coefficients are parameterized as a function of ice concentration and deformation energy simulated atmospheric and oceanic drag coefficients fall in the range of observed values and agree with recent estimates based on topography profiles and model results in our study resulting atmospheric and oceanic drag coefficients can evolve spatially and temporally as function of sea ice characteristics in winter drag coefficients are dominated by sea ice deformation whereas in summer ice concentration contributes most the dynamic sea ice state is affected by the new parameterization particularly in summer the ice moves faster is thinner and the areal extent is reduced when variable drag coefficients are used the ice thickness shows differences up to 0 5 m in the arctic basin in the lincoln sea more ice is removed due to higher drag coefficients and thickness differences are up to 1 m pointing to a strong reduction of ice volume in that region the variable drag parameterization does not have a uniform effect in the arctic basin but the impact is more visible in the western sector of the arctic with variable drag coefficients the model misfit with observations is improved particularly for sea ice thickness in march sea ice drift in summer and sea ice concentration in summer and winter the mean values of drag coefficients computed from the run with variable ones are a better set of parameters for simulations with constant drag coefficients the new set of constant drag coefficients is obtained by the optimization of a sophisticated drag coefficient parameterization and differ from values emerging by a different optimization our study represents the first implementation of a parameterization for surface dependent drag coefficients in a coupled sea ice ocean model not only does this approach allow a more physical representation of the sea ice evolution by including the sea ice ocean feedbacks but also it makes possible the analysis of its effects on the ocean circulation with the new implementation surface mixing is stronger and causes a deeper mixed layer particularly in summer finally the effects of the newly implemented parameterization reach the ocean interior causing changes in atlantic water circulation based on the analysis of climatological maps these effects are small the model configuration used in the present study allows us to investigate the main feedbacks due to variable drag coefficients nevertheless this configuration is simple and the effects of variable drag coefficients should be tested on a more complex model including an itd an ice strength parameterization and the effects of atmospheric instability moreover the effects on the mixed layer depth should be tested using a model with a better vertical resolution in the surface ocean in a natural continuation of this study the effects of our parameterization implementation on the atmosphere and ensuing feedbacks should be studied in a coupled atmosphere ice ocean model finally in the light of the recent increase in sea ice drift spreen et al 2011 kwok et al 2013 our results may be even more relevant to the community

24099,many state of the art coupled sea ice ocean models use atmospheric and oceanic drag coefficients that are at best a function of the atmospheric stability but otherwise constant in time and space constant drag coefficients might lead to an incorrect representation of the ice air and ice ocean momentum exchange since observations of turbulent fluxes imply high variability of drag coefficients we compare three model runs two with constant drag coefficients and one with drag coefficients varying as function of sea ice characteristics the computed drag coefficients range between 0 88 10 3 and 4 68 10 3 for the atmosphere and between 1 28 10 3 and 13 68 10 3 for the ocean they fall in the range of observed drag coefficients and illustrate the interplay of ice deformation and ice concentration in different seasons and regions the introduction of variable drag coefficients improves the realism of the model simulation in addition using the average values of the variable drag coefficients improves simulations with constant drag coefficients when drag coefficients depend on sea ice characteristics the average sea ice drift speed in the arctic basin increases from 6 22 cm s 1 to 6 64 cm s 1 this leads to a reduction of ice thickness in the entire arctic and particularly in the lincoln sea with a mean value decreasing from 7 86 m to 6 62 m variable drag coefficients lead also to a deeper mixed layer in summer and to changes in surface salinity surface temperatures in the ocean are also affected by variable drag coefficients with differences of up to 0 06 c in the east siberian sea small effects are visible in the ocean interior keywords drag coefficients momentum fluxes arctic sea ice atmosphere sea ice ocean interaction deformation energy surface roughness length cost function 1 introduction the recently observed changes in arctic sea ice rothrock et al 1999 serreze et al 2003 2007 stroeve et al 2007 2012a 2012b laxon et al 2013 haas et al 2008 rabenstein et al 2010 castellani et al 2014 feed back into the global climate because sea ice is coupled to atmosphere and oceans sea ice insulates the oceans from the polar atmosphere it contributes to the ice albedo feedback mechanism curry et al 1995 and while drifting it exerts a drag on the oceanic surface layer this drag fluxes momentum into the ocean the momentum fluxes between ice and ocean affect the upper surface circulation with consequences for the interior ocean circulation and the outflow into the nordic seas as well as the pacific and atlantic ocean proshutinsky and johnson 1997 rudels et al 2005 latarius and quadfasel 2010 proshutinsky et al 2009 understanding the dynamic coupling between ice atmosphere and ocean requires a detailed representation of the momentum fluxes in this work we aim to contribute to improving the representation of physical processes in coupled sea ice ocean models by investigating how numerical simulations are affected by a description of ice atmosphere and ice ocean coupling that accounts for the sea ice roughness most sea ice codes resolve both dynamic and thermodynamic processes the sea ice momentum equations are solved for drift velocities that are then used to advect the ice variables the drift velocities also determine the stress acting on the ocean in most sea ice models hibler 1979 hunke 2010 both the atmospheric drag and the oceanic drag are described by a quadratic relationship see also the arctic ocean model intercomparison project aomip protocol proshutinsky et al 2001 depending on the relative velocity between atmospheric wind ocean currents and sea ice drift the intensity of the air ice and ocean ice interactions are described by the transfer coefficients called air drag coefficient ca and ocean drag coefficient cw these coefficients depend on sea ice surface characteristics table 1 lists direct observations of atmospheric drag coefficients and indirect estimates from linear castellani et al 2014 and 3d petty et al 2017 surface profiles all at a reference height of 10 m and oceanic drag coefficients that are generally referenced to geostrophic currents lu et al 2011 many sea ice models in coupled gcms today use constant drag coefficients thus they do not account for their observed spatial and temporal variability hunke et al 2010 in recent years many parameterizations have been developed to relate sea ice surface characteristics to drag coefficients garbrecht et al 2002 birnbaum and luepkes 2002 lüpkes and birnbaum 2005 lüpkes et al 2012 2013 andreas et al 2010 lu et al 2011 and some of these parameterizations have been implemented in numerical models for example tsamados et al 2014 present the results of a simulation with the los alamos sea ice model cice where some of the mentioned parameterizations are used to compute the atmospheric and oceanic neutral drag coefficients as a function of floe edges ridges and melt ponds moreover cice includes instability effects of the upper surface layer over sea ice thus the neutral atmospheric drag coefficient is corrected for the stability that depends on the thickness distribution hunke et al 2015 the approach of tsamados et al 2014 requires a dynamic ice thickness distribution itd as well as an explicit description of ridges and melt ponds formation flocco and felthman 2007 flocco et al 2010 and tracers of deformed ice and melt ponds in a different approach steiner et al 1999 steiner 2001 deformation energy accounts for surface roughness the deformation energy depends on the history of the mechanical deformation of sea ice and on changes in its thickness the drag coefficients are parameterized as a function of the deformation energy and of ice concentration steiner 2001 with this formulation it is possible to implement drag coefficients in sea ice models without additional parameterizations for ridges and melt ponds formation tsamados et al 2014 and steiner 2001 used stand alone sea ice models but variations of oceanic drag coefficients also affect the oceanic momentum through the drag coefficients and the drift velocities of the ice that are themselves functions of the atmospheric and oceanic stress for example castellani et al 2015 showed based on an idealized experiment that variations in the ekman vertical velocity associated with variable oceanic drag coefficients are on the same order of magnitude as the variations due to changes in the surface velocity of the ice roy et al 2015 compare simulations using different air ice and ocean ice roughness they show effects on the general features of sea ice concentration thickness drift and also on the liquid and solid fresh water budget of the arctic ocean in particular increased ice ocean roughness leads to higher arctic fresh water budget by increasing fresh water retention in the beaufort gyre martin et al 2014 investigate changes in momentum transfer to the ocean as consequence of ice thickness and areal extent decrease they conclude that the weaker ice cover in fall winter and spring and the increase in open water fraction in summer cause trends in the momentum transfer over the last three decades in a more recent work martin et al 2016 analyze the effects that the introduction of variable drag coefficients in numerical models have on the trend of annual mean ocean surface stress they show that a decrease in surface roughness over the years leads to a decline in surface ocean stress they conclude that a proper investigation of the trend of the air to ocean momentum transfer in presence of sea ice requires to represent sea ice surface variations in the present study we investigate how atmospheric and oceanic drag coefficients that depend on the degree of sea ice deformation and on ice concentration affect sea ice distribution and ocean circulation in a numerical model we follow the steiner 2001 deformation energy approach and apply it to a coupled sea ice ocean model we focus on the simulated sea ice properties but also on effects on and changes in the ocean circulation with the aim to investigate 1 which of the main physical parameters describing the large scale sea ice cover ice concentration thickness and drift is affected the most and 2 in which regions of the arctic these changes are more prominent finally we aim to 3 quantify to what extent the ocean is affected in section 2 we introduce the model configuration and the implemented parameterizations we also describe the sensitivity study performed to select the set of parameters used in the numerical experiment the results for sea ice and ocean are presented in section 3 and then discussed in section 4 a summary and conclusions follow in section 5 2 methods 2 1 model description and setup we use the massachusetts institute of technology general circulation model mitgcm marshall et al 1997 in a coupled ocean sea ice arctic ocean configuration the configuration is similar to the naosim configuration of karcher et al 2011 and was already described in castro morales et al 2014 the domain covers the arctic ocean the nordic seas and the north atlantic down to approximately 50 n fig 1 the horizontal resolution of 1 4 corresponds to 28 km on a rotated spherical grid with the equator passing though the north pole in the vertical the domain is discretized in 33 levels with thickness ranging from 10 m at the surface to 350 m at depth vertical mixing in the ocean is parameterized by a k profile parameterization kpp scheme large et al 1994 and tracers are advected with an unconditionally stable seventh order monotonicity preserving scheme daru and tenaud 2004 that requires no explicit diffusivity the mixed layer depth is diagnosed based on a density criterion kara et al 2000 to apply this criterion densities are linearly interpolated between model layers to determine the depth at which the density increases above a critical density relative to the surface density in strong stratification where density in the second layer is already much higher than in the first layer this can lead to mixed layer depths smaller than the 10 m of the surface layer thickness the model variable density is located at the center of the grid cells so that the topmost density is at 5 m depth the minimum mixed layer depth is thus 5 m the ocean model is coupled with a dynamic thermodynamic sea ice model losch et al 2010 the sea ice model of the mitgcm uses a viscous plastic rheology and so called zero layer thermodynamics i e zero heat capacity formulation semtner 1976 with a prescribed ice thickness distribution hibler 1979 1980 1984 castro morales et al 2014 in order to compute the net heat flux through the ice the latter is redistributed into seven ice thickness categories between 0 and a maximum thickness of twice the mean thickness the heat fluxes are computed individually for each thickness and then summed the shape of the distribution of these seven thicknesses is flat normalized and fixed in time see hibler 1984 castro morales et al 2014 their fig 1 we also use the same parameterization for the snow distribution in the present configuration the model does not include a dynamic ice thickness distribution itd the model is forced by realistic atmospheric fields we use data of the coordinated ocean research experiment core version 2 large and yeager 2009 for the spin up and the ncep climate forecast system version 2 saha et al 2014 for the analyzed simulations a monthly climatology of river runoff for the main arctic rivers follows the aomip protocol proshutinsky et al 2001 the model is spun up from the first day of january 1948 to the last day of december 1978 in a baseline control configuration with constant drag coefficients the subsequent simulations are forced with ncep reanalysis data saha et al 2014 from the first day of january 1979 to the last day of december 2010 2 2 parameterization of atmospheric and oceanic drag coefficients sea ice motion is determined mainly by three forces the internal stresses in the ice the atmospheric drag force and the oceanic drag force steele et al 1989 the momentum equations for the atmospheric drag τ a and the oceanic drag τ w are expressed through a quadratic drag relationship 1 τ a ρ a c a u a u r a u a u 2 τ w ρ w c w u w u r w u w u where ρa and ρw are the densities of air and sea water the drag depends on the relative velocities u a w u where u a is the atmospheric wind u w is the ocean current and u is the ice drift the ocean atmosphere rotation matrix rw ra accounts for unresolved ekman layers ca and cw are the transfer coefficients for momentum called air drag coefficient and water drag coefficient from the monin obukhov similarity theory and a stability corrected logarithmic profile garbrecht et al 2002 they can be expressed as 3 c d k l n z r z 0 ψ m z r l 2 where d a for the atmosphere and d w for the ocean zr is a reference height usually 10 m for the atmosphere or the depth at which the current equals geostrophic flow for the ocean lu et al 2011 z 0 is the roughness length of sea ice ψm is the dyer businger stability function l the monin obukhov length and k the von karman constant in case of neutral conditions eq 3 reduces to the expression for the neutral drag coefficients 4 c d n k l n z r z 0 2 the roughness length z 0 changes regionally and temporally due to the presence and formation of topographic elements over under the ice variability in z 0 implies variability in c d n in this study we focus on the neutral drag coefficients that is for the case of neutral stratification of the fluid water and air in the following the term drag coefficients always refer to neutral drag coefficients except when stated otherwise in the baseline configuration the sea ice ocean model runs with constant atmospheric and oceanic drag coefficients c a 1 10 3 and c w 5 4 10 3 the latter value corresponds the geostrophic drag coefficient proposed by mcphee 2008 these values are the results of an optimization procedure nguyen et al 2011 and were already used in the present model configuration castro morales et al 2014 they correspond to a roughness length z 0 of 5 10 5 m for the atmosphere ice interface and 22 10 3 m for the ocean ice interface in order to arrive at drag coefficients that depend on sea ice topography we introduce the deformation energy r as a prognostic variable into the sea ice model the deformation energy represents the sea ice roughness and evolves in time steiner et al 1999 deformation energy changes with the work of internal forces in the ice eint and with melting martin 2007 5 d r d t e i n t r min m 0 where m is the same melting rate that is used to thermodynamically change the ice volume divided by the ice thickness by definition m is negative during melting and positive during freezing the term eint is derived as the scalar product of the stress tensor σ and the strain rate tensor ɛ rothrock 1975 martin 2007 6 e int σ ɛ σ i ɛ i σ ii ɛ ii where 7 ɛ i ɛ 11 ɛ 22 ɛ i i ɛ 11 ɛ 22 2 4 ɛ 12 2 and 8 σ i 1 2 σ 11 σ 22 σ i i 1 2 σ 11 σ 22 2 4 σ 12 2 are invariants of the strain rate tensor ɛ and of the stress tensor σ rothrock 1975 this formulation for the deformation energy was previously implemented in uncoupled sea ice models steiner et al 1999 martin 2006 2007 many studies focusing on the dependency of neutral drag coefficients on surface roughness e g garbrecht et al 1999 2002 lüpkes et al 2012 2013 lüpkes and gryanik 2015 are based on the partitioning approach by arya 1973 1975 according to this approach the neutral drag coefficient is given as the sum of a skin drag accounting for small scale roughness and a form drag accounting for the influence of large obstacles due to a pressure difference before and behind the obstacle this can be written as 9 c d c d skin c d form the form drag is usually expressed based on geometric consideration of the obstacles such as ridges garbrecht et al 1999 2002 melt ponds and ice floes lüpkes et al 2012 2013 lüpkes and gryanik 2015 following steiner 2001 the drag coefficients are expressed as a function of deformation energy r and ice concentration a 10 c a r a b a m a r d a 1 4 a 1 2 2 11 c w r a b w m w r d w 1 4 a 1 2 2 the skin drag the terms ba and bw in eqs 10 and 11 accounts for small scale roughness and it is chosen following steiner 2001 according to the lowest observed drag coefficients b a 0 8 10 3 and b w 1 2 10 3 see e g shirasawa and aota 1991 shirasawa and ingram 1991 wamser and martinson 1993 the form drag accounts for large scale obstacles and it is parameterized as a function of deformation energy r second term on the right hand side of eqs 10 and 11 and of ice concentration third term on the right hand side of eqs 10 and 11 according to eqs 10 and 11 the drag coefficients increase linearly with the deformation energy and depend quadratically on ice concentration with a maximum of da dw at a 0 5 50 ice concentration see also fig 1 in steiner 2001 initially the values of the parameters ma mw da and dw are set to the values optimized via comparison with observed buoy drift velocities steiner 2001 see also table 2 in section 2 3 they are optimized by performing a quantitative comparison with sea ice observations note that in this configuration the deformation energy does not affect the sea ice or the ocean directly because the sea ice model does not employ a dynamic ice thickness distribution itd as in e g ungermann et al 2017 this means that we do not redistribute the ice between thickness categories according to variations of deformation energy the only feedback on the physics of the model is through the atmospheric and oceanic drag coefficients that enter the momentum equations of the sea ice and of the ocean even without an itd which may increase the general realism of the simulation ungermann et al 2017 the main feedback we would expect in the context of the drag coefficients is present in our model the shape of the itd is not enough to distinguish between an ensemble of flat thermodynamically grown floes with different thicknesses and comparably low drag coefficients or an ice pack with a high coverage of melt ponds pressure ridges and floe edges and comparably high drag coefficients for this reason even very detailed parameterizations of variable drag coefficients have only indirect connections between the itd and the drag coefficients via intermediate variables tsamados et al 2014 but the main feedback we would expect in this context is included in the model when ice ridges its thickness increases which should make it harder to deform yet at the same time the pressure ridges lead to a higher drag coefficient that should increase the deformation of already thick ice 2 3 choice of parameters eqs 10 and 11 contain 6 parameters ba bw ma mw da and dw the skin drags ba and bw are directly constrained by observations e g shirasawa and aota 1991 shirasawa and ingram 1991 wamser and martinson 1993 in order to find the best set of parameter values for ma mw da and dw we compare the model results with observations in a sensitivity study to evaluate our model results quantitatively we use a cost function from satellite observations as a measure for model quality ungermann et al 2017 in a second step we use a green s functions approach to obtain a set of optimal parameters for details see menemenlis et al 2005 ungermann et al 2017 the cost function for a given variable concentration thickness drift in a given time frame month season is defined as 12 f var i 1 n var 1 2 x i y i 2 n var ξ i 2 where yi is a single observation xi the model estimate at the same position and time and ξi the measurement uncertainty of this observation n var is the number of observations of the respective variable so that the contribution of each variable is normalized in table 3 we present the cost function for the different data sets and seasons that is the sum over the amount of data available for a specific variable in a certain time frame the total cost function is the sum of all contributions most if not all data assimilation and optimization methods e g massonnet et al 2014 roach et al 2018 are based on minimizing a cost function similar to ours the methods differ in the way the errors are treated and how the minimum of the cost function is found for example an ensemble kalman filter allows to estimate the error covariances of the state during the optimization procedure and use this information to refine the results e g massonnet et al 2014 the cost function can be linearized and an optimal set of parameters can be found with approximated gradient information for example with a gauss newton method roach et al 2018 in our approach all prior covariance information about the unknown parameters is neglected and the cost function is constructed with a diagonal error covariance matrix from the error estimates of the observations this allows us to use the green s function approach and to explicitly calculate an optimal set of parameters in each step without an additional line search that would be necessary in the more generally applicable gauss newton method we use four different datasets 1 the reprocessed concentration dataset from osisaf eumetsat ocean

identical to ours was shown to yield simulations consistent with observations see castro morales et al 2014 their fig 7 since our main interest is in the drag coefficients we focus our sensitivity study only on the parameters ma mw da and dw in eqs 10 and 11 in table 2 we list the values of the original parameters and the final values after two optimization cycles in this study we compare three different model runs drags using the optimized parameters to compute variable drag coefficients mean using constant drag coefficients to keep the nansen number na ρ a c a ρ w c w comparable we use the mean values from drags as constant drag coefficients see table 4 and ctrl using constant drag coefficients with the original values castro morales et al 2014 the cost function values of these configurations are given in table 3 while our main results are obtained from a model to model comparison we show a qualitative comparison with observations of ice concentration and ice thickness for the drags run as results of the optimization procedure fig 2 to demonstrate the realism of our coupled ice ocean model the most remarkable model biases are an overestimation of the ice edge in the fram strait especially in winter and a dipole pattern in the thickness field march rmse 0 69 november rmse 0 59 with a thick bias in the barents sea and the east siberian sea and a thin bias over the central arctic both a common problem of many models of comparable complexity stroeve et al 2014 these model data comparisons place the realism of our model configuration well in the range of cmip5 sea ice components 3 results in this section we present results for climatologies obtained from the first day of january 1990 to the last day of december 2010 the first ten years 1979 1989 of the simulations are not used because during this time the model adapts to the new forcing and to the new physics we focus our analysis on the months of march maximum sea ice extent and september minimum sea ice extent the model domain with the following regions is shown in fig 1 lincoln sea ls central arctic ac beaufort sea bs east siberian sea ess and laptev sea laps 3 1 simulated deformation energy and drag coefficients values for deformation energy in the arctic basin vary between 20 and 300 kj m2 fig 3 lower values are found towards the marginal sea ice zone miz whereas values higher than 300 kj m2 characterize the coastal areas along the north coast of greenland and the north coasts of the arctic canadian archipelago where ice is usually pushed against land and thus more deformed in the central arctic the values vary between 25 and 95 kj m2 in agreement with steiner et al 1999 the distribution of drag coefficient values is governed by the linear dependence on the deformation energy eqs 10 and 11 the impact of ice concentration is only visible where a 1 not shown simulated atmospheric and oceanic drag coefficients are higher in summer than in winter table 5 maximum values of both atmospheric and oceanic drag coefficients are found in the lincoln sea minimum values in the laptev sea oceanic drag coefficients show a larger variability due to larger values of mw and dw compared to ma and da in eqs 10 and 11 in both summer and winter changes in drag coefficients reflect changes in the roughness length z 0 section 2 2 in order to calculate the roughness length for the atmosphere that is for the upper sea ice surface and for the ocean that is for the surface underneath the ice we use equation 4 with 10 m as reference height for the atmosphere and 5 m for the ocean as in shaw et al 2008 values of surface roughness length vary between 0 7 10 5 m and 0 027 m fig 4a b these results compare well with the values of roughness length for different ice classes in guest and davidson 1991 in particular the maximum value of 0 027 m is the same as the value of 0 027 m for very rough ice in guest and davidson 1991 the mean value in the lincoln sea table 6 agrees with the value of 2 0 10 3 for smooth myi whereas the mean values in bs ca ess and laps table 6 agree with the values for very smooth and smooth fyi guest and davidson 1991 values for the under ice roughness length varying from 0 05 10 3 m to 0 16 m fig 4c d are also in agreement with observations shaw et al 2008 johannessen 1970 shirasawa 1986 shirasawa and ingram 1991 3 2 contributions to atmospheric and oceanic drag coefficients to analyze the causes of the regional and seasonal differences in atmospheric and oceanic drag coefficients we look at the contribution in eqs 10 and 11 of the terms due to deformation energy and ice concentration as ratios between skin drag deformation energy term and ice concentration term over the total atmospheric drag coefficients fig 5 and oceanic drag coefficients not shown in winter the skin drag dominates both atmospheric and oceanic drag coefficients mainly in the eastern sector of the arctic ocean in summer the skin drag dominates in the miz where the deformation energy is low and the ice concentration is lower than 0 5 the deformation energy term dominates in the western sector of the arctic ocean and its contribution is generally higher in winter the contribution of the ice concentration term in winter is negligible almost everywhere in the arctic basin except for the miz which in winter extends to the barent sea and south of the svalbard islands in summer its contribution increases everywhere in the arctic ocean with maxima in the laptev sea of up to 80 of the total drag coefficient values to analyze in more detail the contribution of deformation and ice concentration in the computation of the atmospheric drag coefficients we show in fig 6 the time evolution from 1990 to 2010 of mean atmospheric drag coefficients due to deformation energy and due to ice concentration in some regions of interest in general the contribution due to ice concentration shows a larger seasonal variability since in winter the ice concentration approaches 1 almost everywhere in the arctic and the ice concentration term drops to zero the contribution of the two terms is different for different regions and shows also an interannual variability in the lincoln sea the total atmospheric drag is always dominated by deformation in the central arctic the deformation energy term dominates in winter whereas in summer the drag is dominated by the ice concentration term in the laptev sea not shown the contribution of the deformation energy remains always very small in the beaufort sea the contribution of the two terms varies with time the same holds for the east siberian sea not shown 3 3 sea ice mean summer ice concentration is lowest in the laptev sea and east siberian sea a 0 4 and highest in the lincoln sea and the central arctic a 0 8 in both drags and mean table 7 in winter the differences between the two runs drags mean in ice concentration are visible only in the miz fig 7 a in summer the ice concentration is reduced almost everywhere in the arctic basin when we introduce variable drag coefficients drags except for the beaufort sea fig 7b in both winter and summer the differences remain between 10 and 20 mean summer ice thickness in the arctic ocean ranges from 0 5 m in the east siberian sea and laptev sea to up to 7 m in the lincoln sea table 7 between drags and mean the ice thickness differences in the western sector of the arctic ocean are on the order of 0 5 m in both march and september in the lincoln sea differences are larger than 1 m in our simulations summer sea ice velocities are on the order of 5 cm s 1 in the arctic ocean faster ice is a characteristic of the beaufort sea with 5 25 cm s 1 in drags and 4 90 cm s 1 in mean very low values are found in the lincoln sea where the ice remains constrained between the coasts of greenland and ellesmere island and it is characterized by velocities smaller than 1 cm s 1 north of greenland and in the fram strait the ice moves faster in drags than in mean and the arrows indicate a larger export of ice through the fram strait in summer when the ice is more mobile differences are larger and the pattern of these differences is more pronounced the drift difference arrows show the anticyclonic pattern in the beaufort gyre fig 7f that usually dominates in summer thus showing an increased anticyclonic circulation in drags than in mean 3 4 ocean surface in order to evaluate the effects of the new drag formulation on the surface ocean we analyze sea surface temperature θ surface salinity and mixed layer depth mld in winter temperatures are equal to the freezing point everywhere in the arctic ocean except in the miz fig 8 and table 7 in summer fig 8b the coldest temperatures are found in the nansen basin mean values vary between 0 24 c in the east siberian sea and 1 66 c in the lincoln sea temperature differences between drags and means are no larger than 0 06 c surface salinity in winter ranges between 33 and 35 except for the beaufort sea and east siberian sea where values are lower than 32 fig 9 a the surface salinity differences in winter are on the order of 0 2 except for the laptev sea and kara sea with differences up to 0 5 on average the mean mld in september is deeper by 3 m in the drags run than in the mean run fig 10 a c this is a big difference because in the mean run the mld reaches average summer depths in the sea ice covered area of 8 m 2 m in winter the mixed layer is deeper everywhere in the arctic basin for both mean 39 11ṁ and drags 43 12 m the mld differences drags mean are smaller in winter than in summer note that the model layer thickness is 10 m at the surface and we use a density criterion section 2 to estimate mlds the impact of variable drag coefficients on the mld should be tested using an ocean model that can resolve the ocean surface at a finer scale 1 3 m in this case though the approach used in the present work i e using the computed drag coefficients to calculate the ocean currents in the first surface layer would result erroneous roy et al 2015 3 5 ocean interior we evaluate the effects of the new drag parameterization on the ocean interior by analyzing the september stream function which specifies the character cyclonic or anticyclonic of the flow a vertical salinity profile along an oceanic transect through a large freshwater reservoir in the beaufort sea in september fig 1 and the circulation in the mid atlantic water mid aw layer between 350 m and 800 m depth the stream function fig 10 is computed by vertically integrating the climatological horizontal velocity for september it illustrates the well known arctic circulation pattern with a more or less clear separation between the eurasian and canadian basin steiner et al 2004 there is a strong anticyclonic circulation in the beaufort sea that reflects the surface beaufort gyre whereas the central arctic ocean circulation is dominated by a cyclonic pattern of the atlantic water in the ocean interior the differences drags mean fig 10d point to a stronger beaufort gyre in drags in agreement with the ice drift stronger ice drift leads to an intensified anticyclonic circulation also in the upper ocean layer the cyclonic pattern in the central arctic ocean interior is also stronger the vertical salinity profile fig 11 a down to 250 m for the drags run shows the accumulation of fresher water at the surface of the beaufort sea the 32 isohaline reaches down to ca 150 m the difference map drags mean fig 11b shows a thin layer of saltier water at the surface first 10 m in agreement with fig 9d in the deep beaufort sea the difference map shows fresher water extending to 120 m depth in the central arctic ca the drags run water masses are saltier with differences extending down to 250 m depth finally we compare the circulation of the atlantic water in the mid aw layer in fig 12 a we show the mid aw circulation in the drags run the typical pattern as inferred from observations carmack et al 1995 rudels et al 1994 1999 swift et al 1997 and previous model results holland et al 1996 karcher and oberhuber 2002 karcher et al 2003 is represented the circulation is cyclonic in the beaufort sea canadian basin and in the makarov basin the inflow from the fram strait with a branch of mid aw flowing along the continental margins of the eurasian and makarov basin is also represented finally the mid aw flows along the continental slope of greenland and leaves through the fram strait the cyclonic circulation in the beaufort sea is slightly slower in the drags run fig 12b a stronger flow of mid aw between the alpha ridge and makarov basin is directed towards the fram strait also the flow along the lincoln shelf is enhanced in the makarov basin the cyclonic mid aw circulation is slowed down for drags compared to mean 3 6 differences between new mean drag coefficients and original values the newly implemented drag coefficients parameterization not only leads to more variability but also to mean drag coefficients that are generally larger atmosphere or smaller ocean than the default values of ctrl this implies a change in the nansen number between mean and ctrl that can lead to changes in sea ice drift and sea ice properties in particular we expect faster ice as a result of the higher atmospheric drag coefficients 1 36 10 3 compared to 1 10 3 and the lower oceanic ones 2 82 10 3 compared to 5 4 10 3 this motivates an additional comparison for the simulated sea ice properties between the mean run and the ctrl run mean values of sea ice concentration thickness and drift for the entire arctic basin and for regions of interested are listed in table 7 difference maps for sea ice concentration thickness and drift in march and september are shown in fig 13 differences in ice concentration are larger in september than in march during winter the ice concentration is 1 almost everywhere in the arctic ocean so differences are seen only in the miz fig 13a in summer the sea ice areal extent in mean is reduced in the central arctic basin lincoln sea and beaufort sea table 7 a stronger reduction is seen in the east siberian sea laptev sea and kara sea ice thickness fig 13c and d is reduced in large parts of the arctic basin in winter with the exception of the chukchi sea where the ice thickness in mean is 0 5 m larger than in ctrl in summer the pattern is the same with a general reduction of ice over the entire arctic ocean large differences are seen in the lincoln sea with mean summer ice thickness decreasing from 8 46 m in ctrl to 7 86 m in mean the ice moves faster in mean than in ctrl as expected by the change in the nansen number particularly the circulation patterns are enhanced in both winter and summer figs 13e and f show a stronger beaufort gyre and a stronger transpolar drift stream differences are relevant in the lincoln sea with changes in mean summer drift from 0 02 cm s 1 in ctrl to 0 11 cm s 1 in mean and in the central arctic with an increase from 1 58 cm s 1 in ctrl to 2 43 cm s 1 in mean 4 discussion with the implementation of eqs 10 and 11 drag coefficients vary according to season and region not shown between 0 88 10 3 and 4 68 10 3 for atmospheric drag coefficients and between 1 28 10 3 and 13 68 10 3 for the oceanic ones our computed atmospheric and oceanic drag coefficients fall into the range of observed and topography based estimated values see table 1 but never reach the extremes the steiner 2001 approach relies on the fraction of energy that goes into deformation and is thus responsible for an increase in surface roughness and in drag coefficients this contribution is expressed by the terms ma and mw in eqs 10 and 11 these terms cannot be measured directly in the field and thus represent a large uncertainty of the parameterization our results for different regions represent the general pattern shown in large scale estimates based on satellite data petty et al 2017 with higher values in regions where the ice is more deformed due to proximity to the coast lincoln sea and due to convergent drift central arctic and lower values in the marginal seas laptev sea and east siberian sea atmospheric drag coefficients computed in a different sea ice model tsamados et al 2014 and based on different parameterizations lüpkes et al 2013 than ours vary between 0 3 10 3 and 4 10 3 whereas oceanic drag coefficients vary between 2 10 3 and 20 10 3 in good agreement with our results the extra contribution of melt pond edges on the atmospheric drag coefficients not included explicitly in our parameterization is visible in summer particularly in july and august see tsamados et al 2014 their figure 7 in these months however the contribution of melt pond edges to the total drag coefficients is much smaller than the other terms deformation ice concentration skin drag the form drag contribution to the total drag in tsamados et al 2014 is based on an itd model where the amount of thick ridged ice in a grid cell is used to estimate geometric parameters i e sail height and distance between sails and keel depth and distance to be used in the parameterization for drag coefficients in contrast we rely on the deformation energy as an explicit function of internal forces in the ice and from which we derive the drag coefficients in spite of these differences our results are very similar to those of tsamados et al 2014 in many respects drag coefficients are higher in summer than in winter and the contribution of the different terms differ with season that is in winter the total drag is dominated by deformation whereas in summer the drag is dominated by the ice concentration term the newly implemented parameterization affects the simulated sea ice properties that is extent thickness and drift in general the ice moves faster is thinner and the overall area is reduced table 7 in particular the sea ice drift increase in the western part of the arctic results in a decrease of ice thickness particularly in the lincoln sea and along the north coast of greenland region where the highest atmospheric drag coefficients are found the larger sea ice velocities along the north coast of greenland directed towards the fram strait explain the reduction of ice concentration in the same region correlations between differences in ice thickness and ice velocities are significant but weak r 0 2 for the entire arctic basin and for most of the regions of interest exceptions are the lincoln sea with r 0 28 between changes in ice thickness and changes in sea ice drift and the central arctic with r 0 29 to compare the realism of the different simulations we use a cost function computed for the different sea ice variables in winter and in summer table 3 the total cost function value that is the model data misfit is smaller for the drags run than for the mean run in particular the ice concentration in both summer and winter the march ice thickness and the summer sea ice drift are better simulated with the variable drag coefficients the default values of constant drag coefficients in the ctrl run gives the largest model data misfit largest cost function except for winter ice concentration the differences drags ctrl in winter ice concentration not shown point to a southward shift of the marginal ice zone this is due to the larger nansen number in drags that makes the ice more mobile in general the differences between mean and ctrl are larger than between drags and mean we conclude that the variable drag parameterization improves the model simulation but to first order this improvement can already be achieved by adjusting the mean drag coefficients and hence the nansen number we can thus suggest a new set of constant drag coefficients that improve the simulated sea ice characteristics additional improvement in the model simulations is caused by the spatial variability of the drag coefficients with variable drag coefficients in the drags run mixing tends to be stronger leading to deeper mixed layers mlds estimates from observations are sparse in summer the few available ones range from 8 m to 20 m in the beaufort sea yang et al 2004 lemke and manley 1984 peralta ferriz and woodgate 2015 the mean mld of 10 m in the drags run agrees better with these estimates than the 7 m in the mean run mld data based on the noaa world ocean atlas monterey and dewitt 1997 give a mean value of 8 7 m and values up to 440 m for the entire arctic basin in september here the mean mld of 8 2 m in the mean run appears to be closer to observation than the mean of 11 2 m in the drags run but this is confounded by the large range of mlds in the observations and the ambiguous estimation methods in winter in the central arctic mld values are between 25 m and 50 m treshnikov and baranov 1973 compared to the simulated 42 m in both mean and drags in general the agreement with independent estimates of mlds is ambiguous and both drags and mean agree with observational estimates similarly well we remind that our numerical surface ocean layer is 10 m thick and mlds are sometimes smaller making our mld estimates less accurate than with a model with higher vertical resolution changes due to variable drag coefficients in sea surface temperatures are small in most regions note that in the present model study the heat exchange coefficients do not depend on the surface roughness thus the changes in surface temperature are only an indirect consequence of the changes in the sea ice properties the pattern in surface temperature changes does not suggest any trend in the lincoln sea the reduction in ice thickness correlates with an increase in temperature r 0 39 pointing to an increased heat flux that penetrates the thinner ice and reaches the ocean surface a similar strong correlation is found in the central arctic r 0 5 whereas in the other regions the correlation is significant but weak differences in salinity point to a more saline sea surface in summer and fresher water in the interior of the beaufort sea the amount of fresh water relative to a reference salinity of 34 8 proshutinsky et al 2009 roy et al 2015 in the beaufort sea not shown here is larger in drags than in mean this agrees with roy et al 2015 who show an increased fresh water retention in the beaufort gyre due to stronger ice ocean and air ice roughness the mean values of atmospheric and oceanic drag coefficients in the beaufort sea see table 5 point to a larger surface and bottom surface roughness in this region compared to the values in mean moreover fig 7f shows a stronger beaufort gyre which explains the retention of fresh water in that region the total liquid arctic fresh water budget is higher in mean than in the drags and in the ctrl runs but the differences remain very small 5 summary and conclusion atmospheric and oceanic drag coefficients vary in time and space as a consequence of the interplay between sea ice deformation and sea ice concentration in the present study we introduce variable atmospheric and oceanic drag coefficients in a coupled sea ice ocean model and we quantify the effects of the new parameterization on the main sea ice properties and on the ocean this is achieved by comparing three simulations two simulations with constant drag coefficients and a simulation where the drag coefficients are parameterized as a function of ice concentration and deformation energy simulated atmospheric and oceanic drag coefficients fall in the range of observed values and agree with recent estimates based on topography profiles and model results in our study resulting atmospheric and oceanic drag coefficients can evolve spatially and temporally as function of sea ice characteristics in winter drag coefficients are dominated by sea ice deformation whereas in summer ice concentration contributes most the dynamic sea ice state is affected by the new parameterization particularly in summer the ice moves faster is thinner and the areal extent is reduced when variable drag coefficients are used the ice thickness shows differences up to 0 5 m in the arctic basin in the lincoln sea more ice is removed due to higher drag coefficients and thickness differences are up to 1 m pointing to a strong reduction of ice volume in that region the variable drag parameterization does not have a uniform effect in the arctic basin but the impact is more visible in the western sector of the arctic with variable drag coefficients the model misfit with observations is improved particularly for sea ice thickness in march sea ice drift in summer and sea ice concentration in summer and winter the mean values of drag coefficients computed from the run with variable ones are a better set of parameters for simulations with constant drag coefficients the new set of constant drag coefficients is obtained by the optimization of a sophisticated drag coefficient parameterization and differ from values emerging by a different optimization our study represents the first implementation of a parameterization for surface dependent drag coefficients in a coupled sea ice ocean model not only does this approach allow a more physical representation of the sea ice evolution by including the sea ice ocean feedbacks but also it makes possible the analysis of its effects on the ocean circulation with the new implementation surface mixing is stronger and causes a deeper mixed layer particularly in summer finally the effects of the newly implemented parameterization reach the ocean interior causing changes in atlantic water circulation based on the analysis of climatological maps these effects are small the model configuration used in the present study allows us to investigate the main feedbacks due to variable drag coefficients nevertheless this configuration is simple and the effects of variable drag coefficients should be tested on a more complex model including an itd an ice strength parameterization and the effects of atmospheric instability moreover the effects on the mixed layer depth should be tested using a model with a better vertical resolution in the surface ocean in a natural continuation of this study the effects of our parameterization implementation on the atmosphere and ensuing feedbacks should be studied in a coupled atmosphere ice ocean model finally in the light of the recent increase in sea ice drift spreen et al 2011 kwok et al 2013 our results may be even more relevant to the community
