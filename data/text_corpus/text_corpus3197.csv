15985,knowledge of the fate and transport of metal organic frameworks mofs in porous media is essential to understanding their environmental impacts however to date the transport mechanisms of mofs are not fully revealed meanwhile surfactants can promote mofs dispersion by forming a stable suspension they also allow mofs to migrate in the aqueous environment which would increase the risks of mofs being exposed to human health and the ecological environment in this study the effect of surfactants type and nanoparticle np concentrations 50 100 and 200 mg l were investigated using a sand column to study the transportability of zif 8 nps in saturated porous media surfactants used were categorized into three groups including cationic surfactants ctab dtab anionic surfactants sdbs sds and nonionic surfactants tween 80 tween 20 experimental results showed that the ionic surfactants significantly increased the transportability of zif 8 nps furthermore a low concentration of nps tended to break through the column under ionic surfactant conditions and the maximum effluent recovery of zif 8 nps 50 mg l was 87 4 in the presence of sds nevertheless zif 8 nps tended to deposit in the inlet of the sand column in the presence of nonionic surfactants due to hydrodynamic bridging and straining this research provides a comprehensive understanding of the deposition mechanism of zif 8 nps as affected by surfactant types and np concentrations most importantly the study highlights those ionic surfactants had a significant impact on the mobility of zif 8 nps which arouses attention to the ecological and human health risk assessment related to the manufacturing of mofs with the aid of various dispersing agents graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords zif 8 nps surfactant type surface tension transport straining 1 introduction metal organic frameworks mofs are porous crystalline materials with inorganic nodes connected by organic bridges wei et al 2020 as the subfamily of typical mofs zeolitic imidazolate frameworks zif nanoparticles nps have been widely used in the fields of medicine he et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 electrochemistry cao et al 2021 han et al 2019 and environmental remediation fu et al 2019 li et al 2016 sann et al 2018 wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b in recent years due to outstanding performance in various studies e g facile synthesis controllable pore size high specific surface area high porosity low density and good chemical tunability zhang et al 2021b zhang et al 2019 the applications of zif 8 and zif 8 composites have been surging which make us consider the possible environmental risks associated with its synthesis migration and transformation for example ruyra et al 2015 revealed that zif 8 could induce responses of reactive oxygen species ros and the immune system in zebrafish wagner et al 2019 stated that zif 8 could interact with the lipid layers of the human lung epithelial cell s membrane thus resulting in increased uptake of zif 8 nps and changes to membrane integrity and cell signaling when zif 8 is used as a subsurface material its migration with water will likely cause some concerns to groundwater quality due to the introduction of organic and inorganic moieties many zif 8 applications such as solar cell zhang et al 2019 polymer composite thompson et al 2012 and conductive thin film cui et al 2017 require the preparation of soluble zif 8 nps i e well dispersed zif 8 nps suspension however the task is challenging as pristine zif 8 nps are hydrophobic and tend to form agglomerates due to the strong van der waals force kebria et al 2019 surfactants are amphiphilic compounds that contain both hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties the hydrophobic chains of surfactant molecules can easily combine with the hydrophobic zif 8 nps then the hydrophilic moieties of the surfactant are exposed to the outside making the zif 8 nps more hydrophilic some reports have stated that surfactants have important influences on the stability of nps suspension through steric hindrance and surface covering hu et al 2020 for example jia et al 2017 pointed out that poly vinyl alcohol can stabilize the zif 8 particles in water via hydrogen bonds surfactants were also reported to reduce the surface energy of water insoluble substances and nps jia et al 2003 thus enhancing their transport in porous media such as silver leo et al 2013 titanium dioxide ghadimi and metselaar 2013 silica zargartalebi et al 2014 hydrophobic microplastics jiang et al 2021 graphene gr liu et al 2015 single walled carbon swnts tian et al 2011 nano tio2 and nano ceo2 dai et al 2022 although surface modification by surfactants promotes the application of zif it may also affect the fate and transport behaviors of zif 8 once it is released into the environment therefore the presence of surfactants in the environment is likely to aggravate the environmental hazards of zif 8 nps or facilitate the co transport of toxic chemicals li et al 2022 however there has been no study on the transport of zif 8 nps in porous media as affected by surfactants to date the transport and retention of nps in porous media are affected by many factors including the size shape of the particles the flow velocity and the chemical features of porewater they are gradually taken into consideration during the development of modeling technique the colloidal filtration theory cft holds that the removal nps is described by first order kinetics with a spatially and temporally constant rate of nps deposition and the concentrations of retained nps decrease log linearly with distance tufenkji and elimelech 2004 however the available mathematical models based on cft frequently do not investigate the physicochemical processes that nps undergo during transport in porous media goldberg et al 2014 babakhani 2019 provided an improved mathematical model that considers transport and aggregation of nps and evaluates their size exclusion later on katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2021 developed a model that accounts for changes e g size of aggregated particles and potential repulsive interactions between particles in nps attachment onto solid matrix in particular aggregation was shown to either decrease or increase nps attachment onto the solid matrix depending on particle size and to yield early or late breakthrough the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory is widely adopted to explain the mechanism of colloid adhesion according to the dlvo theory the stability of nps can be evaluated as the sum of van der waals vdw and electrical double layer edl interactions the resultant interaction energy vt which is the sum of vdw and edl interactions determines the nps stability as the two surfaces approach one another ryan and elimelech 1996 beyond the traditional colloidal interactions considered in the dlvo theory a number of non dlvo forces can also influence the stability of nps in aqueous environments de vicente et al 2000 the most significant forces encountered by nps in aqueous media include steric interactions magnetic forces for iron based nps and hydration forces petosa et al 2010 in this work we examined the mobility and stability of zif 8 nps through a series of column experiments in porous media in the presence of cationic surfactants cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab and dodecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide dtab anionic surfactants sodium dodecyl benzenesulfonate sdbs and sodium dodecyl sulfonate sds and nonionic surfactants tween 80 and tween 20 our initial hypothesis was that these disparate surfactants would affect the mobility of zif 8 nps in porous media in different manners and to different degrees because of their distinct electrostatic properties 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials zinc nitrate hexahydrate zn no3 2 6h2o hushi shanghai china ar 2 methylimidazole 2 meim aladdin chemistry co ltd 98 methanol meoh hushi shanghai china ar were used to synthesize zif 8 nps other chemicals include potassium iodide ki hushi shanghai china ar cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab hushi shanghai china ar dodecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide dtab macklin shanghai china ar sodium dodecyl benzenesulfonate sdbs hushi shanghai china ar sodium dodecyl sulfonate sds hushi shanghai china ar polysorbate 20 tween 20 hushi shanghai china ar and polysorbate 80 tween 80 hushi shanghai china ar milli q water 18 25 mω cm 1 water was used throughout the experiments to prepare solutions the porous media used for transport experiments was quartz sand standard sand hushi shanghai china ar with sizes ranging from 0 50 0 60 mm the quartz sand was soaked alternately in a 0 1 mol l naoh solution and a 0 1 mol l hcl solution for 24 h to remove excess metal ions and colloidal substances then it was repeatedly rinsed with milli q water until the supernatant was clear and the ph was neutral finally the clean quartz sand was dried at 75 c in an oven for 48 h 2 2 synthesis of zif 8 as previously reported zhu et al 2017 1 125 g zn no3 2 6h2o and 3 11 g 2 meim 2 methylimidazole were respectively dissolved in 75 ml methanol completely then the latter solution was carefully dipped into the former to form a milky solution followed by ultrasonic vibration 40 khz 5 min then the milky mixture was kept still at room temperature 25 c for 24 h the product was collected by centrifugation 8000 rpm 10 min then washed with methanol several times and finally dried in a vacuum oven at 60 c for 48 h to obtain the zif 8 2 3 solution preparation herein the critical micelle concentration cmc of surfactants used in the study were 0 8 mm for ctab bahri et al 2006 14 mm for dtab bahri et al 2006 2 9 mm for sdbs liu et al 2019 9 mm for sds bahri et al 2006 0 44 mm for tween 80 and 0 94 mm for tween 20 waters et al 2020 the zif 8 nps suspension was prepared by adding 100 mg of zif 8 powder to 1 l of milli q water at ph 7 the desired surfactant concentrations were 0 2 cmc 0 5 cmc 1 0 cmc and 1 2 cmc table 1 the mixture was then sonicated for 0 5 h to obtain the zif 8 working suspension for the transport experiment the control group of zif 8 np suspension with no added surfactant was prepared similarly after standing for 24 h each supernatant was filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane filter the total zn content in the supernatant was used to quantify the concentration of zif 8 suspension briefly zif 8 was digested with concentrated hno3 at 100 c for 24 h and then the supernatant was filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane the zn concentration was measured on an atomic absorption spectrometer aas pinaacle 900f perkinelmer and the concentration of zn2 was converted to the concentration of zif 8 nps according to its stoichiometry zn zif 8 0 2856 mass ratio 2 4 column experiments columns 10 0 cm length 1 6 cm inner diameter were wet packed with the quartz sand at a porosity of 0 42 in brief the quartz sand was carefully added to the column using a spatula and then gently vibrated to ensure uniform packing two stainless steel screens with a pore size of 50 μm were used to seal both ends of the columns a steady upward flow at a rate of 1 ml min darcy velocity of 0 20 cm min was maintained by a peristaltic pump shenchen lab2015 baoding shenchen pump co ltd china connected to the inlet to reduce air entrapment before column experiments the packed columns were first flushed with milli q water for 1 h to remove the suspended solids and other impurities followed by flushing background surfactant solutions table 1 for 2 h to equilibrate the hydrodynamic and chemical conditions after that 12 pore volumes pvs of zif 8 suspension with desired surfactant conditions table 1 were injected into the columns followed by flushing with several pvs of background solution the zif 8 input suspension was continuously stirred on a magnetic stirrer to maintain homogeneity throughout the experimental period effluent samples of the column were collected using a fraction collector bs 30a huxi analysis instrument factory co ltd shanghai china potassium iodide 15 mg l was used as the conservative tracer to determine flow patterns in the columns which followed the typical transport pattern fig s1 the concentration of iodide ion i was determined by uv 3600 spectrophotometer uv 3600 daojin japan at the absorbance of 226 nm the breakthrough curves btcs of zif 8 were obtained by plotting the normalized effluent concentration i e the ratio of effluent concentration to influent concentration c c0 vs pv the stock suspension was freshly prepared each time before the column experiment 2 5 characterization zif 8 agglomeration and dispersibility were characterized through a series of analytical techniques the particle morphology of the zif 8 was investigated by scanning electron microscope sem su8220 hitachi x ray diffraction xrd bruker d8 advance ger analysis was carried out on a rigaku d max 2500 diffractometer with cu kα radiation at a scan rate of 2 min range of 5 45 the zeta potential of zif 8 suspension was measured using malvern zeta sizer nano zs90 at room temperature the wettability of zif 8 nps was measured by contact angle meter jy 82b kruss dsa and the liquid surface tension was analyzed by surface tension detector dataphysics dcat 21 2 6 data analysis the experimental single collector removal efficiency η was determined from each particle breakthrough curve as follows tufenkji and elimelech 2005 1 η 2 3 d c 1 ε l ln c e c 0 for the transport experiments the deposition rate of colloid on sand kd was calculated by equation 2 and 3 2 k d 3 1 ε v 2 d c η 3 k d v l ln c 0 c e where dc is the diameter of the collector grains ε is the bed porosity v cm min is the pore water velocity l cm is the length

8 3 results and discussion 3 1 static water stability test results 3 1 1 particle morphology and wettability the morphology of zif 8 nps in different surfactant suspensions is shown in fig 1 it can be determined that the zif 8 nps kept their original rhombic dodecahedral shape in the presence of surfactant solution fig 1 a f in the presence of surfactants the contact angles of zif 8 were all reduced from 114 3 to less than 96 fig 1 g m and the ionic surfactants reduced the values to a greater extent than the nonionic ones suggesting that the wettability hydrophilicity of zif 8 nps was improved significantly the xrd patterns of the surfactant immersed zif 8 samples still showed the characteristic peaks of zif 8 fig 1 n suggesting the unchanged crystal structure 3 1 2 apparent zeta potentials the typical zeta potentials for sand grain sio2 particles are negative under environmental ph values ph 5 9 because of low phzpc 2 9 litton and olson 1996 in the surfactant solutions the zeta potential of sand grains ranged from 41 3 to 46 1 mv in ctab 50 0 to 51 7 mv in dtab 47 4 to 55 3 mv in sdbs 38 2 to 47 0 mv in sds 22 1 to 30 5 mv in tween 80 and 22 1 to 30 5 mv in tween 20 fig 2 a the ctab dtab adsorbed layer around quartz sand resulted in the zeta potential of quartz sand turning from negative to positive zhang and somasundaran 2006 meanwhile the zeta potentials of zif 8 nps in the surfactant suspensions ranged from 23 6 to 28 3 mv in ctab 31 8 to 39 3 mv in dtab 30 8 to 45 4 mv in sdbs 26 9 to 36 5 mv in sds 19 1 to 20 0 mv in tween 80 and 25 6 to 26 4 mv in tween 20 fig 2 b noteworthily the apparent zeta potentials were the final output of materials electricity in the solution the inner mechanisms may be complicated and vary with the types of surfactants the interactions of zif 8 with quartz sands and the three kinds of surfactants varied a lot which may finally regulate and determine the transport behavior of zif 8 in the sand column in the cationic surfactant suspension hydrophilic groups of ctab or dtab may bind to the negatively charged quartz sand surface exposing the hydrophobic group to the solution and binding the surfactant s free hydrophobic groups in the solution by hydrophobic interactions sun et al 2015 thus the quartz sand surface was covered with two layers of cationic surfactant one layer developed by electrostatic attraction and the other by hydrophobic effects fig 3 a conversely the nonionic surfactants adsorbed to the sand surfaces with only one layer by hydrophobic interactions and the anionic surfactants did not adsorb to the surfaces of sand due to electrostatic repulsion fig 3 b c meanwhile there was one layer of anionic surfactants adsorbed on the positively charged zif 8 nps surface by electrostatic attraction and hydrophobic interaction pan et al 2011 for the cationic and nonionic surfactants only one layer of surfactants could be loosely bound to the surface of zif 8 nps by hydrophobic interaction 3 1 3 released zn2 from zif 8 nps the dissolution of zn2 from zif 8 nps in milli q water was only 3 33 fig s2a in the presence of surfactants except for the sds at 1 2 cmc the dissolution of zn2 from zif 8 nps was less than 3 33 the reduced zn2 releasing rates may be due to the complexation of zn by these surfactants with anionic surfactants sdbs and sds showing higher complexation rates than the cationic ctab and dtab and nonionic surfactants tween 80 and tween 20 fig s2b in this way surfactants promoted mofs dispersion to form a stable suspension and weakened the agglomeration of nps kebria et al 2019 3 2 effect of cationic surfactants concentration on the transport of zif 8 nps in porous media the transportability of zif 8 nps at high surfactant concentrations was higher than that at low concentrations the effluent recovery of zif 8 nps at ctab concentrations of 0 2 0 5 1 0 and 1 2 cmc was 14 78 14 34 21 17 and 17 77 respectively the effluent recovery of zif 8 nps in dtab concentrations of 0 2 0 5 1 0 and 1 2 cmc was 8 03 21 10 33 81 and 32 27 respectively table 1 the result showed that the transportability of zif 8 nps increased with the increasing ctab dtab concentration as discussed above the deposition process on sand grains depended on the combined effects of electrostatic force and hydrophobic interaction the cationic surfactant ctab dtab was readily adsorbed onto the negatively charged sand through electrostatic attraction between the cationic quaternary ammonium groups and negatively charged sand zhang and somasundaran 2006 such attractive interactions facilitated the formation of large sand aggregates and narrowed the pore throat between the sand grains fig 3 a when nps are larger than the inlet of a pore throat straining occurs and will easily lead to retaining of zif 8 nps in the pore throat bradford et al 2005 zhang et al 2021a besides surfactants are amphiphilic molecules and zif 8 nps are hydrophobic substances thus the hydrophobic tail chains of surfactants were attached to zif 8 s hydrophobic surface due to van der waals force and hydrophobic interaction dederichs et al 2009 while the hydrophilic moiety of surfactants were exposed to the solution phase therefore the zif 8 nps well enveloped by surfactant molecules could exhibit improved hydrophilicity promoting the suspension and enhancing zif 8 nps transport in porous media dollinger et al 2018 the breakthrough curves of zif 8 nps at different ctab dtab concentrations were displayed in fig 4 a b the maximum relative concentration of zif 8 nps recorded in the effluent was 0 18 at 11 pv in 1 0 cmc ctab and 0 35 at 11 pv in 1 0 cmc dtab indicating higher transportability of zif 8 in dtab solutions than ctab it is also well known that surfactant molecules tend to form a monolayer in the gas liquid interface to reduce the surface tension waters et al 2020 with the increasing concentration of surfactant the surfactant molecules tend to form a single molecule layer at the interface until saturated and then form micelle in the solution waters et al 2020 when zif 8 nps were added to the surfactant solution the free surfactant molecules tended to gather on the surface of particles to form the surfactant coated zif 8 nps which enhanced the dispersibility and stability of nps the length of a hydrophobic chain of ctab is longer than that of dtab and the cmc of ctab 0 8 mm is lower than dtab 14 mm it led to a less tightened coating of surfactant on the surface of zif 8 nps and easier formation of micelles in ctab than in dtab thus the interaction between zif 8 nps and sand made it easier for ctab molecules to escape from the surface of zif 8 nps lu et al 2014 resulting in a less stable surfactant coated zif 8 and a lower breakthrough concentration of zif 8 nps in ctab noteworthily the transportability of zif 8 nps was not significantly improved when the concentration of surfactant exceeded cmc further increasing the surfactant concentration did not promote the transport of zif 8 nps but slightly inhibited it this can be explained by the change of zeta potential the zeta potential of zif 8 nps at ctab concentrations of 0 2 0 5 1 0 and 1 2 cmc were 23 6 26 1 28 3 and 25 2 mv respectively that at dtab concentrations of 0 2 0 5 1 0 and 1 2 cmc were 31 8 35 7 39 3 and 36 7 mv respectively table 1 at the same time the surface potential of sand in the ctab or dtab solutions was also changed to be positive the combined surface repulsion between sand and zif 8 presented as potentials was 64 8 ev 0 2 cmc 71 4 ev 0 5 cmc 74 4 ev 1 0 cmc and 71 4 ev 1 2 cmc for ctab and 82 1 ev 0 2 cmc 85 7 ev 0 5 cmc 91 0 ev 1 0 cmc and 88 4 ev 1 2 cmc for dtab respectively the absolute zeta potential value was not increased abruptly at the surfactant concentration of 1 2 cmc suggesting weaker electrostatic repulsion between the zif 8 nps and quartz sands meanwhile free ctab dtab molecules will spontaneously form micelles in the solution when ctab dtab is greater than cmc jiao et al 2018 and the micelles existing in the solution can narrow the pore throat and hinder the migration of nps yang and balhoff 2017 3 3 effect of anionic surfactants concentration on the transport of zif 8 nps in porous media the effluent recovery of zif 8 nps at sdbs concentrations of 0 2 0 5 1 0 and 1 2 cmc were 1 75 6 90 37 46 and 19 28 respectively the effluent recovery of zif 8 nps in sds were 13 96 22 96 65 16 and 55 22 respectively table 1 anionic surfactants tend to adsorb on the positively charged zif 8 nps hence the zeta potential of zif 8 nps at sdbs concentrations of 0 2 0 5 1 0 and 1 2 cmc were 30 8 42 1 45 4 and 45 4 mv and accordingly at sds solutions were 26 9 31 2 36 5 and 32 9 mv respectively fig 2 in the presence of anionic surfactant the zeta potential of colloids often increases while the van der waals attraction between colloid and sand surface decreases resulting in increased repulsion and colloid release batra et al 2001 on the one hand steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion may be enhanced between the sdbs sds modified zif 8 nps and the sand surface alsubaie et al 2021 on the other hand anionic surfactants tend to increase the electrostatic repulsion of negatively charged quartz sand and increase the pore throat between sand grains han et al 2008 fig 3 b thereby the nps outflow rate increased to 65 16 in the presence of 1 0 cmc of sds as compared to 8 70 in water it was found that the transport behavior of zif 8 nps was similar to that under the ctab dtab conditions the breakthrough curves of zif 8 nps under different sdbs sds concentrations are shown in fig 4 c d the maximum relative concentration of zif 8 nps recorded in the effluent was 0 37 at 10 pv in sdbs and 0 50 at 11 pv in sds the spatial structure of sdbs is much more complex than that of sds due to the existence of a benzene ring and the cmc of sdbs 2 9 mm is lower than that of sds 9 mm thereby the steric hindrance and micellar effect caused the higher breakthrough concentration of nps in sds than in sdbs in addition increasing the concentration of sdbs sds in the solution could improve the transportability of zif 8 nps however noticeable inhibition effects occurred when the concentration was greater than 1 0 cmc the reason was again the reduced repulsion between colloids and sand surface yet a difference involved might be the ionic strength of surfactant solution in the sdbs sds solutions the free na carried by surfactant could also increase solution ionic strength which compressed the electric double layer and reduced the electrostatic repulsions between nps and quartz sand surfaces thus promoting the deposition of zif 8 nps hahn and o melia 2004 as fig 5 a d showed the kd values of zif 8 nps in the cationic surfactant immersed sand columns ranged from 0 14 to 0 17 min 1 for ctab and 0 08 to 0 22 min 1 for dtab respectively in comparison the kd values of zif 8 nps in the anionic surfactant systems ranged from 0 08 to 0 39 min 1 for sdbs and 0 05 to 0 19 min 1 for sds respectively these kd values were similar to the retention of surfactant modified carbon nanotubes and graphene oxides in saturated sand media bouchard et al 2012 liu et al 2015 the transportability of zif 8 nps in the sand columns present a trend with anionic surfactant cationic surfactant i e sds sdbs dtab ctab it suggests that the characteristics of surfactants regulated the interactions between zif 8 nps and sand grains and played an important role in the transport of zif 8 nps 3 4 effect of nonionic surfactants concentration on the transport of zif 8 nps in porous media the breakthrough curves of zif 8 nps under different tween 80 tween 20 concentrations were shown in fig 4 e f the maximum relative concentration of zif 8 nps was 0 06 at 13 pv and 0 11 at 14 pv in tween 80 and tween 20 respectively when flushed with background surfactant solutions the breakthrough curves of zif 8 nps went down first and then rose which means that the zif 8 nps originally deposited on sand surface may be released later the effluent recovery of zif 8 nps at tween 80 concentrations of 0 2 0 5 1 0 and 1 2 cmc were 4 34 5 04 5 05 and 5 08 and that at corresponding tween 20 concentrations were 6 60 4 48 9 40 and 7 15 respectively table 1 the kd values of zif 8 nps at the nonionic surfactant conditions were generally higher than 0 2 min 1 fig 5 e f on the one hand the zeta potential of zif 8 nps and quartz sand results table 1 demonstrated that nonionic surfactants did not influence the surface charge characteristic of nps and sand and the electrostatic forces between the positively charged nps and negatively charged sand caused an agglomeration and great retention of zif 8 nps in the sand columns han et al 2008 on the other hand the anchoring of nonionic surfactant heads to the zif 8 and sand surface was due to weak interactions such as hydrogen bonding in this situation micelle adsorption on the zif 8 nps surface may be disfavored versus micelles in solution leaving more free micelles in the solution and further hindering the transport of nps azar et al 2019 li and ishiguro 2016 ríos et al 2018 therefore zif 8 nps tended to deposit on the sand surface under the action of nonionic surfactants in addition the surface tension of zif 8 nps in various solutions followed in the order of water tween 80 tween 20 ctab dtab sdbs sds fig 6 a and the kd values were also in the sequence of water tween 80 tween 20 ctab dtab sdbs sds it indicated that surface tension significantly affected the effluent recovery of zif 8 nps during transport a few studies have reported that the addition of low surface tension liquid systematically changed the electric double layer interaction energies between the colloid and sand such surfactant induced reduction in surface tension could decrease the capillary pressure in saturated porous media chevalier 2003 henry and smith 2002 in the nonionic surfactant solution the liquid surface tension dropped by 27 9 mn m in tween 20 whereas it dropped by 37 4 mn m in ctab and 30 9 mn m in sds fig 5 a respectively it suggested a low density deposition of nps on the sand in the ionic surfactant fig 5 b and a high density deposition of nps in the nonionic surfactant fig 5 c besides when mixed with hydrophobic zif 8 nps the elastic forces generated by ionic surfactants are much greater than those of nonionic surfactants because of the charge effect of surfactant molecules yazhgur et al 2013 it helped to improve the interface strength between surfactant molecules and caused their orderly displacement hunter et al 2009 consequently the ionic surfactants exhibited a greater influence on the transportability of zif 8 nps in the sand than the nonionic surfactants 3 5 effect of nps concentration on the transport of zif 8 nps a constant surfactant concentration of 1 0 cmc was chosen to investigate the effect of nps concentration on the transport of zif 8 nps in porous media the breakthrough curves of zif 8 nps in a saturated quartz sand column are displayed in fig 7 the maximum c c0 of zif 8 nps always found at 50 mg l zif 8 nps was 0 51 11 pv in ctab 0 38 11 pv in dtab 0 41 11 pv in sdbs 0 67 11 pv in sds 0 13 11 pv in tween 80 and 0 14 11 pv in tween 20 respectively the transportability and effluent recovery of zif 8 nps in the 1 0 cmc surfactant gradually decreased with increasing nps concentration irrespective of surfactant type especially when the nps concentration reached 200 mg l fig 7 correspondingly the kd values increased with the increasing nps concentrations table 2 in the presence of ionic surfactants the effluent recovery of zif 8 nps 50 mg l rose from 9 0 in water to 63 7 in ctab and 87 4 in sds fig 8 a d respectively while in the presence of nonionic surfactants the transportability of zif 8 nps only increased from 9 0 to 15 0 in tween 80 and to 17 4 in tween 20 fig 8 e f respectively suggesting that the influence of nonionic surfactants on zif 8 nps migration was less apparent than that of ionic surfactants colloid retention can happen due to complex mechanisms including surface deposition bradford and torkzaban 2015 hydrodynamic bridging ramachandran and fogler 1999 and straining bradford et al 2005 yang and balhoff 2017 blocking and hydrodynamic bridging are both functions of initial colloid concentration lin et al 2021 lin et al 2021 indicated that hydrodynamic bridging tended to happen at high concentration levels and the retention caused by hydrodynamic bridging usually happened in places very close to the inlet these observations suggested that the high zif 8 nps retention at high concentrations may result from blocking and hydrodynamic bridging straining occurs when the size of the colloid is over that of the pore throat and it is not influenced by colloid concentration bradford and torkzaban 2015 at the zif 8 nps concentration of 200 mg l the nps would be susceptible to agglomeration making the zif 8 aggregates retained in the column by straining bradford et al 2005 interestingly in the presence of nonionic surfactant the migration of zif 8 nps even at the low concentration 50 mg l was still very weak herein the interplay between positively charged nps and negatively charged sand should not be neglected in this case the electrostatic attraction between nps and sand occurred producing more surface deposition decreasing the effective radius of the pore throat and enhancing hydrodynamic bridging and straining samari kermani et al 2020 in contrast in the presence of ionic surfactants the liquid surface tension decreased obviously implying that the nps deposited on the sand surface could be effectively detached by the hydrodynamic forces ramachandran and fogler 1999 in addition the electrostatic interaction between the sand and nps was repulsive due to the same electrical properties making the np s bridging at pore throats difficult and again proving that surface deposition of zif 8 may be less likely to happen in the ionic surfactant solution additionally very few studies chen et al 2010 ma et al 2011 wan et al 1995 have revealed that flow direction influences colloid transport in porous media chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2014 2016 concluded that the rate of particle deposition was shown to be greater for up flow than for down flow direction suggesting that gravity was a significant driving force for colloid deposition it should consider the role of gravitational force on nps transport in our up flow experiment columns despite the highly unfavorable electrostatic conditions of the experiments the ionic surfactants solution significant amounts of nps were retained in the packed columns suggesting that physical retention was an important filtration mechanism of zif 8 nps migration in this condition the gravity force could facilitate the attachment of larger aggregate of nps in the sand collector surface in addition the gravity force would aggravate the straining even further 4 conclusions in this study three types of surfactants cationic anionic and nonionic were used to disperse zif 8 nps in a saturated sand column and retention and transport behavior of the dispersed zif 8 nps were investigated the experimental results showed that a applying ionic surfactants can significantly enhance the suspension and mobility of zif 8 nps the electrostatic repulsion between zif 8 nps and sands and the decreased liquid surface tension contributed to the increased zif 8 transportability b the mobility of zif 8 nps under anionic surfactant sdbs sds was much greater than that under cationic surfactant ctab dtab c in the presence of surfactants low concentration of zif 8 nps tended to have higher migration rates d nonionic surfactants tween 80 tween 20 did not have a significant influence on the transportability of zif 8 irrespective of initial injection concentration of surfactant e surfactant cmc also played a key role in the transport process the solution may hinder the migration by free micelles when the surfactant concentration exceeded cmc the concentration dependent transport behavior of zif 8 nps is important in environmental systems because surfactant concentrations are likely diluted along the flow path from the release source considering the high retention of zif 8 in the sand column at the low surfactant concentrations future work using surfactants for mof stabilization may need to pay attention to its deposition in environmental accepting media such as soils groundwater or sediments to the best of our knowledge it is the first work to link surfactant effects with zif 8 migration ability in saturated porous media the complex interactions occurred during the zif 8 migration including electrostatic interaction gravity force attachment and aggregation are crucial for understanding zif 8 s behavior in environmental systems based on this study researchers could explore mathematical models for the transport of aggregated mof

15985,knowledge of the fate and transport of metal organic frameworks mofs in porous media is essential to understanding their environmental impacts however to date the transport mechanisms of mofs are not fully revealed meanwhile surfactants can promote mofs dispersion by forming a stable suspension they also allow mofs to migrate in the aqueous environment which would increase the risks of mofs being exposed to human health and the ecological environment in this study the effect of surfactants type and nanoparticle np concentrations 50 100 and 200 mg l were investigated using a sand column to study the transportability of zif 8 nps in saturated porous media surfactants used were categorized into three groups including cationic surfactants ctab dtab anionic surfactants sdbs sds and nonionic surfactants tween 80 tween 20 experimental results showed that the ionic surfactants significantly increased the transportability of zif 8 nps furthermore a low concentration of nps tended to break through the column under ionic surfactant conditions and the maximum effluent recovery of zif 8 nps 50 mg l was 87 4 in the presence of sds nevertheless zif 8 nps tended to deposit in the inlet of the sand column in the presence of nonionic surfactants due to hydrodynamic bridging and straining this research provides a comprehensive understanding of the deposition mechanism of zif 8 nps as affected by surfactant types and np concentrations most importantly the study highlights those ionic surfactants had a significant impact on the mobility of zif 8 nps which arouses attention to the ecological and human health risk assessment related to the manufacturing of mofs with the aid of various dispersing agents graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords zif 8 nps

the subfamily of typical mofs zeolitic imidazolate frameworks zif nanoparticles nps have been widely used in the fields of medicine he et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 electrochemistry cao et al 2021 han et al 2019 and environmental remediation fu et al 2019 li et al 2016 sann et al 2018 wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b in recent years due to outstanding performance in various studies e g facile synthesis controllable pore size high specific surface area high porosity low density and good chemical tunability zhang et al 2021b zhang et al 2019 the applications of zif 8 and zif 8 composites have been surging which make us consider the possible environmental risks associated with its synthesis migration and transformation for example ruyra et al 2015 revealed that zif 8 could induce responses of reactive oxygen species ros and the immune system in zebrafish wagner et al 2019 stated that zif 8 could interact with the lipid layers of the human lung epithelial cell s membrane thus resulting in increased uptake of zif 8 nps and changes to membrane integrity and cell signaling when zif 8 is used as a subsurface material its migration with water will likely cause some concerns to groundwater quality due to the introduction of organic and inorganic moieties many zif 8 applications such as solar cell zhang et al 2019 polymer composite thompson et al 2012 and conductive thin film cui et al 2017 require the preparation of soluble zif 8 nps i e well dispersed zif 8 nps suspension however the task is challenging as pristine zif 8 nps are hydrophobic and tend to form agglomerates due to the strong van der waals force kebria et al 2019 surfactants are amphiphilic compounds that contain both hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties the hydrophobic chains of surfactant molecules can easily combine with the hydrophobic zif 8 nps then the hydrophilic moieties of the surfactant are exposed to the outside making the zif 8 nps more hydrophilic some reports have stated that surfactants have important influences on the stability of nps suspension through steric hindrance and surface covering hu et al 2020 for example jia et al 2017 pointed out that poly vinyl alcohol can stabilize the zif 8 particles in water via hydrogen bonds surfactants were also reported to reduce the surface energy of water insoluble substances and nps jia et al 2003 thus enhancing their transport in porous media such as silver leo et al 2013 titanium dioxide ghadimi and metselaar 2013 silica zargartalebi et al 2014 hydrophobic microplastics jiang et al 2021 graphene gr liu et al 2015 single walled carbon swnts tian et al 2011 nano tio2 and nano ceo2 dai et al 2022 although surface modification by surfactants promotes the application of zif it may also affect the fate and transport behaviors of zif 8 once it is released into the environment therefore the presence of surfactants in the environment is likely to aggravate the environmental hazards of zif 8 nps or facilitate the co transport of toxic chemicals li et al 2022 however there has been no study on the transport of zif 8 nps in porous media as affected by surfactants to date the transport and retention of nps in porous media are affected by many factors including the size shape of the particles the flow velocity and the chemical features of porewater they are gradually taken into consideration during the development of modeling technique the colloidal filtration theory cft holds that the removal nps is described by first order kinetics with a spatially and temporally constant rate of nps deposition and the concentrations of retained nps decrease log linearly with distance tufenkji and elimelech 2004 however the available mathematical models based on cft frequently do not investigate the physicochemical processes that nps undergo during transport in porous media goldberg et al 2014 babakhani 2019 provided an improved mathematical model that considers transport and aggregation of nps and evaluates their size exclusion later on katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2021 developed a model that accounts for changes e g size of aggregated particles and potential repulsive interactions between particles in nps attachment onto solid matrix in particular aggregation was shown to either decrease or increase nps attachment onto the solid matrix depending on particle size and to yield early or late breakthrough the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory is widely adopted to explain the mechanism of colloid adhesion according to the dlvo theory the stability of nps can be evaluated as the sum of van der waals vdw and electrical double layer edl interactions the resultant interaction energy vt which is the sum of vdw and edl interactions determines the nps stability as the two surfaces approach one another ryan and elimelech 1996 beyond the traditional colloidal interactions considered in the dlvo theory a number of non dlvo forces can also influence the stability of nps in aqueous environments de vicente et al 2000 the most significant forces encountered by nps in aqueous media include steric interactions magnetic forces for iron based nps and hydration forces petosa et al 2010 in this work we examined the mobility and stability of zif 8 nps through a series of column experiments in porous media in the presence of cationic surfactants cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab and dodecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide dtab anionic surfactants sodium dodecyl benzenesulfonate sdbs and sodium dodecyl sulfonate sds and nonionic surfactants tween 80 and tween 20 our initial hypothesis was that these disparate surfactants would affect the mobility of zif 8 nps in porous media in different manners and to different degrees because of their distinct electrostatic properties 2 materials

tween 80 hushi shanghai china ar milli q water 18 25 mω cm 1 water was used throughout the experiments to prepare solutions the porous media used for transport experiments was quartz sand standard sand hushi shanghai china ar with sizes ranging from 0 50 0 60 mm the quartz sand was soaked alternately in a 0 1 mol l naoh solution and a 0 1 mol l hcl solution for 24 h to remove excess metal ions and colloidal substances then it was repeatedly rinsed with milli q water until the supernatant was clear and the ph was neutral finally the clean quartz sand was dried at 75 c in an oven for 48 h 2 2 synthesis of zif 8 as previously reported zhu et al 2017 1 125 g zn no3 2 6h2o and 3 11 g 2 meim 2 methylimidazole were respectively dissolved in 75 ml methanol completely then the latter solution was carefully dipped into the former to form a milky solution followed by ultrasonic vibration 40 khz 5 min then the milky mixture was kept still at room temperature 25 c for 24 h the product was collected by centrifugation 8000 rpm 10 min then washed with methanol several times and finally dried in a vacuum oven at 60 c for 48 h to obtain the zif 8 2 3 solution preparation herein the critical micelle concentration cmc of surfactants used in the study were 0 8 mm for ctab bahri et al 2006 14 mm for dtab bahri et al 2006 2 9 mm for sdbs liu et al 2019 9 mm for sds bahri et al 2006 0 44 mm for tween 80 and 0 94 mm for tween 20 waters et al 2020 the zif 8 nps suspension was prepared by adding 100 mg of zif 8 powder to 1 l of milli q water at ph 7 the desired surfactant concentrations were 0 2 cmc 0 5 cmc 1 0 cmc and 1 2 cmc table 1 the mixture was then sonicated for 0 5 h to obtain the zif 8 working suspension for the transport experiment the control group of zif 8 np suspension with no added surfactant was prepared similarly after standing for 24 h each supernatant was filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane filter the total zn content in the supernatant was used to quantify the concentration of zif 8 suspension briefly zif 8 was digested with concentrated hno3 at 100 c for 24 h and then the supernatant was filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane the zn concentration was measured on an atomic absorption spectrometer aas pinaacle 900f perkinelmer and the concentration of zn2 was converted to the concentration of zif 8 nps according to its stoichiometry zn zif 8 0 2856 mass ratio 2 4 column experiments columns 10 0 cm length 1 6 cm inner diameter were wet packed with the quartz sand at a porosity of 0 42 in brief the quartz sand was carefully added to the column using a spatula and then gently vibrated to ensure uniform packing two stainless steel screens with a pore size of 50 μm were used to seal both ends of the columns a steady upward flow at a rate of 1 ml min darcy velocity of 0 20 cm min was maintained by a peristaltic pump shenchen lab2015 baoding shenchen pump co ltd china connected to the inlet to reduce air entrapment before column experiments the packed columns were first flushed with milli q water for 1 h to remove the suspended solids and other impurities followed by flushing background surfactant solutions table 1 for 2 h to equilibrate the hydrodynamic and chemical conditions after that 12 pore volumes pvs of zif 8 suspension with desired surfactant conditions table 1 were injected into the columns followed by flushing with several pvs of background solution the zif 8 input suspension was continuously stirred on a magnetic stirrer to maintain homogeneity throughout the experimental period effluent samples of the column were collected using a fraction collector bs 30a huxi analysis instrument factory co ltd shanghai china potassium iodide 15 mg l was used as the conservative tracer to determine flow patterns in the columns which followed the typical transport pattern fig s1 the concentration of iodide ion i was determined by uv 3600 spectrophotometer uv 3600 daojin japan at the absorbance of 226 nm the breakthrough curves btcs of zif 8 were obtained by plotting the normalized effluent concentration i e the ratio of effluent concentration to influent concentration c c0 vs pv the stock suspension was freshly prepared each time before the column experiment 2 5 characterization zif 8 agglomeration and dispersibility were characterized through a series of analytical techniques the particle morphology of the zif 8 was investigated by scanning electron microscope sem su8220 hitachi x ray diffraction xrd bruker d8 advance ger analysis was carried out on a rigaku d max 2500 diffractometer with cu kα radiation at a scan rate of 2 min range of 5 45 the zeta potential of zif 8 suspension was measured using malvern zeta sizer nano zs90 at room temperature the wettability of zif 8 nps was measured by contact angle meter jy 82b kruss dsa and the liquid surface tension was analyzed by surface tension detector dataphysics dcat 21 2 6 data analysis the experimental single collector removal efficiency η was determined from each particle breakthrough curve as follows tufenkji and elimelech 2005 1 η 2 3 d c 1 ε l ln c e c 0 for the transport experiments the deposition rate of colloid on sand kd was

8 3 results and discussion 3 1 static water stability test results 3 1 1 particle morphology and wettability the morphology of zif 8 nps in different surfactant suspensions is shown in fig 1 it can be determined that the zif 8 nps kept their original rhombic dodecahedral shape in the presence of surfactant solution fig 1 a f in the presence of surfactants the contact angles of zif 8 were all reduced from 114 3 to less than 96 fig 1 g m and the ionic surfactants reduced the values to a greater extent than the nonionic ones suggesting that the wettability hydrophilicity of zif 8 nps was improved significantly the xrd patterns of the surfactant immersed zif 8 samples still showed the characteristic peaks of zif 8 fig 1 n suggesting the unchanged crystal structure 3 1 2 apparent zeta potentials the typical zeta potentials for sand grain sio2 particles are negative under environmental ph values ph 5 9 because of low phzpc 2 9 litton and olson 1996 in the surfactant solutions the zeta potential of sand grains ranged from 41 3 to 46 1 mv in ctab 50 0 to 51 7 mv in dtab 47 4 to 55 3 mv in sdbs 38 2 to 47 0 mv in sds 22 1 to 30 5 mv in tween 80 and 22 1 to 30 5 mv in tween 20 fig 2 a the ctab dtab adsorbed layer around quartz sand resulted in the zeta potential of quartz sand turning from negative to positive zhang and somasundaran 2006 meanwhile the zeta potentials of zif 8 nps in the surfactant suspensions ranged from 23 6 to 28 3 mv in ctab 31 8 to 39 3 mv in dtab 30 8 to 45 4 mv in sdbs 26 9 to 36 5 mv in sds 19 1 to 20 0 mv in tween 80 and 25 6 to 26 4 mv in tween 20 fig 2 b noteworthily the apparent zeta potentials were the final output of materials electricity in the solution the inner mechanisms may be complicated and vary with the types of surfactants the interactions of zif 8 with quartz sands and the three kinds of surfactants varied a lot which may finally regulate and determine the transport behavior of zif 8 in the sand column in the cationic surfactant suspension hydrophilic groups of ctab or dtab may bind to the negatively charged quartz sand surface exposing the hydrophobic group to the solution and binding the surfactant s free hydrophobic groups in the solution by hydrophobic interactions sun et al 2015 thus the quartz sand surface was covered with two layers of cationic surfactant one layer developed by electrostatic attraction and the other by hydrophobic effects fig 3 a conversely the nonionic surfactants adsorbed to the sand surfaces with only one layer by hydrophobic interactions and the anionic surfactants did not adsorb to the surfaces of sand due to electrostatic repulsion fig 3 b c meanwhile there was one layer of anionic surfactants adsorbed on the positively charged zif 8 nps surface by electrostatic attraction and hydrophobic interaction pan et al 2011 for the cationic and nonionic surfactants only one layer of surfactants could be loosely bound to the surface of zif 8 nps by hydrophobic interaction 3 1 3 released zn2 from zif 8 nps the dissolution of zn2 from zif 8 nps in milli q water was only 3 33 fig s2a in the presence of surfactants except for the sds at 1 2 cmc the dissolution of zn2 from zif 8 nps was less than 3 33 the reduced zn2 releasing rates may be due to the complexation of zn by these surfactants with anionic surfactants sdbs and sds showing higher complexation rates than the cationic ctab and dtab and nonionic surfactants tween 80 and tween 20 fig s2b in this way surfactants promoted mofs dispersion to form a stable suspension and weakened the agglomeration of nps kebria et al 2019 3 2 effect of cationic surfactants concentration on the transport of zif 8 nps in porous media the transportability of zif 8 nps at high surfactant concentrations was higher than that at low concentrations the effluent recovery of zif 8 nps at ctab concentrations of 0 2 0 5 1 0 and 1 2 cmc was 14 78 14 34 21 17 and 17 77 respectively the effluent recovery of zif 8 nps in dtab concentrations of 0 2 0 5 1 0 and 1 2 cmc was 8 03 21 10 33 81 and 32 27 respectively table 1 the result showed that the transportability of zif 8 nps increased with the increasing ctab dtab concentration as discussed above the deposition process on sand grains depended on the combined effects of electrostatic force and hydrophobic interaction the cationic surfactant ctab dtab was readily adsorbed onto the negatively charged sand through electrostatic attraction between the cationic quaternary ammonium groups and negatively charged sand zhang and somasundaran 2006 such attractive interactions facilitated the formation of large sand aggregates and narrowed the pore throat between the sand grains fig 3 a when nps are larger than the inlet of a pore throat straining occurs and will easily lead to retaining of zif 8 nps in the pore throat bradford et al 2005 zhang et al 2021a besides surfactants are amphiphilic molecules and zif 8 nps are hydrophobic substances thus the hydrophobic tail chains of surfactants were attached to zif 8 s hydrophobic surface due to van der waals force and hydrophobic interaction dederichs et al 2009 while the hydrophilic moiety of surfactants were exposed to the solution phase therefore the zif 8 nps well enveloped by surfactant molecules could exhibit improved hydrophilicity promoting the suspension and enhancing zif 8 nps transport in porous media dollinger et al 2018 the breakthrough curves of zif 8 nps at different ctab dtab concentrations were displayed in fig 4 a b the maximum relative concentration of zif 8 nps recorded in the effluent was 0 18 at 11 pv in 1 0 cmc ctab and 0 35 at 11 pv in 1 0 cmc dtab indicating higher transportability of zif 8 in dtab solutions than ctab it is also well known that surfactant molecules tend to form a monolayer in the gas liquid interface to reduce the surface tension waters et al 2020 with the increasing concentration of surfactant the surfactant molecules tend to form a single molecule layer at the interface until saturated and then form micelle in the solution waters et al 2020 when zif 8 nps were added to the surfactant solution the free surfactant molecules tended to gather on the surface of particles to form the surfactant coated zif 8 nps which enhanced the dispersibility and stability of nps the length of a hydrophobic chain of ctab is longer than that of dtab and the cmc of ctab 0 8 mm is lower than dtab 14 mm it led to a less tightened coating of surfactant on the surface of zif 8 nps and easier formation of micelles in ctab than in dtab thus the interaction between zif 8 nps and sand made it easier for ctab molecules to escape from the surface of zif 8 nps lu et al 2014 resulting in a less stable surfactant coated zif 8 and a lower breakthrough concentration of zif 8 nps in ctab noteworthily the transportability of zif 8 nps was not significantly improved when the concentration of surfactant exceeded cmc further increasing the surfactant concentration did not promote the transport of zif 8 nps but slightly inhibited it this can be explained by the change of zeta potential the zeta potential of zif 8 nps at ctab concentrations of 0 2 0 5 1 0 and 1 2 cmc were 23 6 26 1 28 3 and 25 2 mv respectively that at dtab concentrations of 0 2 0 5 1 0 and 1 2 cmc were 31 8 35 7 39 3 and 36 7 mv respectively table 1 at the same time the surface potential of sand in the ctab or dtab solutions was also changed to be positive the combined surface repulsion between sand and zif 8 presented as potentials was 64 8 ev 0 2 cmc 71 4 ev 0 5 cmc 74 4 ev 1 0 cmc and 71 4 ev 1 2 cmc for ctab and 82 1 ev 0 2 cmc 85 7 ev 0 5 cmc 91 0 ev 1 0 cmc and 88 4 ev 1 2 cmc for dtab respectively the absolute zeta potential value was not increased abruptly at the surfactant concentration of 1 2 cmc suggesting weaker electrostatic repulsion between the zif 8 nps and quartz sands meanwhile free ctab dtab molecules will spontaneously form micelles in the solution when ctab dtab is greater than cmc jiao et al 2018 and the micelles existing in the solution can narrow the pore throat and hinder the migration of nps yang and balhoff 2017 3 3 effect of anionic surfactants concentration on the transport of zif 8 nps in porous media the effluent recovery of zif 8 nps at sdbs concentrations of 0 2 0 5 1 0 and 1 2 cmc were 1 75 6 90 37 46 and 19 28 respectively the effluent recovery of zif 8 nps in sds were 13 96 22 96 65 16 and 55 22 respectively table 1 anionic surfactants tend to adsorb on the positively charged zif 8 nps hence the zeta potential of zif 8 nps at sdbs concentrations of 0 2 0 5 1 0 and 1 2 cmc were 30 8 42 1 45 4 and 45 4 mv and accordingly at sds solutions were 26 9 31 2 36 5 and 32 9 mv respectively fig 2 in the presence of anionic surfactant the zeta potential of colloids often increases while the van der waals attraction between colloid and sand surface decreases resulting in increased repulsion and colloid release batra et al 2001 on the one hand steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion may be enhanced between the sdbs sds modified zif 8 nps and the sand surface alsubaie et al 2021 on the other hand anionic surfactants tend to increase the electrostatic repulsion of negatively charged quartz sand and increase the pore throat between sand grains han et al 2008 fig 3 b thereby the nps outflow rate increased to 65 16 in the presence of 1 0 cmc of sds as compared to 8 70 in water it was found that the transport behavior of zif 8 nps was similar to that under the ctab dtab conditions the breakthrough curves of zif 8 nps under different sdbs sds concentrations are shown in fig 4 c d the maximum relative concentration of zif 8 nps recorded in the effluent was 0 37 at 10 pv in sdbs and 0 50 at 11 pv in sds the spatial structure of sdbs is much more complex than that of sds due to the existence of a benzene ring and the cmc of sdbs 2 9 mm is lower than that of sds 9 mm thereby the steric hindrance and micellar effect caused the higher breakthrough concentration of nps in sds than in sdbs in addition increasing the concentration of sdbs sds in the solution could improve the transportability of zif 8 nps however noticeable inhibition effects occurred when the concentration was greater than 1 0 cmc the reason was again the reduced repulsion between colloids and sand surface yet a difference involved might be the ionic strength of surfactant solution in the sdbs sds solutions the free na carried by surfactant could also increase solution ionic strength which compressed the electric double layer and reduced the electrostatic repulsions between nps and quartz sand surfaces thus promoting the deposition of zif 8 nps hahn and o melia 2004 as fig 5 a d showed the kd values of zif 8 nps in the cationic surfactant immersed sand columns ranged from 0 14 to 0 17 min 1 for ctab and 0 08 to 0 22 min 1 for dtab respectively in comparison the kd values of zif 8 nps in the anionic surfactant systems ranged from 0 08 to 0 39 min 1 for sdbs and 0 05 to 0 19 min 1 for sds respectively these kd values were similar to the retention of surfactant modified carbon nanotubes and graphene oxides in saturated sand media bouchard et al 2012 liu et al 2015 the transportability of zif 8 nps in the sand columns present a trend with anionic surfactant cationic surfactant i e sds sdbs dtab ctab it suggests that the characteristics of surfactants regulated the interactions between zif 8 nps and sand grains and played an important role in the transport of zif 8 nps 3 4 effect of nonionic surfactants concentration on the transport of zif 8 nps in porous media the breakthrough curves of zif 8 nps under different tween 80 tween 20 concentrations were shown in fig 4 e f the maximum relative concentration of zif 8 nps was 0 06 at 13 pv and 0 11 at 14 pv in tween 80 and tween 20 respectively when flushed with background surfactant solutions the breakthrough curves of zif 8 nps went down first and then rose which means that the zif 8 nps originally deposited on sand surface may be released later the effluent recovery of zif 8 nps at tween 80 concentrations of 0 2 0 5 1 0 and 1 2 cmc were 4 34 5 04 5 05 and 5 08 and that at corresponding tween 20 concentrations were 6 60 4 48 9 40 and 7 15 respectively table 1 the kd values of zif 8 nps at the nonionic surfactant conditions were generally higher than 0 2 min 1 fig 5 e f on the one hand the zeta potential of zif 8 nps and quartz sand results table 1 demonstrated that nonionic surfactants did not influence the surface charge characteristic of nps and sand and the electrostatic forces between the positively charged nps and negatively charged sand caused an agglomeration and great retention of zif 8 nps in the sand columns han et al 2008 on the other hand the anchoring of nonionic surfactant heads to the zif 8 and sand surface was due to weak interactions such as hydrogen bonding in this situation micelle adsorption on the zif 8 nps surface may be disfavored versus micelles in solution leaving more free micelles in the solution and further hindering the transport of nps azar et al 2019 li and ishiguro 2016 ríos et al 2018 therefore zif 8 nps tended to deposit on the sand surface under the action of nonionic surfactants in addition the surface tension of zif 8 nps in various solutions followed in the order of water tween 80 tween 20 ctab dtab sdbs sds fig 6 a and the kd values were also in the sequence of water tween 80 tween 20 ctab dtab sdbs sds it indicated that surface tension significantly affected the effluent recovery of zif 8 nps during transport a few studies have reported that the addition of low surface tension liquid systematically changed the electric double layer interaction energies between the colloid and sand such surfactant induced reduction in surface tension could decrease the capillary pressure in saturated porous media chevalier 2003 henry and smith 2002 in the nonionic surfactant solution the liquid surface tension dropped by 27 9 mn m in tween 20 whereas it dropped by 37 4 mn m in ctab and 30 9 mn m in sds fig 5 a respectively it suggested a low density deposition of nps on the sand in the ionic surfactant fig 5 b and a high density deposition of nps in the nonionic surfactant fig 5 c besides when mixed with hydrophobic zif 8 nps the elastic forces generated by ionic surfactants are much greater than those of nonionic surfactants because of the charge effect of surfactant molecules yazhgur et al 2013 it helped to improve the interface strength between surfactant molecules and caused their orderly displacement hunter et al 2009 consequently the ionic surfactants exhibited a greater influence on the transportability of zif 8 nps in the sand than the nonionic surfactants 3 5 effect of nps concentration on the transport of zif 8 nps a constant surfactant concentration of 1 0 cmc was chosen to investigate the effect of nps concentration on the transport of zif 8 nps in porous media the breakthrough curves of zif 8 nps in a saturated quartz sand column are displayed in fig 7 the maximum c c0 of zif 8 nps always found at 50 mg l zif 8 nps was 0 51 11 pv in ctab 0 38 11 pv in dtab 0 41 11 pv in sdbs 0 67 11 pv in sds 0 13 11 pv in tween 80 and 0 14 11 pv in tween 20 respectively the transportability and effluent recovery of zif 8 nps in the 1 0 cmc surfactant gradually decreased with increasing nps concentration irrespective of surfactant type especially when the nps concentration reached 200 mg l fig 7 correspondingly the kd values increased with the increasing nps concentrations table 2 in the presence of ionic surfactants the effluent recovery of zif 8 nps 50 mg l rose from 9 0 in water to 63 7 in ctab and 87 4 in sds fig 8 a d respectively while in the presence of nonionic surfactants the transportability of zif 8 nps only increased from 9 0 to 15 0 in tween 80 and to 17 4 in tween 20 fig 8 e f respectively suggesting that the influence of nonionic surfactants on zif 8 nps migration was less apparent than that of ionic surfactants colloid retention can happen due to complex mechanisms including surface deposition bradford and torkzaban 2015 hydrodynamic bridging ramachandran and fogler 1999 and straining bradford et al 2005 yang and balhoff 2017 blocking and hydrodynamic bridging are both functions of initial colloid concentration lin et al 2021 lin et al 2021 indicated that hydrodynamic bridging tended to happen at high concentration levels and the retention caused by hydrodynamic bridging usually happened in places very close to the inlet these observations suggested that the high zif 8 nps retention at high concentrations may result from blocking and hydrodynamic bridging straining occurs when the size of the colloid is over that of the pore throat and it is not influenced by colloid concentration bradford and torkzaban 2015 at the zif 8 nps concentration of 200 mg l the nps would be susceptible to agglomeration making the zif 8 aggregates retained in the column by straining bradford et al 2005 interestingly in the presence of nonionic surfactant the migration of zif 8 nps even at the low concentration 50 mg l was still very weak herein the interplay between positively charged nps and negatively charged sand should not be neglected in this case the electrostatic attraction between nps and sand occurred producing more surface deposition decreasing the effective radius of the pore throat and enhancing hydrodynamic bridging and straining samari kermani et al 2020 in contrast in the presence of ionic surfactants the liquid surface tension decreased obviously implying that the nps deposited on the sand surface could be effectively detached by the hydrodynamic forces ramachandran and fogler 1999 in addition the electrostatic interaction between the sand and nps was repulsive due to the same electrical properties making the np s bridging at pore throats difficult and again proving that surface deposition of zif 8 may be less likely to happen in the ionic surfactant solution additionally very few studies chen et al 2010 ma et al 2011 wan et al 1995 have revealed that flow direction influences colloid transport in porous media chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2014 2016 concluded that the rate of particle deposition was shown to be greater for up flow than for down flow direction suggesting that gravity was a significant driving force for colloid deposition it should consider the role of gravitational force on nps transport in our up flow experiment columns despite the highly unfavorable electrostatic conditions of the experiments the ionic surfactants solution significant amounts of nps were retained in the packed columns suggesting that physical retention was an important filtration mechanism of zif 8 nps migration in this condition the gravity force could facilitate the attachment of larger aggregate of nps in the sand collector surface in addition the gravity force would aggravate the straining even further 4 conclusions in this study three types of surfactants cationic anionic and nonionic were used to disperse zif 8 nps in a saturated sand column and retention and transport behavior of the dispersed zif 8 nps were investigated the experimental results showed that a applying ionic surfactants can significantly enhance the suspension and mobility of zif 8 nps the electrostatic repulsion between zif 8 nps and sands and the decreased liquid surface tension contributed to the increased zif 8 transportability b the mobility of zif 8 nps under anionic surfactant sdbs sds was much greater than that under cationic surfactant ctab dtab c in the presence of surfactants low concentration of zif 8 nps tended to have higher migration rates d nonionic surfactants tween 80 tween 20 did not have a significant influence on the transportability of zif 8 irrespective of initial injection concentration of surfactant e surfactant cmc also played a key role in the transport process the solution may hinder the migration by free micelles when the surfactant concentration exceeded cmc the concentration dependent transport behavior of zif 8 nps is important in environmental systems because surfactant concentrations are likely diluted along the flow path from the release source considering the high retention of zif 8 in the sand column at the low surfactant concentrations future work using surfactants for mof stabilization may need to pay attention to its deposition in environmental accepting media such as soils groundwater or sediments to the best of our knowledge it is the first work to link surfactant effects with zif 8 migration ability in saturated porous media the complex interactions occurred during the zif 8 migration including electrostatic interaction gravity force attachment and aggregation are crucial for understanding zif 8 s behavior in environmental systems based on this study researchers could explore mathematical models for the transport of aggregated mof nps in saturated and homogeneous porous media in future work based on this study researchers could explore mathematical models for the transport of aggregated mof nps in saturated and homogeneous

15986,available oxidation processes for removing cr iii complexes from water wastewater usually encounter the formation of highly toxic cr vi and the generation of cr enriched waste sludge posing challenges on the subsequent disposal herein we achieve efficient removal of cr iii organic complexes and simultaneous recovery of cr from wastewater with enhanced curtailment of intermediate cr vi by using an electrochemically driven peroxone i e electro peroxone process with activated carbon fiber acf electrodes for cr iii edta electro peroxone could remove 90 total cr from 11 50 mg l to 1 20 mg l and 80 total organic carbon with a strong curtailment of cr vi to less than 0 2 mg l additionally the process could obtain a complete recovery of the removable cr of which 78 3 are enriched at acf cathode as amorphous cr oh 3 deposits and the remaining 21 7 are adsorbed at the anode thus avoiding the generation of cr laden sludge mechanism studies show the electro generated h2o2 reacts with o3 to generate abundant ho for decomplexation which sequentially oxidizes cr iii to cr vi and degrades the released edta via stepwise decarboxylated process as confirmed by hplc analysis multiple pathways including electro reduction h2o2 reduction and electro adsorption synergistically curtail and immobilize the formed intermediate cr vi acf characterizations and continuous 5 cycle experiments substantiate the excellent reusability of the acf electrodes moreover this process exhibits satisfactory effectiveness to cr iii complexed with other ligands e g citrate and oxalate and complexed cr iii in the real electroplating wastewater we believe this study would provide an efficient and eco friendly alternative for cr iii complexes removal from wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cr iii organic complexes electro peroxone decomplexation intermediate cr vi cr recovery 1 introduction trivalent chromium cr iii compounds are massively employed in various industrial processes including tanning electroplating metal finishing and textile jiang et al 2020 ye et al 2018 organic ligands such as citrate ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta dyes or other chemical additives are extensively used for complexing cr iii to prevent precipitate formation huang et al 2019a wang et al 2016 which generates abundant recalcitrant wastewaters containing cr iii organic complexes in china the annual discharge of cr iii bearing tanning wastewaters exceeds 70 million tons among which the concentration of complexed cr iii reaches up several dozens mg l wang et al 2016 although cr iii is less toxic than cr vi increasing concerns are raised on the possible formation of mutagenic and carcinogenic cr vi by oxidation processes or natural bio transformations in the water environment chebeir and liu 2016 yang et al 2014 to reduce the potential risks of cr to the receiving waters and human health many countries or organizations issued stringent guidelines on the maximum contaminant level mcl of total cr and cr vi for example mcl of total cr and cr vi in the industrial effluents is regulated to be 1 5 mg l and 0 5 mg l in china respectively most available processes such as chemical precipitation coagulation and adsorption are efficient in the abatement of free cr iii cations ye et al 2017 and 2018 however those above mentioned methods are incapable of removing cr iii organic complexes to the safe level 1 5 mg l in most cases around tens of mg l complexed cr iii still remains in the tanning effluents after chemical precipitation much higher than the maximum allowable discharge standard of cr ye et al 2018 wang et al 2016 advanced oxidation processes aops such as fenton ozonation electrochemical oxidation and photochemical oxidation zhao et al 2018 ma et al 2020 chen et al 2021 huang et al 2016b and 2019b xu et al 2021 are promising technologies for the treatment of wastewater containing complexed heavy metals those above methods could efficiently degrade various metal organic complexes e g pb ii cu ii and ni ii complexes huang et al 2016b wang et al 2020 xu et al 2021 however their employment for eliminating cr iii organic complexes was challenged by the formation and accumulation of much more toxic cr vi species the following post treatment processes e g addition of fe2 and electrocoagulation were adopted to remove intermediate cr vi accompanied by the generation of cr enriched waste sludge that is costly to dispose durante et al 2009 and 2011 huang et al 2019a recently studies on photo fenton and electro fenton processes demonstrate their capability on reducing intermediate cr vi by highly reductive fe ii species yet still facing the problems caused by excess production of the hazardous metal sludge ye et al 2017 jiang et al 2020 to solve the above mentioned problems one of the best approaches is to achieve efficient degradation of cr iii organic complexes with simultaneous curtailment of intermediate cr vi and recovery of cr but still remain a challenge electro peroxone e peroxone i e an electrochemical driven process that combines ozonation with in situ electro generated h2o2 from cathodic oxygen reduction has been developed to promote o3 transformation to ho using the carbon based cathodes including reticulated vitreous carbon carbon felt and carbon polytetrafluoroethylene yuan et al 2013 hou et al 2016 xia et al 2017 wang et al 2018 the markedly enhanced yield of ho in the e peroxone could efficiently degrade ozone recalcitrant contaminants such as 1 4 dioxane oxalic acid pharmaceuticals and taste and odor compounds wang et al 2015a and wang et al 2015b yao et al 2017 li et al 2019 zhan et al 2019 therefore we expect the e peroxone process might potentially be employed to destroy and remove cr iii complexes e g cr iii edta which are typically ozone resistant compounds in industrial effluents huang et al 2016b and 2019a concurrently electro generated h2o2 in the e peroxone is an effective reducing agent which could significantly reduce intermediate chlorine or bromine resulting in negligible formation of perchlorate and bromate li et al 2015 lin et al 2016 several studies also proved that h2o2 was capable of reducing cr vi at acidic phs ph 6 due to the coupled pe ph relationship of cr vi cr iii e0 hcro4 cr3 1 35 v and o2 h2o2 e0 o2 h2o2 0 68 v pettine et al 2002 bokare and choi 2010 and 2011 previous studies indicated h2o2 concentration in e peroxone reached tens to hundreds ppm hou et al 2016 xia et al 2017 much greater than the aqueous o3 concentration suggesting that e peroxone can generate sufficient h2o2 for cr vi reduction moreover we hypothesize that the carbon based porous electrodes can potentially transform cr vi via faradaic electrochemical reduction processes and induce cr oh 3 precipitation possibly on the electrodes barrera díaz et al 2012 jin et al 2016 the electrodes could also directly capture cr iii vi species through non faradaic electro adsorption processes and capacitive adsorption yao et al 2020 liu et al 2021 this could potentially facilitate the synchronous recovery of cr markedly reducing the generation and disposal cost of cr enriched hazardous waste in this study we proposed a new strategy for efficient decomplexation of cr iii organic complexes and simultaneous cr recovery from wastewaters by using e peroxone activated carbon fiber acf was chosen deliberately as the electrodes owing to its excellent electrochemical performance for h2o2 generation and cr iii vi removal cr iii edta was chosen as the representative to investigate the cr removal and recovery performance of e peroxone in comparison with other commonly adopted oxidation processes meanwhile the reactive species for cr iii edta degradation and the synergistic pathways of intermediate cr vi curtailment were systematically investigated the evolution of cr species in the solution and at the electrode surface was particularly concerned and the mechanism involving intermediate cr vi inhibition and simultaneous recovery of cr was also proposed furthermore cathodic reusability and the applicability for other cr iii organic complexes and real electroplating effluent were further evaluated to test the practical applicability of the process 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt na2edta 99 5

mesh acf ti with the exposed area of 40 cm2 was selected as the anode and cathode and their distance was 2 0 cm electrolysis alone electrolysis with o2 sparging electrolysis o2 and e peroxone were performed under galvanostatic conditions using a dc power supply kps 3005d zhaoxin china for electrolysis o2 the ozone generator was off and only o2 was feed into the reactor in contrast a mixed gas of o2 and o3 was substituted during ozonation and e peroxone the reaction solution was uniformly mixed using a magnetic stirrer at a constant speed for each reaction process samples were taken at predetermined time intervals during electrolysis ozonation and e peroxone and then were filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane to determine residual total organic carbon toc total cr and cr vi industrial wastewater was collected from a workshop of electroplating plant in wenzhou zhejiang province china whose basic parameters were shown in table s1 in supporting information si the diluted wastewater 15 times the complexed cr iii concentration of 10 15 mg l and conductivity of 7 8 ms cm was employed for further evaluation of the applicability of e peroxone process all experiments were performed in at least three replicates 2 3 analytical methods solution ph was measured using a ph meter pb 10 sartorious the concentration of cr vi was measured by diphenylcarbohydrazide photometric method lara et al 2017 cr iii was first converted to cr vi through permanganate oxidation and then determined as stated above saltzman 1952 the h2o2 concentration was measured using the potassium titanium iv oxalate method and the apparent current efficiency ace for h2o2 generation is calculated according to eq 1 xia et al 2017 toc was measured by a toc v cpn analyzer shaimadzu japan the ho production during ozonation electrolysis o2 and e peroxone were determined by the addition of ba ho probe the concentration of ba was analyzed as reported in our previous study huang et al 2015 and 2016a the intermediates generated during cr iii edta degradation were firstly complexed with additional cu ii then the following formation of cu ii complexes were determined using high performance liquid

peroxone 3 1 1 enhanced decomplexation and mineralization of cr iii edta and inhibition of intermediate cr vi generation total cr removal and toc mineralization are employed to evaluate to the efficiency of cr iii edta decomplexation the evolution of the residual cr in the solution during cr iii edta decomplexation by electrolysis alone electrolysis o2 ozonation and e peroxone were compared in fig 1 a less than 1 0 mg l of aqueous cr was removed by electrolysis alone within 120 min whereas about 3 1 mg l of aqueous cr was reduced during electrolysis o2 during ozonation less than 4 0 of cr variation was observed in contrast e peroxone showed highly effective removal of aqueous cr and the aqueous concentration of total cr was reduced to 1 20 mg l from 11 50 mg l after 120 min moreover e peroxone removed about 80 of toc within 60 min and exhibited more rapid and efficient removal of toc than electrolysis and ozonation fig s1 in the first 20 min about 71 of toc mineralization was achieved by e peroxone whereas only 25 and 36 toc were removed by electrolysis and ozonation respectively those results indicated that e peroxone could obtain more efficient removal of cr iii edta compared to other three processes the accumulation of intermediate cr vi under four processes was depicted in fig 1b about 60 of the removable cr during electrolysis alone was converted to cr vi 0 6 mg l the accumulation of cr vi during ozonation significantly increased with the increasing reaction time and more than 95 of cr iii was transformed to cr vi 10 mg l within 120 min interestingly the concentration of cr vi accumulation in e peroxone was less than 0 20 mg l which was significantly lower than that in the other aops including fenton oxidation and electrochemical oxidation jiang et al 2020 li et al 2014 numerous researchers demonstrated the formation of cr vi in treatment of cr iii organic complexes via aops such as ozonation and electro oxidation was ascribed to the oxidation of cr iii by ho li et al 2014 durante et al 2011 however insignificant accumulation of cr vi was obtained in the ho dominated e peroxone indicating the possible involvement of electrochemical precipitation adsorption and electro generated h2o2 from e peroxone in the curtailment and immobilization of intermediate cr vi similarly negligible accumulation of cr vi in the electrolysis o2 fig 1b suggested the above mentioned processes were also involved 3 1 2 evidences for simultaneous cr recovery cr precipitate was not observed eventually during e peroxone of cr iii edta inset of fig 1b a combination of macroscopic digestion experiments and spectroscopic analysis was employed to identify the fate of the removed cr the used acf cathode and anode were immersed in 2 m hno3 under sonication for 2 h after determination of cr concentration in the leaching solution the enriched cr at acf cathode accounted for 78 3 of cr removal amount and the remaining 21 7 was concentrated at acf anode suggesting complete recovery of the in process removable cr at the electrodes the morphology and composition of the new and used acf were characterized by sem edx as shown in fig 2 a and b the sediments were observed on the surface of the used acf cathode in comparison to the new one meanwhile edx spectrums of the used cathode and anode fig 2b and c showed distinct peaks of cr and their contents of cr accounted for 18 19 wt and 12 20 wt respectively furthermore the deposited absorbed cr on the cathode and anode was further characterized using xps and the results were illustrated in fig 3 for the used cathode significant peaks appeared at binding energies of 578 0 ev and 587 5 ev fig 3a which separately corresponded to cr 2p3 2 and cr 2p1 2 of cr iii the gray green color deposits formed on the acf cathode when cr iii edta concentration increased to 10 mm fig s2a which were identified as amorphous form based on xrd analysis fig 2d meanwhile the deposits exhibited the evident peaks of stretching vibration 3405 cm 1 flexural vibration 1630 cm 1 and deformation 1384 cm 1 of hydroxyl groups fig s2c and the deposits were conversed to brown green cr2o3 after being calcinated at 400 c fig 2d fig s2b and s2d these results suggest the formation of amorphous cr oh 3 deposits at the acf cathode for the used anode the cr2p xps peaks at binding energies of 580 0 ev and 589 0 ev appeared fig 3b which were identified as cr 2p3 2 and cr 2p1 2 of cr vi further confirming the electro adsorption of partial cr vi anions e g hcro4 cro4 2 and cr2o7 2 on the acf anode besides the bands at binding energies of 578 0 ev and 587 5 ev were also observed which was caused by eletrostatic adsorption of some cr iii edta thus in addition to efficient decomplexation of cr iii edta and curtailment of intermediate cr vi e peroxone could achieve highly effective recovery of cr simultaneously 3 1 3 effects of ph o3 concentration and current density on cr recovery and intermediate cr vi inhibition fig 4 a shows the efficiency of cr recovery at initial ph from 2 0 to 7 0 about 70 of cr was recovered at ph 2 0 and a maximum ph for cr recovery was observed at ph 3 0 with more than 90 of cr recovery further increasing ph above 3 0 led to the obvious deceleration of cr recovery meanwhile the increase of ph also inhibited the removal of toc fig s3 as shown in fig 4b the cumulative concentration of cr vi at ph 2 0 and 3 0 was less than 0 2 mg l but was significantly enhanced by increasing ph to 4 0 or more the electrochemical reduction of h2o into h2 and oh eq 2 creates a local alkaline ph environment at the cathode much higher than the bulk ph in the solution lei et al 2017 wang et al 2022 thus inducing the peroxone reaction to generate ho at acidic phs the higher electro generation of ho2 h2o2 at strong acidic phs than weak acidic or neutral phs promoted more ho production from peroxone reaction zhou et al 2019 wang et al 2018 resulting in the higher efficiency of cr iii edta decomplexation at relatively lower ph similar results of higher mineralization at acidic phs than at neutral and alkaline phs during e peroxone treatment of orange ii dye were reported bakheet et al 2013 lower accumulation of cr vi at acidic phs was possibly because more proton as a reactant eq 3 and more electro generation of h2o2 as a reductant accelerated intermediate cr vi reduction eq 4 wang et al 2014 bokare and choi 2011 2 2 h 2 o 2 e 2 o h h 2 3 cro 4 2 8 h 3 e c r 3 4 h 2 o 4 2 cro 4 2 3 h 2 o 2 10 h 2 c r 3 3 o 2 8 h 2 o cr recovery increased considerably with increasing o3 concentration from 0 48 mg l to 7 40 mg l but moderately decreased when o3 concentration increased to 15 6 mg l fig 4c simultaneously toc removal was enhanced by increasing o3 concentration fig s4 as illustrated in fig 4d no accumulation of cr vi was observed at o3 concentration of not exceeding 2 40 mg l however cr vi accumulation appeared at 7 40 mg l o3 and remarkably increased at 15 6 mg l o3 the declining recovery of cr at 15 6 mg l o3 was ascribed to the more formation of intermediate cr vi increasing gaseous o3 concentration promoted o3 mass transfer from gas phase to aqueous phase leading into the enhanced production of ho from electro peroxone reaction and the aqueous concentration of o3 was always less than 0 5 mg l in the e peroxone fig s5b thus the enhanced accumulation of cr vi at relatively higher o3 concentration possibly derived from more production of ho for the oxidation of cr iii species the applied current is the critical factor affecting the performance for cr iii edta decomplexation by e peroxone since it determines the yield of oxidative species e g h2o2 and ho the increase of applied current intensity from 5 to 15 ma cm2 clearly promoted the recovery of cr but further increasing to 20 ma cm2 resulted in a decline of cr recovery fig 4e this is possibly caused by the declined decomplexation of cr iii edta resulted from partial ho quenched by the more electro generated h2o2 at relatively higher current the applied current intensity ranging from 5 to 20 ma cm2 could effectively inhibited the formation of cr vi with the cr vi accumulation of less than 0 2 mg l fig 4f 3 2 mechanisms for enhanced cr removal and recovery 3 2 1 dominant reactive species ho was thought to be the main reactive species in the e peroxone process yuan et al 2013 xia et al 2017 wang et al 2018 to validate ho as the main oxidizing species for cr iii edta degradation in the e peroxone the experiment with the addition of tert butanol tba a typical ho radical scavenger was carried out to examine the effect of cr removal in the system as shown in fig 5 a the presence of tba remarkably suppressed the removal of cr in the e peroxone and the pseudo fist order kinetic of cr removal was almost completely inhibited by 100 mm tba those results suggest that ho probably accounted for the decomplexation of cr iii edta in the system the production of ho was proved to derive from o3 reaction with electro generated h2o2 in the e peroxone wang et al 2015a and 2015b the concentrations of h2o2 formation under the applied current density ranging from 5 ma cm2 to 20 ma cm2 were measured under o2 sparging and the results are illustrated in fig s6a the concentration of h2o2 clearly increased as the reaction time which was significantly promoted by increasing applied current the formed h2o2 concentration reached 30 35 mg l at the current density of 15 ma cm2 and 20 ma cm2 and the application of high current exhibited higher apparent current efficiencies of electro generated h2o2 fig s6b indicating that the acf cathodic reduction of o2 produced h2o2 efficiently the concentration of h2o2 declined to about 10 mg l in the electrolysis with o3 sparging at the current density of 15 ma cm2 fig s5a meanwhile the aqueous o3 concentration decreased to 0 5 mg l from 3 3 mg l fig s5b suggesting that o3 was consumed in the reaction with in situ formed h2o2 to produce ho we further monitored the concentration of ho during ozonation electrolysis o2 and e peroxone using ba as ho probe as shown in fig 5b ba degradation in those three processes followed the pseudo first order kinetic model the apparent kinetic constants of e peroxone was 1 297 min 1 which was 4 9 and 4 4 times higher than that of ozonation 0 262 min 1 and electrolysis o2 0 294 min 1 respectively those results suggested that the formed ho concentration in e peroxone was much higher than that in ozonation and electrolysis o2 leading more efficient decomplexation of cr iii edta than the other two processes 3 2 2 oxidative pathways of cr iii edta several studies assumed ho radicals preferentially oxidized cr iii to cr vi rather than attacking the organic ligands during the decomplexation of cr iii organic complexes ye et al 2017 ma et al 2020 but the supporting evidences were not provided based on the fact that the complexation rates of organic ligands with cu ii is about 14 orders of magnitude larger than that with cr iii xu et al 1985 afanas eva et al 2006 so the released edta and its decarboxylated products from cr iii edta decomplexation preferentially and rapidly complex with the additional cu ii to form the corresponding cu ii complexes in this study the addition of cu ii was employed to complex the released ligands including edta and its oxidizing products to verify the more preferential oxidation of cr iii to cr vi than organic ligands by ho then the corresponding formed cu ii complexes were determined using hplc and their evolution of the hplc spectrum was illustrated in fig 6 a it can be seen that the peak of cu ii edta emerged at 1 min along with the decline in cr iii edta and then its intensity followed by a significant drop with increasing reaction time indicating the first release of edta during e peroxone of cr iii edta then two decarboxylated intermediates including cu ii ethylenediaminetriacetic cu ii ed3a and cu ii ethylenediamine n n diacetic acid cu ii ed2a were observed those results demonstrated the preferential oxidation of cr iii to cr vi over edta via ho in the cr iii edta decomplexation by e peroxone this was possible because the electrophilic ho readily attacked the cr iii site of higher electron density than edta matović et al 2013 afterwards edta were released and then degraded to decarboxylated products e g ed3a and ed2a by ho 3 2 3 transformation of intermediate cr vi for cr recovery the in process color of the solution changed from purple slight yellow to colorless inset of fig 1b suggesting the occurrence of intermediate cr vi formation and conversion during e peroxone the ho based aops oxidized the vast majority of cr iii species to cr vi but ho dominated e peroxone process exhibited an excellent capacity for inhibition of cr vi formation during the decomplexation of cr iii edta moreover e peroxone was also capable of removing cr vi efficiently with the residual cr vi concentration of less than 0 1 mg l from initial 10 mg l after 30 min fig s7 in e peroxone process h2o2 formed from cathodic o2 reduction e o2 h2o2 0 68 v she and cathode derived electrons may serve as the reductants for reduction of cr vi to cr iii e hcro4 cr3 1 35 v she bokare and choi 2011 jin et al 2016 the additional h2o2 was capable of reducing cr vi to cr iii and increasing h2o2 concentration significantly improved the reducing efficiency fig s8 as well acf anode with high surface area possibly absorbed cr vi anions hcro4 cro4 2 and cr2o7 2 from water by electro adsorption e a under the applied electric field frenzel et al 2006 jin et al 2016 the removal effect for cr vi in electrolysis o2 was similar with e peroxone using the same acf ti electrodes and the amounts of deposited cr at the electrodes and cr iii in the solution after both treatment were also very close fig s7 suggesting both for cr vi removal in the same ways including electro generated h2o2 electro reduction and electro adsorption hence to prevent the further oxidation of the converted cr iii to cr vi by o3 and ho electrolysis o2 was employed as an alternative for e peroxone to clarify the respective contribution of h2o2 electro reduction e r and e a for cr vi reduction since ti electrode is ineffective in generating h2o2 adsorbing cr vi and reducing cr vi yuan et al 2013 yao et al 2020 electrolysis with ti anode and acf ti cathode represents the dominated e r with negligible h2o2 formation and e a while electrolysis with acf ti anode and ti cathode stands for the predominant e a with negligible h2o2 formation and e r the kinetics of cr vi removal by electrolysis o2 e r and e a were shown in fig 6b the kinetic constant of cr vi removal by electrolysis o2 were 0 286 min 1 whereas the kinetic constants of e r and e a were 0 169 min 1 and 0 057 min 1 respectively according to eqs 5 7 the relative contributions of h2o2 e a and e r to cr vi reduction were estimated to be 21 0 19 9 and 59 1 respectively therefore it can conclude that e r played a dominant role in the reduction of intermediate cr vi in the e peroxone and h2o2 reduction and e a were also involved in the intermediate cr vi reduction the cathodic local alkaline ph led the in situ precipitation of cr iii from intermediate cr vi reduction by e r and h2o2 at the local region of the cathode lei et al 2017 wang and na 2014 as a result most of the formed intermediate cr vi was recovered as amorphous cr oh 3 deposits at the acf cathode 5 η e a k e a k e o 2 100 6 η e r k e r k e o 2 100 7 η h 2 o 2 1 η e a η e r 3 2 4 proposed mechanisms for cr iii edta removal and cr recovery based on the above results the plausible mechanism for cr iii edta removal by e peroxone was proposed and schematically illustrated in fig 7 the ho produced from the reaction between o3 and electro generated h2o2 firstly attacked cr iii site of cr iii edta to form cr vi subsequently edta was released and then was degraded by ho through stepwise decarboxylated process simultaneously the formed cr vi was curtailed in situ by e r electro generated h2o2 and e a which accounted for 59 1 21 0 and 19 9 respectively finally about 78 3 of cr was deposited as amorphous cr oh 3 at the cathode via reduction of intermediate cr vi to cr iii and simultaneous in situ cr iii precipitation whereas the remaining cr was adsorbed at the anode via capacitive adsorption attractively the electro generated h2o2 played dual roles for enhancing ho production and intermediate cr vi reduction in the system moreover cathodic reduction could recover a great mount of cr thus e peroxone exhibited highly effective removal of cr iii edta inhibition of intermediate cr vi accumulation and simultaneous recovery of cr 3 3 re use potential of acf electrode electrochemical properties of the new used and regenerated acf cathode and anode were characterized by cv and eis cv curves of the used and regenerative acf exhibited no anodic and cathodic peaks consistent with that of the new one fig 8 a and fig s9a the eis results of acf showed obvious decline in the ohmic resistance rs after use and insignificant change in rs after regeneration fig 8b and fig s9b suggesting the charge transfer resistance of acf was not influenced by regenerative treatment bet results in table s3 in si showed surface area and pore volume of acf were reduced after use due to the deposited adsorbed cr but regeneration treatment could effectively recover its surface area and pore volume the above results suggested acf has excellent renewable performance and oxidative stability furthermore the reusability of acf electrodes with or without regenerative treatment were explored by reusing the same electrode in five successive cycles respectively as shown in fig 8c after regeneration treatment the residual concentration of total cr maintained below 1 5 mg l from 2nd to 5th cycle and the cr vi concentration below 0 5 mg l in contrast the residual total cr rapidly increased from 1 225 mg l in the 1st run to 3 075 mg l in the 5th run in the absence of regeneration treatment fig 8d this might be that abundant cr deposits on the electrode after multiple uses affected the cathodic efficiencies for electro generated h2o2 however the deposition of cr on the acf exhibited little effect on the curtailment of intermediate cr vi fig 8d because cr deposits possibly promote the electron transfer activity of acf for enhancing the electro reduction performance of cr vi the accumulated cr can be reused for electroplating and tanning process via scraping as cr oh 3 solid or dissolving in acid solution 3 4 treatment of other cr iii complexes and real wastewater as listed in table 1 e peroxone was capable of efficiently removing cr iii citrate and cr iii oxalate with the residua cr less than 1 5 mg l and the accumulation of cr vi below 0 43 mg l a real electroplating effluent was acidified to ph 3 0 for e peroxone test the process is still effective in removal of industrial wastewater containing cr about 86 of total cr was removed and the cumulative concentration of cr vi was below 0 19 mg l overall the residual cr and cumulative cr vi after e peroxone treatment of complexed cr iii samples could meet the discharge standard of cr in china total cr 1 5 mg l and cr vi 0 5 mg l meanwhile higher than 86 cr was recovered at the acf electrodes in the e peroxone such satisfactory effects convinced us that e peroxone is a promising alternative to remove toxic cr iii complexes from water wastewater with insignificant accumulation of cr vi 4 conclusions this study demonstrated e peroxone was capable of efficiently decomplexing cr iii organic complex and inhibiting accumulation of intermediate cr vi simultaneously the decomplexed cr could be recovered completely at the acf electrodes without the production of cr laden sludge e peroxone could remove total cr in cr iii edta from 11 50 mg l to 1 20 mg l and the in process accumulation of cr vi was less than 0 2 mg l simultaneously 78 3 of the removable cr was deposited as amorphous cr oh 3 at acf cathode and the residual cr was adsorbed at acf anode the extraordinary efficiency for cr iii edta decomplexation was mainly ascribed to the efficient generation of ho from peroxone reactions of in situ electro generated h2o2 with o3 ho oxidized cr iii to cr vi firstly to force release edta which subsequently went through the stepwise decarboxylation process the formed intermediate cr vi was curtailed and immobilized effectively by the multiple effects of electro reduction h2o2 reduction and electro adsorption which accounted for 59 1 21 0 and 19 9 respectively avoiding the generation of cr laden sludge moreover the acf electrodes experienced negligible performance deterioration after five regeneration cycles the proposed process can effectively treat other cr iii complexes with citrate and oxalate and real electroplating effluent containing cr iii complexes which further verified the applicability of this process and its potential for practical application declaration of competing interest the authors

15986,available oxidation processes for removing cr iii complexes from water wastewater usually encounter the formation of highly toxic cr vi and the generation of cr enriched waste sludge posing challenges on the subsequent disposal herein we achieve efficient removal of cr iii organic complexes and simultaneous recovery of cr from wastewater with enhanced curtailment of intermediate cr vi by using an electrochemically driven peroxone i e electro peroxone process with activated carbon fiber acf electrodes for cr iii edta electro peroxone could remove 90 total cr from 11 50 mg l to 1 20 mg l and 80 total organic carbon with a strong curtailment of cr vi to less than 0 2 mg l additionally the process could obtain a complete recovery of the removable cr of which 78 3 are enriched at acf cathode as amorphous cr oh 3 deposits and the remaining 21 7 are adsorbed at the anode thus avoiding the generation of cr laden sludge mechanism studies show the electro generated h2o2 reacts with o3 to generate abundant ho for decomplexation which sequentially oxidizes cr iii to cr vi and degrades the released edta via stepwise decarboxylated process as confirmed by hplc analysis multiple pathways including electro reduction h2o2 reduction and electro adsorption synergistically curtail and immobilize the formed intermediate cr vi acf characterizations and continuous 5 cycle experiments substantiate the excellent reusability of the acf electrodes moreover this process exhibits satisfactory effectiveness to cr iii complexed with other ligands e g citrate and oxalate and complexed cr iii in the real electroplating wastewater we believe this study would provide an efficient and eco friendly alternative for cr iii complexes removal from wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cr iii organic complexes electro peroxone decomplexation intermediate cr vi cr recovery 1 introduction trivalent chromium cr iii compounds are massively employed in various industrial processes including tanning electroplating metal finishing and textile jiang et al 2020 ye et al 2018 organic ligands such as citrate ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta dyes or other chemical additives are extensively used for complexing cr iii to prevent precipitate formation huang et al 2019a wang et al 2016 which generates abundant recalcitrant wastewaters containing cr iii organic complexes in china the annual discharge of cr iii bearing tanning wastewaters exceeds 70 million tons among which the concentration of complexed cr iii reaches up several dozens mg l wang et al 2016 although cr iii is less toxic than cr vi increasing concerns are raised on the possible formation of mutagenic and carcinogenic cr vi by oxidation processes or natural bio transformations in the water environment chebeir and liu 2016 yang et al 2014 to reduce the potential risks of cr to the receiving waters and human health many countries or organizations issued stringent guidelines on the maximum contaminant level mcl of total cr and cr vi for example mcl of total cr and cr vi in the industrial effluents is regulated to be 1 5 mg l and 0 5 mg l in china respectively most available processes such as chemical precipitation coagulation and adsorption are efficient in the abatement of free cr iii cations ye et al 2017 and 2018 however those above mentioned methods are incapable of removing cr iii organic complexes to the safe level 1 5 mg l in most cases around tens of mg l complexed cr iii still remains in the tanning effluents after chemical precipitation much higher than the maximum allowable discharge standard of cr ye et al 2018 wang et al 2016 advanced oxidation processes aops such as fenton ozonation electrochemical oxidation and photochemical oxidation zhao et al 2018 ma et al 2020 chen et al 2021 huang et al 2016b and 2019b xu et al 2021 are promising technologies for the treatment of wastewater containing complexed heavy metals those above methods could efficiently degrade various metal organic complexes e g pb ii cu ii and ni ii complexes huang et al 2016b wang et al 2020 xu et al 2021 however their employment for eliminating cr iii organic complexes was challenged by the formation and accumulation of much more toxic cr vi species the following post treatment processes e g addition of fe2 and electrocoagulation were adopted to remove intermediate cr vi accompanied by the generation of cr enriched waste sludge that is costly to dispose durante et al 2009 and 2011 huang et al 2019a recently studies on photo fenton and electro fenton processes demonstrate their capability on reducing intermediate cr vi by highly reductive fe ii species yet still facing the problems caused by excess production of the hazardous metal sludge ye et al 2017 jiang et al 2020 to solve the above mentioned problems one of the best approaches is to achieve efficient degradation of cr iii organic complexes with simultaneous curtailment of intermediate cr vi and recovery of cr but still remain a challenge electro peroxone e peroxone i e an electrochemical driven process that combines ozonation with in situ electro generated h2o2 from cathodic oxygen reduction has been developed to promote o3 transformation to ho using the carbon based cathodes including reticulated vitreous carbon carbon felt and carbon polytetrafluoroethylene yuan et al 2013 hou et al 2016 xia et al 2017 wang et al 2018 the markedly enhanced yield of ho in the e peroxone could efficiently degrade ozone recalcitrant contaminants such as 1 4 dioxane oxalic acid pharmaceuticals and taste and odor compounds wang et al 2015a and wang et al 2015b yao et al 2017 li et al 2019 zhan et al 2019 therefore we expect the e peroxone process might potentially be employed to destroy and remove cr iii complexes e g cr iii edta which are typically ozone resistant compounds in industrial effluents huang et al 2016b and 2019a concurrently electro generated h2o2 in the e peroxone is an effective reducing agent which could significantly reduce intermediate chlorine or bromine resulting in negligible formation of perchlorate and bromate li et al 2015 lin et al 2016 several studies also proved that h2o2 was capable of reducing cr vi at acidic phs ph 6 due to the coupled pe ph relationship of cr vi cr iii e0 hcro4 cr3 1 35 v and o2 h2o2 e0 o2 h2o2 0 68 v pettine et al 2002 bokare and choi 2010 and 2011 previous studies indicated h2o2 concentration in e peroxone reached tens to hundreds ppm hou et al 2016 xia et al 2017 much greater than the aqueous o3 concentration suggesting that e peroxone can generate sufficient h2o2 for cr vi reduction moreover we hypothesize that the carbon based porous electrodes can potentially transform cr vi via faradaic electrochemical reduction processes and induce cr oh 3 precipitation possibly on the electrodes barrera díaz et al 2012 jin et al 2016 the electrodes could also directly capture cr iii vi species through non faradaic electro adsorption processes and capacitive adsorption yao et al 2020 liu et al 2021 this could potentially facilitate the synchronous recovery of cr markedly reducing the generation and disposal cost of cr enriched hazardous waste in this study we proposed a new strategy for efficient decomplexation of cr iii organic complexes and simultaneous cr recovery from wastewaters by using e peroxone activated carbon fiber acf was chosen deliberately as the electrodes owing to its excellent electrochemical performance for h2o2 generation and cr iii vi removal cr iii edta was chosen as the representative to investigate the cr removal and recovery performance of e peroxone in comparison with other commonly adopted oxidation processes meanwhile the reactive species for cr iii edta degradation and the synergistic pathways of intermediate cr vi curtailment were systematically investigated the evolution of cr species in the solution and at the electrode surface was particularly concerned and the mechanism involving intermediate cr vi inhibition and simultaneous recovery of cr was also proposed furthermore cathodic reusability and the applicability for other cr iii organic complexes and real electroplating effluent were further evaluated to test the practical applicability of the process 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt na2edta 99 5

performed under galvanostatic conditions using a dc power supply kps 3005d zhaoxin china for electrolysis o2 the ozone generator was off and only o2 was feed into the reactor in contrast a mixed gas

predetermined time intervals during electrolysis ozonation and e peroxone and then were filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane to determine residual total organic carbon toc total cr and cr vi industrial wastewater was collected from a workshop of electroplating plant in wenzhou zhejiang province china whose basic parameters were shown in table s1 in supporting information si the diluted wastewater 15

peroxone 3 1 1 enhanced decomplexation and mineralization of cr iii edta and inhibition of intermediate cr vi generation total cr removal and toc mineralization are employed to evaluate to the efficiency of cr iii edta decomplexation the evolution of the residual cr in the solution during cr iii edta decomplexation by electrolysis alone electrolysis o2 ozonation and e peroxone were compared in fig 1 a less than 1 0 mg l of aqueous cr was removed by electrolysis alone within 120 min whereas about 3 1 mg l of aqueous cr was reduced during electrolysis o2 during ozonation less than 4 0 of cr variation was observed in contrast e peroxone showed highly effective removal of aqueous cr and the aqueous concentration of total cr was reduced to 1 20 mg l from 11 50 mg l after 120 min moreover e peroxone removed about 80 of toc within 60 min and exhibited more rapid and efficient removal of toc than electrolysis and ozonation fig s1 in the first 20 min about 71 of toc mineralization was achieved by e peroxone whereas only 25 and 36 toc were removed by electrolysis and ozonation respectively those results indicated that e peroxone could obtain more efficient removal of cr iii edta compared to other three processes the accumulation of intermediate cr vi under four processes was depicted in fig 1b about 60 of the removable cr during electrolysis alone was converted to cr vi 0 6 mg l the accumulation of cr vi during ozonation significantly increased with the increasing reaction time and more than 95 of cr iii was transformed to cr vi 10 mg l within 120 min interestingly the concentration of cr vi accumulation in e peroxone was less than 0 20 mg l which was significantly lower than that in the other aops including fenton oxidation and electrochemical oxidation jiang et al 2020 li et al 2014 numerous researchers demonstrated the formation of cr vi in treatment of cr iii organic complexes via aops such as ozonation and electro oxidation was ascribed to the oxidation of cr iii by ho li et al 2014 durante et al 2011 however insignificant accumulation of cr vi was obtained in the ho dominated e peroxone indicating the possible involvement of electrochemical precipitation adsorption and electro generated h2o2 from e peroxone in the curtailment and immobilization of intermediate cr vi similarly negligible accumulation of cr vi in the electrolysis o2 fig 1b suggested the above mentioned processes were also involved 3 1 2 evidences for simultaneous cr recovery cr precipitate was not observed eventually during e peroxone of cr iii edta inset of fig 1b a combination of macroscopic digestion experiments and spectroscopic analysis was employed to identify the fate of the removed cr the used acf cathode and anode were immersed in 2 m hno3 under sonication for 2 h after determination of cr concentration in the leaching solution the enriched cr at acf cathode accounted for 78 3 of cr removal amount and the remaining 21 7 was concentrated at acf anode suggesting complete recovery of the in process removable cr at the electrodes the morphology and composition of the new and used acf were characterized by sem edx as shown in fig 2 a and b the sediments were observed on the surface of the used acf cathode in comparison to the new one meanwhile edx spectrums of the used cathode and anode fig 2b and c showed distinct peaks of cr and their contents of cr accounted for 18 19 wt and 12 20 wt respectively furthermore the deposited absorbed cr on the cathode and anode was further characterized using xps and the results were illustrated in fig 3 for the used cathode significant peaks appeared at binding energies of 578 0 ev and 587 5 ev fig 3a which separately corresponded to cr 2p3 2 and cr 2p1 2 of cr iii the gray green color deposits formed on the acf cathode when cr iii edta concentration increased to 10 mm fig s2a which were identified as amorphous form based on xrd analysis fig 2d meanwhile the deposits exhibited the evident peaks of stretching vibration 3405 cm 1 flexural vibration 1630 cm 1 and deformation 1384 cm 1 of hydroxyl groups fig s2c and the deposits were conversed to brown green cr2o3 after being calcinated at 400 c fig 2d fig s2b and s2d these results suggest the formation of amorphous cr oh 3 deposits at the acf cathode for the used anode the cr2p xps peaks at binding energies of 580 0 ev and 589 0 ev appeared fig 3b which were identified as cr 2p3 2 and cr 2p1 2 of cr vi further confirming the electro adsorption of partial cr vi anions e g hcro4 cro4 2 and cr2o7 2 on the acf anode besides the bands at binding energies of 578 0 ev and 587 5 ev were also observed which was caused by eletrostatic adsorption of some cr iii edta thus in addition to efficient decomplexation of cr iii edta and curtailment of intermediate cr vi e peroxone could achieve highly effective recovery of cr simultaneously 3 1 3 effects of ph o3 concentration and current density on cr recovery and intermediate cr vi inhibition fig 4 a shows the efficiency of cr recovery at initial ph from 2 0 to 7 0 about 70 of cr was recovered at ph 2 0 and a maximum ph for cr recovery was observed at ph 3 0 with more than 90 of cr recovery further increasing ph above 3 0 led to the obvious deceleration of cr recovery meanwhile the increase of ph also inhibited the removal of toc fig s3 as shown in fig 4b the cumulative concentration of cr vi at ph 2 0 and 3 0 was less than 0 2 mg l but was significantly enhanced by increasing ph to 4 0 or more the electrochemical reduction of h2o into h2 and oh eq 2 creates a local alkaline ph environment at the cathode much higher than the bulk ph in the solution lei et al 2017 wang et al 2022 thus inducing the peroxone reaction to generate ho at acidic phs the higher electro generation of ho2 h2o2 at strong acidic phs than weak acidic or neutral phs promoted more ho production from peroxone reaction zhou et al 2019 wang et al 2018 resulting in the higher efficiency of cr iii edta decomplexation at relatively lower ph similar results of higher mineralization at acidic phs than at neutral and alkaline phs during e peroxone treatment of orange ii dye were reported bakheet et al 2013 lower accumulation of cr vi at acidic phs was possibly because more proton as a reactant eq 3 and more electro generation of h2o2 as a reductant accelerated intermediate cr vi reduction eq 4 wang et al 2014 bokare and choi 2011 2 2 h 2 o 2 e 2 o h h 2 3 cro 4 2 8 h 3 e c r 3 4 h 2 o 4 2 cro 4 2 3 h 2 o 2 10 h 2 c r 3 3 o 2 8 h 2 o cr recovery increased considerably with increasing o3 concentration from 0 48 mg l to 7 40 mg l but moderately decreased when o3 concentration increased to 15 6 mg l fig 4c simultaneously toc removal was enhanced by increasing o3 concentration fig s4 as illustrated in fig 4d no accumulation of cr vi was observed at o3 concentration of not exceeding 2 40 mg l however cr vi accumulation appeared at 7 40 mg l o3 and remarkably increased at 15 6 mg l o3 the declining recovery of cr at 15 6 mg l o3 was ascribed to the more formation of intermediate cr vi increasing gaseous o3 concentration promoted o3 mass transfer from gas phase to aqueous phase leading into the enhanced production of ho from electro peroxone reaction and the aqueous concentration of o3 was always less than 0 5 mg l in the e peroxone fig s5b thus the enhanced accumulation of cr vi at relatively higher o3 concentration possibly derived from more production of ho for the oxidation of cr iii species the applied current is the critical factor affecting the performance for cr iii edta decomplexation by e peroxone since it determines the yield of oxidative species e g h2o2 and ho the increase of applied current intensity from 5 to 15 ma cm2 clearly promoted the recovery of cr but further increasing to 20 ma cm2 resulted in a decline of cr recovery fig 4e this is possibly caused by the declined decomplexation of cr iii edta resulted from partial ho quenched by the more electro generated h2o2 at relatively higher current the applied current intensity ranging from 5 to 20 ma cm2 could effectively inhibited the formation of cr vi with the cr vi accumulation of less than 0 2 mg l fig 4f 3 2 mechanisms for enhanced cr removal and recovery 3 2 1 dominant reactive species ho was thought to be the main reactive species in the e peroxone process yuan et al 2013 xia et al 2017 wang et al 2018 to validate ho as the main oxidizing species for cr iii edta degradation in the e peroxone the experiment with the addition of tert butanol tba a typical ho radical scavenger was carried out to examine the effect of cr removal in the system as shown in fig 5 a the presence of tba remarkably suppressed the removal of cr in the e peroxone and the pseudo fist order kinetic of cr removal was almost completely inhibited by 100 mm tba those results suggest that ho probably accounted for the decomplexation of cr iii edta in the system the production of ho was proved to derive from o3 reaction with electro generated h2o2 in the e peroxone wang et al 2015a and 2015b the concentrations of h2o2 formation under the applied current density ranging from 5 ma cm2 to 20 ma cm2 were measured under o2 sparging and the results are illustrated in fig s6a the concentration of h2o2 clearly increased as the reaction time which was significantly promoted by increasing applied current the formed h2o2 concentration reached 30 35 mg l at the current density of 15 ma cm2 and 20 ma cm2 and the application of high current exhibited higher apparent current efficiencies of electro generated h2o2 fig s6b indicating that the acf cathodic reduction of o2 produced h2o2 efficiently the concentration of h2o2 declined to about 10 mg l in the electrolysis with o3 sparging at the current density of 15 ma cm2 fig s5a meanwhile the aqueous o3 concentration decreased to 0 5 mg l from 3 3 mg l fig s5b suggesting that o3 was consumed in the reaction with in situ formed h2o2 to produce ho we further monitored the concentration of ho during ozonation electrolysis o2 and e peroxone using ba as ho probe as shown in fig 5b ba degradation in those three processes followed the pseudo first order kinetic model the apparent kinetic constants of e peroxone was 1 297 min 1 which was 4 9 and 4 4 times higher than that of ozonation 0 262 min 1 and electrolysis o2 0 294 min 1 respectively those results suggested that the formed ho concentration in e peroxone was much higher than that in ozonation and electrolysis o2 leading more efficient decomplexation of cr iii edta than the other two processes 3 2 2 oxidative pathways of cr iii edta several studies assumed ho radicals preferentially oxidized cr iii to cr vi rather than attacking the organic ligands during the decomplexation of cr iii organic complexes ye et al 2017 ma et al 2020 but the supporting evidences were not provided based on the fact that the complexation rates of organic ligands with cu ii is about 14 orders of magnitude larger than that with cr iii xu et al 1985 afanas eva et al 2006 so the released edta and its decarboxylated products from cr iii edta decomplexation preferentially and rapidly complex with the additional cu ii to form the corresponding cu ii complexes in this study the addition of cu ii was employed to complex the released ligands including edta and its oxidizing products to verify the more preferential oxidation of cr iii to cr vi than organic ligands by ho then the corresponding formed cu ii complexes were determined using hplc and their evolution of the hplc spectrum was illustrated in fig 6 a it can be seen that the peak of cu ii edta emerged at 1 min along with the decline in cr iii edta and then its intensity followed by a significant drop with increasing reaction time indicating the first release of edta during e peroxone of cr iii edta then two decarboxylated intermediates including cu ii ethylenediaminetriacetic cu ii ed3a and cu ii ethylenediamine n n diacetic acid cu ii ed2a were observed those results demonstrated the preferential oxidation of cr iii to cr vi over edta via ho in the cr iii edta decomplexation by e peroxone this was possible because the electrophilic ho readily attacked the cr iii site of higher electron density than edta matović et al 2013 afterwards edta were released and then degraded to decarboxylated products e g ed3a and ed2a by ho 3 2 3 transformation of intermediate cr vi for cr recovery the in process color of the solution changed from purple slight yellow to colorless inset of fig 1b suggesting the occurrence of intermediate cr vi formation and conversion during e peroxone the ho based aops oxidized the vast majority of cr iii species to cr vi but ho dominated e peroxone process exhibited an excellent capacity for inhibition of cr vi formation during the decomplexation of cr iii edta moreover e peroxone was also capable of removing cr vi efficiently with the residual cr vi concentration of less than 0 1 mg l from initial 10 mg l after 30 min fig s7 in e peroxone process h2o2 formed from cathodic o2 reduction e o2 h2o2 0 68 v she and cathode derived electrons may serve as the reductants for reduction of cr vi to cr iii e hcro4 cr3 1 35 v she bokare and choi 2011 jin et al 2016 the additional h2o2 was capable of reducing cr vi to cr iii and increasing h2o2 concentration significantly improved the reducing efficiency fig s8 as well acf anode with high surface area possibly absorbed cr vi anions hcro4 cro4 2 and cr2o7 2 from water by electro adsorption e a under the applied electric field frenzel et al 2006 jin et al 2016 the removal effect for cr vi in electrolysis o2 was similar with e peroxone using the same acf ti electrodes and the amounts of deposited cr at the electrodes and cr iii in the solution after both treatment were also very close fig s7 suggesting both for cr vi removal in the same ways including electro generated h2o2 electro reduction and electro adsorption hence to prevent the further oxidation of the converted cr iii to cr vi by o3 and ho electrolysis o2 was employed as an alternative for e peroxone to clarify the respective contribution of h2o2 electro reduction e r and e a for cr vi reduction since ti electrode is ineffective in generating h2o2 adsorbing cr vi and reducing cr vi yuan et al 2013 yao et al 2020 electrolysis with ti anode and acf ti cathode represents the dominated e r with negligible h2o2 formation and e a while electrolysis with acf ti anode and ti cathode stands for the predominant e a with negligible h2o2 formation and e r the kinetics of cr vi removal by electrolysis o2 e r and e a were shown in fig 6b the kinetic constant of cr vi removal by electrolysis o2 were 0 286 min 1 whereas the kinetic constants of e r and e a were 0 169 min 1 and 0 057 min 1 respectively according to eqs 5 7 the relative contributions of h2o2 e a and e r to cr vi reduction were estimated to be 21 0 19 9 and 59 1 respectively therefore it can conclude that e r played a dominant role in the reduction of intermediate cr vi in the e peroxone and h2o2 reduction and e a were also involved in the intermediate cr vi reduction the cathodic local alkaline ph led the in situ precipitation of cr iii from intermediate cr vi reduction by e r and h2o2 at the local region of the cathode lei et al 2017 wang and na 2014 as a result most of the formed intermediate cr vi was recovered as amorphous cr oh 3 deposits at the acf cathode 5 η e a k e a k e o 2 100 6 η e r k e r k e o 2 100 7 η h 2 o 2 1 η e a η e r 3 2 4 proposed mechanisms for cr iii edta removal and cr recovery based on the above results the plausible mechanism for cr iii edta removal by e peroxone was proposed and schematically illustrated in fig 7 the ho produced from the reaction between o3 and electro generated h2o2 firstly attacked cr iii site of cr iii edta to form cr vi subsequently edta was released and then was degraded by ho through stepwise decarboxylated process simultaneously the formed cr vi was curtailed in situ by e r electro generated h2o2 and e a which accounted for 59 1 21 0 and 19 9 respectively finally about 78 3 of cr was deposited as amorphous cr oh 3 at the cathode via reduction of intermediate cr vi to cr iii and simultaneous in situ cr iii precipitation whereas the remaining cr was adsorbed at the anode via capacitive adsorption attractively the electro generated h2o2 played dual roles for enhancing ho production and intermediate cr vi reduction in the system moreover cathodic reduction could recover a great mount of cr thus e peroxone exhibited highly effective removal of cr iii edta inhibition of intermediate cr vi accumulation and simultaneous recovery of cr 3 3 re use potential of acf electrode electrochemical properties of the new used and regenerated acf cathode and anode were characterized by cv and eis cv curves of the used and regenerative acf exhibited no anodic and cathodic peaks consistent with that of the new one fig 8 a and fig s9a the eis results of acf showed obvious decline in the ohmic resistance rs after use and insignificant change in rs after regeneration fig 8b and fig s9b suggesting the charge transfer resistance of acf was not influenced by regenerative treatment bet results in table s3 in si showed surface area and pore volume of acf were reduced after use due to the deposited adsorbed cr but regeneration treatment could effectively recover its surface area and pore volume the above results suggested acf has excellent renewable performance and oxidative stability furthermore the reusability of acf electrodes with or without regenerative treatment were explored by reusing the same electrode in five successive cycles respectively as shown in fig 8c after regeneration treatment the residual concentration of total cr maintained below 1 5 mg l from 2nd to 5th cycle and the cr vi concentration below 0 5 mg l in contrast the residual total cr rapidly increased from 1 225 mg l in the 1st run to 3 075 mg l in the 5th run in the absence of regeneration treatment fig 8d this might be that abundant cr deposits on the electrode after multiple uses affected the cathodic efficiencies for electro generated h2o2 however the deposition of cr on the acf exhibited little effect on the curtailment of intermediate cr vi fig 8d because cr deposits possibly promote the electron transfer activity of acf for enhancing the electro reduction performance of cr vi the accumulated cr can be reused for electroplating and tanning process via scraping as cr oh 3 solid or dissolving in acid solution 3 4 treatment of other cr iii complexes and real wastewater as listed in table 1 e peroxone was capable of efficiently removing cr iii citrate and cr iii oxalate with the residua cr less than 1 5 mg l and the accumulation of cr vi below 0 43 mg l a real electroplating effluent was acidified to ph 3 0 for e peroxone test the process is still effective in removal of industrial wastewater containing cr about 86 of total cr was removed and the cumulative concentration of cr vi was below 0 19 mg l overall the residual cr and cumulative cr vi after e peroxone treatment of complexed cr iii samples could meet the discharge standard of cr in china total cr 1 5 mg l and cr vi 0 5 mg l meanwhile higher than 86 cr was recovered at the acf electrodes in the e peroxone such satisfactory effects convinced us that e peroxone is a promising alternative to remove toxic cr iii complexes from water wastewater with insignificant accumulation of cr vi 4 conclusions this study demonstrated e peroxone was capable of efficiently decomplexing cr iii organic complex and inhibiting accumulation of intermediate cr vi simultaneously the decomplexed cr could be recovered completely at the acf electrodes without the production of cr laden sludge e peroxone could remove total cr in cr iii edta from 11 50 mg l to 1 20 mg l and the in process accumulation of cr vi was less than 0 2 mg l simultaneously 78 3 of the removable cr was deposited as amorphous cr oh 3 at acf cathode and the residual cr was adsorbed at acf anode the extraordinary efficiency for cr iii edta decomplexation was mainly ascribed to the efficient generation of ho from peroxone reactions of in situ electro generated h2o2 with o3 ho oxidized cr iii to cr vi firstly to force release edta which subsequently went through the stepwise decarboxylation process the formed intermediate cr vi was curtailed and immobilized effectively by the multiple effects of electro reduction h2o2 reduction and electro adsorption which accounted for 59 1 21 0 and 19 9 respectively avoiding the generation of cr laden sludge moreover the acf electrodes experienced negligible performance deterioration after five regeneration cycles the proposed process can effectively treat other cr iii complexes with citrate and oxalate and real electroplating effluent containing cr iii complexes which further verified the applicability of this process and its potential for practical application declaration of competing interest the authors

15987,membrane distillation md is an emerging thermal desalination technology capable of desalinating waters of any salinity during typical md processes the saline feedwater is heated and acts as the thermal energy carrier however temperature polarization as well as thermal energy loss contributes to low distillate fluxes low single pass water recovery and poor thermal efficiency an alternative approach is to integrate an extra thermal energy carrier as part of the membrane and or module assembly which can channel externally provided heat directly to the membrane feedwater interface and or along the feed channel length this direct heat delivery has been demonstrated to increase single pass water recovery and enhance the overall thermal efficiency we developed a bench scale direct heated vacuum md dhvmd process to desalinate pre treated oil and gas produced water with an initial total dissolved solids of 115 500 ppm at a feed temperature ranging between 24 and 32 c we evaluated both water flux and specific energy consumption sec as a function of water recovery the system achieved a 50 water recovery without significant scaling with an average flux 6 kg m 2 hr 1 and a sec as low as 2 530 kj kg 1 the major species of mineral scales i e nacl caso4 and srso4 that limited the water recovery to 68 were modeled in terms of thermodynamics and identified by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy in addition we further developed and employed a physics based process model to estimate temperature salinity water transport and energy flows for full scale vacuum md and dhvmd modules model results show that a direct heat input rate of 3 600 w can increase single pass water recovery from 2 1 to 3 1 while lowering the thermal sec from 7 800 kj kg 1 to 6 517 kj kg 1 in an unoptimized module finally the scaling up potential of dhvmd process is briefly discussed graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane distillation hyper

membrane distillation is a thermally driven evaporation desalination process through porous hydrophobic membranes one advantage of membrane distillation md is that water flux and energy demand are relatively insensitive to tds concentration whereas for pressure driven desalination processes like reverse osmosis ro the water flux salt rejection and energy demand are directly impacted by tds concentration furthermore ro is limited to the desalination of saline water up to 80 g l 1 tds whereas md or hybrid md integrated with other membrane processes e g forward osmosis is capable of treating hyper saline brines deshmukh et al 2018 nawaz et al 2021 another advantage of md is the high surface area to volume ratio of a membrane module which can lower capital costs compared to conventional thermal desalination processes particularly for small applications of less than 500 m3 day 1 100 gal min 1 deshmukh et al 2018 in conventional md the feed is preheated before entering the membrane module to provide the driving force for vapor transport which is a partial pressure difference between the feed side and the distillate side of the membrane during operation the water vapor leaving the feed at the feed membrane interface contains the latent heat of evaporation that crosses with the vapor into the distillate side of the membrane which results in a lower temperature at the feedwater membrane interface a phenomenon called temperature polarization the presence of temperature polarization decreases the driving force for evaporation across the membrane by lowering the temperature and therefore partial vapor pressure of the feed stream heat is also lost through conduction across the membranes and across the boundaries of the membrane element and other components of the system therefore a thermodynamic limit to water recovery 10 in a single pass md process is expected for standard operating conditions bartholomew et al 2020 gilron et al 2007 lin et al 2014 delivering heat directly to the feed channel and or the membrane surface could minimize temperature polarization in a directly heated vacuum md dhvmd system and thereby increase single pass water

incorporated into the membrane module in a recent study wang et al 2021 a vacuum md vmd process with direct heat input rate was evaluated in 2 hr long tests using hypersaline feed water containing 100

heat md studies are summarized in table 1 where only a few studies used high salinity nacl solutions and no study used real hypersaline wastewater in this study we evaluate the performance of dhvmd applied to desalination of a hyper saline pre treated produced water for which the water recovery was limited by mineral scale formation we identify the principal mineral scale forming species via thermodynamic modeling scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds we also report the sec as a function of water recovery in the lab scale dhvmd module in addition we perform full scale simulations to compare the performance of a standard vmd and dhvmd modules in desalinating a hyper saline brine through the model we explore the impacts of direct heating on temperature and concentration polarization water flux heat flux water recovery and thermal sec finally we have a brief discussion on the potential of scaling up dhvmd to achieve high water recovery and high gained output ratio gor values 2 materials and methods 2 1 md membrane and thermally conducting materials the membranes used for dhvmd are hydrophobic polypropylene pp membranes 3 m charlotte nc with an average thickness of 100 µm an average pore size of 0 2 µm a porosity of 70 and a contact angle of 122 4 0 1 we consider two types of thermally conductive layers the first is a thin aluminum sheet shim placed on the feed channel wall opposite the membrane as shown in fig 1 a c the second is an aluminum mesh that is in direct contact with the membrane in the distillate channel mcmaster carr los angeles ca also as sketched in fig 1c the aluminum shim had a thickness of 250 µm and the aluminum mesh had a mesh size of 120 120 109 µm opening size a thickness of 203 µm and a 27 open area the membrane coupon aluminum shim piece and aluminum mesh piece were cut from flat sheets obtained from the manufacturers and used directly without further modification 2 2 feed characterization and preparation the experiments used pre treated high salinity produced water as feed the water was effluent from a membrane bioreactor mbr used to treat the water with the raw feed to the mbr collected from o g extraction wells in the permian basin the main water quality characteristics of the pre treated produced water are listed in table 2 inorganic species with the highest concentration were found to be na and cl which were at least 10 times higher than any other inorganic constituents in addition to inorganic constituents the pre treated produced water had low levels of dissolved organic carbon doc because the majority of organics contaminates were removed during the mbr process based on the water quality information we used the oli stream analyzer oli systems inc cedar knolls nj to quantify the thermodynamic tendency of salt precipitation using the unitless saturation index the saturation index of inorganic species c x a y was calculated using eq 1 1 s i a c x a a y k s p c x a y where a c is the activity of cation c a a is the activity of anion a and k s p c x a y is the solubility product of c x a y the indices for cation activity and anion activity follow the stoichiometry of the inorganic salt when si exceeds 1 the solution is supersaturated with respect to the particular mineral and precipitation will take place spontaneously the oli simulations were performed using estimates for the salinity and temperature at the membrane surface the membrane surface salinity and temperature were approximated using the concentration polarization factor cp and the temperature polarization factor tp predicted by the full scale process model see details in section 2 6 the membrane surface salinity and temperature were determined as the product of the bulk feed salinity and cp coefficient similarly the surface temperature was the product of the bulk feed temperature and tp coefficient the thermodynamics modeling provides an estimate of salt precipitation tendency at the membrane interface the pre treated produced water used for the experiments was either used directly or pre concentrated by 50 using a rotary vacuum evaporator thermo fisher scientific waltham ma no noticeable crystallization of inorganic salts was observed during pre concentration in terms of the evaporator s operating conditions the water bath temperature was set to 55 c the vacuum was provided by a whole house vacuum system located in the ucla engineering building approximately 0 8 bar absolute pressure and the rotational speed was set to 180 rpm 2 3 dhvmd experiments fig 1a shows a flow diagram of the batch dhvmd system used to desalinate the pre treated produced water flux measurements were performed by measuring changes in the mass of the feed tank holding the pre treated produced water ohaus model number px2202 parsippany nj feed mass measurements were performed every 5 s the feed was circulated through the membrane module using a peristaltic pump cole parmer vernon hills il or a gear pump greylor cape coral fl both of which have speed flow control a cartridge filter with a 1 μm pore size hydronix chino hills ca in the recirculation line after the outlet of the membrane module was used in the experiments where the pre concentrated pre treated produced water was further treated this filter was used to capture any precipitates formed from homogeneous nucleation in the feed tank zhang et al 2015 temperature sensors vktech shenzhen china were placed in the inlet and outlet of the flow cell to monitor the feed temperature in real time the temperature sensors were controlled via an arduino microcontroller the flow cell was constructed of polyether ether ketone peek a polymer known for its ability to withstand high temperatures the length width and height of the flow channel were 10 cm 4 cm and 4 mm or 3 mm respectively the shim membrane and mesh were stacked together from feed side to distillate side type k thermocouples awg 24 minnesota measurement instruments llc minnesota mn were mounted to the surfaces of the mesh and the shim by kapton tape mcmaster carr los angeles ca to measure the temperature at different points on the shim and the mesh as previously detailed in wang et al 2021 specifically inside the module 10 mesh thermocouples and 6 shim thermocouples were placed in symmetry on the left side and right side of the channel length thermocouples of each side are placed at 1 cm intervals towards the o ring mcmaster carr los angeles ca during cross flow operation room temperature feed was pumped into the membrane module and evaporation took place at the feedwater membrane interface a vacuum pump jb industries model number dv 85 n aurora il was used to induce vacuum on the distillate side to drive water vapor transport across the membrane the vacuum was set at 0 01 bar absolute pressure as measured by an external vacuum pressure gage mcmaster carr los angeles ca the vapor produced by the cell and passed to a condenser chemglass life sciences vineland nj in which the coolant 50 wt ethylene glycol at 0 c was recirculated using a refrigerated bath circulator thermo fisher scientific waltham ma the distillate was then collected in a flask the coupling of the thermal energy supply to the shim and mesh is illustrated in fig 1b a cartridge heater with an internal temperature sensor mcmaster carr los angeles ca provided the thermal energy the heating temperature was regulated by a thermostat inkbird shenzhen china in this setup flat sheet thermal carriers both the mesh and the shim were wrapped around a cartridge heater to funnel the externally provided heat to the membrane water interface mesh or into the feed channel itself shim detailed arrangement of feed streams membrane materials and module and both heat and water flows inside the module is presented in fig 1c rate of heat flow to the membrane surface or feed channel delivered through the thermally conducting layers q heat w was estimated by wang et al 2021 2 q h e a t k e f f a δ t δ x where keff w m 1 k 1 is the thermal conductivity of the thermally conducting layer a m2 is the cross sectional area of the thermally conducting layer and δt k and δx m are the temperature difference and the distance between two specified points on the thermally conducting layer along the direction of heat transfer respectively to explore the impact of water recovery on performance the system was operated in a recirculating mode that constantly recirculated feed through the module while the distillate was not returned to the feed tank which allowed the concentrations of rejected constituents to increase over time water recovery in md is typically defined as the percentage of the feed that becomes distillate in this lab scale md system the water recovery y was defined from 3 y δ m m where δm kg is the cumulative water production represented by the reduction in feed mass between 0 and certain recovery and m kg is the initial feed mass each of the experiments was terminated at the target value of y and then the process performance metrics such as distillate flux and salt rejection were computed the distillate flux j kg m 2 hr 1 was calculated as 4 j m 3600 a m where ṁ kg s 1 is the decreasing rate of feed mass and am m2 is the effective membrane area for each set of experiments the distillate flux was calculated using the slope of the linear regression of the feed mass change over time divided by the effective membrane area at different recoveries each data point of feed mass used for flux calculation was an average of all the measurements in 10 min the electrical conductivities of the feed and the distillate were determined using a conductivity meter and conductivity cell thermo fisher scientific waltham ma which can measure the electrical conductivity as high as 200 ms cm 1 in high salinity environments the measured electrical conductivities are used to calculate the salt rejection r as 5 r 1 c d c f where cd and cf are the electrical conductivities of the distillate and feed respectively experiments were conducted in triplicate to evaluate the system behavior in terms of flux as a function of water recovery under the following range of operating conditions table 3 among all the conditions the feed mass variable had limited impact on the performance regardless of scaling each feed mass value was selected to provide the minimized duration based on experimental conditions these high crossflow velocities were chosen because they help mitigate temperature polarization and drive high fluxes 2 4 membrane characterization the membranes were examined to characterize the layers of mineral scale that developed on their surface using sem zeiss supra 40 vp carl zeiss microscopy llc ny quantitative analysis and surface elemental mapping were also carried out using eds to determine the type and species of mineral scale before imaging samples were secured on sem stubs using double sided carbon tape and sputter coated with platinum in addition an approximated membrane surface temperature profile on the distillate side was provided by the temperature data from the thermocouples on the mesh in contact with the membrane 2 5 dhvmd system energy performance the energy requirements in a typical vmd system consist of three components mericq et al 2011 thermal energy for feed evaporation the electrical energy for vacuum generation and the electrical energy for feed recirculation for the calculation of the thermal energy demands we assume that our experimental system operated with no environmental losses considering the flow cell is made up of heat insulating material the energy efficiency of an md system was evaluated using sec as a metric based on the quantities of total energy consumed and the quantity of water being treated sec kj kg 1 was defined as the amount of total energy supplied thermal energy and electrical energy in this case to produce a cumulative mass of pure water which can be calculated using miladi et al 2019 6 s c e s t e c s e e c where stec kj kg 1 is the specific thermal energy consumption which can be calculated as soomro and kim 2018 7 s t e c q h e a t 10 3 δ m δ t where δt s is the corresponding time interval between 0 and a certain recovery in specific m t represents the rate of cumulative water production as another energy performance metric the seec kj kg 1 is the specific electrical energy consumption defined as the electrical energy consumed ė kj s 1 to produce a unit mass of pure water 8 s e e c e δ m δ t the electrical energy consumption is composed of the energy needed to create vacuum on the distillate side and to circulate the feed the method used to calculate the electrical energy input ė kj s 1 is detailed in hoek et al 2021a in addition to connect the two major performance metrics i e vapor flux and specific energy consumption together the relationship between cumulative water production rate and simultaneous vapor flux can be expressed by 9 δ m δ t a m 0 δ t j d t δ t to determine the stec at a given recovery level we use the incremental sec which reflects the sec calculated using only the flux at each water recovery increment the incremental sec is defined as the sum of the incremental stec and seec 10 i n s r e m e n t a l s e c i n s r e m e n t a l s t e c i n s r e m e n t a l s e e c where the incremental stec between n recovery and m recovery n m is expressed as 11 i n s r e m e n t a l s t e c q h e a t 10 3 δ m m δ m n δ t m δ t n similarly the incremental seec is determined by 12 i n s r e m e n t a l s t e c e δ m m δ m n δ t m δ t n 2 6 module scale dhvmd model numerical simulation of an md process at a module scale provides important insights into the spatial distributions of temperature salinity and water and energy flows along the membrane deshmukh and elimelech 2017 gustafson et al 2016 lin et al 2014 ma et al 2018 in the dhvmd model used here the governing equations of momentum transport mass transport and heat transport and the property relations were coupled to generate a prediction of the conditions along the membrane surface the governing equations computational approach and validation against experimental results are detailed in the supplementary information si section s1 a major difference between traditional vmd models and the model used here is the addition of heat to the non membrane side of the feed channel and or the feedwater membrane interface using the energy carriers e g metal plates for conductive heating or electrically conducting layer for electric heating to approximate the actual conditions we discretize the membrane module in the longitudinal direction to create 10000 differential segments a single discretized section is represented by the dashed line box in the right cross section in fig 1c the first order euler method a type of finite difference method was used to translate this system of non linear differential equations to a system of linear equations that can be solved based on the inputs of influent feed conditions operational parameters channel dimensions and membrane properties see section s1 for details 3 results and discussion 3 1 heat delivery and distribution the initial feed temperature in all experiments was room temperature which was 24 0 5 c under all the experimental conditions the feed temperature rapidly increased during the initial recoveries reaching the steady state temperature at 31 5 c see section s2 heat in the dhvmd system was provided entirely by thermal conduction through the aluminum mesh and or shim temperature profiles on both the mesh and the shim are provided based on the thermocouple measurements on both the mesh and the shim section s3 based on eq 2 the total heat input rate from both the shim and mesh was determined to be 16 3 1 8 w and 21 7 2 6 w when the heat source temperatures were set to 140 c and 180 c respectively table 4 the heat input rate from the shim was more than 10 times higher than that from the mesh given the similar temperature gradient due to the shim s greater thermal conductance which was a result of the materials larger cross sectional area when the dhvmd reached steady state most heat delivered to the membrane module was used for evaporation and or to heat up the bulk feed as the heat lost to the environment was minimized by supplying and consuming heat in situ evidenced by the high thermal efficiency of dhvmd in wang et al 2021 as thermal energy carriers the shim and the mesh functioned differently in terms of driving the dhvmd process as they were placed at different locations inside the membrane module the shim is positioned on the feed channel wall opposite the membrane and provided heat to the flowing feed stream in a manner similar to the feed preheating in conventional md systems in contrast the mesh was placed under the membrane distillate side and in direct contact with the membrane and provided heat directly to the membrane feed interface in this configuration the porous mesh allows water vapor to pass through the membrane and into the distillate channel because the thermal conductivity of the water vapor is an order of magnitude smaller than that of the liquid water heat generated from the mesh is delivered primarily across the membrane to convert liquid water to vapor we neglect the effect of radiation heat transfer in the vapor chamber as its value is insignificant compared to the overall heat input rate to the mesh which is less than 8 of the overall mesh heat input rate see section s4 for details 3 2 water flux vs recovery a set of experiments that concentrated the pre treated produced water using different operating conditions conditions 1 and 2 in table 3 was performed to achieve 50 water recovery and vapor flux was measured as a function of water recovery fig 2 a over the course of the experiments from 0 to 50 recovery the flux increased up to 10 recovery and then fluctuated between 4 7 1 6 kg m 2 hr 1 and 6 3 0 2 kg m 2 hr 1 when th 140 c the flux exhibited the similar initial increase and then fluctuated between 5 0 0 4 kg m 2 hr 1 and 7 4 0 6 kg m 2 hr 1 when th 180 c fig 2a these results showed that 50 recovery could be achieved with stable flux and little scaling higher heat source temperature resulted in greater heat input rate table 4 so the system exhibited higher flux to explore system performance at higher feed salinity we evaluated higher distillate recovery and terminated the experiments when the flux dropped below 1 kg m 2 hr 1 this occurred at approximately 60 to 68 recovery fig 2b condition 3 in table 3 with th at 180 c overall the flux firstly increased from 4 4 1 2 kg m 2 hr 1 to 7 8 1 5 kg m 2 hr 1 up to 10 recovery then gradually declined from 7 8 1 5 kg m 2 hr 1 to 6 9 0 4 kg m 2 hr 1 up to about 50 recovery and after 50 recovery flux declined dramatically from 6 9 0 4 kg m 2 hr 1 to 2 3 2 0 kg m 2 hr 1 at the end of each experiment observations confirmed that a thick layer of mineral scale was formed on the membrane surface the rapid formation of minerals can block the pores through the membrane and prevent water vapor from passing into the distillate channel while scale formed through heterogeneous nucleation and growth are known to be strongly attached to the membrane surface bansal et al 2008 dong et al 2021 scale formed via homogeneous precipitation can detach relatively easily from the surface horseman et al 2020 at high recoveries the solution is super saturated with respect to multiple salt species including nacl under these conditions homogeneous precipitation of salts can occur therefore we speculate that the flux instability observed during high recoveries is due to periodic sloughing off of homogeneously formed salt crystals that deposited on the membrane and obstructed the flow of vapor but periodically sloughed off which restored flux to a certain degree with the goal of removing homogeneous precipitates a cartridge filter was used to further investigate flux behavior beyond 50 recovery condition 4 in table 3 the flux became far more stable fig 2b red data points which suggested that some homogeneous crystallization indeed occurred however we still observed a rapid flux decline as the system approached 60 recovery with the flux dropping from 4 8 0 3 kg m 2 hr 1 at 60 recovery to 0 1 0 1 kg m 2 hr 1 at about 66 recovery of all the experiments we reported salt rejection 99 9 despite the rapid flux decline brought about by membrane scaling no change in salt rejection was observed since membrane wetting often accompanies scaling we expect that prolonged operation under these heavy scaled conditions would eventually lead to membrane wetting we modeled the dhvmd process using the experimental parameters as inputs and found the average tp and cp defined in eqs s25 and s32 to be 0 15 and 1 32 respectively those factors were used to compute the membrane surface temperature and salinity based on the bulk feed temperature section 3 1 and salinity table 2 we then determined that nacl exceeded its saturation indices at 60 recovery fig 2c which corresponded to the rapid onset of flux decline in addition srso4 caso4 and caso4 2h2o were already saturated below 50 recovery but because the concentrations of sr and ca were relatively low the formation of these crystals did not have a dramatic impact on system performance but perhaps played a role in the gradual flux decline from 10 to 50 recovery previous literature suggests rapid crystal growth by supersaturated nacl and slower growth for caso4 and srso4 kiefer et al 2019 since increased salinity leads to reduced vapor pressure and flux decline we calculated the contribution of the increased salinity on system performance when water recovery ranged between 10 and 50 and found that it only contributed 0 3 therefore sr and ca scaling had a more significant contribution to flux decline compared to the reduced vapor pressure sem micrographs and eds analysis of pristine md membranes and those used in experiments are shown in fig 3 both sem micrographs and eds data showed that there was limited inorganic fouling when water recovery was below 50 fig 3a b the lack of crystals on the membrane surface when recovery reached 50 was in line with the stable flux observed when recovery was below this level figs 2 and 3 in addition srso4 crystals were not observed despite the fact that the saturation indices of both salts suggested that precipitation should take place however at 68 recovery the membrane was covered by a large number of crystals of varying morphology including needle like likely caso4 and srso4 and cubic crystals likely nacl fig 3c d eds analysis of these images revealed the presence of na cl sr ca s and o confirming the formation of nacl srso4 caso4 species a detailed eds mapping analysis of the membrane surface can be found in the si fig s4 overall the characterization results from both the sem and eds together with the oli simulations suggested that the precipitation of nacl predominantly caused the flux decline at recovery above 50 3 3 specific energy consumption vs recovery the sec stec and seec as a function of the recovery were calculated to quantify the system energy performance in the lab scale system without any heat recovery the secs of desalination were consistent with previously reported energy consumption values wang et al 2021 which demonstrated that the dhvmd system had a lower sec than other md technologies overall the stec is the larger component of the sec while the seec makes up only a small part of the sec with the stec being markedly higher than the seec by 2 3 orders of magnitude fig 4 therefore the sec analysis is focused primarily on the stec under all conditions tested the stec decreased and eventually reached a steady state as the recovery increased these stec values at the starting point e g 0 and 50 recovery are artificially high due to a low flux not reaching steady state thus we focused our discussion on these steady state conditions fig 4a b presents the sec stec seec as a function of water recovery from 0 to 50 with different heat source temperatures conditions 1 and 2 in table 3 based on eq 9 we determine the decrease of vapor flux can causes the decrease of cumulative water production rate as a result it increases the stec eq 7 for the starting point 0 recovery the flux was low and did not reach steady state and therefore a high stec was presented when recovery ranged between 10 and 50 under these conditions scaling was limited the flux was relatively stable and the stec was steady fig 4a b when th 140 c and water recovery increased from 10 to 50 the stec decreased from 2720 158 kj kg 1 to 2530 81 kj kg 1 when th increased to 180 c the system had a higher stec with the stec between 10 and 50 recovery ranging between 3068 140 kj kg 1 and 2897 123 kj kg 1 fig 4b the increase in stec was because the increased cumulative water production rate which increased with increasing heat input rate was smaller than the increased heat input rate at the higher temperature i e the heating was less efficient eq 7 to investigate the impact of scaling on system energy performance fig 4c d plots the sec stec seec as a function of water recovery above 50 where membrane scaling was observed and the membrane experienced rapid flux decline conditions 3 and 4 in table 3 beyond 50 recovery the stec values kept increasing from 3231 311 kj kg 1 to 3449 243 kj kg 1 under condition 3 due to a dramatic flux decline fig 4c in contrast under condition 4 the stec values remained stable from 3861 255 kj kg 1 to 3472 80 kj kg 1 until 60 recovery was reached however at 60 recovery the stec began increasing from 3472 80 kj kg 1 to 3868 212 kj kg 1 due to the flux decline fig 4d the flux decline decreased the cumulative water production rate and thus increased stec because the system had a high stable flux for a relatively long time before flux decline the stec did not have a marked increase fig 4c d to account for the impact of flux at individual recovery levels we show the incremental stec defined in eqs 10 12 on the right y axes of fig 4 as a function of water recovery the incremental sec values are similar to the cumulative sec values in that they are dominated by the stec at tall increments for the starting points of each condition 0 recovery for fig 4a b c and 50 recovery for fig 4d the system did not reach steady state and had an artificially low flux which resulted in inflated incremental stec values once the system reached steady state recovery 10 or 50 the incremental stec and seec values were stable fig 4a b when the recovery was increased beyond 50 scale formation gradually took place and vapor flux decreased which caused the incremental stec values to increase from 3413 353 kj kg 1 at 10 recovery to 3906 1027 kj kg 1 at 60 recovery fig 4c when the flux was unstable beyond 60 recovery under condition 3 the incremental stec values reflected this instability under condition 4 that exhibited more stable flux at high recovery 60 the incremental stec showed a steady increase as the flux dropped beyond 60 recovery specifically from 60 to 65 recovery the flux dropped 35 and the incremental stec increased from 3547 246 kj kg 1 to 5279 1843 kj kg 1 a 49 increase fig 4d the stec is negatively impacted by scaling as shown in fig 4 the formation of mineral scale blocked the vapor flow through the membrane resulting in lower cumulative water production rate and higher stec values with scale formation that prevents feed from evaporating the supplied heat was primarily used to heat up the bulk feedwater in the feed channel based on the heat distribution shown in section 3 1 the increased feed temperature could decrease the solubility of mineral species such as caso4 and srso4 which further affect the stec performance therefore to achieve good stec performance it is necessary to prevent scale formation while targeting maximum water recovery the maximum water recovery without scale formation should be determined based on the saturation indices and vapor flux in this study the saturation index of largest salt species nacl reached 1 and the vapor flux decreased to 6 kg m 2 hr 1 average vapor flux both at 60 recovery therefore it should be about 60 this recovery value was consistent with the water recovery values for high salinity brine reported in the previous literature greenlee et al 2009 hoek et al 2021a for example fresh and brackish water 25000 ppm tds desalination has a typical recovery from 50 to 90 while seawater and brine 25000 ppm tds has a typical water recovery from 30 to 60 3 4 dhvmd process modeling our experimental results demonstrated the feasibility of a lab scale dhvmd process for concentrating real pre treated o g produced water to explore potential performance of a dhvmd process we simulate a medium scale module using the process model which is already validated against lab scale experimental data section s1 the simulation captures temperature salinity water transport and energy flows during the steady state operation of a single pass dhvmd system operating conditions module dimensions feed solution properties and membrane properties of this medium scale module used in the simulation are described in the si table s1 we compare the performance of a standard vmd process i e no heat addition to either membrane surface or feed channel to the dhvmd process with the addition rate of 3600 w of heat to the membrane surface 3600 w of heat to the feed channel or 1800 w of heat to the membrane surface and 1800 w heat the feed channel in both cases the initial feed temperature was 60 c as two overarching performance metrics the single pass water recovery is increased by all the direct heat deliveries while the stec is only increased by membrane surface heating and hybrid heating with heat both to membrane surface and to feed channel and almost not increased by feed channel heating surface heated vmd has the highest single pass water recovery and lowest stec among all simulated conditions representing a 48 3 increase in water recovery and a 16 4 decrease in stec compared to standard vmd fig 5 a the water recovery is the highest because of the highest water flux eq s36 the lowest stec is a result of the lowest heat loss along the membrane module per unit of water production eq s37 in comparison feed channel heating yields nearly no reduction an 1 9 decrease in stec this is because feed channel heating behaves similarly to bulk heating of the feed i e similar to standard vmd and does not improve the energy efficiency as a result it only increases the single pass water recovery albeit to the least degree 26 3 a result of tp a combination of membrane surface heating and feed channel heating i e hybrid heating exhibits an intermediate performance in terms of water recovery and stec membrane surface heating has the highest positive impact on water flux with the highest flux associated with the highest membrane surface temperature eqs s33 s35 as adding heat to membrane surface reduces the heat loss brought about by vaporization fig 5b this is also reflected in the lowest heat flux from the feed stream i e heat loss normalized by membrane area defined in eq s17 which is minimized by membrane surface heating eq s18 in comparison hybrid heating has a lower impact on the vapor flux while feed channel heating increases the flux the least with higher bulk feed heat losses compared to membrane surface heating due to a higher bulk feed temperature eq s20 while all the methods of direct heating increase the temperatures of the membrane surface and bulk feed compared to no direct heating the membrane surface temperature is the highest and bulk feed temperature is the lowest with membrane surface heating fig 5c the bulk feed temperature was increased by the retained sensible heat from the reduced heat loss also the greatest reduction in tp is achieved by membrane surface heating fig 5d not surprisingly feed channel heating is the most effective at increasing the bulk feed temperature followed by hybrid heating however feed channel heating as well as hybrid heating have a lower membrane surface temperature compared to the bulk heating in traditional vmd as a result feed channel heating and hybrid heating exhibit a more severe temperature polarization higher tp the longitudinal profiles of bulk feed salinity and the salinity of the feed along the membrane surface are shown in fig 5e compared to the case with no heat addition the interface salinity is most significantly increased by membrane surface heating followed by hybrid heating and feed channel heating this is due to the fact that membrane surface heating provides the highest flux which leads to more water leaving the interface and higher residual salinity in contrast the bulk feed salinity is not dramatically impacted under any direct heating conditions fig 5f presents the longitudinal cp profile for the module which shows membrane surface heating increases the concentration polarization to a greater extent compared to that brought about by hybrid heating and feed channel heating as the cp is a strong function of vapor flux eq s32 water recovery can also be further increased under more optimized conditions for heat and mass transfer such as longer channel length lower cross flow velocity higher feed temperature stronger vacuum lower cross flow velocity and higher membrane permeability table s2 however in a single pass md it is hard to achieve a water recovery needed for brine concentration as shown in the previous reports lin et al 2014 therefore the dhvmd system requires a single stage batch or semi batch configuration our experimental system or a multi staged single pass configuration bartholomew et al 2020 dudchenko et al 2021 mulder 2012 to achieve a high total water recovery and concentrate the feed up to 310 g l 1 tds to maximize energy efficiency and achieve high gor values heat recycling is critical in all thermal desalination systems dhvmd will be no exception the minimum work of separation in thermal desalination is the latent heat of vaporization of water which is 2260 kj kg 1 deshmukh et al 2018 this is far higher than the energy needed for pressure driven desalination processes e g seawater ro is about 8 to 12 kj kg 1 thermal desalination technologies including md consequently use heat exchangers to recover the latent heat of condensation and lower their overall energy consumption bartholomew et al 2020 chung et al 2016 dudchenko et al 2021 large scale thermal desalination processes have gor values between 10 and 20 with actual stecs as low as 8 3 kj kg 1 al karaghouli and kazmerski 2013 ihm et al 2016 it should be noted that even if a gor of 20 is assumed at 2260 kj kg 1 the practically achievable minimum work of separation for a thermal process is 113 kj kg 1 which is an order of magnitude higher than a seawater ro unit including irreversible losses hence thermal desalination makes sense in two scenarios 1 when oil and gas are extraordinarily cheap and the steam generated by a steam electric cogeneration power plant can be used to drive the desalination process as in the middle east or 2 when the osmotic pressure of a hypersaline water exceeds the pressure limits of commercially available ro membranes and or process equipment 4 conclusion we developed a bench scale batch dhvmd system to desalinate a real pre treated o g produced water with an initial tds concentration of 115500 mg l 1 tds we achieved a maximum of 66 water recovery at an average water flux 6 kg m 2 hr 1 an overall salt rejection 99 9 and a single stage sec as low as 2530 kj kg 1 703 kwh m 3 the concentrated brine had a tds concentration high enough to achieve nacl saturation which is often a target in brine concentration processes with the goal of minimum liquid discharge in addition to experimental efforts we modeled temperature salinity water transport and energy flows in a medium scale dhvmd module the results suggest that an addition rate of 3600 w of thermal energy to the feedwater membrane interface increases water recovery by 48 3 and decreases the stec by 16 4 in a single pass the dhvmd process demonstrated herein shows promise for eventual scale up in the desalination of high salinity pre treated o g produced water and other hyper saline waters the challenges associated with scale up are as follows the flux needs to be higher in order to reduce capital costs specifically the cost of membranes and module a solution is to preheat the feed to normal md operating temperatures 60 80 c to provide the bulk driving force the direct heat input can be used to minimize the temperature polarization increase recovery and improve the energy efficiency in addition the latent heat of vaporization should be recovered to reach high gors and lower operational costs a potential method to achieve this is to use a multistage vmd system and use the wall of next stage to condense the vapor from the previous stage a typical scale up example is the memsys multi effect

15987,membrane distillation md is an emerging thermal desalination technology capable of desalinating waters of any salinity during typical md processes the saline feedwater is heated and acts as the thermal energy carrier however temperature polarization as well as thermal energy loss contributes to low distillate fluxes low single pass water recovery and poor thermal efficiency an alternative approach is to integrate an extra thermal energy carrier as part of the membrane and or module assembly which can channel externally provided heat directly to the membrane feedwater interface and or along the feed channel length this direct heat delivery has been demonstrated to increase single pass water recovery and enhance the overall thermal efficiency we developed a bench scale direct heated vacuum md dhvmd process to desalinate pre treated oil and gas produced water with an initial total dissolved solids of 115 500 ppm at a feed temperature ranging between 24 and 32 c we evaluated both water flux and specific energy consumption sec as a function of water recovery the system achieved a 50 water recovery without significant scaling with an average flux 6 kg m 2 hr 1 and a sec as low as 2 530 kj kg 1 the major species of mineral scales i e nacl caso4 and srso4 that limited the water recovery to 68 were modeled in terms of thermodynamics and identified by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy in addition we further developed and employed a physics based process model to estimate temperature salinity water transport and energy flows for full scale vacuum md and dhvmd modules model results show that a direct heat input rate of 3 600 w can increase single pass water recovery from 2 1 to 3 1 while lowering the thermal sec from 7 800 kj kg 1 to 6 517 kj kg 1 in an unoptimized module finally the scaling up potential of dhvmd process is briefly discussed graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane distillation hyper

membrane distillation is a thermally driven evaporation desalination process through porous hydrophobic membranes one advantage of membrane distillation md is that water flux and energy demand are relatively insensitive to tds concentration whereas for pressure driven desalination processes like reverse osmosis ro the water flux salt rejection and energy demand are directly impacted by tds concentration furthermore ro is limited to the desalination of saline water up to 80 g l 1 tds whereas md or hybrid md integrated with other membrane processes e g forward osmosis is capable of treating hyper saline brines deshmukh et al 2018 nawaz et al 2021 another advantage of md is the high surface area to volume ratio of a membrane module which can lower capital costs compared to conventional thermal desalination processes particularly for small applications of less than 500 m3 day 1 100 gal min 1 deshmukh et al 2018 in conventional md the feed is preheated before entering the membrane module to provide the driving force for vapor transport which is a partial pressure difference between the feed side and the distillate side of the membrane during operation the water vapor leaving the feed at the feed membrane interface contains the latent heat of evaporation that crosses with the vapor into the distillate side of the membrane which results in a lower temperature at the feedwater membrane interface a phenomenon called temperature polarization the presence of temperature polarization decreases the driving force for evaporation across the membrane by lowering the temperature and therefore partial vapor pressure of the feed stream heat is also lost through conduction across the membranes and across the boundaries of the membrane element and other components of the system therefore a thermodynamic limit to water recovery 10 in a single pass md process is expected for standard operating conditions bartholomew et al 2020 gilron et al 2007 lin et al 2014 delivering heat directly to the feed channel and or the membrane surface could minimize temperature polarization in a directly heated vacuum md dhvmd system and thereby increase single pass water

also be delivered to the bulk feed and the feedwater membrane interface through conductive transfer of externally supplied heat via thermally conducting materials e g metal plates and meshes incorporated into the membrane module in a recent study wang et al 2021 a vacuum md vmd process with direct heat input rate was evaluated in 2 hr long tests using hypersaline feed water containing 100 g l 1 nacl under varying operating conditions the process resulted in water flux as high as 9 kg m 2 hr 1 and high thermal efficiency especially with surface heating only details of previous direct heat md studies are summarized in table 1 where only a few studies used high salinity nacl solutions and no study used real hypersaline wastewater in this study we evaluate the performance of dhvmd applied to desalination of a hyper saline pre treated produced water for which the water recovery was limited by mineral scale formation we identify the principal mineral scale forming species via thermodynamic modeling scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds we also report the sec as a function of water recovery in the lab scale dhvmd module in addition we perform full scale simulations to compare the performance of a standard vmd and dhvmd modules in desalinating a hyper saline brine through the model we explore the impacts of direct heating on temperature and concentration polarization water flux heat flux water recovery and thermal sec finally we have a brief discussion on the potential of scaling up dhvmd to achieve high water recovery and high gained output ratio gor values 2 materials and methods 2 1 md membrane and thermally conducting materials the membranes used for dhvmd are hydrophobic polypropylene pp membranes 3 m charlotte nc with an average thickness of 100 µm an average pore size of 0 2 µm a porosity of 70 and a contact angle of 122 4 0 1 we consider two types of thermally conductive layers the first is a thin aluminum sheet shim placed on the feed channel wall opposite the membrane as shown in fig 1 a c the second is an aluminum mesh that is in direct contact with the membrane in the distillate channel mcmaster carr los angeles ca also as sketched in fig 1c the aluminum shim had a thickness of 250 µm and the aluminum mesh had a mesh size of 120 120 109 µm opening size a thickness of 203 µm and a 27 open area the membrane coupon aluminum shim piece and aluminum mesh piece were cut from flat sheets obtained from the manufacturers and used directly without further modification 2 2 feed characterization and preparation the experiments used pre treated high salinity produced water as feed the water was effluent from a membrane bioreactor mbr used to treat the water with the raw feed to the mbr collected from o g extraction wells in the permian basin the main water quality characteristics of the pre treated produced water are listed in table 2 inorganic species with the highest concentration were found to be na and cl which were at least 10 times higher than any other inorganic constituents in addition to inorganic constituents the pre treated produced water had low levels of dissolved organic carbon doc because the majority of organics contaminates were removed during the mbr process based on the water quality information we used the oli stream analyzer oli systems inc cedar knolls nj to quantify the thermodynamic tendency of salt precipitation using the unitless saturation index the saturation index of inorganic species c x a y was calculated using eq 1 1 s i a c x a a y k s p c x a y where a c is the activity of cation c a a is the activity of anion a and k s p c x a y is the solubility product of c x a y the indices for cation activity and anion activity follow the stoichiometry of the inorganic salt when si exceeds 1 the solution is supersaturated with respect to the particular mineral and precipitation will take place spontaneously the oli simulations were performed using estimates for the salinity and temperature at the membrane surface the membrane surface salinity and temperature were approximated using the concentration polarization factor cp and the temperature polarization factor tp predicted by the full scale process model see details in section 2 6 the membrane surface salinity and temperature were determined as the product of the bulk feed salinity and cp coefficient similarly the surface temperature was the product of the bulk feed temperature and tp coefficient the thermodynamics modeling provides an estimate of salt precipitation tendency at the membrane interface the pre treated produced water used for the experiments was either used directly or pre concentrated by 50 using a rotary vacuum evaporator thermo fisher scientific waltham ma no noticeable crystallization of inorganic salts was observed during pre concentration in terms of the evaporator s operating conditions the water bath temperature was set to 55 c the vacuum was provided by a whole house vacuum system located in the ucla engineering building approximately 0 8 bar absolute pressure and the rotational speed was set to 180 rpm 2 3 dhvmd experiments fig 1a shows a flow diagram of the batch dhvmd system used to desalinate the pre treated produced water flux measurements were performed by measuring changes in the mass of the feed tank holding the pre treated produced water ohaus model number px2202 parsippany nj feed mass measurements were performed every 5 s the feed was circulated through the membrane module using a peristaltic pump cole parmer vernon hills il or a gear pump greylor cape coral fl both of which have speed flow control a cartridge filter with a 1 μm pore size hydronix chino hills ca in the recirculation line after the outlet of the membrane module was used in the experiments where the pre concentrated pre treated produced water was further treated this filter was used to capture any precipitates formed from homogeneous nucleation in the feed tank zhang et al 2015 temperature sensors vktech shenzhen china were placed in the inlet and outlet of the flow cell to monitor the feed temperature in real time the temperature sensors were controlled via an arduino microcontroller the flow cell was constructed of polyether ether ketone peek a polymer known for its ability to withstand high temperatures the length width and height of the flow channel were 10 cm 4 cm and 4 mm or 3 mm respectively the shim membrane and mesh were stacked together from feed side to distillate side type k thermocouples awg 24 minnesota measurement instruments llc minnesota mn were mounted to the surfaces of the mesh and the shim by kapton tape mcmaster carr los angeles ca to measure the temperature at different points on the shim and the mesh as previously detailed in wang et al 2021 specifically inside the module 10 mesh thermocouples and 6 shim thermocouples were placed in symmetry on the left side and right side of the channel length thermocouples of each side are placed at 1 cm intervals towards the o ring mcmaster carr los angeles ca during cross flow operation room temperature feed was pumped into the membrane module and evaporation took place at the feedwater membrane interface a vacuum pump jb industries model number dv 85 n aurora il was used to induce vacuum on the distillate side to drive water vapor transport across the membrane the vacuum was set at 0 01 bar absolute pressure as measured by an external vacuum pressure gage mcmaster carr los angeles ca the vapor produced by the cell and passed to a condenser chemglass life sciences vineland nj in which the coolant 50 wt ethylene glycol at 0 c was recirculated using a refrigerated bath circulator thermo fisher scientific waltham ma the distillate was then collected in a flask the coupling of the thermal energy supply to the shim and mesh is illustrated in fig 1b a cartridge heater with an internal temperature sensor mcmaster carr los angeles ca provided the thermal energy the heating temperature was regulated by a thermostat inkbird shenzhen china in this setup flat sheet thermal carriers both the mesh and the shim were wrapped around a cartridge heater to funnel the externally provided heat to the membrane water interface mesh or into the feed channel itself shim detailed arrangement of feed streams membrane materials and module and both heat and water flows inside the module is presented in fig 1c rate of heat flow to the membrane surface or feed channel delivered through the thermally conducting layers q heat w was estimated by wang et al 2021 2 q h e a t k e f f a δ t δ x where keff w m 1 k 1 is the thermal conductivity of the thermally conducting layer a m2 is the cross sectional area of the thermally conducting layer and δt k and δx m are the temperature difference and the distance between two specified points on the thermally conducting layer along the direction of heat transfer respectively to explore the impact of water recovery on performance the system was operated in a recirculating mode that constantly recirculated feed through the module while the distillate was not returned to the feed tank which allowed the concentrations of rejected constituents to increase over time water recovery in md is typically defined as the percentage of the feed that becomes distillate in this lab scale md system the water recovery y was defined from 3 y δ m m where δm kg is the cumulative water production represented by the reduction in feed mass between 0 and certain recovery and m kg is the initial feed mass each of the experiments was terminated at the target value of y and then the process performance metrics such as distillate flux and salt rejection were computed the distillate flux j kg m 2 hr 1 was calculated as 4 j m 3600 a m where ṁ kg s 1 is the decreasing rate of feed mass and am m2 is the effective membrane area for each set of experiments the distillate flux was calculated using the slope of the linear regression of the feed mass change over time divided by the effective membrane area at different recoveries each data point of feed mass used for flux calculation was an average of all the measurements in 10 min the electrical conductivities of the feed and the distillate were determined using a conductivity meter and conductivity cell thermo fisher scientific waltham ma which can measure the electrical conductivity as high as 200 ms cm 1 in high salinity environments the measured electrical conductivities are used to calculate the salt rejection r as 5 r 1 c d c f where cd and cf are the electrical conductivities of the distillate and feed respectively experiments were conducted in triplicate to evaluate the system behavior in terms of flux as a function of water recovery under the following range of operating conditions table 3 among all the conditions the feed mass variable had limited impact on the performance regardless of scaling each feed mass value was selected to provide the minimized duration based on experimental conditions these high crossflow velocities were chosen because they help mitigate temperature polarization and drive high fluxes 2 4 membrane characterization the membranes were examined to characterize the layers of mineral scale that developed on their surface using sem zeiss supra 40 vp carl zeiss microscopy llc ny quantitative analysis and surface elemental mapping were also carried out using eds to determine the type and species of mineral scale before imaging samples were secured on sem stubs using double sided carbon tape and sputter coated with platinum in addition an approximated membrane surface temperature profile on the distillate side was provided by the temperature data from the thermocouples on the mesh in contact with the membrane 2 5 dhvmd system energy performance the energy requirements in a typical vmd system consist of three components mericq et al 2011 thermal energy for feed evaporation the electrical energy for vacuum generation and the electrical energy for feed recirculation for the calculation of the thermal energy demands we assume that our experimental system operated with no environmental losses considering the flow cell is made up of heat insulating material the energy efficiency of an md system was evaluated using sec as a metric based on the quantities of total energy consumed and the quantity of water being treated sec kj kg 1 was defined as the amount of total energy supplied thermal energy and electrical energy in this case to produce a cumulative mass of pure water which can be calculated using miladi et al 2019 6 s c e s t e c s e e c where stec kj kg 1 is the specific thermal energy consumption which can be calculated as soomro and kim 2018 7 s t e c q h e a t 10 3 δ m δ t where δt s is the corresponding time interval between 0 and a certain recovery in specific m t represents the rate of cumulative water production as another energy performance metric the seec kj kg 1 is the specific electrical energy consumption defined as the electrical energy consumed ė kj s 1 to produce a unit mass of pure water 8 s e e c e δ m δ t the electrical energy consumption is composed of the energy needed to create vacuum on the distillate side and to circulate the feed the method used to calculate the electrical energy input ė kj s 1 is detailed in hoek et al 2021a in addition to connect the two major performance metrics i e vapor flux and specific energy consumption together the relationship between cumulative water production rate and simultaneous vapor flux can be expressed by 9 δ m δ t a m 0 δ t j d t δ t to determine the stec at a given recovery level we use the incremental sec which reflects the sec calculated using only the flux at each water recovery increment the incremental sec is defined as the sum of the incremental stec and seec 10 i n s r e m e n t a l s e c i n s r e m e n t a l s t e c i n s r e m e n t a l s e e c where the incremental stec between n recovery and m recovery n m is expressed as 11 i n s r e m e n t a l s t e c q h e a t 10 3 δ m m δ m n δ t m δ t n similarly the incremental seec is determined by 12 i n s r e m e n t a l s t e c e δ m m δ m n δ t m δ t n 2 6 module scale dhvmd model numerical simulation of an md process at a module scale provides important insights into the spatial distributions of temperature salinity and water and energy flows along the membrane deshmukh and elimelech 2017 gustafson et al 2016 lin et al 2014 ma et al 2018 in the dhvmd model used here the governing equations of momentum transport mass transport and heat transport and the property relations were coupled to generate a prediction of the conditions along the membrane surface the governing equations computational approach and validation against experimental results are detailed in the supplementary information si section s1 a major difference between traditional vmd models and the model used here is the addition of heat to the non membrane side of the feed channel and or the feedwater membrane interface using the energy carriers e g metal plates for conductive heating or electrically conducting layer for electric heating to approximate the actual conditions we discretize the membrane module in the longitudinal direction to create 10000 differential segments a single discretized section is represented by the dashed line box in the right cross section in fig 1c the first order euler method a type of finite difference method was used to translate this system of non linear differential equations to a system of linear equations that can be solved based on the inputs of influent feed conditions operational parameters channel dimensions and membrane properties see section s1 for details 3 results and discussion 3 1 heat delivery and distribution the initial feed temperature in all experiments was room temperature which was 24 0 5 c under all the experimental conditions the feed temperature rapidly increased during the initial recoveries reaching the steady state temperature at 31 5 c see section s2 heat in the dhvmd system was provided entirely by thermal conduction through the aluminum mesh and or shim temperature profiles on both the mesh and the shim are provided based on the thermocouple measurements on both the mesh and the shim section s3 based on eq 2 the total heat input rate from both the shim and mesh was determined to be 16 3 1 8 w and 21 7 2 6 w when the heat source temperatures were set to 140 c and 180 c respectively table 4 the heat input rate from the shim was more than 10 times higher than that from the mesh given the similar temperature gradient due to the shim s greater thermal conductance which was a result of the materials larger cross sectional area when the dhvmd reached steady state most heat delivered to the membrane module was used for evaporation and or to heat up the bulk feed as the heat lost to the environment was minimized by supplying and consuming heat in situ evidenced by the high thermal efficiency of dhvmd in wang et al 2021 as thermal energy carriers the shim and the mesh functioned differently in terms of driving the dhvmd process as they were placed at different locations inside the membrane module the shim is positioned on the feed channel wall opposite the membrane and provided heat to the flowing feed stream in a manner similar to the feed preheating in conventional md systems in contrast the mesh was placed under the membrane distillate side and in direct contact with the membrane and provided heat directly to the membrane feed interface in this configuration the porous mesh allows water vapor to pass through the membrane and into the distillate channel because the thermal conductivity of the water vapor is an order of magnitude smaller than that of the liquid water heat generated from the mesh is delivered primarily across the membrane to convert liquid water to vapor we neglect the effect of radiation heat transfer in the vapor chamber as its value is insignificant compared to the overall heat input rate to the mesh which is less than 8 of the overall mesh heat input rate see section s4 for details 3 2 water flux vs recovery a set of experiments that concentrated the pre treated produced water using different operating conditions conditions 1 and 2 in table 3 was performed to achieve 50 water recovery and vapor flux was measured as a function of water recovery fig 2 a over the course of the experiments from 0 to 50 recovery the flux increased up to 10 recovery and then fluctuated between 4 7 1 6 kg m 2 hr 1 and 6 3 0 2 kg m 2 hr 1 when th 140 c the flux exhibited the similar initial increase and then fluctuated between 5 0 0 4 kg m 2 hr 1 and 7 4 0 6 kg m 2 hr 1 when th 180 c fig 2a these results showed that 50 recovery could be achieved with stable flux and little scaling higher heat source temperature resulted in greater heat input rate table 4 so the system exhibited higher flux to explore system performance at higher feed salinity we evaluated higher distillate recovery and terminated the experiments when the flux dropped below 1 kg m 2 hr 1 this occurred at approximately 60 to 68 recovery fig 2b condition 3 in table 3 with th at 180 c overall the flux firstly increased from 4 4 1 2 kg m 2 hr 1 to 7 8 1 5 kg m 2 hr 1 up to 10 recovery then gradually declined from 7 8 1 5 kg m 2 hr 1 to 6 9 0 4 kg m 2 hr 1 up to about 50 recovery and after 50 recovery flux declined dramatically from 6 9 0 4 kg m 2 hr 1 to 2 3 2 0 kg m 2 hr 1 at the end of each experiment observations confirmed that a thick layer of mineral scale was formed on the membrane surface the rapid formation of minerals can block the pores through the membrane and prevent water vapor from passing into the distillate channel while scale formed through heterogeneous nucleation and growth are known to be strongly attached to the membrane surface bansal et al 2008 dong et al 2021 scale formed via homogeneous precipitation can detach relatively easily from the surface horseman et al 2020 at high recoveries the solution is super saturated with respect to multiple salt species including nacl under these conditions homogeneous precipitation of salts can occur therefore we speculate that the flux instability observed during high recoveries is due to periodic sloughing off of homogeneously formed salt crystals that deposited on the membrane and obstructed the flow of vapor but periodically sloughed off which restored flux to a certain degree with the goal of removing homogeneous precipitates a cartridge filter was used to further investigate flux behavior beyond 50 recovery condition 4 in table 3 the flux became far more stable fig 2b red data points which suggested that some homogeneous crystallization indeed occurred however we still observed a rapid flux decline as the system approached 60 recovery with the flux dropping from 4 8 0 3 kg m 2 hr 1 at 60 recovery to 0 1 0 1 kg m 2 hr 1 at about 66 recovery of all the experiments we reported salt rejection 99 9 despite the rapid flux decline brought about by membrane scaling no change in salt rejection was observed since membrane wetting often accompanies scaling we expect that prolonged operation under these heavy scaled conditions would eventually lead to membrane wetting we modeled the dhvmd process using the experimental parameters as inputs and found the average tp and cp defined in eqs s25 and s32 to be 0 15 and 1 32 respectively those factors were used to compute the membrane surface temperature and salinity based on the bulk feed temperature section 3 1 and salinity table 2 we then determined that nacl exceeded its saturation indices at 60 recovery fig 2c which corresponded to the rapid onset of flux decline in addition srso4 caso4 and caso4 2h2o were already saturated below 50 recovery but because the concentrations of sr and ca were relatively low the formation of these crystals did not have a dramatic impact on system performance but perhaps played a role in the gradual flux decline from 10 to 50 recovery previous literature suggests rapid crystal growth by supersaturated nacl and slower growth for caso4 and srso4 kiefer et al 2019 since increased salinity leads to reduced vapor pressure and flux decline we calculated the contribution of the increased salinity on system performance when water recovery ranged between 10 and 50 and found that it only contributed 0 3 therefore sr and ca scaling had a more significant contribution to flux decline compared to the reduced vapor pressure sem micrographs and eds analysis of pristine md membranes and those used in experiments are shown in fig 3 both sem micrographs and eds data showed that there was limited inorganic fouling when water recovery was below 50 fig 3a b the lack of crystals on the membrane surface when recovery reached 50 was in line with the stable flux observed when recovery was below this level figs 2 and 3 in addition srso4 crystals were not observed despite the fact that the saturation indices of both salts suggested that precipitation should take place however at 68 recovery the membrane was covered by a large number of crystals of varying morphology including needle like likely caso4 and srso4 and cubic crystals likely nacl fig 3c d eds analysis of these images revealed the presence of na cl sr ca s and o confirming the formation of nacl srso4 caso4 species a detailed eds mapping analysis of the membrane surface can be found in the si fig s4 overall the characterization results from both the sem and eds together with the oli simulations suggested that the precipitation of nacl predominantly caused the flux decline at recovery above 50 3 3 specific energy consumption vs recovery the sec stec and seec as a function of the recovery were calculated to quantify the system energy performance in the lab scale system without any heat recovery the secs of desalination were consistent with previously reported energy consumption values wang et al 2021 which demonstrated that the dhvmd system had a lower sec than other md technologies overall the stec is the larger component of the sec while the seec makes up only a small part of the sec with the stec being markedly higher than the seec by 2 3 orders of magnitude fig 4 therefore the sec analysis is focused primarily on the stec under all conditions tested the stec decreased and eventually reached a steady state as the recovery increased these stec values at the starting point e g 0 and 50 recovery are artificially high due to a low flux not reaching steady state thus we focused our discussion on these steady state conditions fig 4a b presents the sec stec seec as a function of water recovery from 0 to 50 with different heat source temperatures conditions 1 and 2 in table 3 based on eq 9 we determine the decrease of vapor flux can causes the decrease of cumulative water production rate as a result it increases the stec eq 7 for the starting point 0 recovery the flux was low and did not reach steady state and therefore a high stec was presented when recovery ranged between 10 and 50 under these conditions scaling was limited the flux was relatively stable and the stec was steady fig 4a b when th 140 c and water recovery increased from 10 to 50 the stec decreased from 2720 158 kj kg 1 to 2530 81 kj kg 1 when th increased to 180 c the system had a higher stec with the stec between 10 and 50 recovery ranging between 3068 140 kj kg 1 and 2897 123 kj kg 1 fig 4b the increase in stec was because the increased cumulative water production rate which increased with increasing heat input rate was smaller than the increased heat input rate at the higher temperature i e the heating was less efficient eq 7 to investigate the impact of scaling on system energy performance fig 4c d plots the sec stec seec as a function of water recovery above 50 where membrane scaling was observed and the membrane experienced rapid flux decline conditions 3 and 4 in table 3 beyond 50 recovery the stec values kept increasing from 3231 311 kj kg 1 to 3449 243 kj kg 1 under condition 3 due to a dramatic flux decline fig 4c in contrast under condition 4 the stec values remained stable from 3861 255 kj kg 1 to 3472 80 kj kg 1 until 60 recovery was reached however at 60 recovery the stec began increasing from 3472 80 kj kg 1 to 3868 212 kj kg 1 due to the flux decline fig 4d the flux decline decreased the cumulative water production rate and thus increased stec because the system had a high stable flux for a relatively long time before flux decline the stec did not have a marked increase fig 4c d to account for the impact of flux at individual recovery levels we show the incremental stec defined in eqs 10 12 on the right y axes of fig 4 as a function of water recovery the incremental sec values are similar to the cumulative sec values in that they are dominated by the stec at tall increments for the starting points of each condition 0 recovery for fig 4a b c and 50 recovery for fig 4d the system did not reach steady state and had an artificially low flux which resulted in inflated incremental stec values once the system reached steady state recovery 10 or 50 the incremental stec and seec values were stable fig 4a b when the recovery was increased beyond 50 scale formation gradually took place and vapor flux decreased which caused the incremental stec values to increase from 3413 353 kj kg 1 at 10 recovery to 3906 1027 kj kg 1 at 60 recovery fig 4c when the flux was unstable beyond 60 recovery under condition 3 the incremental stec values reflected this instability under condition 4 that exhibited more stable flux at high recovery 60 the incremental stec showed a steady increase as the flux dropped beyond 60 recovery specifically from 60 to 65 recovery the flux dropped 35 and the incremental stec increased from 3547 246 kj kg 1 to 5279 1843 kj kg 1 a 49 increase fig 4d the stec is negatively impacted by scaling as shown in fig 4 the formation of mineral scale blocked the vapor flow through the membrane resulting in lower cumulative water production rate and higher stec values with scale formation that prevents feed from evaporating the supplied heat was primarily used to heat up the bulk feedwater in the feed channel based on the heat distribution shown in section 3 1 the increased feed temperature could decrease the solubility of mineral species such as caso4 and srso4 which further affect the stec performance therefore to achieve good stec performance it is necessary to prevent scale formation while targeting maximum water recovery the maximum water recovery without scale formation should be determined based on the saturation indices and vapor flux in this study the saturation index of largest salt species nacl reached 1 and the vapor flux decreased to 6 kg m 2 hr 1 average vapor flux both at 60 recovery therefore it should be about 60 this recovery value was consistent with the water recovery values for high salinity brine reported in the previous literature greenlee et al 2009 hoek et al 2021a for example fresh and brackish water 25000 ppm tds desalination has a typical recovery from 50 to 90 while seawater and brine 25000 ppm tds has a typical water recovery from 30 to 60 3 4 dhvmd process modeling our experimental results demonstrated the feasibility of a lab scale dhvmd process for concentrating real pre treated o g produced water to explore potential performance of a dhvmd process we simulate a medium scale module using the process model which is already validated against lab scale experimental data section s1 the simulation captures temperature salinity water transport and energy flows during the steady state operation of a single pass dhvmd system operating conditions module dimensions feed solution properties and membrane properties of this medium scale module used in the simulation are described in the si table s1 we compare the performance of a standard vmd process i e no heat addition to either membrane surface or feed channel to the dhvmd process with the addition rate of 3600 w of heat to the membrane surface 3600 w of heat to the feed channel or 1800 w of heat to the membrane surface and 1800 w heat the feed channel in both cases the initial feed temperature was 60 c as two overarching performance metrics the single pass water recovery is increased by all the direct heat deliveries while the stec is only increased by membrane surface heating and hybrid heating with heat both to membrane surface and to feed channel and almost not increased by feed channel heating surface heated vmd has the highest single pass water recovery and lowest stec among all simulated conditions representing a 48 3 increase in water recovery and a 16 4 decrease in stec compared to standard vmd fig 5 a the water recovery is the highest because of the highest water flux eq s36 the lowest stec is a result of the lowest heat loss along the membrane module per unit of water production eq s37 in comparison feed channel heating yields nearly no reduction an 1 9 decrease in stec this is because feed channel heating behaves similarly to bulk heating of the feed i e similar to standard vmd and does not improve the energy efficiency as a result it only increases the single pass water recovery albeit to the least degree 26 3 a result of tp a combination of membrane surface heating and feed channel heating i e hybrid heating exhibits an intermediate performance in terms of water recovery and stec membrane surface heating has the highest positive impact on water flux with the highest flux associated with the highest membrane surface temperature eqs s33 s35 as adding heat to membrane surface reduces the heat loss brought about by vaporization fig 5b this is also reflected in the lowest heat flux from the feed stream i e heat loss normalized by membrane area defined in eq s17 which is minimized by membrane surface heating eq s18 in comparison hybrid heating has a lower impact on the vapor flux while feed channel heating increases the flux the least with higher bulk feed heat losses compared to membrane surface heating due to a higher bulk feed temperature eq s20 while all the methods of direct heating increase the temperatures of the membrane surface and bulk feed compared to no direct heating the membrane surface temperature is the highest and bulk feed temperature is the lowest with membrane surface heating fig 5c the bulk feed temperature was increased by the retained sensible heat from the reduced heat loss also the greatest reduction in tp is achieved by membrane surface heating fig 5d not surprisingly feed channel heating is the most effective at increasing the bulk feed temperature followed by hybrid heating however feed channel heating as well as hybrid heating have a lower membrane surface temperature compared to the bulk heating in traditional vmd as a result feed channel heating and hybrid heating exhibit a more severe temperature polarization higher tp the longitudinal profiles of bulk feed salinity and the salinity of the feed along the membrane surface are shown in fig 5e compared to the case with no heat addition the interface salinity is most significantly increased by membrane surface heating followed by hybrid heating and feed channel heating this is due to the fact that membrane surface heating provides the highest flux which leads to more water leaving the interface and higher residual salinity in contrast the bulk feed salinity is not dramatically impacted under any direct heating conditions fig 5f presents the longitudinal cp profile for the module which shows membrane surface heating increases the concentration polarization to a greater extent compared to that brought about by hybrid heating and feed channel heating as the cp is a strong function of vapor flux eq s32 water recovery can also be further increased under more optimized conditions for heat and mass transfer such as longer channel length lower cross flow velocity higher feed temperature stronger vacuum lower cross flow velocity and higher membrane permeability table s2 however in a single pass md it is hard to achieve a water recovery needed for brine concentration as shown in the previous reports lin et al 2014 therefore the dhvmd system requires a single stage batch or semi batch configuration our experimental system or a multi staged single pass configuration bartholomew et al 2020 dudchenko et al 2021 mulder 2012 to achieve a high total water recovery and concentrate the feed up to 310 g l 1 tds to maximize energy efficiency and achieve high gor values heat recycling is critical in all thermal desalination systems dhvmd will be no exception the minimum work of separation in thermal desalination is the latent heat of vaporization of water which is 2260 kj kg 1 deshmukh et al 2018 this is far higher than the energy needed for pressure driven desalination processes e g seawater ro is about 8 to 12 kj kg 1 thermal desalination technologies including md consequently use heat exchangers to recover the latent heat of condensation and lower their overall energy consumption bartholomew et al 2020 chung et al 2016 dudchenko et al 2021 large scale thermal desalination processes have gor values between 10 and 20 with actual stecs as low as 8 3 kj kg 1 al karaghouli and kazmerski 2013 ihm et al 2016 it should be noted that even if a gor of 20 is assumed at 2260 kj kg 1 the practically achievable minimum work of separation for a thermal process is 113 kj kg 1 which is an order of magnitude higher than a seawater ro unit including irreversible losses hence thermal desalination makes sense in two scenarios 1 when oil and gas are extraordinarily cheap and the steam generated by a steam electric cogeneration power plant can be used to drive the desalination process as in the middle east or 2 when the osmotic pressure of a hypersaline water exceeds the pressure limits of commercially available ro membranes and or process equipment 4 conclusion we developed a bench scale batch dhvmd system to desalinate a real pre treated o g produced water with an initial tds concentration of 115500 mg l 1 tds we achieved a maximum of 66 water recovery at an average water flux 6 kg m 2 hr 1 an overall salt rejection 99 9 and a single stage sec as low as 2530 kj kg 1 703 kwh m 3 the concentrated brine had a tds concentration high enough to achieve nacl saturation which is often a target in brine concentration processes with the goal of minimum liquid discharge in addition to experimental efforts we modeled temperature salinity water transport and energy flows in a medium scale dhvmd module the results suggest that an addition rate of 3600 w of thermal energy to the feedwater membrane interface increases water recovery by 48 3 and decreases the stec by 16 4 in a single pass the dhvmd process demonstrated herein shows promise for eventual scale up in the desalination of high salinity pre treated o g produced water and other hyper saline waters the challenges associated with scale up are as follows the flux needs to be higher in order to reduce capital costs specifically the cost of membranes and module a solution is to preheat the feed to normal md operating temperatures 60 80 c to provide the bulk driving force the direct heat input can be used to minimize the temperature polarization increase recovery and improve the energy efficiency in addition the latent heat of vaporization should be recovered to reach high gors and lower operational costs a potential method to achieve this is to use a multistage vmd system and use the wall of next stage to condense the vapor from the previous stage a typical scale up example is the memsys multi effect vmd system that already achieves a gor of 3 zhao et al 2013 supplementary information additional experimental details are provided including section s1 governing equations and model validation section

15988,the fenton oxidation improves sludge dewatering but faces notable technical and economic challenges including a narrow acidic ph range slow reduction of fe iii and the use of high doses of chemicals herein we used a natural polyhydroxyphenol tea polyphenols tp as an iron redox conversion enhancer to mitigate these issues compared with the classical fenton process at ph 3 0 the process with tp 33 8 mg g dry solids ds improved sludge dewaterability at ph 7 5 in a fenton like system with faster fe ii fe iii cycling and two times lower consumption of the fenton reagent sludge capillary suction time and specific resistance to filtration decreased from 70 s to 22 s and from 2 7 1013 m kg to 5 2 1011 m kg respectively while the required doses of fe ii and h2o2 were cut to 25 mg g ds and 31 2 mg g ds mechanistically tp could bond readily with fe ii fe iii at neutral ph to form stable complexes with complexation constants of 34 161 m 1 and 52 70 m 1 respectively and reduce part of the fe iii to fe ii simultaneously this maintained sufficient soluble fe in the sludge and boosted efficient conversion of fe ii fe iii to yield more hydroxyl radicals oh subsequently oh oxidation resulted in the decomposition of biopolymers with a molecular weight of 108 da e g 58 2 of polysaccharides and 31 6 of proteins in tightly bound extracellular polymeric substances into small molecules and disintegration of bioflocs into smaller particles with increased porosity contact angle and cell lysis these changes helped reduce bound water content and improved sludge dewaterability in addition the tp mediated fenton process disinfected fecal coliforms in the sludge and preserved the sludge organic matters this work proposes a new paradigm for developing cost effective sludge dewatering technologies that relies on the synergistic effects of plant polyphenols and advanced oxidation processes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewage sludge dewatering tea polyphenols fenton oxidation chemical consumption iron redox cycling 1 introduction sewage sludge contains large amounts of water 95 mass fraction and various pollutants e g pathogens heavy metals and refractory organics christensen et al 2015 the dewatering process can minimize the volume of sludge and facilitate its subsequent transportation and disposal however sludge borne water especially interstitial and vicinal water is difficult to separate directly because of the strong bonding of water with extracellular polymeric substances eps and the rigid structure of sludge cells vaxelaire and cezac 2004 fenton oxidation has been proven to be an efficient conditioning method for different types of sludge including surplus activated sludge and anaerobically digested sludge pham et al 2010 xiao et al 2017 yu et al 2021 the excellent performance of fenton conditioning is grounded in destruction of sludge eps and cell structures by hydroxyl radicals oh and coagulation by fe iii formed after oxidation neyens et al 2004 however the drawbacks of sludge fenton reaction including a narrow acidic ph range ph 3 5 slow reduction of fe iii and formation of fe oh 3 and the use of high doses of chemicals 60 100 mg g dry solids ds h2o2 and 50 80 mg g ds fe ii often limit its practical applications tony et al 2008 liang et al 2015 yu et al 2019 to overcome these deficiencies the sludge fenton oxidation usually needs to be used in combination with other methods such as microwave ultrasound and electrochemistry i e electro fenton cai et al 2018 masihi and gholikandi 2018 olvera vargas et al 2019 recent investigations have demonstrated that chelating ligands e g oxalic acid and protocatechuic acid extend the solubility of fe iii to a higher ph and accelerate fe iii reduction by h2o2 and in turn enable the fenton oxidation of organic pollutants e g herbicide and antibiotics in water over a wide ph range 5 0 9 0 with improved degradation performance de luca et al 2014 qin et al 2015 zhang and zhou 2019 these findings allow for the development of a new sludge fenton process with improved dewaterability and minimal use of chemicals however the application of chelating ligands to sludge fenton dewatering is complicated because sludge is a multiphase system that contains water minerals organic substances and microorganisms more et al 2014 several organic ligands such as aminopolyphosphonates and citric acid have been explored to strengthen sludge fenton dewatering at near neutral ph xiao et al 2018 zhang et al 2022 but their application to full scale processes may be expensive and or cause health risks in addition the performance of some ligands in sludge fenton conditioning is inconsistent and only a slight improvement or even deterioration in the dewaterability have been observed yu et al 2021 found that hydroxylamine chelated fe ii catalyzed fenton reaction enhanced the reduction of fe iii to fe ii by h2o2 but unexpectedly increased the specific resistance to filtration srf from 4 8 1012 m kg to 6 0 1012 m kg therefore cost effective and green chelating ligands that can stably boost sludge fenton dewatering are important from both fundamental and application perspectives tea polyphenols tp are natural polyhydroxy phenol compounds composed mainly of flavanoids and tannins and present in tea leaves olives sea buckthorn and walnuts putnik et al 2017 previous studies have suggested that tp has strong chelating and reducing abilities on metal cations azo dyes and iron silver nanoparticles ouyang et al 2019 xiao et al 2020 considering the remarkable properties of tp accessible biodegradable and chelation reduction we hypothesize that integrating tp into the sludge fenton system improves the dewatering efficiency while reducing chemicals usage the hypothesis is based on the assumption that the interaction of tp with fe should prevent the formation of fe oh 3 boost fe iii fe ii conversion to yield more oh and correspondingly reduce the required dose of fe ii h2o2 in sludge conditioning at present the effect of tp addition on sludge dewatering in fenton system is unknown in this study we evaluated the effect of tp mediated fenton process on sludge dewatering performance a comparison between tp fenton tp and fenton with different doses of fe ii h2o2 was made the mechanism of the tp fenton method was

conducted in triplicate for four reaction groups classic fenton half dose fenton 1 2 fenton tp and tp half dose fenton tp 1 2 fenton all experiments were carried out in 500 ml conical flasks each

according to the results of our previous study zhang et al 2018 the 1 2 fenton group was designed to create different degrees of oxidation in the sludge in preliminary trials we found that the optimum dose of tp for the fenton system was 33 8 mg g ds thus a fixed dose of 33 8 mg g ds tp was used in this study details for the sludge conditioning procedures are listed in si text s2 the sludge dewaterability was assessed using four separate metrics srf capillary suction time cst bound water content and filtrated sludge cake moisture cai et al 2018 the cst and srf were measured using a cst analyzer 304 m triton electronics ltd u k and buchner funnel test respectively the bound water content was determined by differential scanning calorimetry diamond perkinelmer with a liquid nitrogen cooling system the sludge cake moisture was measured after being drying the cake at 105 c for 12 h 2 3 complexation and reduction experiments of tp with fe a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2550 shimadzu japan was used to investigate chelation of tp with fe ii fe iii ouyang et al 2019 first 10 ml of tp solution 5 mmol l and an excess of fe ii or fe iii 10 ml of 5 mmol l fe ii or fe iii were mixed in 500 ml conical flasks then a fe chelation test was conducted while shaking the flasks at 150 rpm and 25 c on a gyratory shaker for 5 min after chelation the solution was analyzed for the chelation state of tp fe ii tp fe iii by uv vis spectrophotometry besides isothermal titration calorimetry itc 200 microcal usa was used to determine the complexation constants of tp with fe ii fe iii qin et al 2015 fe ii fe iii and tp solutions with the initial ph of 4 5 and concentrations of 1 1 and 5 mmol l respectively were prepared the solutions were filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane and degassed before use typically 2 μl of tp solution was injected into a sample cell containing 200 μl fe ii or fe iii with an interval of 100 s the experiment of fe iii reduction by tp was performed in 500 ml

dewatering performance generally sludge with relatively high cst and srf values e g cst 25 s or srf 1013 m kg is difficult to dewater kim et al 2016 variations in the sludge cst and srf across different treatment groups are shown in fig 1 a the best sludge dewaterability was observed in the tp 1 2 fenton group which gave marked decreases in the srf from 2 7 1013 m kg to 5 2 1011 m kg and the cst from 70 s to 22 s after 30 min of oxidation these values are equivalent to normalized reduction rates of 98 2 for the srf and 62 5 for the cst however individual addition of tp or 1 2 fenton did not obtain desired cst and srf results the values of water content of the sludge cake after vacuum filtration confirmed the positive impact of tp addition on the sludge fenton dewatering the minimum sludge cake water content 76 5 was obtained for the tp 1 2 fenton group the differential scanning calorimetry results revealed that the bound water content in the sludge decreased from 6 95 to 5 42 g g ds in the tp 1 2 fenton group fig 1b indicating that the release of bound water and its conversion to free water help to the improvement in dewaterablity yu et al 2019 reported that the maximum reduction in sludge srf was 95 after 30 min of treatment with 106 mg g vs feso4 and 234 mg g vs ca clo 2 reduction of 60 in the cst was recorded after sludge was co treated with hydrodynamic cavitation and fenton s reagent for 20 min cai et al 2018 accordingly the tp mediated fenton process used in this study is comparable to previously reported fenton type processes in terms of improvements in sludge dewatering more importantly the addition of tp to the sludge fenton system resulted in good dewaterability at neutral ph and greatly saved the chemicals usage e g only 50 dose of fe ii h2o2 and free of the requirement of h2so4 3 2 dewatering improvement mechanism 3 2 1 tp complexing and reducing of fe and soluble fe distribution in the sludge chelation of tp with fe ii fe iii was identified by uv visible spectrophotometry fig 2 a tp had a characteristic absorption peak at 270 nm with the addition of fe ii or fe iii a new broad band appeared at 450 700 nm and a marked red shift of the absorption peak at 320 330 nm was observed which were attributed to the formation of fe ii fe iii tp complexes meanwhile the chelation between tp and fe ii fe iii was highly dependent on the solution ph chelation was significant at ph 6 0 but became negligible as ph decreased from 4 5 to 2 0 this dependence may result from the weakened proton removal ability of tp under acidic conditions ph 4 0 ouyang et al 2019 stronger complexation of tp with fe ii fe iii at near neutral ph points to the promise of tp application in the sludge dewatering after further characterization of the formed fe complexes through isothermal titration calorimetry fig 2b the complexation constants of fe ii tp and fe iii tp were found to be 34 161 m 1 and 52 70 m 1 respectively on the other hand from the increase in soluble fe ii concentrations in the fe iii tp pure solution system fig 2c it was clear that tp could reduce a part of fe iii to fe ii these results indicate that tp had a dual

reduction to fe ii to yield more oh in the sludge even with only a half dose of fe ii h2o2 the improvement in the dewaterability may be highly related to effective oxidation of sludge by oh and

15988,the fenton oxidation improves sludge dewatering but faces notable technical and economic challenges including a narrow acidic ph range slow reduction of fe iii and the use of high doses of chemicals herein we used a natural polyhydroxyphenol tea polyphenols tp as an iron redox conversion enhancer to mitigate these issues compared with the classical fenton process at ph 3 0 the process with tp 33 8 mg g dry solids ds improved sludge dewaterability at ph 7 5 in a fenton like system with faster fe ii fe iii cycling and two times lower consumption of the fenton reagent sludge capillary suction time and specific resistance to filtration decreased from 70 s to 22 s and from 2 7 1013 m kg to 5 2 1011 m kg respectively while the required doses of fe ii and h2o2 were cut to 25 mg g ds and 31 2 mg g ds mechanistically tp could bond readily with fe ii fe iii at neutral ph to form stable complexes with complexation constants of 34 161 m 1 and 52 70 m 1 respectively and reduce part of the fe iii to fe ii simultaneously this maintained sufficient soluble fe in the sludge and boosted efficient conversion of fe ii fe iii to yield more hydroxyl radicals oh subsequently oh oxidation resulted in the decomposition of biopolymers with a molecular weight of 108 da e g 58 2 of polysaccharides and 31 6 of proteins in tightly bound extracellular polymeric substances into small molecules and disintegration of bioflocs into smaller particles with increased porosity contact angle and cell lysis these changes helped reduce bound water content and improved sludge dewaterability in addition the tp mediated fenton process disinfected fecal coliforms in the sludge and preserved the sludge organic matters this work proposes a new paradigm for developing cost effective sludge dewatering technologies that relies on the synergistic effects of plant polyphenols and advanced oxidation processes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewage sludge dewatering tea polyphenols fenton oxidation chemical consumption iron redox cycling 1 introduction sewage sludge contains large amounts of water 95 mass fraction and various pollutants e g pathogens heavy metals and refractory organics christensen et al 2015 the dewatering process can minimize the volume of sludge and facilitate its subsequent transportation and disposal however sludge borne water especially interstitial and vicinal water is difficult to separate directly because of the strong bonding of water with extracellular polymeric substances eps and the rigid structure of sludge cells vaxelaire and cezac 2004 fenton oxidation has been proven to be an efficient conditioning method for different types of sludge including surplus activated sludge and anaerobically digested sludge pham et al 2010 xiao et al 2017 yu et al 2021 the excellent performance of fenton conditioning is grounded in destruction of sludge eps and cell structures by hydroxyl radicals oh and coagulation by fe iii formed after oxidation neyens et al 2004 however the drawbacks of sludge fenton reaction including a narrow acidic ph range ph 3 5 slow reduction of fe iii and formation of fe oh 3 and the use of high doses of chemicals 60 100 mg g dry solids ds h2o2 and 50 80 mg g ds fe ii often limit its practical applications tony et al 2008 liang et al 2015 yu et al 2019 to overcome these deficiencies the sludge fenton oxidation usually needs to be used in combination with other methods such as microwave ultrasound and electrochemistry i e electro fenton cai et al 2018 masihi and gholikandi 2018 olvera vargas et al 2019 recent investigations have demonstrated that chelating ligands e g oxalic acid and protocatechuic acid extend the solubility of fe iii to a higher ph and accelerate fe iii reduction by h2o2 and in turn enable the fenton oxidation of organic pollutants e g herbicide and antibiotics in water over a wide ph range 5 0 9 0 with improved degradation performance de luca et al 2014 qin et al 2015 zhang and zhou 2019 these findings allow for the development of a new sludge fenton process with improved dewaterability and minimal use of chemicals however the application of chelating ligands to sludge fenton dewatering is complicated because sludge is a multiphase system that contains water minerals organic substances and microorganisms more et al 2014 several organic ligands such as aminopolyphosphonates and citric acid have been explored to strengthen sludge fenton dewatering at near neutral ph xiao et al 2018 zhang et al 2022 but their application to full scale processes may be expensive and or cause health risks in addition the performance of some ligands in sludge fenton conditioning is inconsistent and only a slight improvement or even deterioration in the dewaterability have been observed yu et al 2021 found that hydroxylamine chelated fe ii catalyzed fenton reaction enhanced the reduction of fe iii to fe ii by h2o2 but unexpectedly increased the specific resistance to filtration srf from 4 8 1012 m kg to 6 0 1012 m kg therefore cost effective and green chelating ligands that can stably boost sludge fenton dewatering are important from both fundamental and application perspectives tea polyphenols tp are natural polyhydroxy phenol compounds composed mainly of flavanoids and tannins and present in tea leaves olives sea buckthorn and walnuts putnik et al 2017 previous studies have suggested that tp has strong chelating and reducing abilities on metal cations azo dyes and iron silver nanoparticles ouyang et al 2019 xiao et al 2020 considering the remarkable properties of tp accessible biodegradable and chelation reduction we hypothesize that integrating tp into the sludge fenton system improves the dewatering efficiency while reducing chemicals usage the hypothesis is based on the assumption that the interaction of tp with fe should prevent the formation of fe oh 3 boost fe iii fe ii conversion to yield more oh and correspondingly reduce the required dose of fe ii h2o2 in sludge conditioning at present the effect of tp addition on sludge dewatering in fenton system is unknown in this study we evaluated the effect of tp mediated fenton process on sludge dewatering performance a comparison between tp fenton tp and fenton with different doses of fe ii h2o2 was made the mechanism of the tp fenton method was investigated by analysis of fe ii fe iii conversion tp chelating reducing of iron soluble iron distribution in the solid and liquid phases of the sludge oh generation and sludge properties eps

materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals the sewage sludge used in this study was surplus activated sludge collected from the thickening tank at the chengdong municipal wastewater treatment plant nanjing china the main characteristics of sludge and chemicals are given in the supplementary information si text s1 2 2 sludge dewatering experiments batch experiments on sludge dewatering were conducted in triplicate for four reaction groups classic fenton half dose fenton 1 2 fenton tp and tp half dose fenton tp 1 2 fenton all experiments were carried out in 500 ml conical flasks each containing 200 ml of raw sludge and different doses of chemical reagents table 1 in the classic fenton group the doses of fe ii and h2o2 were 50 mg g ds and 62 5 mg g ds respectively and established according to the results of our previous study zhang et al 2018 the 1 2 fenton group was designed to create different degrees of oxidation in the sludge in preliminary trials we found that the optimum dose of tp for the fenton system was 33 8 mg g ds thus a fixed dose of 33 8 mg g ds tp was used in this study details for the sludge conditioning procedures are listed in si text s2 the sludge dewaterability was assessed using four separate metrics srf capillary suction time cst bound water content and filtrated sludge cake moisture cai et al 2018 the cst and srf were measured using a cst analyzer 304 m triton electronics ltd u k and buchner funnel test respectively the bound water content was determined by differential scanning calorimetry diamond perkinelmer with a liquid nitrogen cooling system the sludge cake moisture was measured after being drying the cake at 105 c for 12 h 2 3 complexation and reduction experiments of tp with fe a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2550 shimadzu japan was used to investigate chelation of tp with fe ii fe iii ouyang et al 2019 first 10 ml of tp solution 5 mmol l and an excess of fe ii or fe iii 10 ml of 5 mmol l fe ii or fe iii were mixed in 500 ml conical flasks then a fe chelation test was conducted while shaking the flasks at 150 rpm and 25 c on a gyratory shaker for 5 min after chelation the solution was analyzed for the chelation state of tp fe ii tp fe iii by uv vis spectrophotometry besides isothermal titration calorimetry itc 200 microcal usa was used to determine the complexation constants of tp with fe ii fe iii qin et al 2015 fe ii fe iii and tp solutions with the initial ph of 4 5 and concentrations of 1 1 and 5 mmol l respectively were prepared the solutions were filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane and degassed before use typically 2 μl of tp solution was injected into a sample cell containing 200 μl fe ii or fe iii with an interval of 100 s the experiment of fe iii reduction by tp was performed in 500 ml flasks each containing 13 mmol l fe iii and 3 5 mm tp solutions all flasks were placed on a shaker at 25 c for 10 min the concentrations of soluble fe iii and fe ii were measured by a 1 10

dewatering performance generally sludge with relatively high cst and srf values e g cst 25 s or srf 1013 m kg is difficult to dewater kim et al 2016 variations in the sludge cst and srf across different treatment groups are shown in fig 1 a the best sludge dewaterability was observed in the tp 1 2 fenton group which gave marked decreases in the srf from 2 7 1013 m kg to 5 2 1011 m kg and the cst from 70 s to 22 s after 30 min of oxidation these values are equivalent to normalized reduction rates of 98 2 for the srf and 62 5 for the cst however individual addition of tp or 1 2 fenton did not obtain desired cst and srf results the values of water content of the sludge cake after vacuum filtration confirmed the positive impact of tp addition on the sludge fenton dewatering the minimum sludge cake water content 76 5 was obtained for the tp 1 2 fenton group the differential scanning calorimetry results revealed that the bound water content in the sludge decreased from 6 95 to 5 42 g g ds in the tp 1 2 fenton group fig 1b indicating that the release of bound water and its conversion to free water help to the improvement in dewaterablity yu et al 2019 reported that the maximum reduction in sludge srf was 95 after 30 min of treatment with 106 mg g vs feso4 and 234 mg g vs ca clo 2 reduction of 60 in the cst was recorded after sludge was co treated with hydrodynamic cavitation and fenton s reagent for 20 min cai et al 2018 accordingly the tp mediated fenton process used in this study is comparable to previously reported fenton type processes in terms of improvements in sludge dewatering more importantly the addition of tp to the sludge fenton system resulted in good dewaterability at neutral ph and greatly saved the chemicals usage e g only 50 dose of fe ii h2o2 and free of the requirement of h2so4 3 2 dewatering improvement mechanism 3 2 1 tp complexing and reducing of fe and soluble fe distribution in the sludge chelation of tp with fe ii fe iii was identified by uv visible spectrophotometry fig 2 a tp had a characteristic absorption peak at 270 nm with the addition of fe ii or fe iii a new broad band appeared at 450 700 nm and a marked red shift of the absorption peak at 320 330 nm was observed which were attributed to the formation of fe ii fe iii tp complexes meanwhile the chelation between tp and fe ii fe iii was highly dependent on the solution ph chelation was significant at ph 6 0 but became negligible as ph decreased from 4 5 to 2 0 this dependence may result from the weakened proton removal ability of tp under acidic conditions ph 4 0 ouyang et al 2019 stronger complexation of tp with fe ii fe iii at near neutral ph points to the promise of tp application in the sludge dewatering after further characterization of the formed fe complexes through isothermal titration calorimetry fig 2b the complexation constants of fe ii tp and fe iii tp were found to be 34 161 m 1 and 52 70 m 1 respectively on the other hand from the increase in soluble fe ii concentrations in the fe iii tp pure solution system fig 2c it was clear that tp could reduce a part of fe iii to fe ii these results indicate that tp had a dual role of both complexation and reduction effects on iron to further examine the impact of tp on fe ii fe iii conversion in sludge conditioning distribution of soluble iron in the solid and liquid phases of the sludge in different systems were monitored fig 2d and e show that less fe iii accumulated in the sludge treated with the tp 1 2 fenton group than that in classic fenton group the

15989,a groundwater monitoring network surrounding a pumping well such as a public water supply allows for early contaminant detection and mitigation where possible contaminant source locations are often unknown this numerical study investigates how the contaminant detection probability of a hypothetical sentinel well monitoring network consisting of one to four monitoring wells is affected by aquifer spatial heterogeneity and dispersion characteristics where the contaminant source location is randomized this is achieved through a stochastic framework using a monte carlo approach a single production well is considered that results in converging non uniform flow close to the well optimal network arrangements are obtained by maximizing a weighted risk function that considers true and false positive detection rates sampling frequency early detection and contaminant travel time uncertainty aquifer dispersivity is found to be the dominant parameter for the quantification of network performance for the range of parameters considered a single monitoring well screening the full aquifer thickness is expected to correctly and timely identify at least 12 of all incidents resulting in contaminants reaching the production well this proportion increases to a global maximum of 96 for a network consisting of four wells and very dispersive transport conditions irrespective of network size and sampling frequency more dispersive transport conditions result in higher detection rates increasing aquifer heterogeneity and decreasing aquifer spatial continuity also lead to higher detection rates though these effects are diminished for networks of 3 or more wells statistical anisotropy has no effect on the network performance earlier detection which is critical for remedial action and supply safety comes with a significant cost in terms of detection rate and should be carefully considered when a monitoring network is being designed keywords heterogeneity risk corrected detection rate contaminant transport dispersion monitoring network groundwater contamination introduction public water supply wells are monitored at regular intervals for various water quality indicators to detect pathogen nutrient and chemical contamination that can occur from agricultural and urban activities however despite these measures waterborne outbreaks are regularly reported in north america europe and elsewhere moreira and bondelind 2016 onyango et al 2015 indicating that testing the production well alone does not provide sufficient warning for mitigation actions to be successful furthermore in areas of significant seismic activity and following large earthquake events groundwater is prone to pollution from damaged wastewater infrastructure ishii et al 2021 kang et al 2013 kobayashi et al 2021 sarikaya and koyuncu 1999 and changes to the permeability of aquifer and aquitards elkhoury et al 2006 zhang et al 2019 liu et al 2010 that may affect groundwater quality and safety nakagawa et al 2021 wang et al 2016 wang et al 2004 a common protective measure is to restrict the land use surrounding supply wells usepa 1987 however complete restriction is often impractical or impossible particularly in urban areas and the full extent of the well capture zone is almost always uncertain frind and molson 2018 the use of a monitoring network surrounding a supply well allows for early detection and remediation nowak et al 2015 that depending on the contaminant can include various treatment techniques such as adsorption fang et al 2022 permeable reactive barriers burbery et al 2020 bortone et al 2019 and biological techniques da ana et al 2021 gibert et al 2022 however the network success rate depends on several factors such as the number and location of the sentinel wells and the sampling frequency bode et al 2016 bolster et al 2009 papapetridis and paleologos 2012 bode et al 2018 the design of a monitoring system typically aims to maximize contamination detection rates to minimize establishment and maintenance costs i e minimize the number of sentinel wells and sampling frequency required and to detect contamination as early as possible so that mitigation options can be implemented before contaminants reach the production well nowak et al 2015 bode et al 2016 for landfill monitoring applications the design objectives often take the form of minimizing the plume remediation cost storck et al 1997 hudak 2001 2002 2005 bierkens 2006 salamon et al 2006 mahjouri and shamsoddinpour 2016 additional uncertainty arises when the location of the contaminant source is unknown and the transport velocities vary greatly due to aquifer heterogeneity the conflicting objectives result in a multi objective optimization problem that needs to account for these uncertainties several site specific studies have addressed the optimization problem using a number of different formulations of the objective function see discussion in bode et al 2016 and sreekanth et al 2017 while winter and tartakovsky 2008 and bolster et al 2009 propose a probabilistic risk assessment framework that represents the progress of contamination as a markovian sequence based on a rare event statistical approximation the common ground of these studies is that the source location is either known or randomly occurring within high risk regions such as within a landfill there is little discussion in the literature on the effect of uncertainty on the optimal network design randomly occurring instantaneous source locations have been investigated numerically by yenigül et al 2005 who concluded that transverse dispersivities have significant influence on the reliability of monitoring arrays while papapetridis and paleologos 2011 evaluated the effect of sampling frequency and heterogeneity level on the contaminant detection probability from a landfill using sentinel well arrays with predetermined geometries and concluded that detection probability decreases with increased heterogeneity they proposed a risk function that accounts for action lag time between detection and mitigation implementation and investigated how increased lag can affect the system performance yenigül et al 2013 considered a random permanent contaminant source originating from a landfill and concluded that a large number of monitoring wells near the potential source would be preferable but when installation and operating costs are high optimal solutions lead to smaller numbers of wells at greater distances from the source bode et al 2016 considered quality monitoring networks in heterogeneous well capture zones and they attempted to simplify the problem of random contamination sources with the introduction of a line of attack near the production well this simplification led to the suggestion that very high numbers of monitoring wells may be required while no consideration had been given to how the number of wells and contaminant detection rates may be affected by aquifer heterogeneity more recently de barros et al 2016 analyzed the attenuation characteristics of a non conservative contaminant in heterogeneous formations and concluded that the probability of exceeding an accepted hazard index threshold in a pumping well decreases with increased heterogeneity the authors attributed their findings to the presence of low conductivity zones that can significantly increase the travel time between the source and the sink despite considerable progress there exist significant gaps in our fundamental understanding of how aquifer heterogeneity can affect the probabilistic description of plume migration and contaminant detection gómez hernández et al 2017 this study addresses some of these issues by investigating the case of a permanent conservative contaminant leakage from a random source into a heterogenous aquifer stressed by a single supply well with a fixed pumping rate resulting in a non uniform flow field converging towards the well this work was prompted by earthquake related damage to underground infrastructure upgradient of a well field and under such conditions the approximate location of a contaminant source is not always known we investigate how the contaminant detection probability is affected by aquifer spatial heterogeneity and dispersion characteristics by considering a hypothetical monitoring network of varied number of wells and sampling frequency in this study the monitoring network follows the concept of line of defense presented by bode et al 2018 and is designed to detect contamination from unknown sources without source risk prioritizations and to provide sufficient warning for mitigation measures to be implemented to ensure the safety of the water supply this is achieved through a stochastic framework using a monte carlo approach model description our study involves the simulation of flow and contaminant transport in an unconfined heterogeneous alluvial aquifer the model used in this study is based on a simplified version of ham3 gyopari 2014 a 3d regional flow model of the waiwhetu aquifer in new zealand s north island ham3 has been rigorously calibrated and verified and has been used over the last 8 years for the sustainable management of the waterloo borefield water taken from the borefield complements wellington s drinking water supply the model domain is 3 km long in the mean direction of flow 2 km wide and is discretized by a uniform 5 m x 5 m finite difference grid fig 1 steady state flow is imposed by constant head boundaries resulting in head gradient i 4 67e 4 m m and uniform recharge across the model domain r 6 1e 4 m d gyopari 2014 a fully penetrating well extracts water q 10 000 m3 d for a public supply network and is located 2 km downgradient in the flow direction the model horizontal dimensions are considered much larger than the average aquifer thickness and flow and transport conditions are assumed to be vertically uniform in the fully penetrating pumping and monitoring wells papapetridis and paleologos 2011 meyer et al 1994 the aquifer heterogeneity is addressed through the hydraulic conductivity hydraulic conductivity distributions in alluvial aquifers are often assigned according to hydrofacies attributed to the depositional environment zhu et al 2017 and represented by multi indicator methods de barros et al 2016 fiori et al 2013 here due to the small scale and low connectivity of the most permeable hydrofacies burbery et al 2018 hydraulic conductivity k x is assumed to be a lognormally distributed such that y x ln k x is a normal variate stationary second order and anisotropic process gelhar 1986 paleologos et al 2000 paleologos and sarris 2011 which has been shown to be a reasonable representation of aquifer heterogeneity for the prediction of observed plume propagation in similar environments sarris et al 2018 the degree of aquifer heterogeneity is associated with the variance of y x σ2 y the spatial continuity of the log transformed k x field is described by an anisotropic exponential covariance model cy of integral scale λ given by 1 c y r σ y 2 e x p i 1 2 r i 2 λ i 2 1 2 where ri is the separation distance between two arbitrary locations in the ith direction while the correlation length λi is the length over which covariance decreases by a factor of e 1 in direction i deutsch and journel 1997 the exponential variogram correlation length in the mean flow direction λ statistical anisotropy i λ λt where t denotes the transverse direction and the log k variance σ2 y are used to parameterize the aquifer heterogeneity while the log k mean μy and effective porosity neff are considered as deterministic parameters and are adopted from gyopari 2014 with μy 6 86 and neff 0 25 table 1 summarizes the deterministic parameters used in the flow and transport modeling to our knowledge there have been no previous studies addressing solute or pathogen transport in the study area as groundwater velocities in the study area are high molecular diffusion becomes negligible compared to mechanical dispersion and the dispersion mechanism can be represented by the mechanical dispersion alone zheng and wang 1999 contaminant dispersion is parameterized using the longitudinal dispersivity α and transverse dispersivity ratio αt α based on numerical and experimental results from similar environments in new zealand sarris et al 2018 and previously published results zech et al 2015 a source at a random location is assumed to release a conservative fully soluble contaminant in the aquifer in the study area there has been evidence of solute and pathogen contamination recently following the 2016 kaikoura earthquake 7 8 mw but to the authors knowledge there have been no studies quantifying these accidental discharges contaminants are assumed to be released at a constant rate resulting in an average source strength c0 in most cases contaminants are expected to undergo some form of geochemical or biological transformation resulting in mass and concentration reductions renou et al 2008 these reductions are heavily dependent on the contaminant but also on the aquifer s physical chemical and biological environment such processes are not considered here as the focus of our study is the impact of aquifer heterogeneity monitoring locations and sampling frequency on contaminant detection probabilities the source is assumed steady state yenigül et al 2013 which physically corresponds to a source that remains active and potentially undetected or not remedied for sufficient time for the plume to potentially reach the pumping well under these conditions the transport of contaminants in fickian groundwater flow systems can be expressed as zheng and wang 1999 sarris et al 2018 2 θ c t θ d c θ v i c q s c s where d is the mechanical dispersion coefficient tensor vi is the linear pore water velocity defined as qi θ and relates the transport to the flow equation and cs is the concentration of the source fluxes qs the components of the mechanical dispersion tensor in two dimensions are bear 1979 bortone et al 2019 3 d x x α v x 2 v α t v y 2 v d y y α v y 2 v α t v x 2 v d x y d y x α α t v x v y v where v is the magnitude of the velocity vector flow and transport through the unsaturated zone is not considered in our study cases where ignoring the influence of the vadose zone to contaminant transport is appropriate include those where the contamination source is near or below the water table when the water table is shallow or when transport through the vadose zone is relatively fast through non stratified media and or fingered flow conditions wang et al 2018 sarris scott et al 2019 monte carlo scheme the flow and transport in the heterogeneous aquifer are studied in a stochastic framework using a monte carlo approach as follows for each combination of a set of flow λ i and σy 2 and transport α αt α model parameters two dimensional random hydraulic conductivity fields are generated using the sequential gaussian simulation method deutsch and journel 1997 aquifer heterogeneity and dispersion parameter values considered in this study have been selected to represent a range of heterogeneous environments gelhar 1986 sarris and paleologos 2004 burbery et al 2020 fiori et al 2013 zech et al 2015 de barros et al 2016 as summarized in table 2 for each simulated field a random contamination source location is selected across the study area the numerical steady state flow solution is obtained using modflow nwt niswonger et al 2011 while the transport problem is solved using mt3d usgs bedekar et al 2016 to reduce the computational burden and the prohibitive disk storage space requirements due to the large number of realizations required for solution convergence the transport solution is obtained for steady state transport conditions to estimate the stochastic contaminant arrival times advective transport travel times are obtained using modpath version 5 pollock 1994 by calculating the particle travel times from each grid cell to the sink or downgradient boundary detection statistics once all the realizations have been undertaken the point detection probability statistics are calculated at each grid cell this involves the calculation of true positive tp true negative tn false positive fp and false negative fn probabilities a positive negative outcome refers to whether the contamination reaches the well and true false outcome refers to the detection of the contamination from the monitoring well true detection is when the outcome positive or negative is correctly identified in terms of grid cell concentration exceeding a predefined detection limit c t h r in this study the threshold concentration at which detection occurs is c t h r 10 3 c 0 hudak 2001 for example the tp detection rate dt p i j n from n total realizations at a single location i j in the flow field is calculated according to 4 d t p i j n 1 n p o s n 1 n t p i j n where n p o s is the number of positive events and t p i j n denotes a tp detection at location i j for realization n 5 t p i j n 1 i f c w c t h r a n d c i j c t h r 0 o t h e r w i s e in 5 c w and c i j are the contaminant concentrations at the pumping well and monitoring location i j respectively for a monitoring network consisting of k sentinel wells the detection rate also known as sensitivity or true positive rate in biostatistics of the entire network d t p k is calculated as the size of the set of realizations where at least one of k wells has a tp detection divided by the total number of positive events yerushalmy 1947 6 d t p k 1 n p o s k s i j t p where s i j t p is the set of realizations where a tp detection occurred at location i j 7 s i j t p n t p i j n 1 the term k s i j t p is the union of the sets for each of the k wells in the network which gives the set of realizations where a tp detection occurred at any of the well locations ignoring any duplicate cases where 2 or more wells detect the contaminant plume in the same realization the size of this set is the total number of tp detections for the network therefore a crude effectiveness measure of a k well monitoring network could be obtained by calculating the network detection rate d t p k a monitoring network should however also provide an early indication of the imminent well contamination for remedial actions to be implemented bode et al 2016 by ensuring that transport time between first arrival at the monitoring network and arrival at the pumping well will be equal to or greater than a specified threshold t r for practical applications t r is associated with the sampling frequency and action implementation timeframes an optimal monitoring network layout can be obtained by maximizing d t p k such that all wells in the network satisfy the condition that the mean advective travel time t between the monitoring and pumping well is greater than t r a monitoring network should also minimize the risk of false positive detections which can be significant for non conservative and pathogenic contaminations and can result in significant supply disruptions alternatively the network effectiveness can be calculated with a risk correcting function papapetridis and paleologos 2011 that considers a the contamination detection rate adjusted for potential false positive detections b detection timing relative to t r and c the travel time uncertainty from the monitoring wells to the pumping well we propose a weighted risk function as 8 f r i s k k t r 1 k d t p k d f p k k f i j t r f i j σ where d f p k is the false positive detection rate of a k well network pagano and gauvreau 2018 given by 9 d f p k 1 n n e g k s i j f p s i j f p is the set of realizations where a fp detection occurred at location i j similar to 7 and n n e g is the total number of negative events in 8 the weighting term f i j t r accounts for the mean travel time t from a monitoring well located at i j to the pumping well and here is given by a sigmoid function ruppert et al 2015 sarris and paleologos 2004 with midpoint t r and slope t r 2 that smoothly increases from 0 to 1 as t increases from 0 to 2 t r 10 f i j t r 1 2 1 tanh t t r t r 2 this term greatly reduces the risk correcting function f r i s k k t r when travel time t from a monitoring well to the pumping well is less than the threshold t r whereas the slope which in 10 is set to t r 2 defines the distance from t r where f t r reaches its upper and lower limits as a result f t r aims to scale the effects of early and late detections by promoting early detection beyond a simple binary threshold of the form t t r the term f i j σ is weighting the uncertainty of the travel time estimates and here is given by 11 f i j σ 1 1 σ i j t where σ i j t is the average travel time standard deviation at i j expressed as a percentage of the average f i j σ is close to 1 when travel time uncertainty is low and decreases towards 0 as the uncertainty increases it follows from 9 through 11 that f r i s k k t r has a range 1 1 but for conservative contaminants within the well capture zone where dfp reduces towards zero its range reduces to 0 1 as such the quantity f r i s k k t r can be considered as the risk corrected detection probability of a random contamination source by a k well monitoring network for the purposes of this work risk is quantified in terms of monitoring and remedial action delays and uncertainties results and discussion number of realizations the number of realizations that are required for the monte carlo scheme solution to converge varies depending on the physical problem and the sources of uncertainty in our study the scheme is considered to have converged when the tp and tn detection rates stabilize after a sufficient number of realizations lahkim and garcia 1999 yenigül et al 2005 the term δ d t p i j n is defined as the change of the tp rates across the numerical grid denoted by the indices i and j after n realizations according to 12 δ d t p i j n d t p i j n 1 n 1 k 1 n 1 d t p i j k the δ d t p i j n standard deviation σ t p n for the nth realization can be calculated across the numerical grid in a similar manner δ d t n i j n and σ t n n can be calculated for the tn detection rates in our study the sum of σ t p n and σ t n n is used as the convergence criterion fig 2 a plots the scheme convergence with increasing number of monte carlo realizations for low dispersivity and heterogeneity whereas fig 2b plots the scheme convergence for the case with high dispersivity and high heterogeneity these figures indicate that the number of realizations to achieve convergence increases with increased heterogeneity and more dispersive conditions paleologos et al 2000 but convergence can be attained with 10 000 to 15 000 realizations for all cases the latter number is chosen for our numerical experiments contaminant travel time and detection rate based on the site heterogeneity conditions gyopari 2014 donaldson and campbell 1977 and similar environments in nz sarris et al 2018 burbery et al 2020 sarris close et al 2019 we considered λ 50 m i 5 συ 2 1 0 α 6 2 m αt α 0 1 as base model parameters using the ranges from table 2 to assess their effects on contaminant detection rates a base travel time threshold of t r 100 days is also considered to allow time for sampling the pumping well and some response time for mitigation papapetridis and paleologos 2012 this could correspond to quarterly sentinel well sampling approx 90 days between sampling runs with a 10 day response time or 60 day sampling intervals and longer response time 40 days and so on the tp detection rate eq 4 across the model domain for 4 different dispersivity cases is shown in fig 3 as expected tp is larger around the pumping well and directly downgradient the latter is the effect of dispersive transport at or near the well capture zone boundary higher tp rates indicate that a single monitoring point at this location should provide increased positive detection probabilities when the effect of t r is not considered such as for the zone downgradient of the pumping well where the contamination will be detected after the plume reached the pumping well tp increases considerably with increasing dispersivity particularly in the transverse direction as the lateral plume spreading facilitates detection there is some asymmetry in tp distribution across the domain for the highly dispersive flow conditions in fig 3d this is considered to be an artifact of the finite number of realizations undertaken lahkim and garcia 1999 papapetridis and paleologos 2011 sarris close et al 2019 however even when the tp distribution is obtained with a total of 25 000 realizations for the case with highest dispersivities and heterogeneity some residual albeit smaller asymmetry is still observed results not shown fig 4 shows the average advective travel time from each grid cell to the pumping well and the relative travel time standard deviation for different parameter values and increasing heterogeneity white denotes the area where particles never reach the pumping well while the colored area denotes the average capture zone note that these travel times were obtained using particle tracking considering advective transport alone ignoring dispersive effects when heterogeneity is low the average travel time to the pumping well is gaussian with little variability between realizations with increasing heterogeneity the capture zone size increases ayinippully nalarajan et al 2021 as does the variability between realizations even though the range of the average travel times does not change as shown in figs 4d 4f increasing statistical anisotropy has little effect on the spatial distribution of travel times and relative standard deviation σt figure s1 increasing λ from 20 m to 50 m and 500 m increases the capture zone size by 23 and 60 respectively figure s2 as the greater spatial continuity of the k field allows preferential transport to the pumping well from a larger part of the simulated aquifer cole and silliman 1997 increasing συ 2 also contributes to increased capture zone area and is the main contributor to the significant increase of σt figure s3 ayinippully nalarajan et al 2021 the tp and fp detection rates average advective travel time and resulting frisk for a single monitoring location for the model base parameters are shown in fig 5 unsurprisingly fp rate peaks downgradient and to the sides of the pumping well where monitoring is likely to detect up to 25 of contamination events that do not reach the supply well and perhaps unnecessarily trigger remedial responses frisk in fig 5 has been calculated for t r 100 d in the vicinity of the pumping well frisk reduces to almost zero despite the high tp and low fp rates as the average advective travel time t is below t r and any monitoring outcomes would not occur until after the water supply has been contaminated further from this zone frisk increases sharply as t approaches t r before decreasing as the distance from the well increases and tp rate decreases the area downgradient of the well with the highest frisk value shown in red in fig 5d is due to both the high tp rate fig 5c and the very low σt shown earlier in fig 4e on the border of the capture zone however the calculation of the travel time which is computed as the travel time between each grid cell and the pumping well does not consider the contaminant source location in most cases contaminant arrival times to the pumping well are going to be lower than to the monitoring location immediately downgradient of the well hence the constraint that the travel time is greater than t r alone without considering simulated arrival times is not a sufficient condition for early contamination detection in converging flows for that reason monitoring locations downgradient of the pumping well are not considered for monitoring network configurations the effect of t r on frisk for a single observation point is shown in fig 6 as t r increases the area surrounding the pumping well where f r i s k 0 also increases in size within this zone monitoring should not be expected to have a practical benefit the maximum frisk upgradient of the well is approximately 0 32 for t r 10 d and decreases to approximately 0 25 and 0 15 for t r equal to 100 d and 200 d respectively this suggests that earlier detection comes with significant reduction in the effectiveness of the monitoring scheme bode et al 2016 however this does not address the performance of monitoring networks consisting of multiple sentinel wells which is discussed in the following section monitoring network optimization a monitoring network is optimized by finding the locations that maximize the risk correcting function eq 8 for a prescribed network size i e number of monitoring wells because of the highly non linear nature of the optimization problem and the relatively small dimensionality of the phase space sarris and burbery 2018 brute force optimization is applied where the possible location combinations are sampled in sequence as discussed earlier possible monitoring locations are restricted to those upgradient of the pumping well to further reduce the computational burden the domain of possible network locations is restricted by assuming that the solution needs to be symmetric about the x 1 km plane in accordance with the average flow field symmetry it took approximately one hour of wall clock time to calculate an optimal 4 well network with 2 symmetric pairs of wells across a single model domain using a single core of an intel xeon gold 6150 server with 128 gb of memory and clock speed of 2 7 ghz sarris et al 2021 whereas an optimal 5 well network took multiple days as the problem dimensionality greatly increases with each additional well to reduce the computational burden in this study network sizes ranging from 1 to 4 wells are considered fig 7 shows the effect of flow and transport parameters on the optimal array locations while fig 8 summarizes the calculated detection statistics for each network optimal performance with a single monitoring well is always achieved with the well at the side of the capture zone and not immediately upgradient of the pumping well detection rates depend on the size of the monitoring network and the parameter values and range between 12 for a single monitoring location to 96 for four monitoring wells for landfill monitoring under uniform flow conditions and for instantaneous sources papapetridis and paleologos 2012 reported detection probabilities ranging between 5 and 35 for up to six monitoring wells while for similar flow settings yenigül et al 2005 estimated detection probabilities between 5 and 80 for twelve monitoring wells dropping to a maximum of 45 for six wells bode et al 2016 reported that a network of 8 monitoring wells placed immediately downgradient of known risk sources can provide detection probabilities of up to 91 there are several factors contributing to the greater detection rates with smaller number of monitoring wells in this study we only consider permanent sources in contrast to the instantaneous sources used in the aforementioned earlier studies that make the resulting plumes harder to detect unless a dense monitoring network is created for landfill monitoring and for permanent sources for example yenigül et al 2013 reported that detection probabilities from a 3 well network can be up to 85 if the distance from the source is large enough to our knowledge all previous studies consider monitoring downgradient of high risk areas under uniform flow conditions with the exception of bode et al 2016 that for numerical efficiency simulated random sources in the well capture zone with an arc of point sources that cannot account for the dispersive characteristics of plumes which would suggest a larger number of monitoring locations is needed in all cases of our study dfp is small and ranges between 0 and 8 this is to be expected since only permanent contaminant sources are considered with monitoring within the well capture zone instantaneous and non conservative sources would be expected to result in greater false positive detections with the term dfp contributing more to frisk our numerical results suggest that increasing longitudinal and transverse dispersivities figs 7a 8a result in large increases in frisk and tp detection rate under the most dispersive conditions a maximal detection rate 96 is achieved with 4 wells while a single well can correctly and timely identify 64 of all positive contamination events for low α and αt 0 62 m and 0 062 m respectively the detection rate from a single monitoring location is only 12 whereas a 4 well network achieves a peak detection rate of 49 for non convergent flow yenigül et al 2005 and papapetridis and paleologos 2011 reported increasing detection probability with increasing transverse dispersivities but they noted that after a threshold and as the plume dimensions increased concentrations reduced below the detection limit and the detection probabilities declined however yenigül et al 2013 for uniform flow but permanent contamination source concluded that detection probabilities continue increasing with increased dispersivities in our study due to the permanent source and the fact that flow and mass converge towards the pumping well the detection rate increased even with relatively unrealistically high αt more dispersive conditions also result in greater frisk values while increased αt also results in increased dfp for the least dispersive conditions frisk peaks with 4 sentinel wells but for all other cases and in contrast to the detection rate frisk peaks earlier with only 2 monitoring wells this is because the marginal dtp increase of each additional well is negated by a marginal increase in false positive detections and increased travel time uncertainty στ figs 7b d show the optimal networks for varying λ συ 2 and i values in all cases increasing the number of monitoring wells results in increasing dtp and frisk figs 8b d for each network size the value of these parameters appears to have only a small effect on the network spatial arrangement as shown earlier fig 4 smaller λ and συ 2 result in reduced advective travel time uncertainty and greater frisk for 1 to 2 monitoring wells dtp decreases with increasing λ as preferential flow and transport through better connected highly permeable parts of the aquifer is more pronounced with increasing network sizes 3 or 4 wells in our study these preferential pathways are better intercepted and dtp stabilizes increasing συ 2 results in increased dtp this is in contrast to the results of yenigül et al 2005 and papapetridis and paleologos 2011 who concluded that for non convergent flows detection probabilities decrease for increased heterogeneity συ 2 the latter authors suggested that in highly heterogeneous aquifers placing the wells closer to the known source was a necessary condition for detection to occur suggesting that increasing συ 2 potentially resulted in more dispersed plumes with concentrations below the detection limit however under converging flow conditions this is a lesser issue resulting in better detection of the more dispersed plumes the value of statistical anisotropy appears to have no effect on either dtp or frisk fig 8d and only a marginal effect on the spatial distribution of the monitoring wells fig 7d fig 7e shows the optimal networks with the travel time threshold t r varied from 10 to 200 days a low t r value implies a much higher monitoring frequency which may increase operating costs depending on the methods used for contaminant sampling and or measurement as expected increasing this threshold penalizes detections closer to the pumping well and decreases both dtp and frisk fig 8e while the optimal sentinel distance from the pumping well increases to allow for earlier detection bode et al 2016 when t r 10 days there is little benefit from installing more than two sentinel wells in fact the two wells can achieve a detection rate of 84 and a third sentinel well only contributes an additional 1 to the estimated dtp while its location is mostly driven by the relatively small travel time uncertainty σ t resulting in marginally larger frisk increasing t r to 200 days reduces dtp to 24 and 70 for 1 and 4 monitoring wells compared to 46 and 84 for 1 and 2 monitoring wells with t r 10 days discussion and practical applications in this study a risk corrected decision analysis model is proposed to determine optimal groundwater monitoring networks for the protection of production wells the general layout of our proposed network design stems from the line of defense concept proposed by bode et al 2016 2018 but consisting of significantly fewer wells due to the proposed risk correcting function and the stochastic numerical approach to the random source problem that fully considers the plume dispersion the focus of this study is to determine how the network detection rates are affected by aquifer heterogeneity and whether sufficient protection can be achieved from such networks as such certain numerical compromises had to be made to limit the computational burden of this study which included 216 parameter combinations with each one requiring 15 000 flow and transport simulations as a result we opted to ignore seasonal variations in boundary conditions transient transport and multiple retarded or degrading contaminants and represent a 3d aquifer and transport problem with a 2d numerical approximation even though there can be compelling cases made for all of these assumptions it would be expected that in a practical application these may be considered in a more site specific manner for example multiple contaminants based on the catchment land uses and hydro geochemisty can be considered where cthr values can be contaminant specific conclusions in this numerical study monte carlo stochastic analysis is used to simulate groundwater flow and contaminant transport in a heterogeneous two dimensional aquifer the flow field is strongly affected by a pumping well used as a drinking water supply pollution originates from a steady state source at a random location we consider how heterogeneity and dispersion parameters affect the timely and accurate detection of contamination events of monitoring networks consisting of 1 to 4 monitoring wells network performance is measured as a risk correcting function considering the network s true and false positive detections sampling frequency in terms of early detection and the associated uncertainty the following major conclusions can be drawn from our study 1 convergence of the point detection rates was not always achieved after 15 000 realizations the true positive and true negative detection probability standard deviations were used across the field as a convergence criterion and established that 10 000 15 000 realizations should suffice for probabilistic solutions to stabilize however for highly heterogeneous and highly dispersive transport conditions spatially distributed average values of true positive detection probabilities and advective travel time standard deviations remained nonsymmetrical even after as many as 25 000 realizations 2 our results indicate that in all cases of aquifer heterogeneity and dispersion increasing the number of wells used for monitoring purposes resulted in greater detection rate of contamination events for the base parameters of our study and from a single monitoring well it is expected that at least 32 of all contamination events that reach the water supply well would be correctly and timely identified increasing to 80 for a network consisting of four wells for computational reasons our analysis was limited to a maximum of 4 monitoring wells but detection rates of the order of 75 were achieved frequently with only 3 monitoring wells 3 aquifer dispersivity is the dominant parameter for the quantification of network performance for fixed heterogeneity λ συ 2 and i and number of wells detection rate increases with increased longitudinal and transverse dispersivities our numerical results suggest that in contrast to previously published results for non convergent flows and instantaneous sources further increasing dispersion parameters does not result in detection rate reduction under the least dispersive conditions in our study the detection rate is 12 and 49 for 1 and 4 monitoring wells respectively increasing to 64 and 96 for the largest dispersivity values considered 4 for fixed dispersion parameters increasing spatial continuity of the gaussian conductivity field resulted in decreased detection rate when up to two wells were considered due to preferential flow and transport increasing the number of monitoring wells resulted in no obvious differences between dtp achieved for the three considered λ values suggesting that these preferential pathways are adequately captured by the network 5 increasing συ 2 resulted in greater detection rates for networks consisting of up to 3 wells once a fourth well was added to the network συ 2 did not affect the dtp statistical anisotropy did not appear to have a noticeable effect on the network detection rate 6 earlier detection for remedial action comes with a significant cost in terms of detection rate increasing t r from 100 to 200 days results in 17 21 and 10 lower detection rates for 2 3 and 4 monitoring wells respectively false positive rates are also expected to increase from 1 to 4 for networks of 3 and 4 wells respectively future work will expand the scope of this study to address microbial risk and non conservative

15989,a groundwater monitoring network surrounding a pumping well such as a public water supply allows for early contaminant detection and mitigation where possible contaminant source locations are often unknown this numerical study investigates how the contaminant detection probability of a hypothetical sentinel well monitoring network consisting of one to four monitoring wells is affected by aquifer spatial heterogeneity and dispersion characteristics where the contaminant source location is randomized this is achieved through a stochastic framework using a monte carlo approach a single production well is considered that results in converging non uniform flow close to the well optimal network arrangements are obtained by maximizing a weighted risk function that considers true and false positive detection rates sampling frequency early detection and contaminant travel time uncertainty aquifer dispersivity is found to be the dominant parameter for the quantification of network performance for the range of parameters considered a single monitoring well screening the full aquifer thickness is expected to correctly and timely identify at least 12 of all incidents resulting in contaminants reaching the production well this proportion increases to a global maximum of 96 for a network consisting of four wells and very dispersive transport conditions irrespective of network size and sampling frequency more dispersive transport conditions result in higher detection rates increasing aquifer heterogeneity and decreasing aquifer spatial continuity also lead to higher detection rates though these effects are diminished for networks of 3 or more wells statistical anisotropy has no effect on the network performance earlier detection which is critical for remedial action and supply safety comes with a significant cost in terms of detection rate and should be carefully considered when a monitoring network is being designed keywords heterogeneity risk corrected detection rate contaminant transport dispersion monitoring network groundwater contamination introduction public water supply wells are monitored at regular intervals for various water quality indicators to detect pathogen nutrient and chemical contamination that can occur from agricultural and urban activities however despite these measures waterborne outbreaks are regularly reported in north america europe and elsewhere moreira and bondelind 2016 onyango et al 2015 indicating that testing the production well alone does not provide sufficient warning for mitigation actions to be successful furthermore in areas of significant seismic activity and following large earthquake events groundwater is prone to pollution from damaged wastewater infrastructure ishii et al 2021 kang et al 2013 kobayashi et al 2021 sarikaya and koyuncu 1999 and changes to the permeability of aquifer and aquitards elkhoury et al 2006 zhang et al 2019 liu et al 2010 that may affect groundwater quality and safety nakagawa et al 2021 wang et al 2016 wang et al 2004 a common protective measure is to restrict the land use surrounding supply wells usepa 1987 however complete restriction is often impractical or impossible particularly in urban areas and the full extent of the well capture zone is almost always uncertain frind and molson 2018 the use of a monitoring network surrounding a supply well allows for early detection and remediation nowak et al 2015 that depending on the contaminant can include various treatment techniques such as adsorption fang et al 2022 permeable reactive barriers burbery et al 2020 bortone et al 2019 and biological techniques da ana et al 2021 gibert et al 2022 however the network success rate depends on several factors such as the number and location of the sentinel wells and the sampling frequency bode et al 2016 bolster et al 2009 papapetridis and paleologos 2012 bode et al 2018 the design of a monitoring system typically aims to maximize contamination detection rates to minimize establishment and maintenance costs i e minimize the number of sentinel wells and sampling frequency required and to detect contamination as early as possible so that mitigation options can be implemented before contaminants reach the production well nowak et al 2015 bode et al 2016 for landfill monitoring applications the design objectives often take the form of minimizing the plume remediation cost storck et al 1997 hudak 2001 2002 2005 bierkens 2006 salamon et al 2006 mahjouri and shamsoddinpour 2016 additional uncertainty arises when the location of the contaminant source is unknown and the transport velocities vary greatly due to aquifer heterogeneity the conflicting objectives result in a multi objective optimization problem that needs to account for these uncertainties several site specific studies have addressed the optimization problem using a number of different formulations of the objective function see discussion in bode et al 2016 and sreekanth et al 2017 while winter and tartakovsky 2008 and bolster et al 2009 propose a probabilistic risk assessment framework that represents the progress of contamination as a markovian sequence based on a rare event statistical approximation the common ground of these studies is that the source location is either known or randomly occurring within high risk regions such as within a landfill there is little discussion in the literature on the effect of uncertainty on the optimal network design randomly occurring instantaneous source locations have been investigated numerically by yenigül et al 2005 who concluded that transverse dispersivities have significant influence on the reliability of monitoring arrays while papapetridis and paleologos 2011 evaluated the effect of sampling frequency and heterogeneity level on the contaminant detection probability from a landfill using sentinel well arrays with predetermined geometries and concluded that detection probability decreases with increased heterogeneity they proposed a risk function that accounts for action lag time between detection and mitigation implementation and investigated how increased lag can affect the system performance yenigül et al 2013 considered a random permanent contaminant source originating from a landfill and concluded that a large number of monitoring wells near the potential source would be preferable but when installation and operating costs are high optimal solutions lead to smaller numbers of wells at greater distances from the source bode et al 2016 considered quality monitoring networks in heterogeneous well capture zones and they attempted to simplify the problem of random contamination sources with the introduction of a line of attack near the production well this simplification led to the suggestion that very high numbers of monitoring wells may be required while no consideration had been given to how the number of wells and contaminant detection rates may be affected by aquifer heterogeneity more recently de barros et al 2016 analyzed the attenuation characteristics of a non conservative contaminant in heterogeneous formations and concluded that the probability of exceeding an accepted hazard index threshold in a pumping well decreases with increased heterogeneity the authors attributed their findings to the presence of low conductivity zones that can significantly increase the travel time between the source and the sink despite considerable progress there exist significant gaps in our fundamental understanding of how aquifer heterogeneity can affect the probabilistic description of plume migration and contaminant detection gómez hernández et al 2017 this study addresses some of these issues by investigating the case of a permanent conservative contaminant leakage from a random source into a heterogenous aquifer stressed by a single supply well with a fixed pumping rate resulting in a non uniform flow field converging towards the well this work was prompted by earthquake related damage to underground infrastructure upgradient of a well field and under such conditions the approximate location of a contaminant source is not always known we investigate how the contaminant detection probability is affected by aquifer spatial heterogeneity and dispersion characteristics by considering a hypothetical monitoring network of varied number of wells and sampling frequency in this study the monitoring network follows the concept of line of defense presented by bode et al 2018 and is designed to detect contamination from unknown sources without source risk prioritizations and to provide sufficient warning for mitigation measures to be implemented to ensure the safety of the water supply this is achieved through a stochastic framework using a monte carlo approach model description our study involves the simulation of flow and contaminant transport in an unconfined heterogeneous alluvial aquifer the model used in this study is based on a simplified version of ham3 gyopari 2014 a 3d regional flow model of the waiwhetu aquifer in new zealand s north island ham3 has been rigorously calibrated and verified and has been used over the last 8 years for the sustainable management of the waterloo borefield water taken from the borefield complements wellington s drinking water supply the model domain is 3 km long in the mean direction of flow 2 km wide and is discretized by a uniform 5 m x 5 m finite difference grid fig 1 steady state flow is imposed by constant head boundaries resulting in head gradient i 4 67e 4 m m and uniform recharge across the model domain r 6 1e 4 m d gyopari 2014 a fully penetrating well extracts water q 10 000 m3 d for a public supply network and is located 2 km downgradient in the flow direction the model horizontal dimensions are considered much larger than the average aquifer thickness and flow and transport conditions are assumed to be vertically uniform in the fully penetrating pumping and monitoring wells papapetridis and paleologos 2011 meyer et al 1994 the aquifer heterogeneity is addressed through the hydraulic conductivity hydraulic conductivity distributions in alluvial aquifers are often assigned according to hydrofacies attributed to the depositional environment zhu et al 2017 and represented by multi indicator methods de barros et al 2016 fiori et al 2013 here due to the small scale and low connectivity of the most permeable hydrofacies burbery et al 2018 hydraulic conductivity k x is assumed to be a lognormally distributed such that y x ln k x is a normal variate stationary second order and anisotropic process gelhar 1986 paleologos et al 2000 paleologos and sarris 2011 which has been shown to be a reasonable representation of aquifer heterogeneity for the prediction of observed plume propagation in similar environments sarris et al 2018 the degree of aquifer heterogeneity is associated with the variance of y x σ2 y the spatial continuity of the log transformed k x field is described by an anisotropic exponential covariance model cy of integral scale λ given by 1 c y r σ y 2 e x p i 1 2 r i 2 λ i 2 1 2 where ri is the separation distance between two arbitrary locations in the ith direction while the correlation length λi is the length over which covariance decreases by a factor of e 1 in direction i deutsch and journel 1997 the exponential variogram correlation length in the mean flow direction λ statistical anisotropy i λ λt where t denotes the transverse direction and the log k variance σ2 y are used to parameterize the aquifer heterogeneity while the log k mean μy and effective porosity neff are considered as deterministic parameters and are adopted from gyopari 2014 with μy 6 86 and neff 0 25 table 1 summarizes the deterministic parameters used in the flow and transport modeling to our knowledge there have been no previous studies addressing solute or pathogen transport in the study area as groundwater velocities in the study area are high molecular diffusion becomes negligible compared to mechanical dispersion and the dispersion mechanism can be represented by the mechanical dispersion alone zheng and wang 1999 contaminant dispersion is parameterized using the longitudinal dispersivity α and transverse dispersivity ratio αt α based on numerical and experimental results from similar environments in new zealand sarris et al 2018 and previously published results zech et al 2015 a source at a random location is assumed to release a conservative fully soluble contaminant in the aquifer in the study area there has been evidence of solute and pathogen contamination recently following the 2016 kaikoura earthquake 7 8 mw but to the authors knowledge there have been no studies quantifying these accidental discharges contaminants are assumed to be released at a constant rate resulting in an average source strength c0 in most cases contaminants are expected to undergo some form of geochemical or biological transformation resulting in mass and concentration reductions renou et al 2008 these reductions are heavily dependent on the contaminant but also on the aquifer s physical chemical and biological environment such processes are not considered here as the focus of our study is the impact of aquifer heterogeneity monitoring locations and sampling frequency on contaminant detection probabilities the source is assumed steady state yenigül et al 2013 which physically corresponds to a source that remains active and potentially undetected or not remedied for sufficient time for the plume to potentially reach the pumping well under these conditions the transport of contaminants in fickian groundwater flow systems can be expressed as zheng and wang 1999 sarris et al 2018 2 θ c t θ d c θ v i c q s c s where d is the mechanical dispersion coefficient tensor vi is the linear pore water velocity defined as qi θ and relates the transport to the flow equation and cs is the concentration of the source fluxes qs the components of the mechanical dispersion tensor in two dimensions are bear 1979 bortone et al 2019 3 d x x α v x 2 v α t v y 2 v d y y α v y 2 v α t v x 2 v d x y d y x α α t v x v y v where v is the magnitude of the velocity vector flow and transport through the unsaturated zone is not considered in our study cases where ignoring the influence of the vadose zone to contaminant transport is appropriate include those where the contamination source is near or below the water table when the water table is shallow or when transport through the vadose zone is relatively fast through non stratified media and or fingered flow conditions wang et al 2018 sarris scott et al 2019 monte carlo scheme the flow and transport in the heterogeneous aquifer are studied in a stochastic framework using a monte carlo approach as follows for each combination of a set of flow λ i and σy 2 and transport α αt α model parameters two dimensional random hydraulic conductivity fields are generated using the sequential gaussian simulation method deutsch and journel 1997 aquifer heterogeneity and dispersion parameter values considered in this study have been selected to represent a range of heterogeneous environments gelhar 1986 sarris and paleologos 2004 burbery et al 2020 fiori et al 2013 zech et al 2015 de barros et al 2016 as summarized in table 2 for each simulated field a random contamination source location is selected across the study area the numerical steady state flow solution is obtained using modflow nwt niswonger et al 2011 while the transport problem is solved using mt3d usgs bedekar et al 2016 to reduce the computational burden and the prohibitive disk storage space requirements due to the large number of realizations required for solution convergence the transport solution is obtained for steady state transport conditions to estimate the stochastic contaminant arrival times advective transport travel times are obtained using modpath version 5 pollock 1994 by calculating the particle travel times from each grid cell to the sink or downgradient boundary detection statistics once all the realizations have been undertaken the point detection probability statistics are calculated at each grid cell this involves the calculation of true positive tp true negative tn false positive fp and false negative fn probabilities a positive negative outcome refers to whether the contamination reaches the well and true false outcome refers to the detection of the contamination from the monitoring well true detection is when the outcome positive or negative is correctly identified in terms of grid cell concentration exceeding a predefined detection limit c t h r in this study the threshold concentration at which detection occurs is c t h r 10 3 c 0 hudak 2001 for example the tp detection rate dt p i j n from n total realizations at a single location i j in the flow field is calculated according to 4 d t p i j n 1 n p o s n 1 n t p i j n where n p o s is the number of positive events and t p i j n denotes a tp detection at location i j for realization n 5 t p i j n 1 i f c w c t h r a n d c i j c t h r 0 o t h e r w i s e in 5 c w and c i j are the contaminant concentrations at the pumping well and monitoring location i j respectively for a monitoring network consisting of k sentinel wells the detection rate also known as sensitivity or true positive rate in biostatistics of the entire network d t p k is calculated as the size of the set of realizations where at least one of k wells has a tp detection divided by the total number of positive events yerushalmy 1947 6 d t p k 1 n p o s k s i j t p where s i j t p is the set of realizations where a tp detection occurred at location i j 7 s i j t p n t p i j n 1 the term k s i j t p is the union of the sets for each of the k wells in the network which gives the set of realizations where a tp detection occurred at any of the well locations ignoring any duplicate cases where 2 or more wells detect the contaminant plume in the same realization the size of this set is the total number of tp detections for the network therefore a crude effectiveness measure of a k well monitoring network could be obtained by calculating the network detection rate d t p k a monitoring network should however also provide an early indication of the imminent well contamination for remedial actions to be implemented bode et al 2016 by ensuring that transport time between first arrival at the monitoring network and arrival at the pumping well will be equal to or greater than a specified threshold t r for practical applications t r is associated with the sampling frequency and action implementation timeframes an optimal monitoring network layout can be obtained by maximizing d t p k such that all wells in the network satisfy the condition that the mean advective travel time t between the monitoring and pumping well is greater than t r a monitoring network should also minimize the risk of false positive detections which can be significant for non conservative and pathogenic contaminations and can result in significant supply disruptions alternatively the network effectiveness can be calculated with a risk correcting function papapetridis and paleologos 2011 that considers a the contamination detection rate adjusted for potential false positive detections b detection timing relative to t r and c the travel time uncertainty from the monitoring wells to the pumping well we propose a weighted risk function as 8 f r i s k k t r 1 k d t p k d f p k k f i j t r f i j σ where d f p k is the false positive detection rate of a k well network pagano and gauvreau 2018 given by 9 d f p k 1 n n e g k s i j f p s i j f p is the set of realizations where a fp detection occurred at location i j similar to 7 and n n e g is the total number of negative events in 8 the weighting term f i j t r accounts for the mean travel time t from a monitoring well located at i j to the pumping well and here is given by a sigmoid function ruppert et al 2015 sarris and paleologos 2004 with midpoint t r and slope t r 2 that smoothly increases from 0 to 1 as t increases from 0 to 2 t r 10 f i j t r 1 2 1 tanh t t r t r 2 this term greatly reduces the risk correcting function f r i s k k t r when travel time t from a monitoring well to the pumping well is less than the threshold t r whereas the slope which in 10 is set to t r 2 defines the distance from t r where f t r reaches its upper and lower limits as a result f t r aims to scale the effects of early and late detections by promoting early detection beyond a simple binary threshold of the form t t r the term f i j σ is weighting the uncertainty of the travel time estimates and here is given by 11 f i j σ 1 1 σ i j t where σ i j t is the average travel time standard deviation at i j expressed as a percentage of the average f i j σ is close to 1 when travel time uncertainty is low and decreases towards 0 as the uncertainty increases it follows from 9 through 11 that f r i s k k t r has a range 1 1 but for conservative contaminants within the well capture zone where dfp reduces towards zero its range reduces to 0 1 as such the quantity f r i s k k t r can be considered as the risk corrected detection probability of a random contamination source by a k well monitoring network for the purposes of this work risk is quantified in terms of monitoring and remedial action delays and uncertainties results and discussion number of realizations the number of realizations that are required for the monte carlo scheme solution to converge varies depending on the physical problem and the sources of uncertainty in our study the scheme is considered to have converged when the tp and tn detection rates stabilize after a sufficient number of realizations lahkim and garcia 1999 yenigül et al 2005 the term δ d t p i j n is defined as the change of the tp rates across the numerical grid denoted by the indices i and j after n realizations according to 12 δ d t p i j n d t p i j n 1 n 1 k 1 n 1 d t p i j k the δ d t p i j n standard deviation σ t p n for the nth realization can be calculated across the numerical grid in a similar manner δ d t n i j n and σ t n n can be calculated for the tn detection rates in our study the sum of σ t p n and σ t n n is used as the convergence criterion fig 2 a plots the scheme convergence with increasing number of monte carlo realizations for low dispersivity and heterogeneity whereas fig 2b plots the scheme convergence for the case with high dispersivity and high heterogeneity these figures indicate that the number of realizations to achieve convergence increases with increased heterogeneity and more dispersive conditions paleologos et al 2000 but convergence can be attained with 10 000 to 15 000 realizations for all cases the latter number is chosen for our numerical experiments contaminant travel time and detection rate based on the site heterogeneity conditions gyopari 2014 donaldson and campbell 1977 and similar environments in nz sarris et al 2018 burbery et al 2020 sarris close et al 2019 we considered λ 50 m i 5 συ 2 1 0 α 6 2 m αt α 0 1 as base model parameters using the ranges from table 2 to assess their effects on contaminant detection rates a base travel time threshold of t r 100 days is also considered to allow time for sampling the pumping well and some response time for mitigation papapetridis and paleologos 2012 this could correspond to quarterly sentinel well sampling approx 90 days between sampling runs with a 10 day response time or 60 day sampling intervals and longer response time 40 days and so on the tp detection rate eq 4 across the model domain for 4 different dispersivity cases is shown in fig 3 as expected tp is larger around the pumping well and directly downgradient the latter is the effect of dispersive transport at or near the well capture zone boundary higher tp rates indicate that a single monitoring point at this location should provide increased positive detection probabilities when the effect of t r is not considered such as for the zone downgradient of the pumping well where the contamination will be detected after the plume reached the pumping well tp increases considerably with increasing dispersivity particularly in the transverse direction as the lateral plume spreading facilitates detection there is some asymmetry in tp distribution across the domain for the highly dispersive flow conditions in fig 3d this is considered to be an artifact of the finite number of realizations undertaken lahkim and garcia 1999 papapetridis and paleologos 2011 sarris close et al 2019 however even when the tp distribution is obtained with a total of 25 000 realizations for the case with highest dispersivities and heterogeneity some residual albeit smaller asymmetry is still observed results not shown fig 4 shows the average advective travel time from each grid cell to the pumping well and the relative travel time standard deviation for different parameter values and increasing heterogeneity white denotes the area where particles never reach the pumping well while the colored area denotes the average capture zone note that these travel times were obtained using particle tracking considering advective transport alone ignoring dispersive effects when heterogeneity is low the average travel time to the pumping well is gaussian with little variability between realizations with increasing heterogeneity the capture zone size increases ayinippully nalarajan et al 2021 as does the variability between realizations even though the range of the average travel times does not change as shown in figs 4d 4f increasing statistical anisotropy has little effect on the spatial distribution of travel times and relative standard deviation σt figure s1 increasing λ from 20 m to 50 m and 500 m increases the capture zone size by 23 and 60 respectively figure s2 as the greater spatial continuity of the k field allows preferential transport to the pumping well from a larger part of the simulated aquifer cole and silliman 1997 increasing συ 2 also contributes to increased capture zone area and is the main contributor to the significant increase of σt figure s3 ayinippully nalarajan et al 2021 the tp and fp detection rates average advective travel time and resulting frisk for a single monitoring location for the model base parameters are shown in fig 5 unsurprisingly fp rate peaks downgradient and to the sides of the pumping well where monitoring is likely to detect up to 25 of contamination events that do not reach the supply well and perhaps unnecessarily trigger remedial responses frisk in fig 5 has been calculated for t r 100 d in the vicinity of the pumping well frisk reduces to almost zero despite the high tp and low fp rates as the average advective travel time t is below t r and any monitoring outcomes would not occur until after the water supply has been contaminated further from this zone frisk increases sharply as t approaches t r before decreasing as the distance from the well increases and tp rate decreases the area downgradient of the well with the highest frisk value shown in red in fig 5d is due to both the high tp rate fig 5c and the very low σt shown earlier in fig 4e on the border of the capture zone however the calculation of the travel time which is computed as the travel time between each grid cell and the pumping well does not consider the contaminant source location in most cases contaminant arrival times to the pumping well are going to be lower than to the monitoring location immediately downgradient of the well hence the constraint that the travel time is greater than t r alone without considering simulated arrival times is not a sufficient condition for early contamination detection in converging flows for that reason monitoring locations downgradient of the pumping well are not considered for monitoring network configurations the effect of t r on frisk for a single observation point is shown in fig 6 as t r increases the area surrounding the pumping well where f r i s k 0 also increases in size within this zone monitoring should not be expected to have a practical benefit the maximum frisk upgradient of the well is approximately 0 32 for t r 10 d and decreases to approximately 0 25 and 0 15 for t r equal to 100 d and 200 d respectively this suggests that earlier detection comes with significant reduction in the effectiveness of the monitoring scheme bode et al 2016 however this does not address the performance of monitoring networks consisting of multiple sentinel wells which is discussed in the following section monitoring network optimization a monitoring network is optimized by finding the locations that maximize the risk correcting function eq 8 for a prescribed network size i e number of monitoring wells because of the highly non linear nature of the optimization problem and the relatively small dimensionality of the phase space sarris and burbery 2018 brute force optimization is applied where the possible location combinations are sampled in sequence as discussed earlier possible monitoring locations are restricted to those upgradient of the pumping well to further reduce the computational burden the domain of possible network locations is restricted by assuming that the solution needs to be symmetric about the x 1 km plane in accordance with the average flow field symmetry it took approximately one hour of wall clock time to calculate an optimal 4 well network with 2 symmetric pairs of wells across a single model domain using a single core of an intel xeon gold 6150 server with 128 gb of memory and clock speed of 2 7 ghz sarris et al 2021 whereas an optimal 5 well network took multiple days as the problem dimensionality greatly increases with each additional well to reduce the computational burden in this study network sizes ranging from 1 to 4 wells are considered fig 7 shows the effect of flow and transport parameters on the optimal array locations while fig 8 summarizes the calculated detection statistics for each network optimal performance with a single monitoring well is always achieved with the well at the side of the capture zone and not immediately upgradient of the pumping well detection rates depend on the size of the monitoring network and the parameter values and range between 12 for a single monitoring location to 96 for four monitoring wells for landfill monitoring under uniform flow conditions and for instantaneous sources papapetridis and paleologos 2012 reported detection probabilities ranging between 5 and 35 for up to six monitoring wells while for similar flow settings yenigül et al 2005 estimated detection probabilities between 5 and 80 for twelve monitoring wells dropping to a maximum of 45 for six wells bode et al 2016 reported that a network of 8 monitoring wells placed immediately downgradient of known risk sources can provide detection probabilities of up to 91 there are several factors contributing to the greater detection rates with smaller number of monitoring wells in this study we only consider permanent sources in contrast to the instantaneous sources used in the aforementioned earlier studies that make the resulting plumes harder to detect unless a dense monitoring network is created for landfill monitoring and for permanent sources for example yenigül et al 2013 reported that detection probabilities from a 3 well network can be up to 85 if the distance from the source is large enough to our knowledge all previous studies consider monitoring downgradient of high risk areas under uniform flow conditions with the exception of bode et al 2016 that for numerical efficiency simulated random sources in the well capture zone with an arc of point sources that cannot account for the dispersive characteristics of plumes which would suggest a larger number of monitoring locations is needed in all cases of our study dfp is small and ranges between 0 and 8 this is to be expected since only permanent contaminant sources are considered with monitoring within the well capture zone instantaneous and non conservative sources would be expected to result in greater false positive detections with the term dfp contributing more to frisk our numerical results suggest that increasing longitudinal and transverse dispersivities figs 7a 8a result in large increases in frisk and tp detection rate under the most dispersive conditions a maximal detection rate 96 is achieved with 4 wells while a single well can correctly and timely identify 64 of all positive contamination events for low α and αt 0 62 m and 0 062 m respectively the detection rate from a single monitoring location is only 12 whereas a 4 well network achieves a peak detection rate of 49 for non convergent flow yenigül et al 2005 and papapetridis and paleologos 2011 reported increasing detection probability with increasing transverse dispersivities but they noted that after a threshold and as the plume dimensions increased concentrations reduced below the detection limit and the detection probabilities declined however yenigül et al 2013 for uniform flow but permanent contamination source concluded that detection probabilities continue increasing with increased dispersivities in our study due to the permanent source and the fact that flow and mass converge towards the pumping well the detection rate increased even with relatively unrealistically high αt more dispersive conditions also result in greater frisk values while increased αt also results in increased dfp for the least dispersive conditions frisk peaks with 4 sentinel wells but for all other cases and in contrast to the detection rate frisk peaks earlier with only 2 monitoring wells this is because the marginal dtp increase of each additional well is negated by a marginal increase in false positive detections and increased travel time uncertainty στ figs 7b d show the optimal networks for varying λ συ 2 and i values in all cases increasing the number of monitoring wells results in increasing dtp and frisk figs 8b d for each network size the value of these parameters appears to have only a small effect on the network spatial arrangement as shown earlier fig 4 smaller λ and συ 2 result in reduced advective travel time uncertainty and greater frisk for 1 to 2 monitoring wells dtp decreases with increasing λ as preferential flow and transport through better connected highly permeable parts of the aquifer is more pronounced with increasing network sizes 3 or 4 wells in our study these preferential pathways are better intercepted and dtp stabilizes increasing συ 2 results in increased dtp this is in contrast to the results of yenigül et al 2005 and papapetridis and paleologos 2011 who concluded that for non convergent flows detection probabilities decrease for increased heterogeneity συ 2 the latter authors suggested that in highly heterogeneous aquifers placing the wells closer to the known source was a necessary condition for detection to occur suggesting that increasing συ 2 potentially resulted in more dispersed plumes with concentrations below the detection limit however under converging flow conditions this is a lesser issue resulting in better detection of the more dispersed plumes the value of statistical anisotropy appears to have no effect on either dtp or frisk fig 8d and only a marginal effect on the spatial distribution of the monitoring wells fig 7d fig 7e shows the optimal networks with the travel time threshold t r varied from 10 to 200 days a low t r value implies a much higher monitoring frequency which may increase operating costs depending on the methods used for contaminant sampling and or measurement as expected increasing this threshold penalizes detections closer to the pumping well and decreases both dtp and frisk fig 8e while the optimal sentinel distance from the pumping well increases to allow for earlier detection bode et al 2016 when t r 10 days there is little benefit from installing more than two sentinel wells in fact the two wells can achieve a detection rate of 84 and a third sentinel well only contributes an additional 1 to the estimated dtp while its location is mostly driven by the relatively small travel time uncertainty σ t resulting in marginally larger frisk increasing t r to 200 days reduces dtp to 24 and 70 for 1 and 4 monitoring wells compared to 46 and 84 for 1 and 2 monitoring wells with t r 10 days discussion and practical applications in this study a risk corrected decision analysis model is proposed to determine optimal groundwater monitoring networks for the protection of production wells the general layout of our proposed network design stems from the line of defense concept proposed by bode et al 2016 2018 but consisting of significantly fewer wells due to the proposed risk correcting function and the stochastic numerical approach to the random source problem that fully considers the plume dispersion the focus of this study is to determine how the network detection rates are affected by aquifer heterogeneity and whether sufficient protection can be achieved from such networks as such certain numerical compromises had to be made to limit the computational burden of this study which included 216 parameter combinations with each one requiring 15 000 flow and transport simulations as a result we opted to ignore seasonal variations in boundary conditions transient transport and multiple retarded or degrading contaminants and represent a 3d aquifer and transport problem with a 2d numerical approximation even though there can be compelling cases made for all of these assumptions it would be expected that in a practical application these may be considered in a more site specific manner for example multiple contaminants based on the catchment land uses and hydro geochemisty can be considered where cthr values can be contaminant specific conclusions in this numerical study monte carlo stochastic analysis is used to simulate groundwater flow and contaminant transport in a heterogeneous two dimensional aquifer the flow field is strongly affected by a pumping well used as a drinking water supply pollution originates from a steady state source at a random location we consider how heterogeneity and dispersion parameters affect the timely and accurate detection of contamination events of monitoring networks consisting of 1 to 4 monitoring wells network performance is measured as a risk correcting function considering the network s true and false positive detections sampling frequency in terms of early detection and the associated uncertainty the following major conclusions can be drawn from our study 1 convergence of the point detection rates was not always achieved after 15 000 realizations the true positive and true negative detection probability standard deviations were used across the field as a convergence criterion and established that 10 000 15 000 realizations should suffice for probabilistic solutions to stabilize however for highly heterogeneous and highly dispersive transport conditions spatially distributed average values of true positive detection probabilities and advective travel time standard deviations remained nonsymmetrical even after as many as 25 000 realizations 2 our results indicate that in all cases of aquifer heterogeneity and dispersion increasing the number of wells used for monitoring purposes resulted in greater detection rate of contamination events for the base parameters of our study and from a single monitoring well it is expected that at least 32 of all contamination events that reach the water supply well would be correctly and timely identified increasing to 80 for a network consisting of four wells for computational reasons our analysis was limited to a maximum of 4 monitoring wells but detection rates of the order of 75 were achieved frequently with only 3 monitoring wells 3 aquifer dispersivity is the dominant parameter for the quantification of network performance for fixed heterogeneity λ συ 2 and i and number of wells detection rate increases with increased longitudinal and transverse dispersivities our numerical results suggest that in contrast to previously published results for non convergent flows and instantaneous sources further increasing dispersion parameters does not result in detection rate reduction under the least dispersive conditions in our study the detection rate is 12 and 49 for 1 and 4 monitoring wells respectively increasing to 64 and 96 for the largest dispersivity values considered 4 for fixed dispersion parameters increasing spatial continuity of the gaussian conductivity field resulted in decreased detection rate when up to two wells were considered due to preferential flow and transport increasing the number of monitoring wells resulted in no obvious differences between dtp achieved for the three considered λ values suggesting that these preferential pathways are adequately captured by the network 5 increasing συ 2 resulted in greater detection rates for networks consisting of up to 3 wells once a fourth well was added to the network συ 2 did not affect the dtp statistical anisotropy did not appear to have a noticeable effect on the network detection rate 6 earlier detection for remedial action comes with a significant cost in terms of detection rate increasing t r from 100 to 200 days results in 17 21 and 10 lower detection rates for 2 3 and 4 monitoring wells respectively false positive rates are also expected to increase from 1 to 4 for networks of 3 and 4 wells respectively future work will expand the scope of this study to address microbial risk and non conservative
