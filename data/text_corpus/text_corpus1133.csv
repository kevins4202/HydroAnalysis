5665,this study examined radon concentrations in springs in kumamoto and aso regions following the 2016 kumamoto earthquake in addition to monitoring springs near the futagawa hinagu fault zone for more than two years following the earthquake to investigate the relationship between crustal deformation and the radon concentration variation we compared these radon concentrations with those obtained prior to the earthquake the springs that showed elevated radon concentrations were located within the compressive strain quadrant of the earthquake the post seismic concentration variations of the monitored springs can be explained by rock porosity changes these results suggest that the radon concentration in spring water is affected by porosity changes caused by stress changes derived from earthquake deformation and subsequent post seismic relaxation our results are consistent with the previously inferred permeability enhancement model mass conservation calculations for radon release yielded porosity changes ranging from 30 to 70 for some aquifer systems this study explores the possibility of radon monitoring as a tool to investigate not only seismic precursors but also post seismic crustal deformation and aquifer property changes due to large earthquakes on a regional scale keywords 2016 kumamoto earthquake springs radon futagawa hinagu faults porosity volumetric strain 1 introduction pre and post seismic changes of chemical components in crustal fluids groundwater and gas geochemistry have been previously reported in geochemical studies studies on gas geochemistry and seismotectonics are well reviewed by toutain and baubron 1999 radon 222rn in particular is one of the components anticipated to change as a precursory indicator of an earthquake

occurs naturally in earth s crust as an intermediate step in the uranium series radioactive decay chain radon is highly soluble in water and its behavior and concentration in groundwater are strongly influenced by geological nature thus radon has been used as a tracer in the groundwater cycle barberio et al 2018 water budget and flux avery et al 2018 ono et al 2011 and in evaluating submarine groundwater discharges nikpeyman et al 2016 2019 radon release rates essentially depend on the physical properties of rocks mainly the surface area and porosity e g unscear 2000 thus measuring the radon concentration in crustal fluids and groundwater can therefore contribute to understanding the state of crustal deformation such as crack formation or strain changes which naturally increase before and in response to the occurrence of earthquakes unscear 2000 groundwater radon concentrations show daily and annual variations as a result of temperature and atmospheric pressure changes barberio et al 2018 in addition to these daily and seasonal variations anomalous radon concentration changes are observed prior to some earthquakes radon studies as earthquake forecasting have been summarized and the features of radon anomalies such as the relationships between radon anomalies and earthquake size distance and time interval have been evaluated e g hauksson 1981 riggio and santulin 2015 recently real time radon detection in soil gas has occurred since 2015 in italy and relationships between earthquakes and radon anomalies are becoming clear by the use of precise data sets nicoli et al 2019 research related to crustal deformation using radon in groundwater have been discussed in terms of temporal variation or distribution maps of radon concentrations e g wakita et al 1980 igarashi et al 1995 kuo et al 2006 tsunomori and tanaka 2014 the successive monitoring of groundwater radon concentrations has been conducted for earthquake prediction and some studies have successfully detected changes relevant to past large earthquakes changes in radon concentrations were mainly observed prior to earthquakes and led to qualitative discussions associated with mixing of water and the change of the radon release rate expansion of rocks new crack formation inequality between gas and water phases by sonic wave and or crack ratio and porosity change during recent decades variations of pre seismic radon concentrations have been explained considering the physical parameters of radon release such as a volatilization model which considers changes in the aquifer headspace e g kuo et al 2006 2009 2010 2011 tsunomori and tanaka 2014 in addition using the radon concentration distribution studies investigating the existence or extension of unexposed active faults sections have also been conducted these were based on fault zones involving larger surface areas than massive rock tsunomori et al 2017 kawabata et al 2018 however the number of studies documenting the relationship between structural deformations and radon concentrations remains insufficient to comprehensively understand the systems that cause changes in radon concentrations following large earthquakes in natural watershed systems on a regional scale in the kumamoto region many natural springs are formed by the region s characteristic geology which contains many porous pyroclastic deposits from the aso volcano and its groundwater system has been well studied and monitored e g summarized in hosono et al 2013 in 2016 the kumamoto earthquake sequence occurred the first earthquake occurred on april 14 with a moment magnitude mw of 6 2 and the main event mw 7 0 occurred on april 16 extensive damage was caused by both earthquakes and crustal deformations such as surface ruptures and horizontal sliding were observed fujiwara et al 2016 tsuji et al 2017 for the groundwater system changes in the water level and discharge and newly discharging springs were also widely reported in the kumamoto and aso regions sano et al 2016 hosono et al 2018 2019 hosono and masaki 2020 these observations suggest that crustal deformation caused by the 2016 kumamoto earthquake strongly affected aquifer properties and groundwater and spring systems in these areas for the springs in the kumamoto and aso regions we used pre seismic radon concentration data from 2009 following the earthquake we measured the radon concentrations of springs in both regions in 2017 including springs along the futagawa hinagu fault zone that was activated by the earthquakes in this study we report on the spatial variations in spring water radon concentrations between pre and post seismic conditions we also intermittently monitored the springs along and near the futagawa hinagu fault zone for over two years following the earthquake and herein we discuss the various factors of post seismic radon release mechanisms overall we reveal the possible cause of spatiotemporal radon concentration changes in groundwater systems following large crustal earthquakes considering aquifer property changes on a regional scale 2 regional geologic and hydrologic setting central kyushu contains a graben structure called the beppu shimabara graben where low gravity zones and normal faults are observed matsumoto 1979 the graben was thought to have formed from a combination of hot mantle upwelling beneath active volcanoes including the aso volcano the opening of the okinawa trough in the west of kyushu and the presence of the median tectonic line e g zhao et al 2018 several historical earthquakes have been recorded in this zone and the 2016 kumamoto earthquakes occurred on one of the largest active faults in the graben i e the futagawa hinagu fault zone fig 1 in the central kumamoto and aso regions basement rocks are composed of volcanic rocks pre aso volcanic rocks ranging from 0 4 to 2 ma granite and metamorphic rocks the basement is overlain by subsequent pyroclastic flow deposits from the aso volcano referred to as aso 1 aso 2 aso 3 and aso 4 and alluvial deposits fig 1 in the aso caldera central cones are distributed and are covered by unconsolidated alluvial deposits around the wall of the aso caldera pre aso volcanic rocks of older ages are covered by younger quaternary aso pyroclastic flows on the western coast alluvial deposits of the clay ariake formation overlie sandy layers distributed on the kumamoto plain the climate of the study area is categorized as warm and humid is influenced by the asian monsoon and shows four distinct seasons http www data jma go jp gmd cpd longfcst en tourist html the average annual temperature and precipitation of kumamoto were 16 9 c and 1986 mm respectively during 1981 2010 http www jma go jp jma menu report html approximately 40 of total precipitation occurred during the summer rainy season in june july groundwater levels showed systematic annual fluctuations associated with annual hydrological cycles i e highest during september october and lowest during april may well water level data are available from http www city kumamoto jp the kumamoto region is hydrogeologically characterized by active groundwater flows within the pyroclastic deposits aso 1 to aso 4 porous lavas and alluvial deposits e g hosono et al 2013 two major aquifer systems exist the first is an unconfined aquifer shallower than 90 m in depth and the second is a confined to semi confined aquifer distributed between 20 and 250 m in depth both aquifers are recharged vertically through highly permeable volcanic deposits in foot of mountain and surrounding plateaus at elevation ca 200 m above sea level taniguchi et al 2003 okumura et al 2018 groundwater then flows laterally southward and westward along topographical gradients besides these regional groundwater flow systems many mountain springs occur at the base of surrounding mountains fig 1 during the 2016 kumamoto earthquake sequence a series of large earthquakes also occurred along the hinagu futagawa fault zone fujiwara et al 2016 goto et al 2017 this series began along the hinagu fault with a mw 6 2 foreshock on april 14 and the largest event mw 7 0 occurring 28 h later april 16 along the futagawa fault as a normal right lateral motion surface deformation was expressed as subsidence and uplift on the northern and southern side of the futagawa fault respectively and the associated displacement faults near suizenji lake were also reported fujiwara et al 2016 the newly observed faults crosscut the groundwater flow system and thus altered the groundwater flow system including local discharge hosono et al 2019 the observed deformation and change in spring discharge can both be explained as the result of a large volumetric strain change caused by the earthquakes 3 sampling and measurement procedures we obtained spring water from 50 springs in the kumamoto and aso regions in 2017 and also monitored 11 springs along the futagawa hinagu fault zone over two years following the earthquake fig 1 tables 1 and 2 we collected spring water in plastic bottles and ensured the samples were not exposed to air radon concentrations of the samples were measured using a radon monitor rtm 1688 sarad gmbh germany attached to a gas water separation bottle in the laboratory at kagoshima university as for the groundwater data collected in 2009 spring waters were sampled in glass bottles and a rad7 radon detector durridge company inc usa was used to monitor radon concentrations both monitoring devices use the electrostatic collection method for measurement our instrumental setup for determining the radon concentration of water is shown in fig 2 we used a similar setup and method as tsunomori et al 2017 a 1 0 l volume of groundwater was transferred into a 2 2 l bottle from a polyethylene sampling bottle and was then sealed with a screwcap containing two tube connectors the bottled spring water was heavily agitated by hand for three minutes to achieve a gas liquid equilibrium as quickly as possible the air in the gas phase in the bottle was then dehumidified by passing it through a drierite drying column and was introduced into a radon monitor using a pump the monitor contained a radon detector that uses the electrostatic collection method for measurement the number of alpha particles emitted from radon daughter product ions polonium was counted continuously for 15 min for each measurement we carried out three continuous sets of measurements for each sample taking the second and the third values as the radon concentration data in the gas phase due to the case for incomplete equilibrium conditions during the first measurement period the monitor output a radon concentration in the gas phase of the radon measurement system we then estimated the radon concentration in the aqueous phase by considering both the time elapsed from the date of sampling and the diffusion of radon from the sampling bottle into the air the equation for the conservation of radon in gas and water in the measurement system is c a v a c w v w c a e q v a c w e q v w where ca and cw are the radon concentrations in the gas phase and water phase respectively before agitation and ca eq and cw eq show the radon concentration in the gas and water phases in an equilibrium condition respectively va and vw show the volumes of the gas and water phase respectively the radon equilibrium constant is written as k d c w e q c a e q 0 15 0 403 exp 0 0502 t weigel 1978 we can assume ca is 0 here thus the radon concentration in water prior to measurement cw can be estimated 1 k d c w e q c a e q 0 15 0 403 exp 0 0502 t after sampling radon in water decays and diffuses from water to air through the sampling bottle kawabata et al 2019 developed an estimation method for the radon concentration considering its diffusion from a polyethylene bottle into the air this proposed method was used in this study such that cw decay was estimated using the following equation 2 c w 0 c w e a t where cw0 is the radon concentration in water during sampling and a is a constant including the diffusion coefficient of radon from polyethylene to air parameters relating to the polyethylene bottle and the decay constant of radon 3 05 10 6 for the polyethylene bottle used in this study for more details see kawabata et al 2019 t is the elapsed time between sampling and measurement measured data are provided in tables 1 and 2 groundwater residence times have been determined for target springs that range from a few years to 40 years kagabu et al 2011 2017 previous studies explain that recharged water travels under the surface without significant mixing with surface water along flow paths and these outflow from each spring site which is driven by piston flow systems in typical volcanic aquifers e g kagabu et al 2011 2017 hosono et al 2019 therefore we assume that groundwater pathways and the type and property of relatively homogeneous volcanic aquifer geologies are site specific thus the radon concentrations in spring water at each spring site are fairly constant with some seasonal fluctuations through the flow systems unless major structural changes occur such as large destructive earthquakes 4 results 4 1 radon concentrations of spring water in 2009 and 2017 the radon concentrations of spring water sampled in 2009 and 2017 are shown in fig 3 radon concentrations ranged from 183 to 21567 bq m3 in 2009 and from 1180 to 60144 bq m3 in 2017 table 1 both radon concentration distributions showed similar trends 1 higher concentrations occurred along the futagawa hinagu fault 2 the jog and step regions of the fault showed higher concentrations and 3 springs on or near terrace deposits distributed between aso mountain and the kumamoto plain showed higher concentrations in addition a high radon anomaly appeared along the nnw sse suizenji fault system after the earthquake fujiwara et al 2016 these results suggest that radon concentrations are related to the local geology and fault distribution fig 4 displays the relationship between radon concentrations measured in 2009 and 2017 according to ono et al 2011 radon concentrations in groundwater through two major aquifers in the kumamoto area show seasonal variations that can reach a 30 maximum ratio the confined aquifer can be assumed as a piston flow which means the flow is relatively stable unless major structural changes occur during the nine years from 2009 there were no large earthquakes over m4 5 and only one m4 5 earthquake occurred at northern kumamoto in 2011 http www jma go jp jma menu report html thus we assume this value i e 30 can be regarded as the maximum seasonal radon concentration fluctuation including possible changes in response to discharge rates changes outside this concentration range can be considered to be changes triggered by the earthquake radon concentrations in ten springs increased and in four springs they decreased outside of this possible maximum seasonal variation following the kumamoto earthquake fig 5 shows that springs displaying larger changes in the radon concentration are located near the mountainside and the majority of the springs with increased concentrations are located in the earthquake s compressive stress field which was alculated by hosono et al 2019 4 2 time series of groundwater radon concentration data we monitored 11 springs over the two years following the kumamoto earthquake six of these monitored springs were also sampled prior to the earthquake time series data of radon concentrations at each spring are shown in fig 6 and table 2 we classified the monitored springs into three types types ia ib and ii by their radon concentration variations springs classified as type ia s2 s36 s38 and s40 had drastically increased radon concentrations before or after the earthquake which gradually decreased to pre seismic values over time type ib s37 s39 s48 s49 and s50 had similar post seismic trends as type ia springs however pre seismic data was lacking to confirm if their values spiked springs located in the aso caldera were included in this type we classified s16 and s17 as type ii springs in which the radon concentration exhibited post seismic changes but did not return to pre seismic concentrations over time radon concentrations were higher in s16 and lower in s17 as for s17 the data may also be interpreted as approaching a pre seismic level i e type ia 5 discussion 5 1 possible mechanisms for pre and post seismic radon concentration changes we monitored and measured radon concentrations in springs following the kumamoto earthquake and compared these data with those collected before the earthquake to detect crustal and aquifer transformations the results of our comparison show that the radon concentration changed in 15 springs over the inferred seasonal variation fig 4 the springs with the sharpest increases in radon concentration are also distributed in the compressive stress field of the earthquake fig 5 the majority of the temporally monitored springs displayed an increased radon concentration after the earthquake and a subsequent gradual decrease fig 6 the simplest mechanism for altering radon concentrations is mixing with meteoric water or another aquifer with a different radon concentration groundwater discharge at shores and lakes has been studied to consider radon mixing ono et al 2011 nikpeyman et al 2016 2019 physical factors have also been considered in the radon mass conservation equation e g kuo et al 2006 tsunomori and tanaka 2014 the conservation equation for radon in a fracture system is tsunomori and tanaka 2014 which is from unscear 2000 3 c ra ρ e λ s v 1 ε c a 1 r s c w r s ε where cra ρ λ sv and ε are the mean radium concentration in the rock bq kg the mean density of the rock kg m3 the half life of radon s 1 the surface area per unit volume m2 and the mean porosity of the rock respectively e is the emission rate of radon m 2 s 1 ca and cw are the radon concentrations in the gas and water phase respectively in pore spaces and rs is the saturation ratio for water in fracture system in the equation cra ρ e and λ are constants that are dependent on host rocks aquifer properties whereas sv rs and ε are factors that are strongly affected by crustal deformation the sv would increase with the formation of fractures and cracks leading to higher radon concentrations and rs would increase or decrease based on changes in the water volume in the rocks aquifer which produce higher and lower radon concentrations a larger ε results in lower radon concentrations caused by volumetric strain change thus causes of changing radon concentrations can be summarized by 1 dilution by mixing with meteoric water or water from another aquifer 2 increased or decreased radon concentrations due to changes in the saturation ratio 3 increased radon concentrations by increasing the surface area and 4 increased or decreased radon concentrations due to changes in porosity we understand that another factor i e the solar cycle causes daily oscillations of temperature atmospheric pressure and micro deformations that can change the groundwater radon concentration barberio et al 2018 however we considered that these effects are incorporated in seasonal fluctuations as mentioned above and hence we did not evaluate these effects individually we compared the time series data of groundwater radon concentrations with rainfall amounts flow rates and nitrate no3 and chloride ions cl in order to consider dilution by mixing with meteoric and other waters figs 6 9 it seems that the rainfall amount is not directly correlated to the flow rate at each spring although the flow rate may show seasonal variations fig 10 which would support the assumption of piston flow for aquifers both the rainfall amount and flow rate were uncorrelated with the radon concentration variation figs 6 and 7 the flow rate at s36 decreased drastically which is likely to have affected radon concentrations however the fluctuation patterns in the flow rate and radon concentration during the monitoring period are not in agreement thus direct infiltration of rainwater as a bypass flow is unlikely to have played a role in controlling the radon concentrations in groundwater in this case fig 8 shows that no3 drastically increased after the earthquake in most monitored springs and subsequently decreased sharply no3 is known to be an artificial soil additive which suggests that the post seismic increase is due to soil water including no3 mixing with the aquifer which was likely due to enhanced permeability caused by seismic shaking hosono and masaki 2020 sato et al 2020 discuss pre and post seismic no3 variations in this special issue the effect of mixing with soil water was limited to within a few months following the earthquake fig 9 shows the radon concentrations and cl changes decreased cl concentrations directly indicate dilution by groundwater hosono and masaki 2020 reported drastic cl changes in the northern kumamoto area similar but smaller post seismic trends were observed for some springs ca s38 and s50 suggesting a small degree of mixing with diluted water however the majority of the springs showed small variations and clear correlations between radon concentrations and cl decreases were not observed these results indicate that a dilution effect is not clearly reflected in the radon concentrations in the monitored springs according to the physical model of radon concentrations described previously lowering the water saturation ratio decreases radon concentrations because radon in water is redistributed from the water to the gas phase in pore spaces however aquifer systems are generally thought to be saturated by the water phase i e without a gas phase and thus the saturation ratio rs in this study can be assumed to be 1 0 both before and after the earthquake faulting such as a frictional slip along fault surfaces fracturing at the fault core and crack formation in damage zones are always increase surface area the cores of mature faults i e fault core contain grains 10 nm in diameter and the surface area of the entire fault increases to 1 4 108 m2 per unit area chester et al 2005 ma et al 2006 thus groundwater flowing through a fault core would have a higher radon concentration high radon concentration anomalies that appeared along the newly recognized suizenji fault system fig 3b fujiwara et al 2016 may have been caused by co seismic radon release into water from the newly formed surface area this explanation is consistent with tsunomori et al 2017 which surveyed an active fault distribution using the radon concentration distribution on the basis of fault surface area variations spring water from site s17 directly discharges through a part of the futagawa fault where the displacement caused by the 2016 earthquake appeared just behind the spring however the radon concentration declined after the earthquake a fault zone near the ground surface would have opened the system to air and surface ruptures are generally formed by grain sliding rather than by cutting mineral bonds on a microscale thus the decreased radon concentration in the s17 spring suggests that the surface area increase is negligible and or that other factors may have a greater influence than increased surface area additionally a surface area increase due to faulting is irreversible around the ground surface thus any increase in the radon concentration due to the surface area increase would not decrease thereafter time series variations of the radon concentration display gradual decreases for type ia and ib springs indicating that the variations were not likely caused by surface area increases for the majority of spring waters with the likely exception of near the suizenji fault system formation porosity ε would be affected by crustal deformation mainly by volumetric strain change if the aquifer system was placed under compressional strain the radon concentration in groundwater should increase with the porosity decrease due to the change in the water rock ratio the volumetric strain rate following the kumamoto earthquake was estimated around the kumamoto and aso regions hosono et al 2019 springs showing large increases in radon concentrations tended to be distributed in the compressive quadrant of the strain field fig 5 birchard and libby 1980 reported that radon anomalies in soil gas along the san jacinto fault in southern california depend on seismic compression and the dilation field causing gas outflow and inflow in this study the distribution of groundwater radon variation corresponding to the strain field indicates that a porosity change would have affected the radon concentration time series variations of radon concentrations display gradual decreases in type ia and ib springs following the earthquake which could be explained by the porosity that was regained as a result of post seismic stress relaxation springs classified as type ii also showed no relation to the saturation ratio and surface area s16 may also be interpreted as approaching a pre seismic level after an increase in the radon concentration due to the porosity change s17 is the springs on the futagawa fault thus a radon release mechanism without dependence on the mass conservation law can be proposed such as radon release into air by formed cracks connecting to the ground surface 5 2 post seismic porosity changes estimated by radon concentration we discussed the four mechanisms of changing radon concentrations in section 5 1 among the factors of 1 mixing 2 saturation ratio 3 surface area and 4 porosity only a porosity change can explain both the radon concentration variations and their distribution on a strain map for most springs we attempted to estimate this porosity change rate caused by the kumamoto earthquake using eq 2 for variation type ia s2 s36 s38 and s40 according to unscear 2000 and tsunomori and tanaka 2014 typical values of cra 30 bq kg ρ 2700 kg m λ 3 0 10 6 s 1 and ε 5 2 10 12 m 2 s 1 were used for calculation as discussed in section 5 1 we can assume that groundwater entirely saturates the pore space i e rs 1 for aquifers therefore the radon concentration in water is shown as a relationship between porosity and surface area as follows 4 c ra ρ e λ s v 1 ε c a 1 r s c w r s ε the porosities of the aso 4 pyroclastic formation in kumamoto are reported as ranging from 11 to 76 yamaguchi et al 2000 here we assume that the porosity of the aquifer prior to the earthquake was a typical value i e 30 assuming ε 0 3 prior to the earthquake and rs 1 before and after the earthquake we calculated porosities at the maximum and minimum post seismic radon concentrations table 3 calculated porosities at the maximum radon concentration just after the earthquake show 0 08 s36 0 15 s2 0 19 s38 and 0 21 s40 which are 72 49 37 and 30 lower than pre seismic condition respectively fig 11 and table 3 the decreased porosity then gradually increased to pre seismic levels which may have been caused by stress relaxation however these are rough estimations and a 72 decrease in porosity may not be a realistic value the value becomes smaller when we considered seasonal variations and assumed higher initial porosity for example if we assume 0 7 70 for initial porosity which is the values of a weakly welded part of aso pyroclastic flow deposits the porosities after the earthquake become 0 33 s36 0 50 s2 0 56 s38 and 0 59 s40 which show 53 29 20 and 16 decreases respectively accurate values of porosity change can be estimated by obtaining seasonal variations of the steady state situation and the physical properties of aquifers in the future recent studies in the same field revealed the occurrence of mountain water release due to permeability enhancement that led to subsequent water increases in downslope aquifer systems hosono et al 2019 the findings of the present study suggest that crustal earthquakes alter hydrogeological properties i e porosity and permeability of aquifer systems at a regional scale radon concentrations have successfully been applied to detect co seismic changes most frequently at some specific monitoring well sites e g wakita et al 1980 kuo et al 2006 2009 tsunomori and tanaka 2014 however their spatiotemporal variations are rarely investigated due to the lack of comparable datasets this study demonstrates its potential utility in investigating the spatiotemporal distribution of crustal deformations and aquifer property changes 6 conclusions radon concentrations in spring waters were monitored following the 2016 kumamoto earthquake and were compared to those measured prior to the earthquake eleven springs near the futagawa hinagu fault zone were monitored for 2 years after the earthquake the results suggest that the radon concentrations of the springs changed between the pre and post seismic periods the radon concentration variations in the monitored springs were classified into three types ia ib and ii types ia and ib showed gradual post seismic changes which appeared to return to pre seismic values the factors affecting radon concentrations in water are 1 groundwater mixing 2 change in the saturation ratio of the aquifer 3 increased rock surface area and 4 changes in porosity the areal distribution map shows that springs with large increases are all located in the compressive quadrant of the volumetric strain field post seismic radon variations in the monitored springs can be explained by porosity changes between pre and post seismic conditions these results suggest that the radon concentrations of spring water were affected by porosity changes caused by compressive earthquake strain and the subsequent post seismic relaxation assuming the initial porosity was 30 porosity changes due to the earthquake were calculated as 30 70 for each spring more accurate porosity values could be estimated by obtaining detailed physical properties of the aquifers around these springs in the future this research reveals that the radon concentration response to crustal deformation can be caused by earthquake induced volumetric strain change and its relaxation at the catchment scale the findings suggest the possibility of using groundwater radon concentrations to monitor not only earthquake precursors but also post seismic crustal deformation processes a critical point of this work is represented by the necessity to develop a more thorough explanation of rock deformation prior and post

5665,this study examined radon concentrations in springs in kumamoto and aso regions following the 2016 kumamoto earthquake in addition to monitoring springs near the futagawa hinagu fault zone for more than two years following the earthquake to investigate the relationship between crustal deformation and the radon concentration variation we compared these radon concentrations with those

and horizontal sliding were observed fujiwara et al 2016 tsuji et al 2017 for the groundwater system changes in the water level and discharge and newly discharging springs were also widely reported in the kumamoto and aso regions sano et al 2016 hosono et al 2018 2019 hosono and masaki 2020 these observations suggest that crustal deformation caused by the 2016 kumamoto earthquake strongly affected aquifer properties and groundwater and spring systems in these areas for the springs in the kumamoto and aso regions we used pre seismic radon concentration data from 2009 following the earthquake we measured the radon concentrations of springs in both regions in 2017 including springs along the futagawa hinagu fault zone that was activated by the earthquakes in this study we report on the spatial variations in spring water radon concentrations between pre and post seismic conditions we also intermittently monitored the springs along and near the futagawa hinagu fault zone for over two years following the earthquake and herein we discuss the various factors of post seismic radon release mechanisms overall we reveal the possible cause of spatiotemporal radon concentration changes in groundwater systems following large crustal earthquakes considering aquifer property changes on a regional scale 2 regional geologic and hydrologic setting central kyushu contains a graben structure called the beppu shimabara graben where low gravity zones and normal faults are observed matsumoto 1979 the graben was thought to have formed from a combination of hot mantle upwelling beneath active volcanoes including the aso volcano the opening of the okinawa trough in the west of kyushu and the presence of the median tectonic line e g zhao et al 2018 several historical earthquakes have been recorded in this zone and the 2016 kumamoto earthquakes occurred on one of the largest active faults in the graben i e the futagawa hinagu fault zone fig 1 in the central kumamoto and aso regions basement rocks are composed of volcanic rocks pre aso volcanic rocks ranging from 0 4 to 2 ma granite and metamorphic rocks the basement is overlain by subsequent pyroclastic flow deposits from the aso volcano referred to as aso 1 aso 2 aso 3 and aso 4 and alluvial deposits fig 1 in the aso caldera central cones are distributed and are covered by unconsolidated alluvial deposits around the wall of the aso caldera pre aso volcanic rocks of older ages are covered by younger quaternary aso pyroclastic flows on the western coast alluvial deposits of the clay ariake formation overlie sandy layers distributed on the kumamoto plain the climate of the study area is categorized as warm and humid is influenced by the asian monsoon and shows four distinct seasons http www data jma go jp gmd cpd longfcst en tourist html the average annual temperature and precipitation of kumamoto were 16 9 c and 1986 mm respectively during 1981 2010 http www jma go jp jma menu report html approximately 40 of total precipitation occurred during the summer rainy season in june july groundwater levels showed systematic annual fluctuations associated with annual hydrological cycles i e highest during september october and lowest during april may well water level data are available from http www city kumamoto jp the kumamoto region is hydrogeologically characterized by active groundwater flows within the pyroclastic deposits aso 1 to aso 4 porous lavas and alluvial deposits e g hosono et al 2013 two major aquifer systems exist the first is an unconfined aquifer shallower than 90 m in depth and the second is a confined to semi confined aquifer distributed between 20 and 250 m in depth both aquifers are recharged vertically through highly permeable volcanic deposits in foot of mountain and surrounding plateaus at elevation ca 200 m above sea level taniguchi et al 2003 okumura et al 2018 groundwater then flows laterally southward and westward along topographical gradients besides these regional groundwater flow systems many mountain springs occur at the base of surrounding mountains fig 1 during the 2016 kumamoto earthquake sequence a series of large earthquakes also occurred along the hinagu futagawa fault zone fujiwara et al 2016 goto et al 2017 this series began along the hinagu fault with a mw 6 2 foreshock on april 14 and the largest event mw 7 0 occurring 28 h later april 16 along the futagawa fault as a normal right lateral motion surface deformation was expressed as subsidence and uplift on the northern and southern side of the futagawa fault respectively and the associated displacement faults near suizenji lake were also reported fujiwara et al 2016 the newly observed faults crosscut the groundwater flow system and thus altered the groundwater flow system including local discharge hosono et al 2019 the observed deformation and change in spring discharge can both be explained as the result of a large volumetric strain change caused by the earthquakes 3 sampling and measurement procedures we obtained spring water from 50 springs in the kumamoto and aso regions in 2017 and also monitored 11 springs along the futagawa hinagu fault zone over two years following the earthquake fig 1 tables 1 and 2 we collected spring water in plastic bottles and ensured the samples were not exposed to air radon concentrations of the samples were measured using a radon monitor rtm 1688 sarad gmbh germany attached to a gas water separation bottle in the laboratory at kagoshima university as for the groundwater data collected in 2009 spring waters were sampled in glass bottles and a rad7 radon detector durridge company inc usa was used to monitor radon concentrations both monitoring devices use the electrostatic collection method for measurement our instrumental setup for determining the radon concentration of water is shown in fig 2 we used a similar setup and method as tsunomori et al 2017 a 1 0 l volume of groundwater was transferred into a 2 2 l bottle from a polyethylene sampling bottle and was then sealed with a screwcap containing two tube connectors the bottled spring water was heavily agitated by hand for three minutes to achieve a gas liquid equilibrium as quickly as possible the air in the gas phase in the bottle was then dehumidified by passing it through a drierite drying column and was introduced into a radon monitor using a pump the monitor contained a radon detector that uses the electrostatic collection method for measurement the number of alpha particles emitted from radon daughter product ions polonium was counted continuously for 15 min for each measurement we carried out three continuous sets of measurements for each sample taking the second and the third values as the radon concentration data in the gas phase due to the case for incomplete equilibrium conditions during the first measurement period the monitor output a radon concentration in the gas phase of the radon measurement system we then estimated the radon concentration in the aqueous phase by considering both the time elapsed from the date of sampling and the diffusion of radon from the sampling bottle into the air the equation for the conservation of radon in gas and water in the measurement system is c a v a c w v w c a e q v a c w e q v w where ca and cw are the radon concentrations in the gas phase and water phase respectively before agitation and ca eq and cw eq show the radon concentration in the gas and water phases in an equilibrium condition respectively va and vw show the volumes of the gas and water phase respectively the radon equilibrium constant is written as k d c w e q c a e q 0 15 0 403 exp 0 0502 t weigel 1978 we can assume ca is 0 here thus the radon concentration in water prior to measurement cw can be estimated 1 k d c w e q c a e q 0 15 0 403 exp 0 0502 t after sampling radon in water decays and diffuses from water to air through the sampling bottle kawabata et al 2019 developed an estimation method for the radon concentration considering its diffusion from a polyethylene bottle into the air this proposed method was used in this study such that cw decay was estimated using the following equation 2 c w 0 c w e a t where cw0 is the radon concentration in water during sampling and a is a constant including the diffusion coefficient of radon from polyethylene to air parameters relating to the polyethylene bottle and the decay constant of radon 3 05 10 6 for the polyethylene bottle used in this study for more details see kawabata et al 2019 t is the elapsed time between sampling and measurement measured data are provided in tables 1 and 2 groundwater residence times have been determined for target springs that range from a few years to 40 years kagabu et al 2011 2017 previous studies explain that recharged water travels under the surface without significant mixing with surface water along flow paths and these outflow from each spring site which is driven by piston flow systems in typical volcanic aquifers e g kagabu et al 2011 2017 hosono et al 2019 therefore we assume that groundwater pathways and the type and property of relatively homogeneous volcanic aquifer geologies are site specific thus the radon concentrations in spring water at each spring site are fairly constant with some seasonal fluctuations through the flow systems unless major structural changes occur such as large destructive earthquakes 4 results 4 1 radon concentrations of spring water in 2009 and 2017 the radon concentrations of spring water sampled in 2009 and 2017 are shown in fig 3 radon concentrations ranged from 183 to 21567 bq m3 in 2009 and from 1180 to 60144 bq m3 in 2017 table 1 both radon concentration distributions showed similar trends 1 higher concentrations occurred along the futagawa hinagu fault 2 the jog and step regions of the fault showed higher concentrations and 3 springs on or near terrace deposits distributed between aso mountain and the kumamoto plain showed higher concentrations in addition a high radon anomaly appeared along the nnw sse suizenji fault system after the earthquake fujiwara et al 2016 these results suggest that radon concentrations are related to the local geology and fault distribution fig 4 displays the relationship between radon concentrations measured in 2009 and 2017 according to ono et al 2011 radon concentrations in groundwater through two major aquifers in the kumamoto area show seasonal variations that can reach a 30 maximum ratio the confined aquifer can be assumed as a piston flow which means the flow is relatively stable unless major structural changes occur during the nine years from 2009 there were no large earthquakes over m4 5 and only one m4 5 earthquake occurred at northern kumamoto in 2011 http www jma go jp jma menu report html thus we assume this value i e 30 can be regarded as the maximum seasonal radon concentration fluctuation including possible changes in response to discharge rates changes outside this concentration range can be considered to be changes triggered by the earthquake radon concentrations in ten springs increased and in four springs they decreased outside of this possible maximum seasonal variation following the kumamoto earthquake fig 5 shows that springs displaying larger changes in the radon concentration are located near the mountainside and the majority of the springs with increased concentrations are located in the earthquake s compressive stress field which was alculated by hosono et al 2019 4 2 time series of groundwater radon concentration data we monitored 11 springs over the two years following the kumamoto earthquake six of these monitored springs were also sampled prior to the earthquake time series data of radon concentrations at each spring are shown in fig 6 and table 2 we classified the monitored springs into three types types ia ib and ii by their radon concentration variations springs classified as type ia s2 s36 s38 and s40 had drastically increased radon concentrations before or after the earthquake which gradually decreased to pre seismic values over time type ib s37 s39 s48 s49 and s50 had similar post seismic trends as type ia springs however pre seismic data was lacking to confirm if their values spiked springs located in the aso caldera were included in this type we classified s16 and s17 as type ii springs in which the radon concentration exhibited post seismic changes but did not return to pre seismic concentrations over time radon concentrations were higher in s16 and lower in s17 as for s17 the data may also be interpreted as approaching a pre seismic level i e type ia 5 discussion 5 1 possible mechanisms for pre and post seismic radon concentration changes we monitored and measured radon concentrations in springs following the kumamoto earthquake and compared these data with those collected before the earthquake to detect crustal and aquifer transformations the results of our comparison show that the radon concentration changed in 15 springs over the inferred seasonal variation fig 4 the springs with the sharpest increases in radon concentration are also distributed in the compressive stress field of the earthquake fig 5 the majority of the temporally monitored springs displayed an increased radon concentration after the earthquake and a subsequent gradual decrease fig 6 the simplest mechanism for altering radon concentrations is mixing with meteoric water or another aquifer with a different radon concentration groundwater discharge at shores and lakes has been studied to consider radon mixing ono et al 2011 nikpeyman et al 2016 2019 physical factors have also been considered in the radon mass conservation equation e g kuo et al 2006 tsunomori and tanaka 2014 the conservation equation for radon in a fracture system is tsunomori and tanaka 2014 which is from unscear 2000 3 c ra ρ e λ s v 1 ε c a 1 r s c w r s ε where cra ρ λ sv and ε are the mean radium concentration in the rock bq kg the mean density of the rock kg m3 the half life of radon s 1 the surface area per unit volume m2 and the mean porosity of the rock respectively e is the emission rate of radon m 2 s 1 ca and cw are the radon concentrations in the gas and water phase respectively in pore spaces and rs is the saturation ratio for water in fracture system in the equation cra ρ e and λ are constants that are dependent on host rocks aquifer properties whereas sv rs and ε are factors that are strongly affected by crustal deformation the sv would increase with the formation of fractures and cracks leading to higher radon concentrations and rs would increase or decrease based on changes in the water volume in the rocks aquifer which produce higher and lower radon concentrations a larger ε results in lower radon concentrations caused by volumetric strain change thus causes of changing radon concentrations can be summarized by 1 dilution by mixing with meteoric water or water from another aquifer 2 increased or decreased radon concentrations due to changes in the saturation ratio 3 increased radon concentrations by increasing the surface area and 4 increased or decreased radon concentrations due to changes in porosity we understand that another factor i e the solar cycle causes daily oscillations of temperature atmospheric pressure and micro deformations that can change the groundwater radon concentration barberio et al 2018 however we considered that these effects are incorporated in seasonal fluctuations as mentioned above and hence we did not evaluate these effects individually we compared the time series data of groundwater radon concentrations with rainfall amounts flow rates and nitrate no3 and chloride ions cl in order to consider dilution by mixing with meteoric and other waters figs 6 9 it seems that the rainfall amount is not directly correlated to the flow rate at each spring although the flow rate may show seasonal variations fig 10 which would support the assumption of piston flow for aquifers both the rainfall amount and flow rate were uncorrelated with the radon concentration variation figs 6 and 7 the flow rate at s36 decreased drastically which is likely to have affected radon concentrations however the fluctuation patterns in the flow rate and radon concentration during the monitoring period are not in agreement thus direct infiltration of rainwater as a bypass flow is unlikely to have played a role in controlling the radon concentrations in groundwater in this case fig 8 shows that no3 drastically increased after the earthquake in most monitored springs and subsequently decreased sharply no3 is known to be an artificial soil additive which suggests that the post seismic increase is due to soil water including no3 mixing with the aquifer which was likely due to enhanced permeability caused by seismic shaking hosono and masaki 2020 sato et al 2020 discuss pre and post seismic no3 variations in this special issue the effect of mixing with soil water was limited to within a few months following the earthquake fig 9 shows the radon concentrations and cl changes decreased cl concentrations directly indicate dilution by groundwater hosono and masaki 2020 reported drastic cl changes in the northern kumamoto area similar but smaller post seismic trends were observed for some springs ca s38 and s50 suggesting a small degree of mixing with diluted water however the majority of the springs showed small variations and clear correlations between radon concentrations and cl decreases were not observed these results indicate that a dilution effect is not clearly reflected in the radon concentrations in the monitored springs according to the physical model of radon concentrations described previously lowering the water saturation ratio decreases radon concentrations because radon in water is redistributed from the water to the gas phase in pore spaces however aquifer systems are generally thought to be saturated by the water phase i e without a gas phase and thus the saturation ratio rs in this study can be assumed to be 1 0 both before and after the earthquake faulting such as a frictional slip along fault surfaces fracturing at the fault core and crack formation in damage zones are always increase surface area the cores of mature faults i e fault core contain grains 10 nm in diameter and the surface area of the entire fault increases to 1 4 108 m2 per unit area chester et al 2005 ma et al 2006 thus groundwater flowing through a fault core would have a higher radon concentration high radon concentration anomalies that appeared along the newly recognized suizenji fault system fig 3b fujiwara et al 2016 may have been caused by co seismic radon release into water from the newly formed surface area this explanation is consistent with tsunomori et al 2017 which surveyed an active fault distribution using the radon concentration distribution on the basis of fault surface area variations spring water from site s17 directly discharges through a part of the futagawa fault where the displacement caused by the 2016 earthquake appeared just behind the spring however the radon concentration declined after the earthquake a fault zone near the ground surface would have opened the system to air and surface ruptures are generally formed by grain sliding rather than by cutting mineral bonds on a microscale thus the decreased radon concentration in the s17 spring suggests that the surface area increase is negligible and or that other factors may have a greater influence than increased surface area additionally a surface area increase due to faulting is irreversible around the ground surface thus any increase in the radon concentration due to the surface area increase would not decrease thereafter time series variations of the radon concentration display gradual decreases for type ia and ib springs indicating that the variations were not likely caused by surface area increases for the majority of spring waters with the likely exception of near the suizenji fault system formation porosity ε would be affected by crustal deformation mainly by volumetric strain change if the aquifer system was placed under compressional strain the radon concentration in groundwater should increase with the porosity decrease due to the change in the water rock ratio the volumetric strain rate following the kumamoto earthquake was estimated around the kumamoto and aso regions hosono et al 2019 springs showing large increases in radon concentrations tended to be distributed in the compressive quadrant of the strain field fig 5 birchard and libby 1980 reported that radon anomalies in soil gas along the san jacinto fault in southern california depend on seismic compression and the dilation field causing gas outflow and inflow in this study the distribution of groundwater radon variation corresponding to the strain field indicates that a porosity change would have affected the radon concentration time series variations of radon concentrations display gradual decreases in type ia and ib springs following the earthquake which could be explained by the porosity that was regained as a result of post seismic stress relaxation springs classified as type ii also showed no relation to the saturation ratio and surface area s16 may also be interpreted as approaching a pre seismic level after an increase in the radon concentration due to the porosity change s17 is the springs on the futagawa fault thus a radon release mechanism without dependence on the mass conservation law can be proposed such as radon release into air by formed cracks connecting to the ground surface 5 2 post seismic porosity changes estimated by radon concentration we discussed the four mechanisms of changing radon concentrations in section 5 1 among the factors of 1 mixing 2 saturation ratio 3 surface area and 4 porosity only a porosity change can explain both the radon concentration variations and their distribution on a strain map for most springs we attempted to estimate this porosity change rate caused by the kumamoto earthquake using eq 2 for variation type ia s2 s36 s38 and s40 according to unscear 2000 and tsunomori and tanaka 2014 typical values of cra 30 bq kg ρ 2700 kg m λ 3 0 10 6 s 1 and ε 5 2 10 12 m 2 s 1 were used for calculation as discussed in section 5 1 we can assume that groundwater entirely saturates the pore space i e rs 1 for aquifers therefore the radon concentration in water is shown as a relationship between porosity and surface area as follows 4 c ra ρ e λ s v 1 ε c a 1 r s c w r s ε the porosities of the aso 4 pyroclastic formation in kumamoto are reported as ranging from 11 to 76 yamaguchi et al 2000 here we assume that the porosity of the aquifer prior to the earthquake was a typical value i e 30 assuming ε 0 3 prior to the earthquake and rs 1 before and after the earthquake we calculated porosities at the maximum and minimum post seismic radon concentrations table 3 calculated porosities at the maximum radon concentration just after the earthquake show 0 08 s36 0 15 s2 0 19 s38 and 0 21 s40 which are 72 49 37 and 30 lower than pre seismic condition respectively fig 11 and table 3 the decreased porosity then gradually increased to pre seismic levels which may have been caused by stress relaxation however these are rough estimations and a 72 decrease in porosity may not be a realistic value the value becomes smaller when we considered seasonal variations and assumed higher initial porosity for example if we assume 0 7 70 for initial porosity which is the values of a weakly welded part of aso pyroclastic flow deposits the porosities after the earthquake become 0 33 s36 0 50 s2 0 56 s38 and 0 59 s40 which show 53 29 20 and 16 decreases respectively accurate values of porosity change can be estimated by obtaining seasonal variations of the steady state situation and the physical properties of aquifers in the future recent studies in the same field revealed the occurrence of mountain water release due to permeability enhancement that led to subsequent water increases in downslope aquifer systems hosono et al 2019 the findings of the present study suggest that crustal earthquakes alter hydrogeological properties i e porosity and permeability of aquifer systems at a regional scale radon concentrations have successfully been applied to detect co seismic changes most frequently at some specific monitoring well sites e g wakita et al 1980 kuo et al 2006 2009 tsunomori and tanaka 2014 however their spatiotemporal variations are rarely investigated due to the lack of comparable datasets this study demonstrates its potential utility in investigating the spatiotemporal distribution of crustal deformations and aquifer property changes 6 conclusions radon concentrations in spring waters were monitored following the 2016 kumamoto earthquake and were compared to those measured prior to the earthquake eleven springs near the futagawa hinagu fault zone were monitored for 2 years after the earthquake the results suggest that the radon concentrations of the springs changed between the pre and post seismic periods the radon concentration variations in the monitored springs were classified into three types ia ib and ii types ia and ib showed gradual post seismic changes which appeared to return to pre seismic values the factors affecting radon concentrations in water are 1 groundwater mixing 2 change in the saturation ratio of the aquifer 3 increased rock surface area and 4 changes in porosity the areal distribution map shows that springs with large increases are all located in the compressive quadrant of the volumetric strain field post seismic radon variations in the monitored springs can be explained by porosity changes between pre and post seismic conditions these results suggest that the radon concentrations of spring water were affected by porosity changes caused by compressive earthquake strain and the subsequent post seismic relaxation assuming the initial porosity was 30 porosity changes due to the earthquake were calculated as 30 70 for each spring more accurate porosity values could be estimated by obtaining detailed physical properties of the aquifers around these springs in the future this research reveals that the radon concentration response to crustal deformation can be caused by earthquake induced volumetric strain change and its relaxation at the catchment scale the findings suggest the possibility of using groundwater radon concentrations to monitor not only earthquake precursors but also post seismic crustal deformation processes a critical point of this work is represented by the necessity to develop a more thorough explanation of rock deformation prior and post

5666,vadose zone well vzw injection is an effective method for aquifer recharge in semiarid and arid regions where groundwater table is deep or sufficiently permeable soils and or sufficiently large land areas for surface infiltration are not available several analytical and numerical models have been developed for the injection well in the vadose zone however those models usually ignore the ground surface flux gsf generated by infiltration or evapotranspiration which may cause errors and hinder the success of artificial recharge and groundwater management this study takes gsf generated by these two processes into consideration with the purpose of understanding their influences on the hydraulic responses and recharge efficiency an innovative mathematical model is established based on a three dimensional 3d governing equation for saturated flow and a linearized 3d richards equation for unsaturated flow the laplace hankel transforms are applied to derive solutions for the hydraulic head increments and recharge rate the solutions are tested by a finite element numerical model developed using comsol multiphysics the obtained solutions are utilized to assess the influences of time dependent gsf generated by infiltration or evapotranspiration the magnitude of these influences depends on unsaturated and saturated aquifer properties and the value of gsf the impacts of three important properties are investigated the constitutive exponent of the unsaturated zone ω the specific yield s y and the hydraulic conductivity anisotropy k d k z k r smaller values of dimensionless constitutive exponent ω d and dimensionless specific yield s yd lead to larger changes of hydraulic head increments in both unsaturated zone u d and saturated zone s d when gsf is the same a small value of k d can delay the changes of u d and s d but the value of k d does not affect the final values of u d and s d larger values of gsf generated by surface infiltration lead to larger increases of u d and s d larger absolute values of gsf generated by evapotranspiration lead to larger decreases of u d and s d the proposed semi analytical solutions can be used to improve the feasibility and

introduction managed aquifer recharge mar describes the intentional recharge and storage of water into an aquifer for subsequent recovery or for environmental benefits mar is one of the effective measures that can be implemented to secure water supply ghayoumian et al 2007 compensate for some effects of climate change liu et al 2013 and handle the quantity and quality of groundwater bodies casanova et al 2016 this method has been widely used in many fields including urban water supply karlsen et al 2012 lacher et al 2014 pollution control kuster et al 2010 sharma and kennedy 2017 seawater intrusion garcía menéndez et al 2018 shammas 2008 land subsidence shi et al 2016 and environmental conservation nöjd et al 2009 vadose zone wells vzws also called dry wells or recharge shafts are boreholes in the vadose zone vzw injection is an important technique to implement mar in semiarid and arid regions where groundwater table is deep or sufficiently permeable soils and or sufficiently large land areas for surface infiltration are not available bouwer 2002 in these regions hydrological processes can be easily affected by ground surface infiltration and evapotranspiration liu et al 2013 ground surface infiltration is often the sole source of water replenishment while evapotranspiration is a major source of water depletion in semiarid and arid regions many researches focused on learning more about factors affecting infiltration pattern kargas et al 2012 wang et al 2007 and developing evapotranspiration estimation models dehghanisanij et al 2004 weiß and menzel 2008 to improve the efficiency of water management and to obtain an accurate water budget it is important to investigate the influences of ground surface flux gsf generated by infiltration or evapotranspiration on vzw injection hydrological models are effective tools for predicting and understanding hydrological processes and making a quantitative assessment of the injection or recharge capacity of mar kim et al 2012 rahman et al 2012 since wells shafts and boreholes are the most frequently applied methods to recharge an aquifer most modeling studies were conducted for direct injection into saturated zones ringleb et al 2016 for the vzw injection glover 1953 proposed a simple formula to calculate recharge rate of the well then a lot of groundwater flow models based on the hydraulics of wells were developed taneja and khepar 1996 wang et al 2012 stephens and neuman 1982 constructed numerical models for constant head borehole injection in the unsaturated zone to examine previous formulae unsaturated flow models coupled with saturated flow models are recently developed and the application of this type of models keeps increasing liang et al 2018 ringleb et al 2016 however the models proposed before for vzw injection usually ignore the influences of gsf generated by infiltration or evapotranspiration which can lead to errors and hinder the success of artificial recharge and groundwater management this study focuses on getting a better understanding of the influences of gsf generated by infiltration or evapotranspiration on vzw injection to improve the efficiency and feasibility of artificial recharge in semiarid and arid regions the mathematical models are established based on linearized richards equation and groundwater governing equation to couple the unsaturated and saturated flows the semi analytical solutions of hydraulic head increments and recharge rate are derived by laplace hankel transform and are tested by a finite element numerical model developed by comsol multiphysics then analyses are conducted to investigate the influences of time dependent gsf on hydraulic head increments and recharge rate a point to note is that in this study the terms vadose zone and unsaturated zone are exchangeable 2 mathematical model a transection of a vadose zone well in the unsaturated saturated porous media is schematically shown in fig 1 the aquifer is saturated beneath an initially horizontal water table with a uniform thickness of b the unsaturated zone is lying above the saturated zone and has a uniform thickness of a both the unsaturated and saturated zones are homogeneous anisotropic and extend sufficiently far laterally the saturated zone is bounded by an impermeable horizontal bottom the top of the unsaturated zone is horizontal ground surface with a time dependent gsf i t a vadose zone well with a constant recharge rate q is screened from j to d where j and d are distances from the top and bottom of the screen to the initial position of water table respectively the origin of the cylindrical coordinate system is at the intercept of the central axis of the well and the water table the r axis is along the horizontally radial water flow direction and the z axis is vertically upward the initial water table is at the elevation z 0 the flow in the unsaturated zone is governed by richards equation this system in fig 1 is highly nonlinear because of 1 the nonlinear nature of richards equation and 2 the presence of a moving interface water table between two different saturated and unsaturated flow regimes tartakovsky and neuman 2007 to solve this problem kroszynski and dagan 1975 employed the method of perturbation expansion to simplify the richards equation the flow is assumed to depart slightly from equilibrium and the dependent variables in richards equation can be expanded in perturbation series whose higher order terms are neglected then the remaining terms are substituted into the equation to obtain a first order linearized equation this linearization method is widely used in previous studies on coupling unsaturated saturated flow problems chang et al 2018 liang et al 2017a lin et al 2017 mathias and butler 2006 mishra et al 2012 tartakovsky and neuman 2007 based on linearization the governing equation for the unsaturated zone describing groundwater

can result in a static hydraulic condition before vzw injection we make the assumption that i 0 0 the key properties of the unsaturated soils are volumetric water content θ relative hydraulic

this study evaluates the integration of the inverse hankel transformation in eqs 9 11 by a numerical method proposed by ogata 2005 ogata 2005 discussed a numerical integration formula which solves an infinite integral involving the bessel function by the quadrature formula with the zeros of the bessel functions as nodes for the integrals this numerical method is convenient to implement and has a high accuracy liang et al 2018 note that eqs 9 11 are laplace domain solutions which are sufficiently complex to defy analytical inversion to obtain the time domain solutions therefore the de hoog algorithm de hoog et al 1982 is adopted to numerically invert the laplace domain solutions into the time domain solutions 3 3 the setting of gsf generated by infiltration or evapotranspiration the ground surface infiltration and evapotranspiration processes can generate time dependent fluxes on ground surface however those processes are complex and always dependent on the saturation of near surface soils beven 1979 chu 1978 patil et al 2019 to simplify the model and focus on their influences on vzw injection we define i t as a known time dependent ground surface flux generated by infiltration or evapotranspiration i t is positive when its direction is vertically downward for the demonstration purpose the gsf i t is considered as a piecewise function with time in this study 12a i t i i t t i 1 t i i 1 2 3 where i i is constant for the time interval t i 1 t i and t 0 0 the dimensionless form of i i is i di 2 π a 2 q i i taking laplace transform on i d yields 12b i d p i 1 i di p exp p t di 1 exp p t di a point to note is that in mar management an arbitrary time dependent function of gsf over a certain operational time duration can always be approximated as a sequence of piecewise functions over many discretized small time intervals once the impact of gsf for each small time interval can be obtained the impact from the entire sequence of gsf can be straightforwardly obtained using the principle of superposition because of the linearization of the governing equations and the linear nature of the initial and boundary conditions involved in this study therefore although this study uses one piecewise function of gsf for the demonstration purpose the procedure can be directly extended to a sequence of rather arbitrary piecewise functions to mimic an actual time dependent gsf function i t 4 comparison with numerical model to test the solutions of eqs 9 11 a finite element numerical model is constructed by comsol multiphysics comsol inc burlington ma usa the axisymmetric model simulates the flow in the unsaturated saturated zone induced by a vertical vzw and gsf the dimensionless parameter values are set as follows the initial saturated zone thickness b d is 1 0 the hydraulic conductivity anisotropy k d is 1 0 the constitutive exponent ω d is 1 10 2 and the specific yield s yd is 1 10 3 the screen top and bottom of the injection well are respectively j d 0 7 and d d 0 3 we assume that the gsf occurs during t d 10 2 50 with a constant rate of i d 0 5 the dimensionless governing equations are solved by the partial differential equation solver of comsol this model is discretized by triangular elements with a total number of 36495 to improve accuracy elements near the injection well the ground surface and the interface between the unsaturated and saturated zones are refined with the minimum element size of 0 001 and a growth rate of 1 1 the total simulation time t d 1 10 3 and the time step grows exponentially starting at δ t d 1 10 2 we test the accuracy of solutions 9 11 by comparing with the numerical simulation using the above parameter values fig 2 demonstrates the comparison in which the present solution results are represented by solid curves and the numerical simulation results are represented by circle symbols fig 2a shows the dimensionless time t d vs the dimensionless hydraulic head increments u d or s d in the saturated zone z d 0 1 and the unsaturated zone z d 0 1 0 5 a n d 0 9 at r d 0 1 for the same z d the u d and s d values obtained by these two methods agree with each other well fig 2b shows the dimensionless hydraulic head increments u d or s d vs z d at t d 0 1 1 10 a n d 100 for the same t d the u d and s d values obtained by these two methods have very small differences which can be ignored the comparison above indicates that our solution has sufficient accuracy to predict the hydraulic head changes induced by the vzw injection and gsf 5 results and discussions 5 1 influences of gsf generated by surface infiltration the response pattern of the hydraulic heads in the unsaturated and saturated zones induced by vzw injection is affected by gsf as well as properties of unsaturated and saturated zones such as constitutive exponent of the unsaturated zone specific yield of the unsaturated zone and the anisotropy of the unsaturated and saturated zone to get better understanding of influences of gsf generated by surface infiltration the impacts of unsaturated and saturated aquifer properties have to be taken into consideration and relative analyses are adopted other parameter values of the well and unsaturated and saturated zones are the same as that in section 4 we first investigate how the hydraulic heads change with the gsf generated by infiltration for the dimensionless constitutive exponent ω d 1 10 4 1 10 3 1 10 2 a n d 1 10 1 where s yd 1 10 3 and k d 1 fig 3 shows changes of u d and s d with i d 1 during t d 10 2 50 solid curves and without i d dotted curves in fig 3a the hydraulic head increment u d increases with time and the presence of gsf i d enhances this increase after t d 50 when i d stops u d gradually stops increasing and reaches a constant value the value of ω d has a significant effect on the influence of i d on u d a smaller ω d leads to stronger influences of i d on u d a small ω d means that the storage capacity and or thickness of the unsaturated zone are small resulting in relatively large hydraulic head changes induced by the vzw injection and gsf in addition more water can be drained downward into the saturated zone giving rise to larger s d fig 3b displays that the changes of s d with t d and the influences of i d on s d are similar to the curves of u d in fig 3a fig 4 shows the hydraulic heads change with the dimensionless gsf generated by infiltration i d 1 during t d 10 2 50 solid curves and without i d dotted curves for the dimensionless specific yield s yd 1 10 2 1 10 3 1 10 4 a n d 1 10 5 where ω d 1 10 2 and k d 1 in fig 4 the presence of i d enlarges u d and s d and the influence of i d is decreased as s yd increases the dimensionless specific yield s yd represents the storage capacity of the unsaturated zone a larger s yd means that more water can be stored in the unsaturated zone reducing the influences of i d and hydraulic head changes in the unsaturated and saturated zones fig 5 displays the hydraulic head changes with the dimensionless gsf generated by infiltration i d 1 during t d 10 2 50 solid curves and without i d dotted curves for the hydraulic conductivity anisotropy k d 0 01 0 1 1 and 10 where ω d 1 10 2 and s yd 1 10 3 in fig 5a the presence of gsf i d enlarges u d and this influence is delayed further as k d decreases the reason is that a smaller k d indicates that the horizontal flow is dominant in the unsaturated zone at early stage after this early stage the flow will move downward into the saturated zone causing an obvious delay of s d increment shown in fig 5b fig 6 presents the hydraulic head changes with different dimensionless gsf generated by infiltration i d 0 0 5 1 a n d 2 where ω d 1 10 2 s yd 1 10 3 and k d 1 in fig 6 1 i d is applied during t d 10 2 50 u d increases as i d increases a larger i d means more water can infiltrate into the unsaturated zone leading to faster increase of u d then the water enters the saturated zone enlarging s d in fig 6 2 i d is applied during a later time t d 200 250 after a relatively long period of vzw injection the gsf is applied which causes gradual increases of u d and s d then u d and s d will reach to constant values after i d stops fig 7 demonstrates that the dimensionless infiltration rate at the interface of the unsaturated and saturated zones changes with different dimensionless gsf generated by infiltration i d 0 0 5 1 a n d 2 during t d 10 2 50 where ω d 1 10 2 s yd 1 10 3 and k d 1 for i d 0 q d increases as t d increases at the early stage and then reaches a constant value the presence of i d increases q d and a larger i d induces a larger q d the figure at the lower right corner of fig 7 zooms in the curves of t d 45 55 it shows that after t d 50 when i d stops q d gradually decreases to a constant value which is not influenced by the value of i d the reason is that i d increases the water into the unsaturated zone as well as the saturated zone giving rise to higher q d when i d stops this influence also stops to examine the influence of gsf after the steady state flow is somewhat established by the vzw injection fig 8 displays the profile contours of u d z d 0 and s d z d 0 with different gsf i d applied during t d 200 250 where ω d 1 10 2 s yd 1 10 3 and k d 1 in fig 8 1 when i d 0 the influence area of vzw injection increases as time increases in fig 8 2 i d 0 5 is applied during t d 200 250 before i d starts the changes of u d and s d are the same with that in figs 8 1a the presence of i d enlarges the influence area especially at the top of the unsaturated zone after i d stops u d and s d gradually reach to constant values which are larger than that in figs 8 1c in fig 8 3 i d 0 5 is applied during t d 200 250 the change tendency of u d and s d is the same with that in fig 8 2 while the values of u d and s d are larger than those at the same time in fig 8 2 5 2 influences of gsf generated by evapotranspiration to investigate the influences of gsf generated by evapotranspiration on the response pattern of the hydraulic heads in the unsaturated and saturated zones we conduct the following analyses and set i d as a negative value other parameter values of the well and unsaturated and saturated zones are the same as that in section 4 fig 9 shows the hydraulic head increments change with the dimensionless gsf generated by evapotranspiration i d 0 3 during t d 10 2 50 solid curves and without i d dotted curves for the dimensionless constitutive exponent ω d 5 10 3 8 10 3 1 10 2 a n d 1 10 1 where s yd 1 10 3 and k d 1 in fig 9 the presence of i d decreases u d and s d and a smaller ω d leads to smaller u d and s d ω d represents the storage capacity and or thickness of the unsaturated zone a smaller ω d means that more water can be evaporated through the ground surface and less water drains downward into the saturated zone resulting in smaller u d and s d when ω d is very small u d and s d may become negative for some time and then increases after i d stops fig 10 shows the hydraulic head increments change with the dimensionless gsf generated by evapotranspiration i d 0 3 during t d 10 2 50 solid curves and without i d dotted curves for the dimensionless specific yield s yd 5 10 2 8 10 2 1 10 3 a n d 1 10 4 where ω d 1 10 2 and k d 1 like in fig 9 the presence of i d decreases u d and s d a smaller s yd leads to smaller u d and s d for the reason that it represents a smaller storage capacity of the unsaturated zone when s yd is very small u d and s d may become negative for some time and then increases after i d stops fig 11 shows the hydraulic head increments change with the dimensionless gsf generated by evapotranspiration i d 0 3 during t d 10 2 50 solid curves and without i d dotted curves for the hydraulic conductivity anisotropy k d 0 01 0 1 1 and 10 where ω d 1 10 2 and s yd 1 10 3 the presence of i d decreases u d and s d the smaller the k d the later this influence occurs the reason is that a smaller k d indicates that the horizontal flow is dominant in the unsaturated zone at early stage and it is more difficult for water to be evaporated through the ground surface then the influence of gsf generated by evapotranspiration on s d in the saturated zone is also delayed fig 12 shows the hydraulic head increments change with different values of dimensionless gsf generated by evapotranspiration i d 0 0 1 0 3 a n d 0 5 where ω d 1 10 2 s yd 1 10 3 and k d 1 in fig 12 1 i d is applied during t d 10 2 50 u d and s d decrease as the absolute value of i d increases a larger absolute value of i d means that more water is evaporated through the ground surface leading to faster decrease of u d when the absolute value of i d is very large the evapotranspiration effect is so strong that water will move upward through the saturated zone leading to negatives values of s d in fig 12 2 i d is applied during t d 200 250 after relatively long vzw injection the gsf is applied which causes gradual decreases of u d and s d the decreases of u d and s d are less than those in fig 12 1 for short time vzw injection injected water only flows in the vicinity of the well gsf generated by evapotranspiration is playing a dominating role and can lead to more hydraulic head decreases over most parts of aquifer that are not in the vicinity of the injection well fig 13 demonstrates how the dimensionless infiltration rate at the interface of the unsaturated and saturated zones changes with different dimensionless gsf generated by evapotranspiration i d 0 0 3 0 5 a n d 1 during t d 10 2 50 where ω d 1 10 2 s yd 1 10 3 and k d 1 for i d 0 q d increases as t d increases at the early stage and then reaches a constant value the presence of i d decreases q d and a larger absolute value of i d induces a smaller q d the figure at the lower right corner of fig 13 zooms in the curves of t d 45 55 it shows that after t d 50 when i d stops q d gradually increases to a constant value which is not influenced by the value of i d the reason is that gsf generated by evapotranspiration reduces the water into the unsaturated zone and the saturated zone giving rise to a lower q d when i d stops this influence also stops to examine the influence of gsf after the steady state flow is somewhat established by the vzw injection fig 14 displays the profile contours of u d z d 0 and s d z d 0 with different gsf i d applied during t d 200 250 where ω d 1 10 2 s yd 1 10 3 and k d 1 in fig 14 1 when i d 0 the influence area of vzw injection increases as time increases in fig 14 2 i d 0 1 is applied during t d 200 250 before i d starts the changes of u d and s d are the same with that in fig 14 1a the presence of i d decreases u d and s d especially at the top of the unsaturated zone after i d stops u d and s d gradually reach their asymptotic constants which are smaller than those in fig 14 1c in fig 14 3 i d 0 3 is applied during t d 200 250 the change tendency of u d and s d is the same with that in fig 14 2 while the values of u d and s d are smaller than those at the same time in fig 14 2 6 discussion there are a number of issues that deserve discussion for the better application of this study the assumptions and limitations of this study are also worth discussion first of all in this study the linearized richards equation is used to describe flow in the unsaturated zone such a linearization is realized by applying gardner 1958 model and kroszynski and dagan 1975 method of perturbation expansion the relative hydraulic conductivity and water content are assumed to vary exponentially with incremental capillary pressure head relative to the air entry pressure head the flow is assumed to differ slightly from equilibrium thus higher order terms in the expansion series of dependent variables in richards equation are neglected these simplifications have been tested and applied in previous studies kroszynski and dagan 1975 liang et al 2017b lin et al 2017 tartakovsky and neuman 2007 for instance mishra and neuman 2010 solved the problem of constant rate pumping in a coupled saturated and unsaturated flow system and compared the drawdown curves predicted by the analytical solution with the gardner s model and the numerical solution with the van genuchten mualem soil constitutive model mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 the comparison showed good agreement in the predicted drawdown curve at early and late times this indicates that the linearization method can be adopted for approximating the flow induced by vzw injection and ground surface flux for a coupled unsaturated saturated system when the flow differs slightly from its equilibrium state however one should be cautious that the linearization approximation as used in this study and in many previous studies may not be valid when flow differs considerably from its equilibrium state for instance when the rate of vzw injection is sufficiently large that the flow departs greatly from its equilibrium state if this is true one probably has to adopt a higher order approximation to deal with the problem which will make the analytical treatment difficult or even impossible for such a case we will recommend using a numerical approach rather than analytical approach to tackle the problem of concern which could be very challenging in a numerical perspective as the system investigated is highly nonlinear in nature all of these issues are out of the scope of this investigation and should be examined separately second media anisotropy has been considered but media heterogeneity has not been considered specifically in this study a typical kind of media heterogeneity in the vadose zone may appears as layering as multiple layers of soils with different hydraulic parameters coexist such a multiple layer system will substantially complicate the pattern of movement of water in the vadose zone in which gravity driven vertical flow usually prevails and can be hindered by some low permeability layers the use of media anisotropy or more specifically a lower vertical hydraulic conductivity than the horizontal hydraulic conductivity has partially taken into account the micro layering effect in an average sense fetter 2018 but it does not address a general multiple layer system another kind of typical heterogeneity commonly encountered in the field is isolated clay lens in the vadose zone as well as saturated zone which has not been addressed in present study further investigations are certainly valuable for extending the present work to a multiple layer system and or to include isolated clay lens among other issues third the well radius is assumed to be infinitely small in this study while bouwer 2002 referred that vzws are usually 1 2 m in diameter for such finite radius wells the wellbore storage may cause errors in prediction of hydraulic head changes at the early stage of vzw injection and the presence of well skin during injection can change the hydraulic properties around the well and affect the recharge capacity the effects of wellbore storage and well skin should not be ignored in the future in addition vzw injection can cause rise of the water table depending on the size and location of the well which may affect the water dissipation from the injection well such a groundwater mounding effect has not been taken into consideration and will be investigated in a future study fourth clogging of vzw is another issue that has not been included in this study but could affect the performance of vzw in real applications clogging of vzws may include the physical clogging in which fine materials block the entrance of the well screen or biological clogging in which growth of bacterial blocks the pathways of the well screen clogging can also reduce the permeability of formations immediately adjacent to vzws further investigation is certainly needed to address the clogging issue of vzws which has been reported in field applications bloetscher et al 2014 jeong et al 2018 martin 2013 7 conclusions this study investigates the influences of time dependent gsf generated by infiltration or evapotranspiration on the vzw injection in a coupled unsaturated saturated porous media the unsaturated flow is described by a linearized richards equation and the saturated flow is described by a three dimensional groundwater flow equation the unsaturated and saturated flows are coupled by interface conditions representing continuity of pressure and normal flux across the water table laplace and hankel transforms are used to derive the semi analytical solutions for the hydraulic head increment and infiltration rate at the interface of the unsaturated and saturated zones the time domain solutions are obtained by using the de hoog algorithm the solutions are tested by comparing with the numerical simulation results solved by comsol multiphysics indicating that our solutions have sufficient accuracy the conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the presence of gsf generated by infiltration can increase the hydraulic head increments in the unsaturated and saturated zones and the magnitude of this influence depends on properties of unsaturated and saturated zones and the value of gsf smaller ω d and s yd lead to larger increases of u d and s d when gsf is the same a small k d can delay the increases of u d and s d and the value of k d does not affect the final values of u d and s d in addition larger values of gsf generated by infiltration lead to larger increases of u d and s d 2 the presence of gsf generated by evapotranspiration can decrease the hydraulic head increments in the unsaturated and saturated zones and the magnitude of this influence depends on properties of unsaturated and saturated zones and the value of gsf smaller ω d and s yd lead to larger decreases of u d and s d when gsf is the same a small k d can delay the decreases of u d and s d and the value of k d does not affect the final values of u d and s d in addition larger absolute values of gsf generated by evapotranspiration lead to larger decreases of u d and s d 3 the presence of gsf generated by infiltration can increase the infiltration rate at the interface of the unsaturated and saturated zones and larger values of gsf lead to larger increases of q d after gsf stops the infiltration rate gradually decreases to a constant value which is not influenced by the value of gsf generated by infiltration 4 the presence of gsf generated by evapotranspiration can decrease the infiltration rate at the interface of the unsaturated and saturated zones and larger absolute values of gsf lead to larger decreases of q d after gsf stops the infiltration rate gradually increases to

5666,vadose zone well vzw injection is an effective method for aquifer recharge in semiarid and arid regions where groundwater table is deep or sufficiently permeable soils and or sufficiently large land areas for surface infiltration are not available several analytical and numerical models have been developed for the injection well in the vadose zone however those models usually ignore the ground surface flux gsf generated by infiltration or evapotranspiration which may cause errors and hinder the success of artificial recharge and groundwater management this study takes gsf generated by these two processes into consideration with the purpose of understanding their influences on the hydraulic responses and recharge efficiency an innovative mathematical model is established based on a three dimensional 3d governing equation for saturated flow and a linearized 3d richards equation for unsaturated flow the laplace hankel transforms are applied to derive solutions for the hydraulic head increments and recharge rate the solutions are tested by a finite element numerical model developed using comsol multiphysics the obtained solutions are utilized to assess the influences of time dependent gsf generated by infiltration or evapotranspiration the magnitude of these influences depends on unsaturated and saturated aquifer properties and the value of gsf the impacts of three important properties are investigated the constitutive exponent of the unsaturated zone ω the specific yield s y and the hydraulic conductivity anisotropy k d k z k r smaller values of dimensionless constitutive exponent ω d and dimensionless specific yield s yd lead to larger changes of hydraulic head increments in both unsaturated zone u d and saturated zone s d when gsf is the same a small value of k d can delay the changes of u d and s d but the value of k d does not affect the final values of u d and s d larger values of gsf generated by surface infiltration lead to larger increases of u d and s d larger absolute values of gsf generated by evapotranspiration lead to larger decreases of u d and s d the proposed semi analytical solutions can be used to improve the feasibility and

introduction managed aquifer recharge mar describes the intentional recharge and storage of water into an aquifer for subsequent recovery or for environmental benefits mar is one of the effective measures that can be implemented to secure water supply ghayoumian et al 2007 compensate for some effects of climate change liu et al 2013 and handle the quantity and quality of groundwater bodies casanova et al 2016 this method has been widely used in many fields including urban water supply karlsen et al 2012 lacher et al 2014 pollution control kuster et al 2010 sharma and kennedy 2017 seawater intrusion garcía menéndez et al 2018 shammas 2008 land subsidence shi et al 2016 and environmental conservation nöjd et al 2009 vadose zone wells vzws also called dry wells or recharge shafts are boreholes in the vadose zone vzw injection is an important technique to implement mar in semiarid and arid regions where groundwater table is deep or sufficiently permeable soils and or sufficiently large land areas for surface infiltration are not available bouwer 2002 in these regions hydrological processes can be easily affected by ground surface infiltration and evapotranspiration liu et al 2013 ground surface infiltration is often the sole source of water replenishment while evapotranspiration is a major source of water depletion in semiarid and arid regions many researches focused on learning more about factors affecting infiltration pattern kargas et al 2012 wang et al 2007 and developing evapotranspiration estimation models dehghanisanij et al 2004 weiß and menzel 2008 to improve the efficiency of water management and to obtain an accurate water budget it is important to investigate the influences of ground surface flux gsf generated by infiltration or evapotranspiration on vzw injection hydrological models are effective tools for predicting and understanding hydrological processes and making a quantitative assessment of the injection or recharge capacity of mar kim et al 2012 rahman et al 2012 since wells shafts and boreholes are the most frequently applied methods to recharge an aquifer most modeling studies were conducted for direct injection into saturated zones ringleb et al 2016 for the vzw injection glover 1953 proposed a simple formula to calculate recharge rate of the well then a lot of groundwater flow models based on the hydraulics of wells were developed taneja and khepar 1996 wang et al 2012 stephens and neuman 1982 constructed numerical models for constant head borehole injection in the unsaturated zone to examine previous formulae unsaturated flow models coupled with saturated flow models are recently developed and the application of this type of models keeps increasing liang et al 2018 ringleb et al 2016 however the models proposed before for vzw injection usually ignore the influences of gsf generated by infiltration or evapotranspiration which can lead to errors and hinder the success of artificial recharge and groundwater management this study focuses on getting a better understanding of the influences of gsf generated by infiltration or evapotranspiration on vzw injection to improve the efficiency and feasibility of artificial recharge in semiarid and arid regions the mathematical models are established based on linearized richards equation and groundwater governing equation to couple the unsaturated and saturated flows the semi analytical solutions of hydraulic head increments and recharge rate are derived by laplace hankel transform and are tested by a finite element numerical model developed by comsol multiphysics then analyses are conducted to investigate the influences of time dependent gsf on hydraulic head increments and recharge rate a point to note is that in this study the terms vadose zone and unsaturated zone are exchangeable 2 mathematical model a transection of a vadose zone well in the unsaturated saturated porous media is schematically shown in fig 1 the aquifer is saturated beneath an initially horizontal water table with a uniform thickness of b the unsaturated zone is lying above the saturated zone and has a uniform thickness of a both the unsaturated and saturated zones are homogeneous anisotropic and extend sufficiently far laterally the saturated zone is bounded by an impermeable horizontal bottom the top of the unsaturated zone is horizontal ground surface with a time dependent gsf i t a vadose zone well with a constant recharge rate q is screened from j to d where j and d are distances from the top and bottom of the screen to the initial position of water table respectively the origin of the cylindrical coordinate system is at the intercept of the central axis of the well and the water table the r axis is along the horizontally radial water flow direction and the z axis is vertically upward the initial water table is at the elevation z 0 the flow in the unsaturated zone is governed by richards equation this system in fig 1 is highly nonlinear because of 1 the nonlinear nature of richards equation and 2 the presence of a moving interface water table between two different saturated and unsaturated flow regimes tartakovsky and neuman 2007 to solve this problem kroszynski and dagan 1975 employed the method of perturbation expansion to simplify the richards equation the flow is assumed to depart slightly from equilibrium and the dependent variables in richards equation can be expanded in perturbation series whose higher order terms are neglected then the remaining terms are substituted into the equation to obtain a first order linearized equation this linearization method is widely used in previous studies on coupling unsaturated saturated flow problems chang et al 2018 liang et al 2017a lin et al 2017 mathias and butler 2006 mishra et al 2012 tartakovsky and neuman 2007 based on linearization the governing equation for the unsaturated zone describing groundwater

boundary condition of the ground surface should be k z k 0 z u z z a k z k 0 z h u z z a k z k 0 z h 0 z z a i t since u h u h 0 define i u k z k 0 z h u z z a as the total flux on ground surface and i 0 k z k 0 z h 0 z z a as the initial ground surface flux then i t i u i 0 describes the change in the time dependent gsf with respect to that in the natural state to make sure that the natural state can result in a static hydraulic condition before vzw injection we make the assumption that i 0 0 the key properties of the unsaturated soils are volumetric water content θ relative hydraulic

neuman 2007 the unsaturated and saturated flows are coupled by interface conditions representing continuity of pressure and normal flux across the water table the linearized interface conditions at the water table are denoted as 4a s u 0 z 0 4b s z u z 0 z 0 3 solutions define the dimensionless variables as follows s d 2 π k r a s q u d 2 π k r a u q r d r a z d z a b d b a t d k r s s a 2 t k d

this study evaluates the integration of the inverse hankel transformation in eqs 9 11 by a numerical method proposed by ogata 2005 ogata 2005 discussed a numerical integration formula which solves an infinite integral involving the bessel function by the quadrature formula with the zeros of the bessel functions as nodes for the integrals this numerical method is convenient to implement and has a high accuracy liang et al 2018 note that eqs 9 11 are laplace domain solutions which are sufficiently complex to defy analytical inversion to obtain the time domain solutions therefore the de hoog algorithm de hoog et al 1982 is adopted to numerically invert the laplace domain solutions into the time domain solutions 3 3 the setting of gsf generated by infiltration or evapotranspiration the ground surface infiltration and evapotranspiration processes can generate time dependent fluxes on ground surface however those processes are complex and always dependent on the saturation of near surface soils beven 1979 chu 1978 patil et al 2019 to simplify the model and focus on their influences on vzw injection we define i t as a known time dependent ground surface flux generated by infiltration or evapotranspiration i t is positive when its direction is vertically downward for the demonstration purpose the gsf i t is considered as a piecewise function with time in this study 12a i t i i t t i 1 t i i 1 2 3 where i i is constant for the time interval t i 1 t i and t 0 0 the dimensionless form of i i is i di 2 π a 2 q i i taking laplace transform on i d yields 12b i d p i 1 i di p exp p t di 1 exp p t di a point to note is that in mar management an arbitrary time dependent function of gsf over a certain operational time duration can always be approximated as a sequence of piecewise functions over many discretized small time intervals once the impact of gsf for each small time interval can be obtained the impact from the entire sequence of gsf can be straightforwardly obtained using the principle of superposition because of the linearization of the governing equations and the linear nature of the initial and boundary conditions involved in this study therefore although this study uses one piecewise function of gsf for the demonstration purpose the procedure can be directly extended to a sequence of rather arbitrary piecewise functions to mimic an actual time dependent gsf function i t 4 comparison with numerical model to test the solutions of eqs 9 11 a finite element numerical model is constructed by comsol multiphysics comsol inc burlington ma usa the axisymmetric model simulates the flow in the unsaturated saturated zone induced by a vertical vzw and gsf the dimensionless parameter values are set as follows the initial saturated zone thickness b d is 1 0 the hydraulic conductivity anisotropy k d is 1 0 the constitutive exponent ω d is 1 10 2 and the specific yield s yd is 1 10 3 the screen top and bottom of the injection well are respectively j d 0 7 and d d 0 3 we assume that the gsf occurs during t d 10 2 50 with a constant rate of i d 0 5 the dimensionless governing equations are solved by the partial differential equation solver of comsol this model is discretized by triangular elements with a total number of 36495 to improve accuracy elements near the injection well the ground surface and the interface between the unsaturated and saturated zones are refined with the minimum element size of 0 001 and a growth rate of 1 1 the total simulation time t d 1 10 3 and the time step grows exponentially starting at δ t d 1 10 2 we test the accuracy of solutions 9 11 by comparing with the numerical simulation using the above parameter values fig 2 demonstrates the comparison in which the present solution results are represented by solid curves and the numerical simulation results are represented by circle symbols fig 2a shows the dimensionless time t d vs the dimensionless hydraulic head increments u d or s d in the saturated zone z d 0 1 and the unsaturated zone z d 0 1 0 5 a n d 0 9 at r d 0 1 for the same z d the u d and s d values obtained by these two methods agree with each other well fig 2b shows the dimensionless hydraulic head increments u d or s d vs z d at t d 0 1 1 10 a n d 100 for the same t d the u d and s d values obtained by these two methods have very small differences which can be ignored the comparison above indicates that our solution has sufficient accuracy to predict the hydraulic head changes induced by the vzw injection and gsf 5 results and discussions 5 1 influences of gsf generated by surface infiltration the response pattern of the hydraulic heads in the unsaturated and saturated zones induced by vzw injection is affected by gsf as well as properties of unsaturated and saturated zones such as constitutive exponent of the unsaturated zone specific yield of the unsaturated zone and the anisotropy of the unsaturated and saturated zone to get better understanding of influences of gsf generated by surface infiltration the impacts of unsaturated and saturated aquifer properties have to be taken into consideration and relative analyses are adopted other parameter values of the well and unsaturated and saturated zones are the same as that in section 4 we first investigate how the hydraulic heads change with the gsf generated by infiltration for the dimensionless constitutive exponent ω d 1 10 4 1 10 3 1 10 2 a n d 1 10 1 where s yd 1 10 3 and k d 1 fig 3 shows changes of u d and s d with i d 1 during t d 10 2 50 solid curves and without i d dotted curves in fig 3a the hydraulic head increment u d increases with time and the presence of gsf i d enhances this increase after t d 50 when i d stops u d gradually stops increasing and reaches a constant value the value of ω d has a significant effect on the influence of i d on u d a smaller ω d leads to stronger influences of i d on u d a small ω d means that the storage capacity and or thickness of the unsaturated zone are small resulting in relatively large hydraulic head changes induced by the vzw injection and gsf in addition more water can be drained downward into the saturated zone giving rise to larger s d fig 3b displays that the changes of s d with t d and the influences of i d on s d are similar to the curves of u d in fig 3a fig 4 shows the hydraulic heads change with the dimensionless gsf generated by infiltration i d 1 during t d 10 2 50 solid curves and without i d dotted curves for the dimensionless specific yield s yd 1 10 2 1 10 3 1 10 4 a n d 1 10 5 where ω d 1 10 2 and k d 1 in fig 4 the presence of i d enlarges u d and s d and the influence of i d is decreased as s yd increases the dimensionless specific yield s yd represents the storage capacity of the unsaturated zone a larger s yd means that more water can be stored in the unsaturated zone reducing the influences of i d and hydraulic head changes in the unsaturated and saturated zones fig 5 displays the hydraulic head changes with the dimensionless gsf generated by infiltration i d 1 during t d 10 2 50 solid curves and without i d dotted curves for the hydraulic conductivity anisotropy k d 0 01 0 1 1 and 10 where ω d 1 10 2 and s yd 1 10 3 in fig 5a the presence of gsf i d enlarges u d and this influence is delayed further as k d decreases the reason is that a smaller k d indicates that the horizontal flow is dominant in the unsaturated zone at early stage after this early stage the flow will move downward into the saturated zone causing an obvious delay of s d increment shown in fig 5b fig 6 presents the hydraulic head changes with different dimensionless gsf generated by infiltration i d 0 0 5 1 a n d 2 where ω d 1 10 2 s yd 1 10 3 and k d 1 in fig 6 1 i d is applied during t d 10 2 50 u d increases as i d increases a larger i d means more water can infiltrate into the unsaturated zone leading to faster increase of u d then the water enters the saturated zone enlarging s d in fig 6 2 i d is applied during a later time t d 200 250 after a relatively long period of vzw injection the gsf is applied which causes gradual increases of u d and s d then u d and s d will reach to constant values after i d stops fig 7 demonstrates that the dimensionless infiltration rate at the interface of the unsaturated and saturated zones changes with different dimensionless gsf generated by infiltration i d 0 0 5 1 a n d 2 during t d 10 2 50 where ω d 1 10 2 s yd 1 10 3 and k d 1 for i d 0 q d increases as t d increases at the early stage and then reaches a constant value the presence of i d increases q d and a larger i d induces a larger q d the figure at the lower right corner of fig 7 zooms in the curves of t d 45 55 it shows that after t d 50 when i d stops q d gradually decreases to a constant value which is not influenced by the value of i d the reason is that i d increases the water into the unsaturated zone as well as the saturated zone giving rise to higher q d when i d stops this influence also stops to examine the influence of gsf after the steady state flow is somewhat established by the vzw injection fig 8 displays the profile contours of u d z d 0 and s d z d 0 with different gsf i d applied during t d 200 250 where ω d 1 10 2 s yd 1 10 3 and k d 1 in fig 8 1 when i d 0 the influence area of vzw injection increases as time increases in fig 8 2 i d 0 5 is applied during t d 200 250 before i d starts the changes of u d and s d are the same with that in figs 8 1a the presence of i d enlarges the influence area especially at the top of the unsaturated zone after i d stops u d and s d gradually reach to constant values which are larger than that in figs 8 1c in fig 8 3 i d 0 5 is applied during t d 200 250 the change tendency of u d and s d is the same with that in fig 8 2 while the values of u d and s d are larger than those at the same time in fig 8 2 5 2 influences of gsf generated by evapotranspiration to investigate the influences of gsf generated by evapotranspiration on the response pattern of the hydraulic heads in the unsaturated and saturated zones we conduct the following analyses and set i d as a negative value other parameter values of the well and unsaturated and saturated zones are the same as that in section 4 fig 9 shows the hydraulic head increments change with the dimensionless gsf generated by evapotranspiration i d 0 3 during t d 10 2 50 solid curves and without i d dotted curves for the dimensionless constitutive exponent ω d 5 10 3 8 10 3 1 10 2 a n d 1 10 1 where s yd 1 10 3 and k d 1 in fig 9 the presence of i d decreases u d and s d and a smaller ω d leads to smaller u d and s d ω d represents the storage capacity and or thickness of the unsaturated zone a smaller ω d means that more water can be evaporated through the ground surface and less water drains downward into the saturated zone resulting in smaller u d and s d when ω d is very small u d and s d may become negative for some time and then increases after i d stops fig 10 shows the hydraulic head increments change with the dimensionless gsf generated by evapotranspiration i d 0 3 during t d 10 2 50 solid curves and without i d dotted curves for the dimensionless specific yield s yd 5 10 2 8 10 2 1 10 3 a n d 1 10 4 where ω d 1 10 2 and k d 1 like in fig 9 the presence of i d decreases u d and s d a smaller s yd leads to smaller u d and s d for the reason that it represents a smaller storage capacity of the unsaturated zone when s yd is very small u d and s d may become negative for some time and then increases after i d stops fig 11 shows the hydraulic head increments change with the dimensionless gsf generated by evapotranspiration i d 0 3 during t d 10 2 50 solid curves and without i d dotted curves for the hydraulic conductivity anisotropy k d 0 01 0 1 1 and 10 where ω d 1 10 2 and s yd 1 10 3 the presence of i d decreases u d and s d the smaller the k d the later this influence occurs the reason is that a smaller k d indicates that the horizontal flow is dominant in the unsaturated zone at early stage and it is more difficult for water to be evaporated through the ground surface then the influence of gsf generated by evapotranspiration on s d in the saturated zone is also delayed fig 12 shows the hydraulic head increments change with different values of dimensionless gsf generated by evapotranspiration i d 0 0 1 0 3 a n d 0 5 where ω d 1 10 2 s yd 1 10 3 and k d 1 in fig 12 1 i d is applied during t d 10 2 50 u d and s d decrease as the absolute value of i d increases a larger absolute value of i d means that more water is evaporated through the ground surface leading to faster decrease of u d when the absolute value of i d is very large the evapotranspiration effect is so strong that water will move upward through the saturated zone leading to negatives values of s d in fig 12 2 i d is applied during t d 200 250 after relatively long vzw injection the gsf is applied which causes gradual decreases of u d and s d the decreases of u d and s d are less than those in fig 12 1 for short time vzw injection injected water only flows in the vicinity of the well gsf generated by evapotranspiration is playing a dominating role and can lead to more hydraulic head decreases over most parts of aquifer that are not in the vicinity of the injection well fig 13 demonstrates how the dimensionless infiltration rate at the interface of the unsaturated and saturated zones changes with different dimensionless gsf generated by evapotranspiration i d 0 0 3 0 5 a n d 1 during t d 10 2 50 where ω d 1 10 2 s yd 1 10 3 and k d 1 for i d 0 q d increases as t d increases at the early stage and then reaches a constant value the presence of i d decreases q d and a larger absolute value of i d induces a smaller q d the figure at the lower right corner of fig 13 zooms in the curves of t d 45 55 it shows that after t d 50 when i d stops q d gradually increases to a constant value which is not influenced by the value of i d the reason is that gsf generated by evapotranspiration reduces the water into the unsaturated zone and the saturated zone giving rise to a lower q d when i d stops this influence also stops to examine the influence of gsf after the steady state flow is somewhat established by the vzw injection fig 14 displays the profile contours of u d z d 0 and s d z d 0 with different gsf i d applied during t d 200 250 where ω d 1 10 2 s yd 1 10 3 and k d 1 in fig 14 1 when i d 0 the influence area of vzw injection increases as time increases in fig 14 2 i d 0 1 is applied during t d 200 250 before i d starts the changes of u d and s d are the same with that in fig 14 1a the presence of i d decreases u d and s d especially at the top of the unsaturated zone after i d stops u d and s d gradually reach their asymptotic constants which are smaller than those in fig 14 1c in fig 14 3 i d 0 3 is applied during t d 200 250 the change tendency of u d and s d is the same with that in fig 14 2 while the values of u d and s d are smaller than those at the same time in fig 14 2 6 discussion there are a number of issues that deserve discussion for the better application of this study the assumptions and limitations of this study are also worth discussion first of all in this study the linearized richards equation is used to describe flow in the unsaturated zone such a linearization is realized by applying gardner 1958 model and kroszynski and dagan 1975 method of perturbation expansion the relative hydraulic conductivity and water content are assumed to vary exponentially with incremental capillary pressure head relative to the air entry pressure head the flow is assumed to differ slightly from equilibrium thus higher order terms in the expansion series of dependent variables in richards equation are neglected these simplifications have been tested and applied in previous studies kroszynski and dagan 1975 liang et al 2017b lin et al 2017 tartakovsky and neuman 2007 for instance mishra and neuman 2010 solved the problem of constant rate pumping in a coupled saturated and unsaturated flow system and compared the drawdown curves predicted by the analytical solution with the gardner s model and the numerical solution with the van genuchten mualem soil constitutive model mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 the comparison showed good agreement in the predicted drawdown curve at early and late times this indicates that the linearization method can be adopted for approximating the flow induced by vzw injection and ground surface flux for a coupled unsaturated saturated system when the flow differs slightly from its equilibrium state however one should be cautious that the linearization approximation as used in this study and in many previous studies may not be valid when flow differs considerably from its equilibrium state for instance when the rate of vzw injection is sufficiently large that the flow departs greatly from its equilibrium state if this is true one probably has to adopt a higher order approximation to deal with the problem which will make the analytical treatment difficult or even impossible for such a case we will recommend using a numerical approach rather than analytical approach to tackle the problem of concern which could be very challenging in a numerical perspective as the system investigated is highly nonlinear in nature all of these issues are out of the scope of this investigation and should be examined separately second media anisotropy has been considered but media heterogeneity has not been considered specifically in this study a typical kind of media heterogeneity in the vadose zone may appears as layering as multiple layers of soils with different hydraulic parameters coexist such a multiple layer system will substantially complicate the pattern of movement of water in the vadose zone in which gravity driven vertical flow usually prevails and can be hindered by some low permeability layers the use of media anisotropy or more specifically a lower vertical hydraulic conductivity than the horizontal hydraulic conductivity has partially taken into account the micro layering effect in an average sense fetter 2018 but it does not address a general multiple layer system another kind of typical heterogeneity commonly encountered in the field is isolated clay lens in the vadose zone as well as saturated zone which has not been addressed in present study further investigations are certainly valuable for extending the present work to a multiple layer system and or to include isolated clay lens among other issues third the well radius is assumed to be infinitely small in this study while bouwer 2002 referred that vzws are usually 1 2 m in diameter for such finite radius wells the wellbore storage may cause errors in prediction of hydraulic head changes at the early stage of vzw injection and the presence of well skin during injection can change the hydraulic properties around the well and affect the recharge capacity the effects of wellbore storage and well skin should not be ignored in the future in addition vzw injection can cause rise of the water table depending on the size and location of the well which may affect the water dissipation from the injection well such a groundwater mounding effect has not been taken into consideration and will be investigated in a future study fourth clogging of vzw is another issue that has not been included in this study but could affect the performance of vzw in real applications clogging of vzws may include the physical clogging in which fine materials block the entrance of the well screen or biological clogging in which growth of bacterial blocks the pathways of the well screen clogging can also reduce the permeability of formations immediately adjacent to vzws further investigation is certainly needed to address the clogging issue of vzws which has been reported in field applications bloetscher et al 2014 jeong et al 2018 martin 2013 7 conclusions this study investigates the influences of time dependent gsf generated by infiltration or evapotranspiration on the vzw injection in a coupled unsaturated saturated porous media the unsaturated flow is described by a linearized richards equation and the saturated flow is described by a three dimensional groundwater flow equation the unsaturated and saturated flows are coupled by interface conditions representing continuity of pressure and normal flux across the water table laplace and hankel transforms are used to derive the semi analytical solutions for the hydraulic head increment and infiltration rate at the interface of the unsaturated and saturated zones the time domain solutions are obtained by using the de hoog algorithm the solutions are tested by comparing with the numerical simulation results solved by comsol multiphysics indicating that our solutions have sufficient accuracy the conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the presence of gsf generated by infiltration can increase the hydraulic head increments in the unsaturated and saturated zones and the magnitude of this influence depends on properties of unsaturated and saturated zones and the value of gsf smaller ω d and s yd lead to larger increases of u d and s d when gsf is the same a small k d can delay the increases of u d and s d and the value of k d does not affect the final values of u d and s d in addition larger values of gsf generated by infiltration lead to larger increases of u d and s d 2 the presence of gsf generated by evapotranspiration can decrease the hydraulic head increments in the unsaturated and saturated zones and the magnitude of this influence depends on properties of unsaturated and saturated zones and the value of gsf smaller ω d and s yd lead to larger decreases of u d and s d when gsf is the same a small k d can delay the decreases of u d and s d and the value of k d does not affect the final values of u d and s d in addition larger absolute values of gsf generated by evapotranspiration lead to larger decreases of u d and s d 3 the presence of gsf generated by infiltration can increase the infiltration rate at the interface of the unsaturated and saturated zones and larger values of gsf lead to larger increases of q d after gsf stops the infiltration rate gradually decreases to a constant value which is not influenced by the value of gsf generated by infiltration 4 the presence of gsf generated by evapotranspiration can decrease the infiltration rate at the interface of the unsaturated and saturated zones and larger absolute values of gsf lead to larger decreases of q d after gsf stops the infiltration rate gradually increases to a constant value which is not influenced by the value of gsf generated by evapotranspiration credit authorship contribution statement cuiting qi conceptualization methodology software writing original

5667,hydrologic pulse represent one of the dominant factors controlling the distribution of aquatic organisms changes in hydrologic pulses may change the surroundings of the organism and then affect their distribution and community structure here based on the data from a rainy season and a dry season the water quality heavy metal in the sediment and macrozoobenthos community structure in two shallow lakes nansihu lake nsh and dongpinghu lake dph were analyzed the results showed that the water diversion pulse participated in the influence of runoff pulse on nsh and dph the macrozoobenthos community in nsh and dph were similar after the hydrologic pulse changed this might be due to these two lakes were connected by the south to north water transfer project snwtp along the direction of water transfer the macrozoobenthos communities were gradually dominated by small size species with as water quality decreased compared with community structure before the snwtp the macrozoobenthos changed from dominant aquatic insect to dominant mollusca in nsh and changed from dominant mollusca and oligochaeta to dominant mollusca in dph the water diversion pulse in which the direction of water transfer was opposite to that of natural water flow affected the distribution of nitrogen and phosphorous in water and heavy metals in sediment in addition the introduction of exogenous water caused by the snwtp changed water quality and heavy metals content in the sediment and water depth in nsh and dph these changes together affected the community structure and distribution of macrozoobenthos these findings enable a better understanding of the ecological impact of intense hydrologic pulse changes caused by water transfer projects keywords macrozoobenthos community hydrologic pulse connected lakes shallow lakes the south to north water transfer project 1 introduction hydrological changes strongly affect the habitat environment of aquatic organisms song et al 2010 and affect their community structure menció and boix 2018 water quality is directly related to the community structure of aquatic organisms sediments which include aggregations of organic debris and provide habitat that benthos directly come into contact with are closely related to the composition and distribution of aquatic organisms because of discontinuities in time precipitation and water transfer affect the aquatic organisms in lakes or rivers in the form of hydrologic pulses which change the hydrology water quality and sediment in the environmental habitat and represent one of the main factors controlling the distribution of aquatic organisms hydrologic pulse is not clearly defined yet in this study we consider the hydrologic pulse to be a hydrology type in the form of the pulse during a hydrologic year the hydrologic pulse is characterized by high flow volume and fast flow velocity in the rainy season and low flow volume and slow flow velocity in the dry season the hydrological pulses generated by the water transfer project were collectively referred to as water diversion pulses and those caused by rainfall runoff were collectively referred to as runoff pulses the runoff pulses are usually seasonal or affect the receiving water in the form of a flood pulse because of the temporal spatial heterogeneity a et al 2019 bazzanti et al 2012 donohue et al 2009 fang et al 2018 galir balkić et al 2018 han et al 2018 winemiller et al 2014 zhao et al 2018 additionally runoff pulses caused by precipitation are natural and uncontrollable due to the randomness of climate change water diversion pulses showed regularity and caused intense hydrological change because it broke the naturally formed hydrological pattern due to the implementation of water transfer projects the situation in lakes with high water levels in the rainy season and low water levels in the dry season have also changed specifically the water levels have generally been raised the reversal caused by the hydrologic regime and the increase in water level has affected the ecosystems of regulating lakes zhang 2009 the riparian ecosystem of the terminal reservoir of the water transfer project was also affected by the rise of the water level yang et al 2018 the introduction of external water sources and water pollution during the water transfer project led to changes in the water quality and sedimentary environment in these lakes zhang 2009 zhuang 2016 zhuang et al 2019 and these changes caused a chain reaction in the community structure guo et al 2019 hydrology is susceptible to rainfall and many studies have shown that the diversity and richness of aquatic organisms are more dependent on flow changes in river channels arthington et al 2014 galir balkić et al 2018 karaouzas et al 2019 mustonen et al 2016 thus the impact of hydrologic pulses on aquatic organisms in rivers is apparent flood pulses increased the early survival rate of most fish in rivers by preventing abrasion from contact between larvae and sediment rodger et al 2016 and affected the community structure of rotifers by affecting food sources galir balkić et al 2018 at the same time water quantity changes caused by seasonal hydrologic pulses seriously affected the abundance of algae and microbenthos winemiller et al 2014 studies on the impact of hydrologic pulses on aquatic organisms have been concentrated in rivers while in lakes most studies have focused on the relationship between hydrologic conditions formed by their own characteristics and ecosystems bazzanti et al 2012 donohue et al 2009 zhao et al 2018 and on the impact of water level change caused by precipitation on aquatic organisms cremona et al 2008 in addition water depth and water temperature as the main driving factors of the aquatic organism community in lakes especially those in deep lakes represent the most common research content bazzanti et al 2012 wu et al 2016 in shallow lakes due to the small water depth the water stratification was not obvious and aquatic organisms were vulnerable to external fluctuations thus the relationship between the community structure of aquatic organisms and hydrological conditions such as velocity have also been primary research concerns zhao et al 2018 however most studies in lakes focus on individual hydrology or water quality factors research on the influence of hydrologic pulses on aquatic organisms in lakes especially those in shallow lakes which are easily affected by hydrologic and water quality changes are still very limited zoobenthos are usually widely distributed and have poor mobility thus they have long been used to evaluate water quality and ecosystem health cai et al 2017 heino and tolonen 2018 menció and boix 2018 żbikowski and kobak 2007 changes in habitat environment can affect community structure within a year or several years menció and boix 2018 pennuto et al 2014 piló et al 2016 especially in shallow lakes the zoobenthos are an essential group affecting lake ecosystems scheffer 1998 żbikowski and kobak 2007 the distribution of benthos is directly related to the water quality in shallow lakes eutrophication is common due to plankton and sediment inputs cai et al 2010 rao et al 2018 the nutritional status and pollution level have been reported as the most important factors regulating the macrozoobenthos community cai et al 2010 the influence of these factors on the temporal and spatial variation in benthos is obvious zhao et al 2018 additionally benthos and phytoplankton are vulnerable to the constraints of total nitrogen and phosphorus zhao et al 2014 zhao et al 2019 and the increase in nutrients increases the future dominance of dominant species rao et al 2018 in addition hydrologic changes cause changes in water quality thus jointly interfering with the distribution of aquatic organisms menció and boix 2018 song et al 2010 the content of heavy metals in sediments as the main living space of benthos is correlated with the distribution of aquatic organisms some studies have shown that benthos species are less abundant in areas with high heavy metal pollution in sediments wu et al 2014 and species with small sizes and short life spans have adaptive advantages in areas with heavy metal pollution piló et al 2016 due to the low water depth the sediment quality of shallow lakes is more easily disturbed by outside changes than that of deep lakes therefore the influence of water quality and the sediment environment on benthos in shallow lakes cannot be ignored the water diversion pulses change the hydrologic pattern of receiving water that is affected only by the runoff pulses this kind of hydrologic pulse change leads to intense hydrologic changes and affects the water quality and sedimentary environment additionally it represents a new stress to the benthos community there have been many studies on the impact of hydrologic pulses on communities in rivers and some studies have been conducted to research the relationship between plankton communities and environmental factors in the regulating and storing lakes along the water transfer project route liu et al 2010 luo et al 2019 tian et al 2012 tian et al 2013a b 2016 tian et al 2017a b zhao et al 2014 however under the long term influence of the hydrologic pulse changes in which the water diversion pulse is involved in the impact of the runoff pulse affecting the macrozoobenthos in lakes the macrozoobenthos variations have not been thoroughly studied especially in shallow lakes in this paper we focused on several issues 1 community structure and temporal spatial variations in macrozoobenthos were investigated and compared in two regulating and storing lakes along the water transfer project route 2 the environmental driving factors of the distribution of the macrozoobenthos community and interspecific variations were analyzed in two shallow lakes and 3 the effect of the hydrologic pulse changes on the macrozoobenthos community was analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the south to north water transfer project snwtp is the largest inter basin transfer project in the world the eastern route of the snwtp starts from the water source which is the yangtze river and flows through the shandong peninsula to tianjin city making this region an important route for this project feng et al 2007 nansihu lake nsh and dongpinghu lake dph are important regulating and storing lakes along the eastern route and there was no obvious hydraulic connectivity between these two lakes before the snwtp fig 1 during the non water transfer periods rain and other drainage flow into nsh through the liangjiyun river and the water flows from northwest to southeast during the water transfer periods the snwtp raises the water level in the lower reaches and transfers water to the vicinity of dph through the liangjiyun river and then pumps the water into dph the snwtp not only connects nsh and dph but also changes the flow direction completely during water transfer periods since the first water supply in 2013 nsh and dph have participated in water diversion many times water transfers mainly occur in winter and spring every year and are adjusted based on the water level in each year before the snwtp the inflow of nsh and dph was mainly caused by runoff and some wastewater after the snwtp these two lakes were greatly affected by water transfer which changed the hydrologicl factors in nsh and dph and then greatly affected the habitat of aquatic organisms in nsh and dph the surface area of nsh is approximately 1260 km2 and the lake basin is shallow and flat nsh consists of four lakes and the erjiba dam divides the lakes into the upper lakes which include dushanhu lake and nanyanghu lake and the lower lakes which include weishanhu lake and zhaoyanghu lake zhaoyanghu lake has the smallest water depth for many years because of the interception effect of the erjiba dam the average water depths of the upper lakes of nsh are greater than those of the lower lakes the perennial water surface of dph is approximately 125 km2 and the average water depth for many years has been approximately 2 m nsh and dph are the main ecological reserves and tourist attractions in shandong province they are rich in biodiversity and rich in aquatic products aquatic animals and plants nsh has rich wetland resources and a variety of aquatic plants and animals the fish and birds are also diverse the implementation of the snwtp complicated the water ecological environment nsh and dph are both in the continental monsoon climate with dry cold winters and hot rainy summers and the rainfall is concentrated in the rainy season 2 2 data description during the summer july of 2018 and spring march of 2019 two water quality and aquatic organism samplings were conducted in the two lakes and the samples came from 16 sites in nsh and 6 sites in dph the data on water quality sediment and aquatic organisms provided a rich database for the study of the macrozoobenthos community 2 2 1 ecological data at each sampling site macrozoobenthos samples were collected using a 0 025 m2 peterson grab and sieved in situ through a 425 μm aperture mesh size sieve the material retained from the sieve was collected in a 500 ml bottle and 4 concentration buffered formalin solution was added each macrozoobenthos sample was collected twice in the laboratory the macrozoobenthos samples were identified by an anatomic microscope and microscope and their densities were calculated the phytoplankton were sampled by collecting 1000 ml at a depth of 0 5 m with a water extractor and 40 ml lugol s solution and 40 ml 40 formalin solution were added to the phytoplankton sample for fixation each phytoplankton sample was collected twice the zooplankton were collected by filtering the lake water with a 200 mesh sieve the filtrate was collected in a 100 ml bottle and 50 ml 40 formaldehyde solution was added to the zooplankton sample for fixation all samples were stored in the dark and sent to the laboratory a 24 h sedimentation method was used to concentrate the phytoplankton and zooplankton samples to 50 ml and an inter plankton microscope was employed to count them 2 2 2 water quality data and sediment data during the 22 sampling events water samples and sediment were collected and the samples were sent to the laboratory for testing within 24 h after collection a spectrophotometer was used to measure ammonia nitrogen nh4 n total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and chemical oxygen demand cod in the water inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry was employed to measure the cadmium cd chromium cr copper cu iron fe nickel ni lead pb and zinc zn in the sediment and the organic matter om in the sediment was also measured 2 3 methods 2 3 1 dominant species evaluation method the species density i e the number of species in a given sampling site is an important indicator however the frequency of species appeared to affect the species distribution in this paper we use equation 1 to calculate the dominance of macrozoobenthos species and this equation considers the number and distribution of the target species all the species densities were fourth root transformed to reduce the influence of extreme values chen et al 2016 olsgard et al 1997 1 y i n i n f i where y i is the dominance of a macrozoobenthos species n i is the abundance of the i th species n refers to the total abundance of the species and f i refers to the frequency in which the i th species appears 2 3 2 identification method of key driving factors the relationship between species composition and environmental factors was realized by redundancy analysis rda based on the fact that the gradient length of the longest detrended correspondence analysis dca axis was less than 3 standard deviation units 2 48 2 67 luo et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 rda combines correspondence analysis with multiple regression thus it reflects the effect of species composition on a community and reflects the influence of environmental factors in this paper the environmental variables consisted of tn tp nh4 n and cod in water and cd cr fe zn ni cu and pb in sediment all the environmental variables were log 10 x 1 transformed to normalize their distribution before analysis rda figures were drawn using r package 2 3 3 niche breadth and niche overlap niche breadth and niche overlap can be calculated by many methods colwell and futuyma 1971 dolédec et al 2000 petraitis 1979 pianka 1974 schoener 1968 1974 smith 1982 and are widely used amacker and alford 2017 heino and tolonen 2018 liu et al 2019 quirino et al 2019 in this paper we used the shannon wiener index eq 2 to obtain niche breadth shannon 1948 and the pianka overlap model eq 3 was used to calculate niche overlap pianka 1974 2 b i j 1 r p ij ln p ij 3 q ik j 1 r p ij p kj j 1 r p ij 2 j 1 r p kj 2 where b i is the niche breadth of the i th species q ik is the niche overlap of the i th species on the k th species r is the total number of resource states p ij and p kj refer to the ratios of the individual numbers of the i th species and the k th species in the j th resources state to the total individual number of the i th and j th species respectively 3 results 3 1 the macrozoobenthos community structure and dominant species 3 1 1 macrozoobenthos community composition and spatial variations sample analysis in the 22 sampling sites identified a total of 38 species belonging to 4 phyla the macrozoobenthos community consisted of mollusca oligochaeta aquatic insects and some unidentified species which accounted for 57 89 14 79 10 53 and 15 79 of the total species numbers of macrozoobenthos respectively mollusca dominated phyla and abundance fig 2 and occurred at all sites the total macrozoobenthos abundance varied from 2 ind m2 to 1540 ind m2 in the lower lakes of nsh 1520 ind m2 in the upper lakes and 1800 ind m2 in dph and the species composition showed obvious spatial heterogeneity mollusca aquatic insects and oligochaeta ranked in order were the absolute dominant groups in the three regions the abundance of mollusca contributed 93 and 85 to the total abundance in the lower lakes and the upper lakes of nsh respectively while the value was 60 in dph the total abundance of mollusca decreased gradually and aquatic insects and oligochaeta increased gradually from the southern to the northern region of nsh and then to dph fig 2 the species numbers among all sites were compared and 24 20 and 22 species occurred in the lower lakes in the upper lakes of nsh and in dph respectively eleven species were common to these three regions the upper lakes and lower lakes shared more species than they shared with dph and the lower lakes and dph had no common species 3 1 2 identifying of the dominant species in nsh and dph a total of 38 macrozoobenthos were identified and used to identify the dominant species the density and the frequency of species appears were input into eq 1 to calculate the species dominance y i the dominance was ranked from large to small and the accumulation value was calculated to draw the dominance curve the breakpoints were calculated according to the previously drawn curve fig 3 and the cut off points were 12 1 74 11 1 63 10 3 37 in the lower lakes the upper lakes of nsh and dph respectively the dominant species were bellamya purificata bithynia fuchsiana cipangopaludina cathayensis radix auricularia radix lagotis hippeutis umbilicalis cipangopaludina chinensis parafossarulus striatulus tubifex sinicus chironomus plumosus propsilocerusi akamusi unidentified gastropoda radix clessini gyraulus albus semisulcospira cancellata and rheotanytarsus muscicola those dominant species were labelled spa1 to spa16 respectively table 2 except for spa6 and spa10 the dominance value of each species in dph was higher than that in nsh and there was no obvious difference between the dominance value in the upper lakes and the lower lakes in the three regions the number of dominant species screened by the unified method was not much different and the dominance values of the dominant species between the two regions of nsh were not much different however the dominance value of species in dph was much different fig 3 this difference was caused by the high occurrence frequency which was significantly correlated with dominance value fig 4 without considering the occurrence frequency the differences in dominance among the three regions were small thus the difference in occurrence frequency led to the difference in species dominance between nsh and dph for the phenomenon of the high occurrence frequency in dph it was likely that the area of dph was much smaller than that of the others thus the high sampling density led to the high occurrence frequency of dominant species in dph bithynia fuchsiana spa2 had the highest dominance value in all three regions especially in dph and appeared at all sampling sites additionally the mollusca species number was the least these two reasons led to the absolute advantage of bithynia fuchsiana in dph the dominance value of hippeutis umbilicalis spa6 in dph was the lowest likely due to its low occurrence frequency in dph and high occurrence frequency in nsh 3 2 spatial variations in the environment and biological factors 3 2 1 spatial variations in the environment factors pollutants in water have toxic effects on organisms and can turn into more toxic compounds under the action of microorganisms the pollutants are enriched in organisms due to biological amplification through the food chain and then these pollutants can affect the structure and distribution of benthos the four water quality indicators in nsh showed lower values than those in dph and in the lower lakes of nsh they showed lower values than those of the upper lakes of nsh table 1 however the indicators of sediment showed a different pattern the values of cr cu fe and ni in nsh were lower than those in dph while the values of cd pb and zn were larger than those in dph the values of om cd zn and pb in nsh were higher than those in dph but the differences were not significant the average concentrations of cd cr cu ni and pb in the lower lakes of nsh were higher than those in the upper lakes while the concentrations of fe and zn in the lower lakes were lower than those in the upper lakes overall the water pollution in dph was more serious than that in nsh and that of the upper lakes in nsh was more serious than that in lower lakes yao et al 2019 when considering the heavy metals in sediment the same conclusion could be drawn as dph was more polluted by heavy metals than was nsh with the exceptions of cd zn and pb for the heavy metals in the sediment of nsh 5 in 7 indicators in the lower lakes of nsh had the higher content than those in the upper lakes 3 2 2 spatial variations in the biological factors phytoplankton and zooplankton not only directly reflect the pollution status of the habitat environment but also affect the structure and distribution of benthos as food sources the total density of phytoplankton decreased gradually from the lower lakes of nsh to the upper lakes and then to dph which was consistent with the pollution trend reflected by the water quality and heavy metal fig 2 unlike phytoplankton the total density of zooplankton in nsh was still higher than that in dph while the density in the lower lakes was the lowest this pattern was different from that of phytoplankton but consistent with that of cd zn pb and om 3 2 3 identifying the key driving factors in the macrozoobenthos community water quality factors have a great impact on the distribution and composition of aquatic lives and sediments are the direct living environment of macrozoobenthos additionally zooplankton and phytoplankton are zoobenthos food resources water quality indicators and plankton in water and heavy metals and organic matter in sediments were considered for statistical analysis with macrozoobenthos for which only the dominant species were considered on the rda sorting map the line segment with arrows represents the environmental factor and the plankton factor the length of the line segment represents the correlation between the environmental factors and the species distribution and a longer line segment indicates a greater impact the smaller the angle between a species and an environmental factor is the closer the relationship between the species and the environmental factor is the key driving factors of zooplankton communities could be identified by this principle it can be seen from fig 5 that the key water quality factors and ecological factors were tzoo tphyto and tn in dph tphyto tzoo cod and nh4 n in the upper lakes of nsh and tphyto and nh4 n in the lower lakes the key sediment factors were om cu cr zn pb in dph cd pb and om in the upper lakes and pb cd and cu in the lower lakes moreover the effects of water quality and ecological factors on macrozoobenthos were more obvious than those of sediment particularly for the ecological factors according to the rda results the two axis interpretation rate of the macrozoobenthos distribution in dph was higher than that in nsh which indicated that there were additional factors affecting the macrozoobenthos community in nsh other than the factors shown in the fig 5 3 3 variations in the ecological niche parameters in nsh and dph in general the adaptability of species to the environment and interspecies competition can be described by niche breadth and niche overlap the species with a wider niche breadth are more adaptable and are usually referred to as generalized species these species have a wider range of resources available when resources are rare generalized species are more competitive because of their broad diet and greater chances of survival the species with a narrower niche breadth are environmentally sensitive and are usually referred to as specialized species and they have few resources available which means they are more competitive when resources are abundant because of the high efficiency of food zhao et al 2014 except for semisulcospira cancellata spa15 and rheotanytarsus muscicola spa16 the niche breadths of the other dominant species in dph were the lowest considering only the niche breadth of species in nsh the niche breadths of cipangopaludina cathayensis spa3 tubifex sinicus spa9 chironomus plumosus spa10 and radix clessini spa13 in the upper lakes were larger than those in the lower lakes while the niche breadths of bellamya purificata spa1 radix auricularia spa4 radix lagotis spa5 and hippeutis umbilicalis spa6 in the upper lakes were smaller than those in the lower lakes while the niche breadths of bithynia fuchsiana spa2 and propsilocerusi akamusi spa11 were similar in nsh the niche breadth of bithynia fuchsiana was the highest in all three regions especially in nsh the mean niche overlap in dph was higher than the others and that in the lower lakes was only slightly higher than the upper lakes indicating that the interspecific competition in dph was intense than that in nsh fig 7 the mean niche overlap values of bithynia fuchsiana spa2 and cipangopaludina cathayensis spa3 were higher than the other dominant species fig 7 and they had high niche breadth values in dph and nsh fig 6 therefore these species had a wide range of available resources and easily competed with other species the mean niche overlap values of unidentified gastropoda spa12 in dph and in the upper lakes of nsh were higher than those of other dominant species indicating that they had more competitors the greatest of which were bithynia fuchsiana spa2 and cipangopaludina cathayensis spa3 the most competitive species pairs were spa1 spa2 spa2 spa12 spa3 spa12 and spa10 spa11 in dph spa4 spa6 and spa9 spa16 in the upper lakes and spa4 spa6 and spa5 spa11 in the lower lakes furthermore the value of the niche overlap index of these species pairs was greater than 0 77 4 discussion 4 1 variations in macrozoobenthos community after the hydrologic pulse change before the snwtp both nsh and dph were dominated by runoff pulse the snwtp formed the water diversion pulse that impacted these two lakes and the hydrologic pulse changed the snwtp has occurred for six years and this long term hydrologic pulse changes have had a cumulative impact on the macrozoobenthos community in nsh and dph and the macrozoobenthos community in nsh and dph changed a lot after the snwtp here the main macrozoobenthos groups in the two lakes were the same and they were mollusca oligochaeta and aquatic insects their abundance and proportion showed the following order mollusca oligochaeta aquatic insects and the total abundance in the upper lake of nsh was lower than in the lower lakes of nsh fig 2 this was very different from the macrozoobenthos community structure before the hydrologic pulse changed caused by the snwtp before the implementation of the snwtp aquatic insects dominated the macrozoobenthos in nsh and the total density of macrozoobenthos in the upper lakes was higher than that in the lower lakes shu et al 2014 mollusca and oligochaeta dominated the macrozoobenthos in dph and the species number of mollusca decreased compared with the previous values dong et al 2015 under the influence of the hydrologic pulse change caused by the snwtp the macrozoobenthos also showed obvious spatial differences from the lower lakes to the upper lakes of nsh to dph the abundance and proportion of mollusca which had large sizes gradually decreased and the oligochaeta and aquatic insects which had small sizes gradually increased the snwtp connected nsh and dph and dph received the transferred water from nsh in the rainy season this affected the macrozoobenthos community making them similar in structure and regular in spatial change hydrologic pulse change caused by the snwtp not only affected the macrozoobenthos community structure and distribution but also affected the interspecific relationships in nsh and dph among the 16 dominant species shown in fig 6 apart from semisulcospira cancellata spa15 and rheotanytarsus muscicola spa16 the niche breadths of other species was lower in dph than in nsh which was contrary to the distribution of dominance this indicated that the dominant species in dph had less available resources than nsh compared with nsh dph had less plankton fig 2 and less om table 1 these food sources restricted the breadth of the benthos diet therefore food sources might cause of the low niche breadth of dominant species in dph the niche overlap values of the 16 dominant species in these three regions were consistent with the change rule of niche breadth which also verified that the species with a larger niche breadth will overlap with more species zhao et al 2014 the average niche overlap value in dph was higher than that in nsh and the values in the upper lakes and the lower lakes of nsh were similar which showed that the competition in dph was more intense than that in nsh bithynia fuchsiana spa2 and cipangopaludina cathayensis spa3 had the widest niche breadth and largest niche overlap values so they were highly adaptable to the environment both gyraulus albus spa14 and rheotanytarsus muscicola spa16 had low niche breadth and niche overlap which indicated that they were more sensitive to the environment 4 2 hydrologic pulse changes affect macrozoobenthos through water quality the hydrologic pulse changes affect the water quality and then affect the macrozoobenthos community on the one hand the water quality of the external water source affected the water quality in receiving lake on the other hand the snwtp changed the natural water flow direction and this intense change also interfered with the distribution of nitrogen and phosphorus in the lakes which alleviated the eutrophication in nsh and dph qu et al 2017 and thereby affected the distribution of macrozoobenthos the rda results fig 5 showed that water quality factors were closely related to macrozoobenthos the niche breadth values along the water quality factors gradient indicated that the tp changes had the least effect on the macrozoobenthos while the cod changes had the greatest effect table 3 moreover even if the nitrogen effect is small it still needs to be concerned because in addition to direct pollution nitrogen has potential risks for lake ecosystems wang et al 2019a so the water quality had an obvious effect on the macrozoobenthos in nsh and dph along the water transfer direction the proportion and total density of large size mollusca decreased and the small size oligochaeta and aquatic insects increased fig 2 at the same time the water quality indicators like tn tp cod nh4 n also gradually increased table 1 these indicated that with the deterioration of water quality the community gradually changed from the dominant large size to the dominant small size these results were consistent with other studies cai et al 2010 2012 donohue et al 2009 yang et al 2019 in addition the total plankton in water was closely related to the water quality and the distribution of macrozoobenthos because the plankton was the food of macrozoobenthos so the change in water quality not only directly affected the distribution of macrozoobenthos but also affected the plankton community which then affected the composition and distribution of macrozoobenthos tian et al 2012 tian et al 2013a b therefore the hydrologic pulse change affected the spatial distribution of macrozoobenthos by changing the water quality to further analyze the macrozoobenthos community variations the dominant species niche parameters were calculated most dominant species in dph had lower niche breadth and higher niche overlap than that in nsh figs 6 and 7 so the dominant species in dph had less available resource and more intense interspecific than in nsh this was related to zooplankton and om as a source of food for macrozoobenthos fewer zooplankton and organic matter in dph fig 2 and table 1 therefore these results confirmed that the hydrologic pulse change affected the water quality which affected the community structure and distribution of macrozoobenthos either directly or indirectly by affecting plankton 4 3 hydrologic pulse changes affect macrozoobenthos through heavy metal in the sediment compared with water quality which can respond to external influences in time the distribution of heavy metals in sediment is a long term accumulation process which can better reflect the cumulative impact of hydrologic pulse changes on aquatic organisms wang et al 2018 hydrologic pulse change caused by the snwtp affected the distribution of heavy metals and then affected macrozoobenthos the snwtp brought the exogenous heavy metals thus affected the heavy metal in nsh the change of flow direction and intense water diversion pulse affected the distribution of heavy metals in sediment of the shallow lakes and then affected the community structure and distribution of macrozoobenthos the rda results showed that heavy metals were related to the distribution of macrozoobenthos especially pb cd and cu but not as much as water quality factors and plankton after the snwtp 5 in 7 heavy metals in the lower lakes had a higher average content than in the upper lakes this was consistent with other studies after the snwtp but not consistent with the results of the earlier survey before the snwtp the average content of heavy metals in the lower lakes was lower than that in the upper lakes liu and zhang 2013 zhang et al 2016 this shift was due to the introduction of exogenous heavy metals by the snwtp zhuang et al 2019 besides the intense hydrologic change which the reversal of flow direction also disturbed the distribution of heavy metal in lakes these changes affected the distribution of heavy metals in nsh therefore the hydrologic pulse change caused by the snwtp had a significant impact on the sediment environment of nsh and further affected the distribution of macrozoobenthos the niche breadth values along the heavy metals gradient showed that the pb change had the greatest effect on the macrozoobenthos table 3 the average content of pb in the lower lakes was the highest which was mainly due to agriculture farming around the lower lakes of nsh because the main source of pb was natural and agricultural fertilization zhuang et al 2019 and some came from industrial sources wang et al 2019b therefore the control of agricultural fertilization benefits the macrozoobenthos in nsh 4 4 hydrologic pulse changes affect macrozoobenthos through water depth the water levels in nsh and dph were generally low in the dry periods and high in the rainy periods because of the runoff pulse the water diversion pulse increased the inflow of these two lakes and then raised the water level and this change alleviated the decline in the water level that occurs during the dry periods as one of the main hydrologic factors water depth greatly affected the macrozoobenthos bazzanti et al 2012 scharold et al 2010 the hydrologic pulse change caused the water depth change which affected the macrozoobenthos community in terms of the total abundance of macrozoobenthos the lower lakes of nsh had the highest total abundance and dph had the lowest the small size aquatic insects and oligochaeta were more abundant in dph than nsh this was probably related to the larger water depth in dph protected the small size aquatic insects and oligochaeta from the disturbance of water diversion pulse in the three regions the average water depth of dph was larger than nsh and that of the lower lakes was smaller than the upper lakes on the one hand dph had the largest average natural lake depth and zhaoyanghu lake in the lower lakes had the smallest average lake depth on the other hand during water transfer periods the water was pumped from the lower lakes into the upper lakes which maintained the water level difference during the non water transfer period the interception of the erjiba dam made the average water depth of the upper lakes lager than the lower lakes for a long time all of these factors led to the smallest average depth in the lower lakes and the largest average depth in dph therefore hydrologic pulse change affected the water depth and then led to the difference in the total density of macrozoobenthos 5 conclusions hydrologic pulse is one of the factors controlling the distribution of aquatic organisms intense hydrologic variations change the surrounding environment and then affect the distribution and community structure of macrozoobenthos due to the snwtp water diversion pulse participated in the influence of runoff pulse on nsh and dph and this hydrologic pulse change affected the macrozoobenthos community structure however under the influence of this long term hydrologic pulse change the macrozoobenthos variations in nsh and dph were still not very clear in this study the changes in environmental factors and macrozoobenthos community structure in the upper lakes and the lower lakes of nsh and dph were studied and the distribution and community variations under the influence of hydrologic pulse change for many years were discussed by analyzing the water quality heavy metal in the sediment and water depth our goal was to provide some suggestions and theoretical support for the protection and improvement of water ecology the influence of the hydrologic pulse on the nsh and dph changed from the rainfall pulse to the hydrologic pulses consisting the runoff pulse and water diversion pulse after the hydrologic pulse changes the macrozoobenthos communities in nsh and dph were similar mainly composed of mollusca oligochaeta and aquatic insects and dominated by mollusca before the hydrologic pulse changes the macrozoobenthos in nsh and dph were dominated by aquatic insects and oligochaeta respectively from nsh to dph that is along the water transfer direction of the snwtp the abundance and proportion of mollusca gradually decreased and oligochaeta and aquatic insects gradually increased with the deterioration of water quality macrozoobenthos communities gradually became dominated by smaller species the hydrologic pulse change caused by the snwtp not only affected the community but also affected the interspecific relationships after the snwtp the interspecific competition was the most intense in dph and least intense in the upper lakes of nsh which had a lot to do with food the distribution of food was one of the effects of the water diversion pulse the dominant species were least affected by tp and most affected by cod in nsh and dph the pb in the sediment was also had effect on the macrozoobenthos in the study area the intense hydrologic change in which the direction of water transfer was opposite to that of natural water flow affected the distribution of nitrogen and phosphorous in water and heavy metals in sediment in addition the introduction of exogenous water caused by the snwtp changed water quality and heavy metals and water depth in nsh and dph these changes affected the community structure and distribution of macrozoobenthos in conclusion the hydrologic pulse change caused by the snwtp had an obvious cumulative effect on macrozoobenthos community these results increase our understanding of the impact of hydrological changes caused by water transfer projects on water ecology credit authorship contribution statement guoqiang wang

5667,hydrologic pulse represent one of the dominant factors controlling the distribution of aquatic organisms changes in hydrologic pulses may change the surroundings of the organism and then affect their distribution and community structure here based on the data from a rainy season and a dry season the water quality heavy metal in the sediment and macrozoobenthos community structure in two shallow lakes nansihu lake nsh and dongpinghu lake dph were analyzed the results showed that the water diversion pulse participated in the influence of runoff pulse on nsh and dph the macrozoobenthos community in nsh and dph were similar after the hydrologic pulse changed this might be due to these two lakes were connected by the south to north water transfer project snwtp along the direction of water transfer the macrozoobenthos communities were gradually dominated by small size species with as water quality decreased compared with community structure before the snwtp the macrozoobenthos changed from dominant aquatic insect to dominant mollusca in nsh and changed from dominant mollusca and oligochaeta to dominant mollusca in dph the water diversion pulse in which the direction of water transfer was opposite to that of natural water flow affected the distribution of nitrogen and phosphorous in water and heavy metals in sediment in addition the introduction of exogenous water caused by the snwtp changed water quality and heavy metals content in the sediment and water depth in nsh and dph these changes together affected the community structure and distribution of macrozoobenthos these findings enable a better understanding of the ecological impact of intense hydrologic pulse changes caused by water transfer projects keywords macrozoobenthos community hydrologic pulse connected lakes shallow lakes the south to north water transfer project 1 introduction hydrological changes strongly affect the habitat environment of aquatic organisms song et al 2010 and affect their community structure menció and boix 2018 water quality is directly related to the community structure of aquatic organisms sediments which include aggregations of organic debris and provide habitat that benthos directly come into contact with are closely related to the composition and distribution of aquatic organisms because of discontinuities in time precipitation and water transfer affect the aquatic organisms in lakes or rivers in the form of hydrologic pulses which change the hydrology water quality and sediment in the environmental habitat and represent one of the main factors controlling the distribution of aquatic organisms hydrologic pulse is not clearly defined yet in this study we consider the hydrologic pulse to be a hydrology type in the form of the pulse during a hydrologic year the hydrologic pulse is characterized by high flow volume and fast flow velocity in the rainy season and low flow volume and slow flow velocity in the dry season the hydrological pulses generated by the water transfer project were collectively referred to as water diversion pulses and those caused by rainfall runoff were collectively referred to as runoff pulses the runoff pulses are usually seasonal or affect the receiving water in the form of a flood pulse because of the temporal spatial heterogeneity a et al 2019 bazzanti et al 2012 donohue et al 2009 fang et al 2018 galir balkić et al 2018 han et al 2018 winemiller et al 2014 zhao et al 2018 additionally runoff pulses caused by precipitation are natural and uncontrollable due to the randomness of climate change water diversion pulses showed regularity and caused intense hydrological change because it broke the naturally formed hydrological pattern due to the implementation of water transfer projects the situation in lakes with high water levels in the rainy season and low water levels in the dry season have also changed specifically the water levels have generally been raised the reversal caused by the hydrologic regime and the increase in water level has affected the ecosystems of regulating lakes zhang 2009 the riparian ecosystem of the terminal reservoir of the water transfer project was also affected by the rise of the water level yang et al 2018 the introduction of external water sources and water pollution during the water transfer project led to changes in the water quality and sedimentary environment in these lakes zhang 2009 zhuang 2016 zhuang et al 2019 and these changes caused a chain reaction in the community structure guo et al 2019 hydrology is susceptible to rainfall and many studies have shown that the diversity and richness of aquatic organisms are more dependent on flow changes in river channels arthington et al 2014 galir balkić et al 2018 karaouzas et al 2019 mustonen et al 2016 thus the impact of hydrologic pulses on aquatic organisms in rivers is apparent flood pulses increased the early survival rate of most fish in rivers by preventing abrasion from contact between larvae and sediment rodger et al 2016 and affected the community structure of rotifers by affecting food sources galir balkić et al 2018 at the same time water quantity changes caused by seasonal hydrologic pulses seriously affected the abundance of algae and microbenthos winemiller et al 2014 studies on the impact of hydrologic pulses on aquatic organisms have been concentrated in rivers while in lakes most studies have focused on the relationship between hydrologic conditions formed by their own characteristics and ecosystems bazzanti et al 2012 donohue et al 2009 zhao et al 2018 and on the impact of water level change caused by precipitation on aquatic organisms cremona et al 2008 in addition water depth and water temperature as the main driving factors of the aquatic organism community in lakes especially those in deep lakes represent the most common research content bazzanti et al 2012 wu et al 2016 in shallow lakes due to the small water depth the water stratification was not obvious and aquatic organisms were vulnerable to external fluctuations thus the relationship between the community structure of aquatic organisms and hydrological conditions such as velocity have also been primary research concerns zhao et al 2018 however most studies in lakes focus on individual hydrology or water quality factors research on the influence of hydrologic pulses on aquatic organisms in lakes especially those in shallow lakes which are easily affected by hydrologic and water quality changes are still very limited zoobenthos are usually widely distributed and have poor mobility thus they have long been used to evaluate water quality and ecosystem health cai et al 2017 heino and tolonen 2018 menció and boix 2018 żbikowski and kobak 2007 changes in habitat environment can affect community structure within a year or several years menció and boix 2018 pennuto et al 2014 piló et al 2016 especially in shallow lakes the zoobenthos are an essential group affecting lake ecosystems scheffer 1998 żbikowski and kobak 2007 the distribution of benthos is directly related to the water quality in shallow lakes eutrophication is common due to plankton and sediment inputs cai et al 2010 rao et al 2018 the nutritional status and pollution level have been reported as the most important factors regulating the macrozoobenthos community cai et al 2010 the influence of these factors on the temporal and spatial variation in benthos is obvious zhao et al 2018 additionally benthos and phytoplankton are vulnerable to the constraints of total nitrogen and phosphorus zhao et al 2014 zhao et al 2019 and the increase in nutrients increases the future dominance of dominant species rao et al 2018 in addition hydrologic changes cause changes in water quality thus jointly interfering with the distribution of aquatic organisms menció and boix 2018 song et al 2010 the content of heavy metals in sediments as the main living space of benthos is correlated with the distribution of aquatic organisms some studies have shown that benthos species are less abundant in areas with high heavy metal pollution in sediments wu et al 2014 and species with small sizes and short life spans have adaptive advantages in areas with heavy metal pollution piló et al 2016 due to the low water depth the sediment quality of shallow lakes is more easily disturbed by outside changes than that of deep lakes therefore the influence of water quality and the sediment environment on benthos in shallow lakes cannot be ignored the water diversion pulses change the hydrologic pattern of receiving water that is affected only by the runoff pulses this kind of hydrologic pulse change leads to intense hydrologic changes and affects the water quality and sedimentary environment additionally it represents a new stress to the benthos community there have been many studies on the impact of hydrologic pulses on communities in rivers and some studies have been conducted to research the relationship between plankton communities and environmental factors in the regulating and storing lakes along the water transfer project route liu et al 2010 luo et al 2019 tian et al 2012 tian et al 2013a b 2016 tian et al 2017a b zhao et al 2014 however under the long term influence of the hydrologic pulse changes in which the water diversion pulse is involved in the impact of the runoff pulse affecting the macrozoobenthos in lakes the macrozoobenthos variations have not been thoroughly studied especially in shallow lakes in this paper we focused on several issues 1 community structure and temporal spatial variations in macrozoobenthos were investigated and compared in two regulating and storing lakes along the water transfer project route 2 the environmental driving factors of the distribution of the macrozoobenthos community and interspecific variations were analyzed in two shallow lakes and 3 the effect of the hydrologic pulse changes on the macrozoobenthos community was analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the south to north water transfer project snwtp is the largest inter basin transfer project in the world the eastern route of the snwtp starts from the water source which is the yangtze river and flows through the shandong peninsula to tianjin city making this region an important route for this project feng et al 2007 nansihu lake nsh and dongpinghu lake dph are important regulating and storing lakes along the eastern route and there was no obvious hydraulic connectivity between these two lakes before the snwtp fig 1 during the non water transfer periods rain and other drainage flow into nsh through the liangjiyun river and the water flows from northwest to southeast during the water transfer periods the snwtp raises the water level in the lower reaches and transfers water to the vicinity of dph through the liangjiyun river and then pumps the water into dph the snwtp not only connects nsh and dph but also changes the flow direction completely during water transfer periods since the first water supply in 2013 nsh and dph have participated in water diversion many times water transfers mainly occur in winter and spring every year and are adjusted based on the water level in each year before the snwtp the inflow of nsh and dph was mainly caused by runoff and some wastewater after the snwtp these two lakes were greatly affected by water transfer which changed the hydrologicl factors in nsh and dph and then greatly affected the habitat of aquatic organisms in nsh and dph the surface area of nsh is approximately 1260 km2 and the lake basin is shallow and flat nsh consists of four lakes and the erjiba dam divides the lakes into the upper lakes which include dushanhu lake and nanyanghu lake and the lower lakes which include weishanhu lake and zhaoyanghu lake zhaoyanghu lake has the smallest water depth for many years because of the interception effect of the erjiba dam the average water depths of the upper lakes of nsh are greater than those of the lower lakes the perennial water surface of dph is approximately 125 km2 and the average water depth for many years has been approximately 2 m nsh and dph are the main ecological reserves and tourist attractions in shandong province they are rich in biodiversity and rich in aquatic products aquatic animals and plants nsh has rich wetland resources and a variety of aquatic plants and animals the fish and birds are also diverse the implementation of the snwtp complicated the water ecological environment nsh and dph are both in the continental monsoon climate with dry cold winters and hot rainy summers and the rainfall is concentrated in the rainy season 2 2 data description during the summer july of 2018 and spring march of 2019 two water quality and aquatic organism samplings were conducted in the two lakes and the samples came from 16 sites in nsh and 6 sites in dph the data on water quality sediment and aquatic organisms provided a rich database for the study of the macrozoobenthos community 2 2 1 ecological data at each sampling site macrozoobenthos samples were collected using a 0 025 m2 peterson grab and sieved in situ through a 425 μm aperture mesh size sieve the material retained from the sieve was collected in a 500 ml bottle and 4 concentration buffered formalin solution was added each macrozoobenthos sample was collected twice in the laboratory the macrozoobenthos samples were identified by an anatomic microscope and microscope and their densities were calculated the phytoplankton were sampled by collecting 1000 ml at a depth of 0 5 m with a water extractor and 40 ml lugol s solution and 40 ml 40 formalin solution were added to the phytoplankton sample for fixation each phytoplankton sample was collected twice the zooplankton were collected by filtering the lake water with a 200 mesh sieve the filtrate was collected in a 100 ml bottle and 50 ml 40 formaldehyde solution was added to the zooplankton sample for fixation all samples were stored in the dark and sent to the laboratory a 24 h sedimentation method was used to concentrate the phytoplankton and zooplankton samples to 50 ml and an inter plankton microscope was employed to count them 2 2 2 water quality data and sediment data during the 22 sampling events water samples and sediment were collected and the samples were sent to the laboratory for testing within 24 h after collection a spectrophotometer was used to measure ammonia nitrogen nh4 n total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and chemical oxygen demand cod in the water inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry was employed to measure the cadmium cd chromium cr copper cu iron fe nickel ni lead pb and zinc zn in the sediment and the organic matter om in the sediment was also measured 2 3 methods 2 3 1 dominant species evaluation method the species density i e the number of species in a given sampling site is an important indicator however the frequency of species appeared to affect the species distribution in this paper we use equation 1 to calculate the dominance of macrozoobenthos species and this equation considers the number and distribution of the target species all the species densities were fourth root transformed to reduce the influence of extreme values chen et al 2016 olsgard et al 1997 1 y i n i n f i where y i is the dominance of a macrozoobenthos species n i is the abundance of the i th species n refers to the total abundance of the species and f i refers to the frequency in which the i th species appears 2 3 2 identification method of key driving factors the relationship between species composition and environmental factors was realized by redundancy analysis rda based on the fact that the gradient length of the longest detrended correspondence analysis dca axis was less than 3 standard deviation units 2 48 2 67 luo et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 rda combines correspondence analysis with multiple regression thus it reflects the effect of species composition on a community and reflects the influence of environmental factors in this paper the environmental variables consisted of tn tp nh4 n and cod in water and cd cr fe zn ni cu and pb in sediment all the environmental variables were log 10 x 1 transformed to normalize their distribution before analysis rda figures were drawn using r package 2 3 3 niche breadth and niche overlap niche breadth and niche overlap can be calculated by many methods colwell and futuyma 1971 dolédec et al 2000 petraitis 1979 pianka 1974 schoener 1968 1974 smith 1982 and are widely used amacker and alford 2017 heino and tolonen 2018 liu et al 2019 quirino et al 2019 in this paper we used the shannon wiener index eq 2 to obtain niche breadth shannon 1948 and the pianka overlap model eq 3 was used to calculate niche overlap pianka 1974 2 b i j 1 r p ij ln p ij 3 q ik j 1 r p ij p kj j 1 r p ij 2 j 1 r p kj 2 where b i is the niche breadth of the i th species q ik is the niche overlap of the i th species on the k th species r is the total number of resource states p ij and p kj refer to the ratios of the individual numbers of the i th species and the k th species in the j th resources state to the total individual number of the i th and j th species respectively 3 results 3 1 the macrozoobenthos community structure and dominant species 3 1 1 macrozoobenthos community composition and spatial variations sample analysis in the 22 sampling sites identified a total of 38 species belonging to 4 phyla the macrozoobenthos community consisted of mollusca oligochaeta aquatic insects and some unidentified species which accounted for 57 89 14 79 10 53 and 15 79 of the total species numbers of macrozoobenthos respectively mollusca dominated phyla and abundance fig 2 and occurred at all sites the total macrozoobenthos abundance varied from 2 ind m2 to 1540 ind m2 in the lower lakes of nsh 1520 ind m2 in the upper lakes and 1800 ind m2 in dph and the species composition showed obvious spatial heterogeneity mollusca aquatic insects and oligochaeta ranked in order were the absolute dominant groups in the three regions the abundance of mollusca contributed 93 and 85 to the total abundance in the lower lakes and the upper lakes of nsh respectively while the value was 60 in dph the total abundance of mollusca decreased gradually and aquatic insects and oligochaeta increased gradually from the southern to the northern region of nsh and then to dph fig 2 the species numbers among all sites were compared and 24 20 and 22 species occurred in the lower lakes in the upper lakes of nsh and in dph respectively eleven species were common to these three regions the upper lakes and lower lakes shared more species than they shared with dph and the lower lakes and dph had no common species 3 1 2 identifying of the dominant species in nsh and dph a total of 38 macrozoobenthos were identified and used to identify the dominant species the density and the frequency of species appears were input into eq 1 to calculate the species dominance y i the dominance was ranked from large to small and the accumulation value was calculated to draw the dominance curve the breakpoints were calculated according to the previously drawn curve fig 3 and the cut off points were 12 1 74 11 1 63 10 3 37 in the lower lakes the upper lakes of nsh and dph respectively the dominant species were bellamya purificata bithynia fuchsiana cipangopaludina cathayensis radix auricularia radix lagotis hippeutis umbilicalis cipangopaludina chinensis parafossarulus striatulus tubifex sinicus chironomus plumosus propsilocerusi akamusi unidentified gastropoda radix clessini gyraulus albus semisulcospira cancellata and rheotanytarsus muscicola those dominant species were labelled spa1 to spa16 respectively table 2 except for spa6 and spa10 the dominance value of each species in dph was higher than that in nsh and there was no obvious difference between the dominance value in the upper lakes and the lower lakes in the three regions the number of dominant species screened by the unified method was not much different and the dominance values of the dominant species between the two regions of nsh were not much different however the dominance value of species in dph was much different fig 3 this difference was caused by the high occurrence frequency which was significantly correlated with dominance value fig 4 without considering the occurrence frequency the differences in dominance among the three regions were small thus the difference in occurrence frequency led to the difference in species dominance between nsh and dph for the phenomenon of the high occurrence frequency in dph it was likely that the area of dph was much smaller than that of the others thus the high sampling density led to the high occurrence frequency of dominant species in dph bithynia fuchsiana spa2 had the highest dominance value in all three regions especially in dph and appeared at all sampling sites additionally the mollusca species number was the least these two reasons led to the absolute advantage of bithynia fuchsiana in dph the dominance value of hippeutis umbilicalis spa6 in dph was the lowest likely due to its low occurrence frequency in dph and high occurrence frequency in nsh 3 2 spatial variations in the environment and biological factors 3 2 1 spatial variations in the environment factors pollutants in water have toxic effects on organisms and can turn into more toxic compounds under the action of microorganisms the pollutants are enriched in organisms due to biological amplification through the food chain and then these pollutants can affect the structure and distribution of benthos the four water quality indicators in nsh showed lower values than those in dph and in the lower lakes of nsh they showed lower values than those of the upper lakes of nsh table 1 however the indicators of sediment showed a different pattern the values of cr cu fe and ni in nsh were lower than those in dph while the values of cd pb and zn were larger than those in dph the values of om cd zn and pb in nsh were higher than those in dph but the differences were not significant the average concentrations of cd cr cu ni and pb in the lower lakes of nsh were higher than those in the upper lakes while the concentrations of fe and zn in the lower lakes were lower than those in the upper lakes overall the water pollution in dph was more serious than that in nsh and that of the upper lakes in nsh was more serious than that in lower lakes yao et al 2019 when considering the heavy metals in sediment the same conclusion could be drawn as dph was more polluted by heavy metals than was nsh with the exceptions of cd zn and pb for the heavy metals in the sediment of nsh 5 in 7 indicators in the lower lakes of nsh had the higher content than those in the upper lakes 3 2 2 spatial variations in the biological factors phytoplankton and zooplankton not only directly reflect the pollution status of the habitat environment but also affect the structure and distribution of benthos as food sources the total density of phytoplankton decreased gradually from the lower lakes of nsh to the upper lakes and then to dph which was consistent with the pollution trend reflected by the water quality and heavy metal fig 2 unlike phytoplankton the total density of zooplankton in nsh was still higher than that in dph while the density in the lower lakes was the lowest this pattern was different from that of phytoplankton but consistent with that of cd zn pb and om 3 2 3 identifying the key driving factors in the macrozoobenthos community water quality factors have a great impact on the distribution and composition of aquatic lives and sediments are the direct living environment of macrozoobenthos additionally zooplankton and phytoplankton are zoobenthos food resources water quality indicators and plankton in water and heavy metals and organic matter in sediments were considered for statistical analysis with macrozoobenthos for which only the dominant species were considered on the rda sorting map the line segment with arrows represents the environmental factor and the plankton factor the length of the line segment represents the correlation between the environmental factors and the species distribution and a longer line segment indicates a greater impact the smaller the angle between a species and an environmental factor is the closer the relationship between the species and the environmental factor is the key driving factors of zooplankton communities could be identified by this principle it can be seen from fig 5 that the key water quality factors and ecological factors were tzoo tphyto and tn in dph tphyto tzoo cod and nh4 n in the upper lakes of nsh and tphyto and nh4 n in the lower lakes the key sediment factors were om cu cr zn pb in dph cd pb and om in the upper lakes and pb cd and cu in the lower lakes moreover the effects of water quality and ecological factors on macrozoobenthos were more obvious than those of sediment particularly for the ecological factors according to the rda results the two axis interpretation rate of the macrozoobenthos distribution in dph was higher than that in nsh which indicated that there were additional factors affecting the macrozoobenthos community in nsh other than the factors shown in the fig 5 3 3 variations in the ecological niche parameters in nsh and dph in general the adaptability of species to the environment and interspecies competition can be described by niche breadth and niche overlap the species with a wider niche breadth are more adaptable and are usually referred to as generalized species these species have a wider range of resources available when resources are rare generalized species are more competitive because of their broad diet and greater chances of survival the species with a narrower niche breadth are environmentally sensitive and are usually referred to as specialized species and they have few resources available which means they are more competitive when resources are abundant because of the high efficiency of food zhao et al 2014 except for semisulcospira cancellata spa15 and rheotanytarsus muscicola spa16 the niche breadths of the other dominant species in dph were the lowest considering only the niche breadth of species in nsh the niche breadths of cipangopaludina cathayensis spa3 tubifex sinicus spa9 chironomus plumosus spa10 and radix clessini spa13 in the upper lakes were larger than those in the lower lakes while the niche breadths of bellamya purificata spa1 radix auricularia spa4 radix lagotis spa5 and hippeutis umbilicalis spa6 in the upper lakes were smaller than those in the lower lakes while the niche breadths of bithynia fuchsiana spa2 and propsilocerusi akamusi spa11 were similar in nsh the niche breadth of bithynia fuchsiana was the highest in all three regions especially in nsh the mean niche overlap in dph was higher than the others and that in the lower lakes was only slightly higher than the upper lakes indicating that the interspecific competition in dph was intense than that in nsh fig 7 the mean niche overlap values of bithynia fuchsiana spa2 and cipangopaludina cathayensis spa3 were higher than the other dominant species fig 7 and they had high niche breadth values in dph and nsh fig 6 therefore these species had a wide range of available resources and easily competed with other species the mean niche overlap values of unidentified gastropoda spa12 in dph and in the upper lakes of nsh were higher than those of other dominant species indicating that they had more competitors the greatest of which were bithynia fuchsiana spa2 and cipangopaludina cathayensis spa3 the most competitive species pairs were spa1 spa2 spa2 spa12 spa3 spa12 and spa10 spa11 in dph spa4 spa6 and spa9 spa16 in the upper lakes and spa4 spa6 and spa5 spa11 in the lower lakes furthermore the value of the niche overlap index of these species pairs was greater than 0 77 4 discussion 4 1 variations in macrozoobenthos community after the hydrologic pulse change before the snwtp both nsh and dph were dominated by runoff pulse the snwtp formed the water diversion pulse that impacted these two lakes and the hydrologic pulse changed the snwtp has occurred for six years and this long term hydrologic pulse changes have had a cumulative impact on the macrozoobenthos community in nsh and dph and the macrozoobenthos community in nsh and dph changed a lot after the snwtp here the main macrozoobenthos groups in the two lakes were the same and they were mollusca oligochaeta and aquatic insects their abundance and proportion showed the following order mollusca oligochaeta aquatic insects and the total abundance in the upper lake of nsh was lower than in the lower lakes of nsh fig 2 this was very different from the macrozoobenthos community structure before the hydrologic pulse changed caused by the snwtp before the implementation of the snwtp aquatic insects dominated the macrozoobenthos in nsh and the total density of macrozoobenthos in the upper lakes was higher than that in the lower lakes shu et al 2014 mollusca and oligochaeta dominated the macrozoobenthos in dph and the species number of mollusca decreased compared with the previous values dong et al 2015 under the influence of the hydrologic pulse change caused by the snwtp the macrozoobenthos also showed obvious spatial differences from the lower lakes to the upper lakes of nsh to dph the abundance and proportion of mollusca which had large sizes gradually decreased and the oligochaeta and aquatic insects which had small sizes gradually increased the snwtp connected nsh and dph and dph received the transferred water from nsh in the rainy season this affected the macrozoobenthos community making them similar in structure and regular in spatial change hydrologic pulse change caused by the snwtp not only affected the macrozoobenthos community structure and distribution but also affected the interspecific relationships in nsh and dph among the 16 dominant species shown in fig 6 apart from semisulcospira cancellata spa15 and rheotanytarsus muscicola spa16 the niche breadths of other species was lower in dph than in nsh which was contrary to the distribution of dominance this indicated that the dominant species in dph had less available resources than nsh compared with nsh dph had less plankton fig 2 and less om table 1 these food sources restricted the breadth of the benthos diet therefore food sources might cause of the low niche breadth of dominant species in dph the niche overlap values of the 16 dominant species in these three regions were consistent with the change rule of niche breadth which also verified that the species with a larger niche breadth will overlap with more species zhao et al 2014 the average niche overlap value in dph was higher than that in nsh and the values in the upper lakes and the lower lakes of nsh were similar which showed that the competition in dph was more intense than that in nsh bithynia fuchsiana spa2 and cipangopaludina cathayensis spa3 had the widest niche breadth and largest niche overlap values so they were highly adaptable to the environment both gyraulus albus spa14 and rheotanytarsus muscicola spa16 had low niche breadth and niche overlap which indicated that they were more sensitive to the environment 4 2 hydrologic pulse changes affect macrozoobenthos through water quality the hydrologic pulse changes affect the water quality and then affect the macrozoobenthos community on the one hand the water quality of the external water source affected the water quality in receiving lake on the other hand the snwtp changed the natural water flow direction and this intense change also interfered with the distribution of nitrogen and phosphorus in the lakes which alleviated the eutrophication in nsh and dph qu et al 2017 and thereby affected the distribution of macrozoobenthos the rda results fig 5 showed that water quality factors were closely related to macrozoobenthos the niche breadth values along the water quality factors gradient indicated that the tp changes had the least effect on the macrozoobenthos while the cod changes had the greatest effect table 3 moreover even if the nitrogen effect is small it still needs to be concerned because in addition to direct pollution nitrogen has potential risks for lake ecosystems wang et al 2019a so the water quality had an obvious effect on the macrozoobenthos in nsh and dph along the water transfer direction the proportion and total density of large size mollusca decreased and the small size oligochaeta and aquatic insects increased fig 2 at the same time the water quality indicators like tn tp cod nh4 n also gradually increased table 1 these indicated that with the deterioration of water quality the community gradually changed from the dominant large size to the dominant small size these results were consistent with other studies cai et al 2010 2012 donohue et al 2009 yang et al 2019 in addition the total plankton in water was closely related to the water quality and the distribution of macrozoobenthos because the plankton was the food of macrozoobenthos so the change in water quality not only directly affected the distribution of macrozoobenthos but also affected the plankton community which then affected the composition and distribution of macrozoobenthos tian et al 2012 tian et al 2013a b therefore the hydrologic pulse change affected the spatial distribution of macrozoobenthos by changing the water quality to further analyze the macrozoobenthos community variations the dominant species niche parameters were calculated most dominant species in dph had lower niche breadth and higher niche overlap than that in nsh figs 6 and 7 so the dominant species in dph had less available resource and more intense interspecific than in nsh this was related to zooplankton and om as a source of food for macrozoobenthos fewer zooplankton and organic matter in dph fig 2 and table 1 therefore these results confirmed that the hydrologic pulse change affected the water quality which affected the community structure and distribution of macrozoobenthos either directly or indirectly by affecting plankton 4 3 hydrologic pulse changes affect macrozoobenthos through heavy metal in the sediment compared with water quality which can respond to external influences in time the distribution of heavy metals in sediment is a long term accumulation process which can better reflect the cumulative impact of hydrologic pulse changes on aquatic organisms wang et al 2018 hydrologic pulse change caused by the snwtp affected the distribution of heavy metals and then affected macrozoobenthos the snwtp brought the exogenous heavy metals thus affected the heavy metal in nsh the change of flow direction and intense water diversion pulse affected the distribution of heavy metals in sediment of the shallow lakes and then affected the community structure and distribution of macrozoobenthos the rda results showed that heavy metals were related to the distribution of macrozoobenthos especially pb cd and cu but not as much as water quality factors and plankton after the snwtp 5 in 7 heavy metals in the lower lakes had a higher average content than in the upper lakes this was consistent with other studies after the snwtp but not consistent with the results of the earlier survey before the snwtp the average content of heavy metals in the lower lakes was lower than that in the upper lakes liu and zhang 2013 zhang et al 2016 this shift was due to the introduction of exogenous heavy metals by the snwtp zhuang et al 2019 besides the intense hydrologic change which the reversal of flow direction also disturbed the distribution of heavy metal in lakes these changes affected the distribution of heavy metals in nsh therefore the hydrologic pulse change caused by the snwtp had a significant impact on the sediment environment of nsh and further affected the distribution of macrozoobenthos the niche breadth values along the heavy metals gradient showed that the pb change had the greatest effect on the macrozoobenthos table 3 the average content of pb in the lower lakes was the highest which was mainly due to agriculture farming around the lower lakes of nsh because the main source of pb was natural and agricultural fertilization zhuang et al 2019 and some came from industrial sources wang et al 2019b therefore the control of agricultural fertilization benefits the macrozoobenthos in nsh 4 4 hydrologic pulse changes affect macrozoobenthos through water depth the water levels in nsh and dph were generally low in the dry periods and high in the rainy periods because of the runoff pulse the water diversion pulse increased the inflow of these two lakes and then raised the water level and this change alleviated the decline in the water level that occurs during the dry periods as one of the main hydrologic factors water depth greatly affected the macrozoobenthos bazzanti et al 2012 scharold et al 2010 the hydrologic pulse change caused the water depth change which affected the macrozoobenthos community in terms of the total abundance of macrozoobenthos the lower lakes of nsh had the highest total abundance and dph had the lowest the small size aquatic insects and oligochaeta were more abundant in dph than nsh this was probably related to the larger water depth in dph protected the small size aquatic insects and oligochaeta from the disturbance of water diversion pulse in the three regions the average water depth of dph was larger than nsh and that of the lower lakes was smaller than the upper lakes on the one hand dph had the largest average natural lake depth and zhaoyanghu lake in the lower lakes had the smallest average lake depth on the other hand during water transfer periods the water was pumped from the lower lakes into the upper lakes which maintained the water level difference during the non water transfer period the interception of the erjiba dam made the average water depth of the upper lakes lager than the lower lakes for a long time all of these factors led to the smallest average depth in the lower lakes and the largest average depth in dph therefore hydrologic pulse change affected the water depth and then led to the difference in the total density of macrozoobenthos 5 conclusions hydrologic pulse is one of the factors controlling the distribution of aquatic organisms intense hydrologic variations change the surrounding environment and then affect the distribution and community structure of macrozoobenthos due to the snwtp water diversion pulse participated in the influence of runoff pulse on nsh and dph and this hydrologic pulse change affected the macrozoobenthos community structure however under the influence of this long term hydrologic pulse change the macrozoobenthos variations in nsh and dph were still not very clear in this study the changes in environmental factors and macrozoobenthos community structure in the upper lakes and the lower lakes of nsh and dph were studied and the distribution and community variations under the influence of hydrologic pulse change for many years were discussed by analyzing the water quality heavy metal in the sediment and water depth our goal was to provide some suggestions and theoretical support for the protection and improvement of water ecology the influence of the hydrologic pulse on the nsh and dph changed from the rainfall pulse to the hydrologic pulses consisting the runoff pulse and water diversion pulse after the hydrologic pulse changes the macrozoobenthos communities in nsh and dph were similar mainly composed of mollusca oligochaeta and aquatic insects and dominated by mollusca before the hydrologic pulse changes the macrozoobenthos in nsh and dph were dominated by aquatic insects and oligochaeta respectively from nsh to dph that is along the water transfer direction of the snwtp the abundance and proportion of mollusca gradually decreased and oligochaeta and aquatic insects gradually increased with the deterioration of water quality macrozoobenthos communities gradually became dominated by smaller species the hydrologic pulse change caused by the snwtp not only affected the community but also affected the interspecific relationships after the snwtp the interspecific competition was the most intense in dph and least intense in the upper lakes of nsh which had a lot to do with food the distribution of food was one of the effects of the water diversion pulse the dominant species were least affected by tp and most affected by cod in nsh and dph the pb in the sediment was also had effect on the macrozoobenthos in the study area the intense hydrologic change in which the direction of water transfer was opposite to that of natural water flow affected the distribution of nitrogen and phosphorous in water and heavy metals in sediment in addition the introduction of exogenous water caused by the snwtp changed water quality and heavy metals and water depth in nsh and dph these changes affected the community structure and distribution of macrozoobenthos in conclusion the hydrologic pulse change caused by the snwtp had an obvious cumulative effect on macrozoobenthos community these results increase our understanding of the impact of hydrological changes caused by water transfer projects on water ecology credit authorship contribution statement guoqiang wang

5668,assimilating unique features of genetic programming gp and gene expression programming gep this study introduces a hybrid algorithm which results in promising incipient non cohesive sediment motion models the new models use the dimensionless input parameters including relative particle size relative deposited bed thickness channel friction factor and channel bed slope to estimate particle froude number in rectangular channels the models accuracy is tested using different error measures and cross validated through comparison with that of five empirical models available in the relevant literature the results showed enhanced accuracy of the proposed models in comparison to the existing ones with concordance correlation coefficient of 0 92 and 0 94 for parsimonious and quasi parsimonious ensemble gp models respectively such superiority is attributed to the integrated use of flow fluid sediment and channel characteristics in the modeling of incipient motion although the new algorithm is hybrid the proposed models are explicit and precise and thus motivating to be used in practice keywords empirical equations incipient sediment motion genetic programming rectangular channels sediment bed thickness 1 introduction an efficient urban drainage system conveys the surface runoff from a watershed to the point of discharge usually to a river at its designed capacity the deposition of sediment brought through surface runoff within a channel morphs its cross sectional area and consequently reduces the discharge capacity to counteract this inherent problem particularly in areas with high runoff the drainage system is designed based on self cleansing velocity that ensures sediment motion along the channel nalluri et al 1997 the primary description of the self cleansing analysis was provided by ackers et al 1996 and may et al 1996 recently a detail review of its concept and applications has been presented by safari et al 2018 it was reported that the self cleansing criteria can be classified as non deposition ota and perrusquía 2013 and bed sediment motion bong et al 2016 camp 1946 novak and nalluri 1984 safari et al 2017 while the former satisfies a flow condition to keep sediment particle in motion through the flow in the latter deposited sediment particle at the channel bottom is removed from the channel bottom and entrained into the flow incipient motion criterion is considered as bed sediment motion self cleaning criteria which can be considered as minimum design benchmark to prevent continues deposition of sediment the design guideline and basic principles of self cleaning can also be found in the relevant literature butler and davies 2004 mays 2001 merritt 2009 when the focus is deposited sediment the incipient sediment motion is appropriate to be used as the criterion to describe the inherent self cleansing incipient or threshold sediment motion is the movement of sediment from its originally stationary condition to mobility whereby the movement of deposited sediment is initiated by the fluid forces acting on it the flow velocity in conveyance systems is designed for exceeding the critical velocity of sediment so that the system is inherently able to cleanse and remove the deposited sediment the threshold criterion for non cohesive sediment movement depends on the sediment size as described by the well established presentation of the shields diagram shields 1936 the diagram was developed based on homogeneous non cohesive sediment on a flat surface whereby the velocity at the point of the first movement is described as the critical velocity v c shields 1936 presented the concept of incipient sediment motion at the boundary layer where u c is presented as the critical shear velocity u c τ c ρ where τ c is the critical bed shear stress the threshold criterion is described as shields 1936 parameter θ c 1 θ c τ c ρ s ρ g d s where ρ s and ρ denote the sediment and water specific mass respectively g is the acceleration due to gravity and d s is the sediment size often presented as the median grain size d 50 shields 1936 parameter describes the initiation of motion at the surface layer of the bed however it is already reported by bong et al 2014 that sediment deposited bed thickness effects the required incipient motion self cleansing velocity the thickness of deposited sediment in combined sewers varies between 10 mm and 100 mm ashley and crabtree 1992 hence variation of the thickness layer can be more than 1000 d 50 a thicker sediment bed requires higher fluid forces to initiate movement particularly for longer consolidated sediment the increasing forces between particles the armouring effect of the coarser sediment on finer ones and the additional resistance friction between particles due to micro bed forms all contribute in the augment of the critical velocity require for sediment movement bong et al 2016 the empirically developed equations are useful tool to predict critical velocity within the range of thickness used in the relevant experiments the thickness of the non cohesive deposited sediment mixture was found up to 330 mm bong et al 2014 in urban drainage in kuching city bed slope less than 2 and it is believed it can be more in the areas with higher rainfall intensity sediment deposits vary in size distribution and characteristics whereby exhaustive experiments incorporating a wide range of sediment thickness and homogeneity of sediment are not deemed cost effective furthermore experimental works are typically limited by a set of parameters and therefore the validity of the derived equations is restricted to the experimental conditions utilising the critical mean velocity v c novak and nalluri 1975 1984 described the incipient sediment motion in terms of particle froude number f d and relative particle size d r as follows 2 f d v c g d s s 1 a d s r b where s denotes the relative specific mass of sediment a and b are coefficients and r is the hydraulic radius equation 2 can be obtained by analysing hydrodynamic forces acting on the sediment particle or through combination of shields 1936 parameter with manning formula safari et al 2015 describing the sediment pick up rate the incipient sediment motion is also better correlated with the parameter f d than the shields 1936 parameter θ c cheng and emadzadeh 2016 while the coefficient a can vary between 0 48 and 1 07 the coefficient b has the smaller range of 0 23 to 0 47 in rigid boundary channels the relationship between particle froude number f d and relative particle size ds r is commonly used to develop incipient motion models see table 1 among those models given in table 1 novak and nalluri 1984 and safari et al 2017 studied the incipient motion in the smooth bed channels whilst el zaemey 1991 salem 1998 and bong et al 2016 conducted the experiments with the presence of deposited bed sediment thickness ts at the channel bottom to describe the effect of deposited bed thickness bong et al 2016 incorporated the relative deposited thickness parameter in their model referred to as ts y in which y is the flow depth in recent studies machine learning ml techniques has been successfully used to solve variety of problems in sediment transport modeling bhattacharya et al 2007 emamgholizadeh et al 2013 emamgholizadeh and karimi demneh 2019 kisi et al 2012 safari and danandeh mehr 2018 kargar et al 2019 models based on the artificial neural network ann of radial basis function rbf and feed forward neural network ffnn were found to be efficient in predicting the critical velocity for both a shallow and slightly thicker sediment layer wan mohtar et al 2018 the correlation coefficient for both rbf and ffnn models reached up to 0 863 and 0 884 respectively ann models are useful to predict and forecast the critical velocity for various sediment thicknesses however with more data and a large variation in thickness mathematical optimisation is required to enhance the performance of an ml model although the work of wan mohtar et al 2018 produced relatively convincing results of v c prediction using rbf and ffnn an output of an applicable universal equation was not feasible most importantly this study makes an improvement in parameters used in modeling of sediment incipient motion through incorporating the four fundamental parameters effective in the phenomenon as flow fluid sediment and channel characteristics with the aim to produce more efficient models for calculating the particle froude number in varying sediment thickness the technique of ensemble gp hereafter egp is applied in the present study this technique is not only able to find a fit solution in relatively less time and provide wider range of solutions but also has an inherent built in mechanism to avoid or minimise overfitting successful applications of stand alone or hybrid gp models in hydrological hydraulic problems were reported in recent studies danandeh mehr et al 2018 danandeh mehr and safari 2020 however the efficiency of ensemble gp in which different gp variants are combined to achieve both accurate and simple i e parsimonious models was investigated only in a few studies e g rahmani rezaeieh et al 2019 in the present study for the first time we developed and verified a new algorithm that employs power of monolithic gp and gene expression programming gep to model incipient sediment motion in the rectangular channels with a bed deposit the study incorporates channel characteristics with flow fluid and sediment features and puts forward two new models possessing higher accuracy than that of exciting alternatives 2 methodology 2 1 data used to formulate incipient sediment motion in rectangular channels the available data from the relevant literature 250 experiments were collected and used in this study source type and the range of the collected data are tabulated in table 2 salem 1998 investigated the incipient sediment motion for five sediment sizes with the median grain sizes d 50 of 0 55 mm 0 97 mm 1 8 mm 3 09 mm and 4 78 mm the experiments were conducted in a 0 3 m 0 45 m 10 m rectangular flume bong 2013 on the other hand examines the threshold criteria of sediment movement in a 0 6 m 0 4 m 6 3 m flume for three sediment sizes i e d 50 0 81 mm 1 53 mm and 4 78 mm the variation in both studies are only in the sediment sizes with all sediment is non cohesive uniformly distributed sediment with the gradation parameter σ g 1 4 the description of experimental setup and measurement procedures herein are applicable to both studies the working areas to observe the sediment incipient motion were located at a distance from the inlet chamber where at this location the flow is measured as uniform the non cohesive sediment bed was laid with varying thickness ranging from d 50 5 mm 10 mm and 24 mm and was made horizontal by using a metal scraper once the sediment bed is ready the water was carefully flowed in starting with the lowest velocity as not to disrupt the prepared sediment bed the velocity was systematically increased until incipient sediment motion was observed the criteria of sediment movement were set based on the general transport defined by kramer 1935 where particles of all sizes are moving at all points on the bed at all times at this point the velocity is recorded using velocity meter nixon stream flo 430 which denoted as the critical velocity the experiments were rerun to ensure the repeatability and validity of the observed data 2 2 dimensional analysis and data preparation in order to investigate the sediment transport process in open channel flow with the presence of deposited bed thickness four fundamental characteristics of flow fluid sediment and channel must be considered robinson and graf 1972 to this end flow velocity vc flow depth y hydraulic radius r gravitational acceleration g as flow characteristics fluid specific mass ρ as fluid characteristic and sediment specific mass ρs and particles median size ds and deposited bed thickness ts as sediment characteristics and channel bed slope s and channel friction factor λ are considered as channel characteristics these can be expressed via a functional relationship of the form 8 f v c y r g ρ ρ s d s t s s λ 0 utilizing buckingham pi theorem on variables given in eq 8 and substituting ρs with δρ ρs ρ and choosing vc d and ρ as repeating variables the equivalent form 9 f d v c g d s s 1 f d s r d s t s d s y s λ is obtained two dimensionless parameters of ds ts and ds y can be combined and presented as ts y and eq 9 is re written as 10 f d v c g d s s 1 f d s r t s y s λ it is seen that that dimensionless parameters of particle froude number fd sediment relative particle size ds r and relative bed thickness of deposited sediment ts y channel bed slope s and channel friction factor λ can best describe the sediment incipient motion phenomenon with the presence of deposited bed thickness left side of eq 10 is particle froude number fd it is known that the flow velocity vc is a desired variable for channel design fd consists of flow velocity at its structure and therefore it is considered as the model output and the parameters in the right side of the eq 10 are selected as inputs of the model parameters given in eq 10 are calculated at first step of the data preparation in this study the data are changed to dimensionless parameters to generate simple formulae to use in practice then they are divided into two subsets the randomly selected 75 of data was utilised for calibration and the remaining 25 was used for testing the evolved models details of the modeling issues are demonstrated in the subsequent sections 2 3 overview of gp and gep models the state of the art gp is an ml approach in the evolutionary modeling category similar to the well known genetic algorithm the concept of the survival of the best is used to solve a variety of problems using gp referring to the gp literature in water resources engineering danandeh mehr et al 2018 different variants of gp such as multigene gp linear gp and gene expression programming gep were typically applied to solve nonlinear regression problems in which a set of inputs are mapped to an output emamgolizadeh et al 2015 the optimal solution is generally a nonlinear function that is created through simultaneous optimisation of inputs and their coefficients in other words the functional form of the best solution is not given in advance therefore the approach may provide insights into the problem at hand differing in the initial structure of programs i e potential solutions the evolutionary process in all gp variants includes reproduction crossover and mutation that act on the initial and regenerated population of programs the classic gp aka standard gp was first introduced by koza 1992 as illustrated in fig 1 an initial program in classic gp has the form of a tree constructed from a root node inner nodes terminal nodes and linking branches that typically represent a mathematical function all the nodes are randomly filled by a member from a user defined set of inputs functions and terminals a constant value or a given variable the merely constraint belongs to the root node that always takes a function during the evolutionary process the tree materials nodes branches are changed or exchanged between trees the process is continued up to the desired number of generation or until a new program achieves a preferred accuracy more details about classic gp its variants and the evolutionary process at each variant are available in the review paper published by danandeh mehr et al 2018 gep is one of the commonly used gp variants that selects some of the evolved trees to link and improve them with respect to a given objective function and obtains the best combination of individuals using a linking operator the primary difference between gep and gp algorithms is that gep adopts a linear fixed length representation of computer programs see fig 2 which can later be converted into a gp tree many studies have claimed the superiority of gep over the traditional gp in both efficiency and effectiveness ferreira 2006 as previously mentioned in gep an initial program takes the form of a string of fixed length composed of one or more genes called sub expressions sub et and the best result is built by linking the sub expressions using mathematical or boolean functions such as and or not etc rahmani rezaeieh et al 2019 each sub expression is composed of two parts the first part called the head is formed by functions and terminals and the second part called the tail is filled merely by terminals see fig 2 like gp a function accepts one or more arguments and returns a result after evaluation to ensure the validity of a gene for each problem the length of the head h is chosen whereas the tail length t is determined using eq 11 11 t h n 1 1 where n is the maximum arity of all predefined functions despite several advantages of gep over classic gp one of its drawbacks is the expressional complexity of the final solution that may also become over fitted to the training set in such cases noise within the training set is treated as a feature and the generated expressions also try to learn the noise information usually this effect is evidenced by a having very low errors on the training set whereas the evaluation on the test set achieves a very high error rahmani rezaeieh et al 2019 a common approach to address this issue is to use a lower number of sub ets and small heads for details about the evolutionary process in gep and its applications the interested reader is referred to danandeh mehr et al 2018 2 4 ensemble gp egp model for incipient sediment motion the proposed egp is a hybrid evolutionary model that intends for the fine tuning of the gene expressions attained from the classic gep while the classic gep improves the predictive accuracy of the solutions through the combination of a limited number of sub ets the egp model takes the most effective features and functions from a percentage of top gene expressions as new inputs to evolve parsimonious models using a monolithic gp engine as illustrated in fig 3 the proposed model includes three phases of gep based modeling first phase effective input selection second phase and parsimonious model evolution via gp third phase in the first phase the gep engine is used to generate a population of the best models for the given features and label fd as the ultimate goal is to develop the most accurate explicit function a number of mathematical functions such as arithmetic operations trigonometric functions square root and others are defined as the members of initial function set the maximum number of sub ets and allowable tree depth are selected so that the evolved solutions are not over trained to this end we recommend the evaluation of the efficiency of a percentage of potential solutions at the testing data sets instead of the best on training data set this idea originates from the unique feature of gep that evolves a population of potential solutions models while most other ml techniques train a single model at each iteration in this phase it is seen that gep has no prior constraints to avoid model complexity therefore the corresponding mathematical expressions of gene expressions would be of arbitrary complexity when the solutions are allowed to be complex they might also become over fitted to the training set to achieve fewer complex models sensitivity analysis is carried out in the next phase as described below in the second phase a sensitivity analysis is done to determine each input parameter function effect on the accuracy of best solutions then the less effective inputs functions and parameters are removed from the initial inputs the efficiency of each parameter in the best solution can be easily determined considering its frequency as suggested in the literature uyumaz et al 2014 for a given population of best solutions the higher the frequency the higher the efficiency determination of the number of solutions used to accomplish the sensitivity analysis is an important task in this phase less population may lead to the loss of some informative inputs and a larger population may result in complex secondary solutions our review of the relevant literature showed that there is no absolute way to decide the population for example while nourani et al 2012 selected the best inputs from the top 50 gp models uyumaz et al 2014 considered only the top 30 models given an extra challenge we preferred to consider two alternatives the top 20 gene expressions scenario 1 and the top 40 gene expressions scenario 2 with respect to their accuracy in the testing in the last step the effective inputs from each scenario are entered to the monolithic gp engine with a user defined tree depth similar to gep decisions on the best gp model are made by the evaluation of the best model at testing dataset that guarantees both parsimony and generalisability of the best solution returning to the literature it is seen that combination of different gp techniques to increase modeling accuracy has got more attention in recent studies for instance rahmani rezaeieh et al 2019 suggested an ensemble gep egep model for parsimonious streamflow forecasting although the study combines classic gp with gep there are essential differences between the egep and egp approach as listed below egep was used for fine tuning of the percentage of top individuals attained from the canonical gp but egp approach is developed for the fine tuning of the gene expressions attained from the classic gep the proposed egep model integrates a population of low complex gp solutions using a gep technique but the egp model takes the most effective features and functions from a percentage of top gene expressions as new inputs to evolve parsimonious models using a monolithic gp engine 2 5 performance evaluation to assess the performance of each model in predicting the output variable fd four different statistical indicators are used these applied criteria are root mean square errors rmse mean absolute error mae concordance correlation coefficient ccc and percentage of bias pbias while the first three statistics quantify the difference between the observed and predicted values the latter quantifies the agreement between these two measures in addition box diagram which provides more beneficial analytical information about the distribution of predictions is used to derive a better judgement of the models 12 rmse i 1 n x ip x io 2 n 13 mae 1 n i 1 n x ip x io 14 ccc 2 r σ io σ ip σ io 2 σ ip 2 x io x ip 2 15 pbias i 1 n x ip x io i 1 n x io 100 where x io and x ip are the observed and predicted values of fd x io and x ip are the observed and predicted mean values of fd respectively r is correlation coefficient σ io and σ ip are standard deviation of observed and predicted values of fd 3 results to apply egp approach for incipient sediment motion modeling two evolutionary algorithm frameworks namely geppy and gpdotnetv5 0 were interactively used in this study the former is gep framework in python https geppy readthedocs io and the latter is an open source tree based gp software framework in c the main setup parameters to run these models include root mean square error as the objective function arithmetic operations square root exponential trigonometric and power functions as functional set and ultimately dimensionless parameters given in eq 10 as the terminal set members 3 1 selecting the best model as previously mentioned two egp alternatives namely parsimonious ensemble gp hereafter pegp eq 16 and quasi parsimonious hereafter qpegp eq 17 are developed in the present study to predict fd in rectangular channels 16 v c g d s s 1 e x p 1 d s r s s λ e x p s d s r λ 2 d s r 4 d s r 2 s λ d s r λ s d s r c o s s λ c o s d s r 2 λ 17 v c g d s s 1 e x p c o s d

the second phase at both top 20 and top 40 gep models however ts y was not appeared at all the top 20 models from an effective functioning perspective frequency of addition multiplication subtraction and square root were higher than the other predefined functions in the top 40 model from a physical point of view ts y significantly affects the required velocity of flow at sediment incipient motion condition presence of deposited bed thickness at the channel bottom increases the channel friction factor λ and accordingly higher hydrodynamic forces are needed for initiation of sediment motion neglecting the ts y in the pegp model can be linked to the narrow range of ts in the experiments to overcome to this experimental deficiency performing new set of experiments seems to be helpful to provide sediment incipient motion data with wide range of sediment deposited bed thickness the predictions of the new models vs entire experiments and the associated scatterplots at testing data set are illustrated in fig 4 as mentioned earlier about 250 various data with different sediment size were used for modeling according to the results of fig 4 the qpegp model shows more accurate models having results closer to the measured data than the pegp model the qpegp outperforms pegp where data are fall on the best fit line although there is a slight overestimation for fd less than two the pegp model slightly overestimates and underestimates for fd less than and higher than two respectively the reason behind this is mainly the appearance of more effective functions in the top 50 of models the predicted values of fd in the testing stage were also shown in fig 4 for both the pegp and qpegp models with 10 maximum and minimum prediction as seen in the figure for the pegp and qpegp models the predictions lower than 10 underestimation are not exist conversely both models estimated values more than the 10 accuracy band but the cases for the qpegp model are lower than the simple model overall both models could forecast the incipient sediment motion with high accuracy but the qpegp model estimated a bit better than the simple model consequently the qpegp as complex model yielded slightly better accuracy in the testing set and it s useful for because the important parameter of ts y is incorporated in the model 3 2 comparison of qpegp and pegp models with empirical equations a comparison between the five different empirical equations available in the literature is illustrated in fig 5 the predictions of novak and nalluri 1984 and safari et al 2017 models are underestimated and in many cases the results are less than the 10 line although in some cases their results are close to the fit line but totally the predicted values are underestimated el zaemey 1991 salem 1998 and bong et al 2016 proved better results in comparison with novak and nalluri 1984 and safari et al 2017 models the comparison of the outcomes of qpegp model with the results of empirical equations tabulated in table 3 displays the superiority of the qpegp model in estimation of fd values in rectangular cross section according to the results it is obvious that the complex qpegp performs better than the other equations as can be seen in this table the results of el zaemey 1991 and salem 1998 are more accurate than those of other equations presented by novak and nalluri 1984 bong et al 2016 and safari et al 2017 it is clear from the table that the qpegp model performs much better than the empirical equations with respect to rmse mae ccc and pbias criteria in fig 6 the efficiency of the qpegp and pegp models developed in this study are compared with empirical models available in the literature using box and whisker plot the 25th and 75th percentile of the data are shown as upper and lower line of the boxes median of the data is indicated as a line at the middle of the boxes the whiskers are shown as extended lines above and below of the boxes it is seen from fig 6 that whiskers boxes for qpegp and pegp models are almost same as observed values although qpegp provides slightly better performance than pegp it can be said that predicted fd values for empirical equations are extremely underestimated as their middle line level are much lower than observed middle line level on the other hand median line for empirical models are not located as middle of the box indicating that the predicted fd values are lower than their counterparts observed in experiments the median lines in qpegp and pegp are placed in the same level as observed one showing the accuracy of the models developed in this study indeed novak and nalluri 1984 and safari et al 2017 conducted experiments in smooth bed channels and accordingly it is reasonable results that their models underestimate for deposited bed condition existing deposited bed at the channel bottom increases the bed friction factor and accordingly higher hydrodynamic forces are required to exert on the sediment particle to initiate the motion el zaemey 1991 salem 1998 and bong et al 2016 conducted experiments in deposited bed condition therefore their performances are better than smooth bed channels models as novak and nalluri 1984 and safari et al 2017 it has to emphasize that empirical models have deficiency to calculate fd for deposited bed condition as demonstrated through the statistical analysis given above 4 discussion sediment incipient motion with a bed deposit was investigated in this study unlike clean smooth bed channel channel with a bed deposit has higher roughness and accordingly higher velocity and shear stress are required to initiate the sediment motion it is the main reason that novak and nalluri 1984 and safari et al 2017 underestimate particle froude number for incipient motion of sediment with a bed deposit it should be noticed that el zaemey 1991 salem 1998 and bong et al 2016 models were developed for deposited bed channels however their computation ability is not as high as qpegp and pegp models developed in this study as already mentioned in order to model sediment transport in open channel flow four fundamental characteristics of flow fluid sediment and channel should be considered conventional regression incipient motion models were developed based on two dimensionless parameters of particle froude number fd and relative particle size ds r in which all effective variables are lumped without considering the channel friction factor as channel characteristic parameter poor performance of conventional regression models can be attributed to the neglecting the channel friction factor λ in the model while in qpegp and pegp models developed in this study λ is incorporated in the models most importantly for deposited bed condition of sediment incipient motion deposited bed thickness ts must be considered in the modeling however in most of the conventional regression models it is neglected in this study the relative bed thickness of deposited sediment parameter ts y is considered which can describe the effect of deposited bed thickness the importance of this parameter is demonstrated in this study as qpegp outperforms pegp where in the former ts y is considered and in the latter the model simplified through removing the ts y parameter this study focuses on sediment incipient motion in rigid boundary channels as reported in safari et al 2018 there are a few numbers of experimental works in the literature on this subject which experiments were mostly conducted in clean smooth bed channels experimental studies on sediment incipient motion in rigid boundary channels with a bed deposit are even less in the literature which are restricted to narrow range of deposited bed thickness moreover determination of the point that sediment particles start to move at the channel bottom is a quite subjective task to define the sediment incipient motion although the fourth definition of kramer 1935 as general transport particles of all sizes are in motion at all points and at all times is mostly used in the experiments the method is optical and accordingly systematic observational error is inevitable to this end conducting new set of experiments in rigid boundary channels with a small bed deposit thickness are still needed it should be noticed that there are a few number of experimental studies conducted for investigation of sediment incipient motion considering deposited sediment thickness as an effective variable utilizing two data sets taken from the literature new models are developed in this study which cover fd d r and ts y ranges of 0 33 3 30 0 010 0 138 and 0 014 0 774 respectively there are a few numbers of data for fd lower than unity in the literature to this end performing new set of experiment utilizing wide range of sediment size can be considered as the subject of future studies 5 conclusions to estimate incipient sediment motion in rectangular channels two new models namely pegp and qpegp are suggested in this study the experimental data available in the literature was used for the modeling model parameters were determined based on dimensional analysis through incorporating four fundamental characteristics of fluid flow sediment and channel to estimate particle froude number as the output of the new models relative particle size relative deposited bed thickness and channel bed slope and friction factor were utilized the qpegp demonstrates more accurate results with an rmse of 0 16 than the pegp with an rmse of 0 17 the accuracy of the qpegp and pegp models are compared with five different empirical models taken from the literature results indicate that the qpegp and pegp models provide better accuracy than the empirical models in estimating the particle froude number at incipient sediment motion empirical models suggested for smooth clean bed channels significantly underestimate which can be related to the effect of existing the deposited bed thickness poor performance of conventional regression models in the literature is also attributed to the neglecting the channel characteristics in the models structure the results of this study recommend that the explicit models from the proposed qpegp and pegp models are more reliable and accurate approach than empirical models for predicting incipient sediment motion particle froude number in rectangular channels declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
5668,assimilating unique features of genetic programming gp and gene expression programming gep this study introduces a hybrid algorithm which results in promising incipient non cohesive sediment motion models the new models use the dimensionless input parameters including relative particle size relative deposited bed thickness channel friction factor and channel bed slope to estimate particle froude number in rectangular channels the models accuracy is tested using different error measures and cross validated through comparison with that of five empirical models available in the relevant literature the results showed enhanced accuracy of the proposed models in comparison to the existing ones with concordance correlation coefficient of 0 92 and 0 94 for parsimonious and quasi parsimonious ensemble gp models respectively such superiority is attributed to the integrated use of flow fluid sediment and channel characteristics in the modeling of incipient motion although the new algorithm is hybrid the proposed models are explicit and precise and thus motivating to be used in practice keywords empirical equations incipient sediment motion genetic programming rectangular channels sediment bed thickness 1 introduction an efficient urban drainage system conveys the surface runoff from a watershed to the point of discharge usually to a river at its designed capacity the deposition of sediment brought through surface runoff within a channel morphs its cross sectional area and consequently reduces the discharge capacity to counteract this inherent problem particularly in areas with high runoff the drainage system is designed based on self cleansing velocity that ensures sediment motion along the channel nalluri et al 1997 the primary description of the self cleansing analysis was provided by ackers et al 1996 and may et al 1996 recently a detail review of its concept and applications has been presented by safari et al 2018 it was reported that the self cleansing criteria can be classified as non deposition ota and perrusquía 2013 and bed sediment motion bong et al 2016 camp 1946 novak and nalluri 1984 safari et al 2017 while the former satisfies a flow condition to keep sediment particle in motion through the flow in the latter deposited sediment particle at the channel bottom is removed from the channel bottom and entrained into the flow incipient motion criterion is considered as bed sediment motion self cleaning criteria which can be considered as minimum design benchmark to prevent continues deposition of sediment the design guideline and basic principles of self cleaning can also be found in the relevant literature butler and davies 2004 mays 2001 merritt 2009 when the focus is deposited sediment the incipient sediment motion is appropriate to be used as the criterion to describe the inherent self cleansing incipient or threshold sediment motion is the movement of sediment from its originally stationary condition to mobility whereby the movement of deposited sediment is initiated by the fluid forces acting on it the flow velocity in conveyance systems is designed for exceeding the critical velocity of sediment so that the system is inherently able to cleanse and remove the deposited sediment the threshold criterion for non cohesive sediment movement depends on the sediment size as described by the well established presentation of the shields diagram shields 1936 the diagram was developed based on homogeneous non cohesive sediment on a flat surface whereby the velocity at the point of the first movement is described as the critical velocity v c shields 1936 presented the concept of incipient sediment motion at the boundary layer where u c is presented as the critical shear velocity u c τ c ρ where τ c is the critical bed shear stress the threshold criterion is described as shields 1936 parameter θ c 1 θ c τ c ρ s ρ g d s where ρ s and ρ denote the sediment and water specific mass respectively g is the acceleration due to gravity and d s is the sediment size often presented as the median grain size d 50 shields 1936 parameter describes the initiation of motion at the surface layer of the bed however it is already reported by bong et al 2014 that sediment deposited bed thickness effects the required incipient motion self cleansing velocity the thickness of deposited sediment in combined sewers varies between 10 mm and 100 mm ashley and crabtree 1992 hence variation of the thickness layer can be more than 1000 d 50 a thicker sediment bed requires higher fluid forces to initiate movement particularly for longer consolidated sediment the increasing forces between particles the armouring effect of the coarser sediment on finer ones and the additional resistance friction between particles due to micro bed forms all contribute in the augment of the critical velocity require for sediment movement bong et al 2016 the empirically developed equations are useful tool to predict critical velocity within the range of thickness used in the relevant experiments the thickness of the non cohesive deposited sediment mixture was found up to 330 mm bong et al 2014 in urban drainage in kuching city bed slope less than 2 and it is believed it can be more in the areas with higher rainfall intensity sediment deposits vary in size distribution and characteristics whereby exhaustive experiments incorporating a wide range of sediment thickness and homogeneity of sediment are not deemed cost effective furthermore experimental works are typically limited by a set of parameters and therefore the validity of the derived equations is restricted to the experimental conditions utilising the critical mean velocity v c novak and nalluri 1975 1984 described the incipient sediment motion in terms of particle froude number f d and relative particle size d r as follows 2 f d v c g d s s 1 a d s r b where s denotes the relative specific mass of sediment a and b are coefficients and r is the hydraulic radius equation 2 can be obtained by analysing hydrodynamic forces acting on the sediment particle or through combination of shields 1936 parameter with manning formula safari et al 2015 describing the sediment pick up rate the incipient sediment motion is also better correlated with the parameter f d than the shields 1936 parameter θ c cheng and emadzadeh 2016 while the coefficient a can vary between 0 48 and 1 07 the coefficient b has the smaller range of 0 23 to 0 47 in rigid boundary channels the relationship between particle froude number f d and relative particle size ds r is commonly used to develop incipient motion models see table 1 among those models given in table 1 novak and nalluri 1984 and safari et al 2017 studied the incipient motion in the smooth bed channels whilst el zaemey 1991 salem 1998 and bong et al 2016 conducted the experiments with the presence of deposited bed sediment thickness ts at the channel bottom to describe the effect of deposited bed thickness bong et al 2016 incorporated the relative deposited thickness parameter in their model referred to as ts y in which y is the flow depth in recent studies machine learning ml techniques has been successfully used to solve variety of problems in sediment transport modeling bhattacharya et al 2007 emamgholizadeh et al 2013 emamgholizadeh and karimi demneh 2019 kisi et al 2012 safari and danandeh mehr 2018 kargar et al 2019 models based on the artificial neural network ann of radial basis function rbf and feed forward neural network ffnn were found to be efficient in predicting the critical velocity for both a shallow and slightly thicker sediment layer wan mohtar et al 2018 the correlation coefficient for both rbf and ffnn models reached up to 0 863 and 0 884 respectively ann models are useful to predict and forecast the critical velocity for various sediment thicknesses however with more data and a large variation in thickness mathematical optimisation is required to enhance the performance of an ml model although the work of wan mohtar et al 2018 produced relatively convincing results of v c prediction using rbf and ffnn an output of an applicable universal equation was not feasible most importantly this study makes an improvement in parameters used in modeling of sediment incipient motion through incorporating the four fundamental parameters effective in the phenomenon as flow fluid sediment and channel characteristics with the aim to produce more efficient models for calculating the particle froude number in varying sediment thickness the technique of ensemble gp hereafter egp is applied in the present study this technique is not only able to find a fit solution in relatively less time and provide wider range of solutions but also has an inherent built in mechanism to avoid or minimise overfitting successful applications of stand alone or hybrid gp models in hydrological hydraulic problems were reported in recent studies danandeh mehr et al 2018 danandeh mehr and safari 2020 however the efficiency of ensemble gp in which different gp variants are combined to achieve both accurate and simple i e parsimonious models was investigated only in a few studies e g rahmani rezaeieh et al 2019 in the present study for the first time we developed and verified a new algorithm that employs power of monolithic gp and gene expression programming gep to model incipient sediment motion in the rectangular channels with a bed deposit the study incorporates channel characteristics with flow fluid and sediment features and puts forward two new models possessing higher accuracy than that of exciting alternatives 2 methodology 2 1 data used to formulate incipient sediment motion in rectangular channels the available data from the relevant literature 250 experiments were collected and used in this study source type and the range of the collected data are tabulated in table 2 salem 1998 investigated the incipient sediment motion for five sediment sizes with the median grain sizes d 50 of 0 55 mm 0 97 mm 1 8 mm 3 09 mm and 4 78 mm the experiments were conducted in a 0 3 m 0 45 m 10 m rectangular flume bong 2013 on the other hand examines the threshold criteria of sediment movement in a 0 6 m 0 4 m 6 3 m flume for three sediment sizes i e d 50 0 81 mm 1 53 mm and 4 78 mm the variation in both studies are only in the sediment sizes with all sediment is non cohesive uniformly distributed sediment with the gradation parameter σ g 1 4 the description of experimental setup and measurement procedures herein are applicable to both studies the working areas to observe the sediment incipient motion were located at a distance from the inlet chamber where at this location the flow is measured as uniform the non cohesive sediment bed was laid with varying thickness ranging from d 50 5 mm 10 mm and 24 mm and was made horizontal by using a metal scraper once the sediment bed is ready the water was carefully flowed in starting with the lowest velocity as not to disrupt the prepared sediment bed the velocity was systematically increased until incipient sediment motion was observed the criteria of sediment movement were set based on the general transport defined by kramer 1935 where particles of all sizes are moving at all points on the bed at all times at this point the velocity is recorded using velocity meter nixon stream flo 430 which denoted as the critical velocity the experiments were rerun to ensure the repeatability and validity of the observed data 2 2 dimensional analysis and data preparation in order to investigate the sediment transport process in open channel flow with the presence of deposited bed thickness four fundamental characteristics of flow fluid sediment and channel must be considered robinson and graf 1972 to this end flow velocity vc flow depth y hydraulic radius r gravitational acceleration g as flow characteristics fluid specific mass ρ as fluid characteristic and sediment specific mass ρs and particles median size ds and deposited bed thickness ts as sediment characteristics and channel bed slope s and channel friction factor λ are considered as channel characteristics these can be expressed via a functional relationship of the form 8 f v c y r g ρ ρ s d s t s s λ 0 utilizing buckingham pi theorem on variables given in eq 8 and substituting ρs with δρ ρs ρ and choosing vc d and ρ as repeating variables the equivalent form 9 f d v c g d s s 1 f d s r d s t s d s y s λ is obtained two dimensionless parameters of ds ts and ds y can be combined and presented as ts y and eq 9 is re written as 10 f d v c g d s s 1 f d s r t s y s λ it is seen that that dimensionless parameters of particle froude number fd sediment relative particle size ds r and relative bed thickness of deposited sediment ts y channel bed slope s and channel friction factor λ can best describe the sediment incipient motion phenomenon with the presence of deposited bed thickness left side of eq 10 is particle froude number fd it is known that the flow velocity vc is a desired variable for channel design fd consists of flow velocity at its structure and therefore it is considered as the model output and the parameters in the right side of the eq 10 are selected as inputs of the model parameters given in eq 10 are calculated at first step of the data preparation in this study the data are changed to dimensionless parameters to generate simple formulae to use in practice then they are divided into two subsets the randomly selected 75 of data was utilised for calibration and the remaining 25 was used for testing the evolved models details of the modeling issues are demonstrated in the subsequent sections 2 3 overview of gp and gep models the state of the art gp is an ml approach in the evolutionary modeling category similar to the well known genetic algorithm the concept of the survival of the best is used to solve a variety of problems using gp referring to the gp literature in water resources engineering danandeh mehr et al 2018 different variants of gp such as multigene gp linear gp and gene expression programming gep were typically applied to solve nonlinear regression problems in which a set of inputs are mapped to an output emamgolizadeh et al 2015 the optimal solution is generally a nonlinear function that is created through simultaneous optimisation of inputs and their coefficients in other words the functional form of the best solution is not given in advance therefore the approach may provide insights into the problem at hand differing in the initial structure of programs i e potential solutions the evolutionary process in all gp variants includes reproduction crossover and mutation that act on the initial and regenerated population of programs the classic gp aka standard gp was first introduced by koza 1992 as illustrated in fig 1 an initial program in classic gp has the form of a tree constructed from a root node inner nodes terminal nodes and linking branches that typically represent a mathematical function all the nodes are randomly filled by a member from a user defined set of inputs functions and terminals a constant value or a given variable the merely constraint belongs to the root node that always takes a function during the evolutionary process the tree materials nodes branches are changed or exchanged between trees the process is continued up to the desired number of generation or until a new program achieves a preferred accuracy more details about classic gp its variants and the evolutionary process at each variant are available in the review paper published by danandeh mehr et al 2018 gep is one of the commonly used gp variants that selects some of the evolved trees to link and improve them with respect to a given objective function and obtains the best combination of individuals using a linking operator the primary difference between gep and gp algorithms is that gep adopts a linear fixed length representation of computer programs see fig 2 which can later be converted into a gp tree many studies have claimed the superiority of gep over the traditional gp in both efficiency and effectiveness ferreira 2006 as previously mentioned in gep an initial program takes the form of a string of fixed length composed of one or more genes called sub expressions sub et and the best result is built by linking the sub expressions using mathematical or boolean functions such as and or not etc rahmani rezaeieh et al 2019 each sub expression is composed of two parts the first part called the head is formed by functions and terminals and the second part called the tail is filled merely by terminals see fig 2 like gp a function accepts one or more arguments and returns a result after evaluation to ensure the validity of a gene for each problem the length of the head h is chosen whereas the tail length t is determined using eq 11 11 t h n 1 1 where n is the maximum arity of all predefined functions despite several advantages of gep over classic gp one of its drawbacks is the expressional complexity of the final solution that may also become over fitted to the training set in such cases noise within the training set is treated as a feature and the generated expressions also try to learn the noise information usually this effect is evidenced by a having very low errors on the training set whereas the evaluation on the test set achieves a very high error rahmani rezaeieh et al 2019 a common approach to address this issue is to use a lower number of sub ets and small heads for details about the evolutionary process in gep and its applications the interested reader is referred to danandeh mehr et al 2018 2 4 ensemble gp egp model for incipient sediment motion the proposed egp is a hybrid evolutionary model that intends for the fine tuning of the gene expressions attained from the classic gep while the classic gep improves the predictive accuracy of the solutions through the combination of a limited number of sub ets the egp model takes the most effective features and functions from a percentage of top gene expressions as new inputs to evolve parsimonious models using a monolithic gp engine as illustrated in fig 3 the proposed model includes three phases of gep based modeling first phase effective input selection second phase and parsimonious model evolution via gp third phase in the first phase the gep engine is used to generate a population of the best models for the given features and label fd as the ultimate goal is to develop the most accurate explicit function a number of mathematical functions such as arithmetic operations trigonometric functions square root and others are defined as the members of initial function set the maximum number of sub ets and allowable tree depth are selected so that the evolved solutions are not over trained to this end we recommend the evaluation of the efficiency of a percentage of potential solutions at the testing data sets instead of the best on training data set this idea originates from the unique feature of gep that evolves a population of potential solutions models while most other ml techniques train a single model at each iteration in this phase it is seen that gep has no prior constraints to avoid model complexity therefore the corresponding mathematical expressions of gene expressions would be of arbitrary complexity when the solutions are allowed to be complex they might also become over fitted to the training set to achieve fewer complex models sensitivity analysis is carried out in the next phase as described below in the second phase a sensitivity analysis is done to determine each input parameter function effect on the accuracy of best solutions then the less effective inputs functions and parameters are removed from the initial inputs the efficiency of each parameter in the best solution can be easily determined considering its frequency as suggested in the literature uyumaz et al 2014 for a given population of best solutions the higher the frequency the higher the efficiency determination of the number of solutions used to accomplish the sensitivity analysis is an important task in this phase less population may lead to the loss of some informative inputs and a larger population may result in complex secondary solutions our review of the relevant literature showed that there is no absolute way to decide the population for example while nourani et al 2012 selected the best inputs from the top 50 gp models uyumaz et al 2014 considered only the top 30 models given an extra challenge we preferred to consider two alternatives the top 20 gene expressions scenario 1 and the top 40 gene expressions scenario 2 with respect to their accuracy in the testing in the last step the effective inputs from each scenario are entered to the monolithic gp engine with a user defined tree depth similar to gep decisions on the best gp model are made by the evaluation of the best model at testing dataset that guarantees both parsimony and generalisability of the best solution returning to the literature it is seen that combination of different gp techniques to increase modeling accuracy has got more attention in recent studies for instance rahmani rezaeieh et al 2019 suggested an ensemble gep egep model for parsimonious streamflow forecasting although the study combines classic gp with gep there are essential differences between the egep and egp approach as listed below egep was used for fine tuning of the percentage of top individuals attained from the canonical gp but egp approach is developed for the fine tuning of the gene expressions attained from the classic gep the proposed egep model integrates a population of low complex gp solutions using a gep technique but the egp model takes the most effective features and functions from a percentage of top gene expressions as new inputs to evolve parsimonious models using a monolithic gp engine 2 5 performance evaluation to assess the performance of each model in predicting the output variable fd four different statistical indicators are used these applied criteria are root mean square errors rmse mean absolute error mae concordance correlation coefficient ccc and percentage of bias pbias while the first three statistics quantify the difference between the observed and predicted values the latter quantifies the agreement between these two measures in addition box diagram which provides more beneficial analytical information about the distribution of predictions is used to derive a better judgement of the models 12 rmse i 1 n x ip x io 2 n 13 mae 1 n i 1 n x ip x io 14 ccc 2 r σ io σ ip σ io 2 σ ip 2 x io x ip 2 15 pbias i 1 n x ip x io i 1 n x io 100 where x io and x ip are the observed and predicted values of fd x io and x ip are the observed and predicted mean values of fd respectively r is correlation coefficient σ io and σ ip are standard deviation of observed and predicted values of fd 3 results to apply egp approach for incipient sediment motion modeling two evolutionary algorithm frameworks namely geppy and gpdotnetv5 0 were interactively used in this study the former is gep framework in python https geppy readthedocs io and the latter is an open source tree based gp software framework in c the main setup parameters to run these models include root mean square error as the objective function arithmetic operations square root exponential trigonometric and power functions as functional set and ultimately dimensionless parameters given in eq 10 as the terminal set members 3 1 selecting the best model as previously mentioned two egp alternatives namely parsimonious ensemble gp hereafter pegp eq 16 and quasi parsimonious hereafter qpegp eq 17 are developed in the present study to predict fd in rectangular channels 16 v c g d s s 1 e x p 1 d s r s s λ e x p s d s r λ 2 d s r 4 d s r 2 s λ d s r λ s d s r c o s s λ c o s d s r 2 λ 17 v c g d s s 1 e x p c o s d s r t s y d s r t a n s λ t a n d s r c o s d s r s e x p s λ s λ s among four features used as the inputs in the first phase of modeling ds r λ and s were found to be the most effective parameters in the second phase at both top 20 and top 40 gep models however ts y was not appeared at all the top 20 models from an effective functioning perspective frequency of addition multiplication subtraction and square root were higher than the other predefined functions in the top 40 model from a physical point of view ts y significantly affects the required velocity of flow at sediment incipient motion condition presence of deposited bed thickness at the channel bottom increases the channel friction factor λ and accordingly higher hydrodynamic forces are needed for initiation of sediment motion neglecting the ts y in the pegp model can be linked to the narrow range of ts in the experiments to overcome to this experimental deficiency performing new set of experiments seems to be helpful to provide sediment incipient motion data with wide range of sediment deposited bed thickness the predictions of the new models vs entire experiments and the associated scatterplots at testing data set are illustrated in fig 4 as mentioned earlier about 250 various data with different sediment size were used for modeling according to the results of fig 4 the qpegp model shows more accurate models having results closer to the measured data than the pegp model the qpegp outperforms pegp where data are fall on the best fit line although there is a slight overestimation for fd less than two the pegp model slightly overestimates and underestimates for fd less than and higher than two respectively the reason behind this is mainly the appearance of more effective functions in the top 50 of models the predicted values of fd in the testing stage were also shown in fig 4 for both the pegp and qpegp models with 10 maximum and minimum prediction as seen in the figure for the pegp and qpegp models the predictions lower than 10 underestimation are not exist conversely both models estimated values more than the 10 accuracy band but the cases for the qpegp model are lower than the simple model overall both models could forecast the incipient sediment motion with high accuracy but the qpegp model estimated a bit better than the simple model consequently the qpegp as complex model yielded slightly better accuracy in the testing set and it s useful for because the important parameter of ts y is incorporated in the model 3 2 comparison of qpegp and pegp models with empirical equations a comparison between the five different empirical equations available in the literature is illustrated in fig 5 the predictions of novak and nalluri 1984 and safari et al 2017 models are underestimated and in many cases the results are less than the 10 line although in some cases their results are close to the fit line but totally the predicted values are underestimated el zaemey 1991 salem 1998 and bong et al 2016 proved better results in comparison with novak and nalluri 1984 and safari et al 2017 models the comparison of the outcomes of qpegp model with the results of empirical equations tabulated in table 3 displays the superiority of the qpegp model in estimation of fd values in rectangular cross section according to the results it is obvious that the complex qpegp performs better than the other equations as can be seen in this table the results of el zaemey 1991 and salem 1998 are more accurate than those of other equations presented by novak and nalluri 1984 bong et al 2016 and safari et al 2017 it is clear from the table that the qpegp model performs much better than the empirical equations with respect to rmse mae ccc and pbias criteria in fig 6 the efficiency of the qpegp and pegp models developed in this study are compared with empirical models available in the literature using box and whisker plot the 25th and 75th percentile of the data are shown as upper and lower line of the boxes median of the data is indicated as a line at the middle of the boxes the whiskers are shown as extended lines above and below of the boxes it is seen from fig 6 that whiskers boxes for qpegp and pegp models are almost same as observed values although qpegp provides slightly better performance than pegp it can be said that predicted fd values for empirical equations are extremely underestimated as their middle line level are much lower than observed middle line level on the other hand median line for empirical models are not located as middle of the box indicating that the predicted fd values are lower than their counterparts observed in experiments the median lines in qpegp and pegp are placed in the same level as observed one showing the accuracy of the models developed in this study indeed novak and nalluri 1984 and safari et al 2017 conducted experiments in smooth bed channels and accordingly it is reasonable results that their models underestimate for deposited bed condition existing deposited bed at the channel bottom increases the bed friction factor and accordingly higher hydrodynamic forces are required to exert on the sediment particle to initiate the motion el zaemey 1991 salem 1998 and bong et al 2016 conducted experiments in deposited bed condition therefore their performances are better than smooth bed channels models as novak and nalluri 1984 and safari et al 2017 it has to emphasize that empirical models have deficiency to calculate fd for deposited bed condition as demonstrated through the statistical analysis given above 4 discussion sediment incipient motion with a bed deposit was investigated in this study unlike clean smooth bed channel channel with a bed deposit has higher roughness and accordingly higher velocity and shear stress are required to initiate the sediment motion it is the main reason that novak and nalluri 1984 and safari et al 2017 underestimate particle froude number for incipient motion of sediment with a bed deposit it should be noticed that el zaemey 1991 salem 1998 and bong et al 2016 models were developed for deposited bed channels however their computation ability is not as high as qpegp and pegp models developed in this study as already mentioned in order to model sediment transport in open channel flow four fundamental characteristics of flow fluid sediment and channel should be considered conventional regression incipient motion models were developed based on two dimensionless parameters of particle froude number fd and relative particle size ds r in which all effective variables are lumped without considering the channel friction factor as channel characteristic parameter poor performance of conventional regression models can be attributed to the neglecting the channel friction factor λ in the model while in qpegp and pegp models developed in this study λ is incorporated in the models most importantly for deposited bed condition of sediment incipient motion deposited bed thickness ts must be considered in the modeling however in most of the conventional regression models it is neglected in this study the relative bed thickness of deposited sediment parameter ts y is considered which can describe the effect of deposited bed thickness the importance of this parameter is demonstrated in this study as qpegp outperforms pegp where in the former ts y is considered and in the latter the model simplified through removing the ts y parameter this study focuses on sediment incipient motion in rigid boundary channels as reported in safari et al 2018 there are a few numbers of experimental works in the literature on this subject which experiments were mostly conducted in clean smooth bed channels experimental studies on sediment incipient motion in rigid boundary channels with a bed deposit are even less in the literature which are restricted to narrow range of deposited bed thickness moreover determination of the point that sediment particles start to move at the channel bottom is a quite subjective task to define the sediment incipient motion although the fourth definition of kramer 1935 as general transport particles of all sizes are in motion at all points and at all times is mostly used in the experiments the method is optical and accordingly systematic observational error is inevitable to this end conducting new set of experiments in rigid boundary channels with a small bed deposit thickness are still needed it should be noticed that there are a few number of experimental studies conducted for investigation of sediment incipient motion considering deposited sediment thickness as an effective variable utilizing two data sets taken from the literature new models are developed in this study which cover fd d r and ts y ranges of 0 33 3 30 0 010 0 138 and 0 014 0 774 respectively there are a few numbers of data for fd lower than unity in the literature to this end performing new set of experiment utilizing wide range of sediment size can be considered as the subject of future studies 5 conclusions to estimate incipient sediment motion in rectangular channels two new models namely pegp and qpegp are suggested in this study the experimental data available in the literature was used for the modeling model parameters were determined based on dimensional analysis through incorporating four fundamental characteristics of fluid flow sediment and channel to estimate particle froude number as the output of the new models relative particle size relative deposited bed thickness and channel bed slope and friction factor were utilized the qpegp demonstrates more accurate results with an rmse of 0 16 than the pegp with an rmse of 0 17 the accuracy of the qpegp and pegp models are compared with five different empirical models taken from the literature results indicate that the qpegp and pegp models provide better accuracy than the empirical models in estimating the particle froude number at incipient sediment motion empirical models suggested for smooth clean bed channels significantly underestimate which can be related to the effect of existing the deposited bed thickness poor performance of conventional regression models in the literature is also attributed to the neglecting the channel characteristics in the models structure the results of this study recommend that the explicit models from the proposed qpegp and pegp models are more reliable and accurate approach than empirical models for predicting incipient sediment motion particle froude number in rectangular channels declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
5669,this study was objected to assess active changes in hydrochemistry of coastal groundwater through the construction of underground low and intermediate level radioactive waste lilrw disposal facility groundwater monitoring data from the construction stage of the facility beginning in 2010 to the operation stage in 2017 revealed seawater intrusion swi into the inland area with significant spatiotemporal variation and subsequent changes in hydrochemical reactions groundwater was divided into three groups based on the temporal changes in the seawater mixing ratio group 1 showed an increasing trend with some delayed responses to swi and an ion exchange dominant process group 2 represented dynamic changes of hydrochemical reactions in time toward to a new equilibrium condition along swi and refreshing in this group simultaneous increases in so4 and ca depletion of δ34sso4 and a slight decline in the si of gypsum suggest that precipitation and re dissolution of gypsum occurred during the transition of swi these changes are probably attributable to the balance change between seawater and fresh groundwater inflows and subsequently to preferential flow paths developed in the fractured aquifer group 3 groundwater demonstrated a rapid and direct connection with seawater since the beginning of construction of the lilrw facility in summary swi process and subsequent hydrogeochemical reactions in the coastal groundwater varies significantly in time and in space thus continuous monitoring of groundwater chemistry is warranted for safety management of the underground lilrw facility keywords hydrochemical reactions spatiotemporal variation seawater intrusion gypsum phase change underground disposal 1 introduction geological disposal of radwaste means isolation of the radwaste from the biosphere and its long term storage in a disposal facility located underground within a stable geological formation and long term management is recommended for high and intermediate level waste iaea 2011 granite has been evaluated worldwide as a suitable geological material of stability for constructing underground research laboratory or underground radioactive waste disposal facility fairhurst 2004 wang 2010 mariner et al 2011 but even in this granite environment geological stability has been investigated through monitoring the hydrogeologic conditions changed by the construction of underground facility parneix 1992 grenier et al 2009 illman et al 2009 in underground disposal sites hydrological and geochemical safety assessment is essential because the geochemical characteristics of groundwater can affect the corrosion of the radwaste barrier ewing et al 2016 in south korea a geological disposal facility for low and intermediate level radioactive waste lilrw was constructed from 2008 to 2014 in the southeastern coastal area and is currently in operation kim et al 2018 reported that groundwater pumping during the construction stage of the facility caused water level decline and subsequent seawater intrusion swi through the fractured aquifer the swi occurred differently in time and space depending on the connectivity of groundwater flow paths which were dominated by fractures to the underground facility swi is a global issue caused naturally by tsunamis illangasekare et al 2006 tidal effects mondal et al 2010 and sea level rise due to climate change sun et al 2017 in addition it can be caused by human induced drivers such as overexploitation of groundwater bagheri et al 2019 and groundwater pumping related to the construction of underground facilities in coastal areas iwatsuki et al 2015 in the course of swi the volume of groundwater is reduced and various chemical reactions occur along the seawater freshwater contact zone andersen et al 2005 the most common reaction during swi is the ion exchange process involved with mineral precipitation and dissolution appelo and postma 2005 boluda botella et al 2008 described a gypsum precipitation dissolution process due to ion exchange between groundwater and aquifer matrix during swi chae et al 2012 reported ion exchange and calcite dissolution in coastal groundwater and the rate of precipitation dissolution of carbonate minerals depended on the salinity and salinity gradient other phenomena that occur in the seawater freshwater interface zone during swi include organic matter degradation by methanogenesis andersen et al 2005 and changes in microbial diversity and community composition chen et al 2019 the lilrw disposal facility in this study area is located within a fractured aquifer in this fractured system the complex circumstances of physical flows and chemical reactions could play an important role in controlling groundwater flow paths along the swi area grenier et al 2009 many modeling studies on coastal fractured aquifers have been conducted allen et al 2003 filippis et al 2013 masciopinto et al 2017 koohbor et al 2019 but few studies have been based on continuous field monitoring sebben et al 2015 iaea 2011 also reported that even though much hydrogeological data pertaining to the underground stability of an lilrw disposal facility are required there is limited experience in the construction and operation of such facilities therefore this field study was objected to quantify the swi process in the fractured coastal aquifer with spatiotemporal variations and to assess the resulting hydrogeochemical processes such as ion exchange and gypsum precipitation dissolution occurring when the swi mixing ratio changes dynamically to approach a new equilibrium in this paper we report the results of hydrogeochemical monitoring at the underground lilrw disposal site in korea from 2015 to 2017 during the facility operation period in the line of consecutive monitoring from the construction period presented in kim et al 2018 our results based on continuous and reliable hydrogeological data measured in the field will provide valuable information not only for understanding the hydrogeochemical processes at the lilrw disposal site in korea but also for increasing the reliability of model predictions in the real groundwater system with the fractured aquifers in coastal areas 2 methods 2 1 study area the lilrw disposal facility is located in the coastal area of southeastern korea fig 1 in the study area the mean annual precipitation and temperature from 2011 to 2017 were 1042 4 mm and 13 2 c respectively six underground domes with 50 m high were constructed for disposal of radioactive wastes these domes are located between 80 m and 130 m below sea level and are located hundreds of meters apart from the coast and groundwater monitoring wells were installed along the coast to check the impact of seawater 2 2 geology and hydrogeology geologically the area consists of cretaceous sedimentary rocks in its western and southern parts and granitic intrusive rocks in its central and northeastern parts there are five fractured zones z21 23 and z31 32 identified at the surface and also three fractured zones f31 33 detected in the tunnel fig 1 the granite in the northeastern part of the area has low hydraulic conductivity 10 8 m s but the fracture zone in the southeastern part has relatively high hydraulic conductivities ranging from 10 6 to 10 7 m s kim et al 2018 minerals in the fractured zones include mostly montmorillonite zeolite chlorite and illite in order of abundance which affect the chemical composition of the groundwater choi et al 2008 high mountains exist in the western part of the repository and groundwater flows from west to east toward the east sea kim et al 2008 since the beginning of the construction of the lilrw disposal facility with storage tanks leveled down to 130 m below mean sea level msl the groundwater level declined continuously to 136 m below msl converting the groundwater flow direction to flow from the sea to the inland lilrw disposal facility kim et al 2018 2 3 field investigation and hydrochemical analyses in this study quarterly field monitoring was performed from june 2015 to december 2017 during the operation stage of the facility we sampled groundwater from six monitoring wells screened at multi depths in discrete intervals gm1 gm2 gm4 gm5 gm6 and gm7 figs 1 and 8 and seawater at two points north and south of the facility boundary each well consists of pump multi packer systems solexperts which inject nitrogen gas through a gas line and sample groundwater through a sample line solexperts 2010 we collected groundwater samples after pumping about 2 l of groundwater until the field measurements stabilized observations from wells gm1 and gm7 were used as comparative backgrounds for those from the other wells depths and screen intervals are given in table 1 to identify the temporal variation in the chemical compositions of the groundwater in the monitoring wells data obtained during the construction stage of the facility were obtained from kim et al 2018 groundwater and seawater samples for chemical and isotope analysis were collected in every quarterly sampling campaign in this study samples were collected using 60 ml ldpe bottle in march june september and december of each year thus noted as 1q 2q 3q and 4q respectively in 2015 2q 3q 4q and 2016 3q when precipitation events occurred during the sampling period precipitation was collected for isotope analysis using a 15 ml ldpe bottle on site on site measurement of water samples included ph temperature electrical conductivity ec and alkalinity and all samples were filtered with a 0 45 µm membrane filter before laboratory analyses water samples for major cations na k ca mg were preserved by adding concentrated hno3 to attain ph 2 and then analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes thermo icap 7000 all samples used for anion and isotope analysis were collected without headspace anions cl so4 br of samples were measured using ion chromatography ic metrohm 883 basic ic plus stable isotope ratios of water samples for δ18o and δd were analyzed using a liquid water isotope analyzer lgr iwa 35 ep with a precision of 1 0 and 0 1 for δd and δ18o respectively δ34sso4 samples were collected in 2017 1q and again in 2017 3q for some samples that showed different trends from others these samples for δ34sso4 were analyzed at the korea basic science institute kbsi using stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry sirms elementar isoprime vision with an analytical precision of 0 2 data reliability was checked with the charge balance and all the samples have the balance less than 10 geochemical modeling with all of these data with phreeqc interactive https www usgs gov software phreeqc version 3 was conducted to identify the reactive mineral phases in the system 3 results discussion fig 2 shows a flowchart of the activities on the lilrw disposal facility from the pre construction phase to the post closure stage including a detailed information on environmental monitoring processes conducted in this study this study covers the hydrogeologic monitoring of the site of lilrw disposal facility during the operational stage from 2015 to 2017 and shows how the groundwater chemistry at the site has been changing continuously in time and space detailed time series monitoring data is provided with table s1 including chemical and stable isotopic compositions during the construction stage a significant groundwater level drop below sea level caused seawater intrusion and a subsequent increase in ec in monitoring wells along the coast kim et al 2018 3 1 changes in groundwater tds in time and space the water body was classified as fresh brackish saline or brinish according to the amount of total dissolved solids tds less than 1000 1000 10 000 10 000 100 000 and greater than 100 000 mg l respectively freeze and cherry 1979 for the samples of this study tds was calculated from the ionic concentrations and showed a proportional correlation with cl concentrations r2 0 999 fig 3 implying that cl could be the dominant component in the coastal groundwater of the study area especially in the high tds ranges the tds values of each monitoring well were plotted over time as shown in fig 4 and the groundwater was subdivided into several categories based on its water type and the pattern of temporal change first the groundwater from wells gm4 6 6 3 and 6 4 and all sampling depths of gm1 and gm7 showed tds values ranging from 170 to 921 mg l maintaining the freshwater type from the construction period to the operation period thus groundwater of these wells was considered to have background quality fig 4a second some groundwater showed tds that started increasing in 2012 1q reached a maximum with values of 9056 mg l and then remained in a steady condition this pattern characterized as delayed increase followed by stabilization occurred in wells gm2 3 2 4 4 3 4 4 4 5 6 1 and 6 2 which were thus classified as group 1 fig 4b third groundwater from gm2 1 2 2 4 1 and 4 2 showed tds values that increased from 2010 3q reached a maximum in around 2014 showing the saline water type and then declined and maintained somewhat steady conditions of the brackish water type during 2017 these wells characterized by rise and decline temporal changes through the monitoring period were grouped as group 2 fig 4c lastly wells of gm5 showed tds values that increased rapidly from 2010 3q reached a maximum within 2 years and then remained mostly within the saline water type except for gm5 4 which had the brackish water type these waters were grouped as group 3 which had the most direct and significant impact of the salinization processes fig 4d in the groundwater spatial variation in tds occurred simultaneously with temporal variation even in the same monitoring wells water types varied with depth for instance among the gm2 wells groundwaters from 2 1 and 2 2 with respective sampling depths of 86 4 and 136 4 m were in group 2 however groundwaters of gm2 3 and 2 4 from respective depths of 190 9 and 267 4 m were in group 1 only the groundwater of gm5 wells showed the same type throughout the whole sampling depth range however the water did show various ranges of tds values therefore the groundwater in the study area appears to have significant variation in time and 3d space and the varying water types indicate that the salinization process mainly explains the spatiotemporal variation in tds values 3 2 spatiotemporal variation in groundwater salinization based on the distinctive signatures of water isotopes numerous studies have applied isotopic analyses to swi studies in a coastal aquifer ma et al 2007 han et al 2015 mohanty and rao 2019 in this study water isotopes for determining δd and δ18o were analyzed to identify the source of salinization and the spatiotemporal variation in the groundwater salinization process during the operation stage of the lilrw disposal facility since 2015 as shown by the isotope ratios fig 5 δd and δ18o of the groundwater ranged from 53 2 to 13 2 and 8 8 to 1 5 respectively those of seawater varied from 4 7 to 1 1 and 0 8 to 0 9 respectively based on the precipitation samples collected in 2015 and 2016 mean δd 31 8 mean δ18o 5 3 the local meteoric water line lmwl was plotted with the equation of δd 8 78 δ18o 14 9 fig 5a table s2 the groundwater data plotted along the equation of δd 6 17 δ18o 1 76 which has a lower slope than the lmwl which implies that isotopic enrichment occurred after precipitation along the groundwater flows by the processes of evaporation and or mixing with seawater montenty et al 2006 the fao 1997 reported that comparing cl and δ18o can help distinguish whether groundwater has been affected by seawater plots of cl with δ18o value showed that all of the groundwater data plotted on a best fit line between seawater and the background fresh water with an r2 0 962 fig 5b indicating that swi was the main process of groundwater salinization additional analysis of swi using br cl ratio is also available in the supplementary material fig s1 richter and kreitler 1993 based on the mixing line of seawater and fresh background groundwater the mixing ratio and its spatiotemporal variation during the construction and operation periods were quantified for the groundwater except for the background samples fig 6 the seawater mixing ratio fsea was estimated based on cl concentrations due to the conservative characteristics of the element in water as follows appelo and postma 2005 f s e a c l m i x c l f r e s h c l s e a c l f r e s h 100 where fsea seawater mixing ratio clmix cl concentration in the mixed groundwater sample mg l clfresh cl concentration in the fresh groundwater sample mg l clsea cl concentration in the seawater sample mg l from 2010 to 2017 covering the construction and operation periods cl mixing ratios at the monitoring wells could also be distinguished according to the three groups fig 6 table s3 wells of group 1 showed a steadily increasing trend of swi with mixing ratios from 0 003 to 27 3 fig 6a those of group 2 showed the earliest detection of swi during the construction period and the most rapid decline of swi during the operation period after construction of the lilrw disposal facility had been completed in these wells the mixing ratios ranged from 0 019 to 36 4 fig 6b however in the well gm5 located close to the shoreline in all sampling depth of group 3 the mixing process proceeded rapidly for several years since construction began and reached a relatively stable phase during the monitoring period of this study after june 2015 the wells of group 3 had significantly varying mixing ratios ranging from 1 3 to 76 8 fig 6c in particular gm5 1 the shallowest one screened at the elevation of 78 4 m in the well of gm5 showed wide variation in mixing ratio with significant drops in 2015 2q for gm5 1 fig 4 d shows a decline of tds in 2015 2q which implies an increased contribution of fresh groundwater relative to that of seawater by contrast well gm5 4 screened at the elevation of 163 4 m showed relatively lower mixing ratios than other gm5 wells throughout the monitoring period this difference is probably attributable to less connected flow paths than for other wells between groundwater and seawater emphasizing the significant spatial variation in groundwater flows the amount of groundwater discharge from the disposal facility for lilrw peaked in 2011 but then declined rapidly to 2014 probably following the construction stages fig 7 since 2015 the groundwater discharge from the facility became relatively stable these changes in groundwater discharge could have driven the salinization of groundwater and re established new equilibriums in groundwater chemistry along the flow paths for instance from the fig 6 gm5 1 shown significant drop in cl mixing ratio from around 40 to about 20 in 2016 1q then rebounded to around 37 in 2016 2q and 20 in 2016 3q respectively these changes in mixing ratio could be attributed to the contribution of fresh groundwater into the well point in fig 7 the facility has been pumping groundwater to discharge under the dome structures and the amount of groundwater discharge has been changing by time such as 167 2 103 ton in 2015 4q 150 3 103 ton in 2016 1q and 155 103 ton in 2016 2q respectively thus the changes in groundwater pumping discharge could affect the induced amount of seawater intrusion for instance decreased pumping from 2015 4q to 2016 1q could draw the seawater intrusion in 2016 1q less than that of 2015 4q subsequently causing the fresh saline groundwater balance moving toward more fresh groundwater contribution resulting in lowering the mixing ratio then the next quarter 2016 2q more pumping discharge drew more seawater and the mixing ratio became rising again with increased tds values wells of groups 1 2 and 3 submitted to swi have depths ranging from 117 0 to 267 4 m 67 6 to 107 6 m and 78 4 to 191 4 m elevation amsl fig 8 in general high salinity groundwater is located nearer the bottom of an aquifer than low salinity groundwater due to the density difference between these waters however the seawater mixing ratios of the gm2 gm4 and gm5 wells along the coastal boundary in the study area showed no regular depth wise pattern following the density distribution in addition adjacent wells at similar depths also showed different mixing ratios thus we concluded as suggested by park et al 2012 that spatiotemporal variation in swi had been occurring at variable depths probably through preferential flow paths developed in the granitic bedrock at this study site 3 3 hydrogeochemical changes in groundwater groundwater chemistry in the mixing zone of a coastal aquifer is controlled by reactions among freshwater the minerals in bedrock and seawater thus depending on the extent of reactions the groundwater chemistry can be presented as typical types in piper plots hounslow 1995 fig 9 shows the temporal changes in groundwater chemistry from the initial state before construction 2010 3q to the final stage of construction 2014 3q and at the time after 3 years of operation 2017 3q of the lilrw disposal facility groundwaters from group 1 and 2 wells showed changes from the initial stage fig 9a to the construction stage fig 9b and to the operation stage fig 9c however the groundwater of group 3 wells already had some compositions indicating mixing with seawater subsequently during the construction stage the composition moved rapidly to that of seawater and then stabilized the temporal changes in water composition of the different groups are shown clearly in fig 10 wells gm4 4 4 2 and 5 2 were selected as representative wells of groups 1 2 and 3 respectively then the quarterly analytical results were plotted in a piper diagram the red and blue colors of the plots indicate those before and after the construction stages respectively groundwater of the gm4 4 well representing group 1 fig 10a showed dominant changes in composition through the ion exchange process along the swi the exchange of ca and na between aquifer matrix and intruding seawater is noted by an arrow as seawater intrudes ion exchange occurs in groundwater between ca in the aquifer matrix and na in seawater this ion exchange proceeds until the aquifer matrix is saturated with na and no additional ca is released from the matrix resulting in an increase in ca in the groundwater compared to the initial composition and subsequently changing the water from na ca hco3 type to ca cl type appelo and postma 2005 in this group 1 cl mixing ratio is not increasing until seawater composition but if swi continues after this time like group 2 there will be decreasing in ca and increasing in na in groundwater as consequence of the cationic exchange with the aquifer matrix resulting na cl type water as occurs in seawater intrusion experiments carried out in laboratory columns boluda botella et al 2008 the pathway between fresh and sea water described in piper diagrams carried out of those experiments are similar to the sample s evolution in gm4 2 representing group 2 groundwater fig 10b however as shown in fig 6 the cl mixing ratio was decreased during the operation period of the lilrw disposal facility and the final composition not reached that of the seawater therefore water type can evolve to similar composition with different salinity as can be seen moreover if the final composition not reached that of seawater the present state is apparently stabilized as can be seen in fig 6a but could modify their composition as consequence of flow rate variations or with the water mixture as shown in fig 6b plots of the major compositions of gm4 4 and gm4 2 representing groups 1 and 2 respectively also clearly show the trends of temporal change in major compositions fig 11 in a system in which the ion exchange process is dominant the slope in the relationship between major compositions is 1 rajmohan and elango 2004 thus the slope of 1 03 indicates that ion exchange is the main process in this groundwater system all samples correspond to this slope and their composition is consequence of the seawater intrusion or refreshing both with ion exchange wang and jiao 2012 proposed a quantitative method to calculate the ion exchange along the swi process they suggested the calculation of nareact and ca react using following equations c a o r n a m i x f s e a c a o r n a s e a 1 f s e a c a o r n a f r e s h where ca or na mix ca or na concentrations calculated by seawater fraction in conservative mixing mg l ca or na sea and ca or na fresh ca or na concentrations in seawater and freshwater mg l c a o r n a r e a c t c a o r n a s a m p l e c a o r n a m i x where ca or na react ca or na concentrations depleted or enriched by geochemical reactions mg l ca or na sample ca or na concentrations in groundwater sample mg l based on the nareact ca react relations table s4 fig 12 a shows a typical intrusion stage of na deficiency in reaction for group 1 samples and fig 12b for an intrusion following refreshing in time for group 2 samples specially group 2 samples shows that the change is still in action rather not stalled indicating the dynamic variation in the coastal groundwater system group 3 reached immediately the seawater composition groundwater in the gm5 2 group 3 well shows direct mixing with seawater although the mixing ratios vary with depth figs 6c and 10c this implies that the groundwater flow paths in the aquifer at the locations of gm5 wells extend to seawater causing direct connection between groundwater and seawater although the degree of connection varies with depth in summary during the operation of the lilrw disposal facility the groundwaters of groups 1 and 3 seem to be stabilize with their present equilibriums but if the conditions are different as occurred with the flow rate the composition could be different as in group 2 as commented in the next section 3 4 dynamic equilibrium of so4 in the transition process as noted earlier group 2 wells showed that clear temporal changes in groundwater chemistry occurred through the swi including ion exchange and mixing processes because pumping discharge from the lilrw disposal facility was lower during the operation stage than during the construction stage fig 7 the influence of swi became less and the mixing ratio started to decline in the detailed plots of the molar ratio of so4 cl fig 13 it decreased drastically close to that of 0 05 of seawater implying the swi from 2010 3q with the beginning of the lilrw disposal facility construction stage so4 cl of the background groundwater gm7 0 82 in average then with the beginning of the operation stage of the facility after 2015 2q the seawater mixing ratio started to decline and the molar ratio of so4 cl rebounded steadily this means that so4 is actively reflecting the changes in water chemistry along the swi process the saturation index si of gypsum in group 2 wells calculated using the speciation model phreeqci ver 3 increased up to the equilibrium state close to si 0 in the range 0 5 0 5 considered in appelo and postma 2005 through the swi process fig 13 gomis yagües et al 2000 reported that gypsum precipitation dissolution could occur in the contact zone of freshwater and seawater through the swi and ion exchange in an aquifer the activities of ca and so4 ions become sufficient to reach the solubility product of gypsum triggering precipitation of gypsum subsequently when ca release is reduced after sufficient ion exchange the si of gypsum decreases in 2014 4q until 0 9 and the so4 is liberated to solution causing so4 concentrations to become higher than those of seawater thus the seawater mixing ratio starts to decline at the end of the ion exchange and then precipitated gypsum along the transition zone can be dissolved to release ca and so4 boluda botella et al 2014 this gypsum precipitation and dissolution process conforms to the changes in ca and so4 concentrations in fig 14 following the ion exchange process showed ca na trend and continuous swi caused na ca trend resulting in na cl water type however at some points ca concentrations increased fig 14a which originated from additional source of ca the trend of ca concentration change appears to follow the gypsum dissolution line with so4 indicating that gypsum dissolution occurred in this groundwater system fig 14b the isotopic signature of sulfate in the groundwater samples also implies that the group 2 wells in this study area are affected not only by seawater mixing but also by other geochemical processes fig 15 δ34sso4 values have been used to identify sources of so4 in saline groundwater kim et al 2003 and modern seawater has isotopic signatures close to 21 han et al 2011 in the study area water samples have isotope values ranging from 5 3 for background fresh water to 20 2 for seawater along with intermediate values depending on the mixing ratio fig 15 when the mixing ratio exceeded 6 5 group 1 i e gm4 5 the isotopic signature reached 19 2 close to the value of seawater however group 2 wells such as gm4 1 and 4 2 had isotopically highly depleted signatures ranging from 9 5 to 11 7 even with mixing ratios of 6 9 10 1 relative to the other wells regarding these depleted isotopic values barker et al 1998 reported that groundwater affected by gypsum dissolution had δ34sso4 values of 8 15 and karim and veizer 2000 also noted that river water affected by dissolution of gypsum and anhydrite had a δ34sso4 value of 10 4 consequently the isotopic depletion of δ34sso4 in the group 2 wells fig 15 with a slight decline of the si of gypsum fig 13 implies that the groundwaters of these wells are under the influence of the gypsum dissolution process at the fresh saline water transition boundary precipitation dissolution of minerals during swi in a fractured aquifer can affect the preferential flow paths in the fractured carbonate aquifer in salento southern italy precipitated gypsum demonstrates the feasibility of barriers to swi barcelona et al 2006 therefore hydrochemical processes such as gypsum precipitation and dissolution and their changes in time and space could play an important role in the safety of the underground lilrw disposal facility within the aquifer through the connection or blockage of preferential flow paths between fresh groundwater and seawater 4 conclusions in this paper we reported the results of hydrogeochemical monitoring at the underground lilrw disposal site of korea during the facility operation period along with results obtained previously during the construction period kim et al 2018 the fractured coastal aquifer where the site is located has been intruded by seawater due to groundwater discharge accompanying the construction of the facility based on the water quality and the stable isotopic signatures groundwater salinization dominantly driven by swi was identified along preferential flow paths developed in the fractured aquifer which subsequently caused significant spatiotemporal variation groundwater samples were divided into three groups based on the temporal changes in seawater mixing ratio group 1 wells showing a pattern of increasing mixing ratio with some delayed responses to swi are still undergoing an ion exchange process group 2 wells presented the decreased mixing ratio and the water type changed to na cl type following swi process and refreshing due to decreased groundwater discharge from the facility and following increased contribution of fresh groundwater during the process the increase of sulfate concentrations in group 2 wells implies that gypsum precipitation and redissolution occur in the transition zone this process was confirmed by the simultaneous increase in so4 and ca depletion of δ34sso4 and slight decline of the si of gypsum group 3 wells have been rapidly and directly affected by seawater since the start of construction of the lilrw disposal facility the chemical properties of groundwater in the fractured coastal aquifer with different seawater mixing ratios vary over time and space and that the changes could result in the precipitation dissolution of gypsum possibly altering the flow paths of the groundwater and directly affecting the safety of the underground lilrw disposal facility

5669,this study was objected to assess active changes in hydrochemistry of coastal groundwater through the construction of underground low and intermediate level radioactive waste lilrw disposal facility groundwater monitoring data from the construction stage of the facility beginning in 2010 to the operation stage in 2017 revealed seawater intrusion swi into the inland area with significant spatiotemporal variation and subsequent changes in hydrochemical reactions groundwater was divided into three groups based on the temporal changes in the seawater mixing ratio group 1 showed an increasing trend with some delayed responses to swi and an ion exchange dominant process group 2 represented dynamic changes of hydrochemical reactions in time toward to a new equilibrium condition along swi and refreshing in this group simultaneous increases in so4 and ca depletion of δ34sso4 and a slight decline in the si of gypsum suggest that precipitation and re dissolution of gypsum occurred during the transition of swi these changes are probably attributable to the balance change between seawater and fresh groundwater inflows and subsequently to preferential flow paths developed in the fractured aquifer group 3 groundwater demonstrated a rapid and direct connection with seawater since the beginning of construction of the lilrw facility in summary swi process and subsequent hydrogeochemical reactions in the coastal groundwater varies significantly in time and in space thus continuous monitoring of groundwater chemistry is warranted for safety management of the underground lilrw facility keywords hydrochemical reactions spatiotemporal variation seawater intrusion gypsum phase change underground disposal 1 introduction geological disposal of radwaste means isolation of the radwaste from the biosphere and its long term storage in a disposal facility located underground within a stable geological formation and long term management is recommended for high and intermediate level waste iaea 2011 granite has been evaluated worldwide as a suitable geological material of stability for constructing underground research laboratory or underground radioactive waste disposal facility fairhurst 2004 wang 2010 mariner et al 2011 but even in this granite environment geological stability has been investigated through monitoring the hydrogeologic conditions changed by the construction of underground facility parneix 1992 grenier et al 2009 illman et al 2009 in underground disposal sites hydrological and geochemical safety assessment is essential because the geochemical characteristics of groundwater can affect the corrosion of the radwaste barrier ewing et al 2016 in south korea a geological disposal facility for low and intermediate level radioactive waste lilrw was constructed from 2008 to 2014 in the southeastern coastal area and is currently in operation kim et al 2018 reported that groundwater pumping during the construction stage of the facility caused water level decline and subsequent seawater intrusion swi through the fractured aquifer the swi occurred differently in time and space depending on the connectivity of groundwater flow paths which were dominated by fractures to the underground facility swi is a global issue caused naturally by tsunamis illangasekare et al 2006 tidal effects mondal et al 2010 and sea level rise due to climate change sun et al 2017 in addition it can be caused by human induced drivers such as overexploitation of groundwater bagheri et al 2019 and groundwater pumping related to the construction of underground facilities in coastal areas iwatsuki et al 2015 in the course of swi the volume of groundwater is reduced and various chemical reactions occur along the seawater freshwater contact zone andersen et al 2005 the most common reaction during swi is the ion exchange process involved with mineral precipitation and dissolution appelo and postma 2005 boluda botella et al 2008 described a gypsum precipitation dissolution process due to ion exchange between groundwater and aquifer matrix during swi chae et al 2012 reported ion exchange and calcite dissolution in coastal groundwater and the rate of precipitation dissolution of carbonate minerals depended on the salinity and salinity gradient other phenomena that occur in the seawater freshwater interface zone during swi include organic matter degradation by methanogenesis andersen et al 2005 and changes in microbial diversity and community composition chen et al 2019 the lilrw disposal facility in this study area is located within a fractured aquifer in this fractured system the complex circumstances of physical flows and chemical reactions could play an important role in controlling groundwater flow paths along the swi area grenier et al 2009 many modeling studies on coastal fractured aquifers have been conducted allen et al 2003 filippis et al 2013 masciopinto et al 2017 koohbor et al 2019 but few studies have been based on continuous field monitoring sebben et al 2015 iaea 2011 also reported that even though much hydrogeological data pertaining to the underground stability of an lilrw disposal facility are required there is limited experience in the construction and operation of such facilities therefore this field study was objected to quantify the swi process in the fractured coastal aquifer with spatiotemporal variations and to assess the resulting hydrogeochemical processes such as ion exchange and gypsum precipitation dissolution occurring when the swi mixing ratio changes dynamically to approach a new equilibrium in this paper we report the results of hydrogeochemical monitoring at the underground lilrw disposal site in korea from 2015 to 2017 during the facility operation period in the line of consecutive monitoring from the construction period presented in kim et al 2018 our results based on continuous and reliable hydrogeological data measured in the field will provide valuable information not only for understanding the hydrogeochemical processes at the lilrw disposal site in korea but also for increasing the reliability of model predictions in the real groundwater system with the fractured aquifers in coastal areas 2 methods 2 1 study area the lilrw disposal facility is located in the coastal area of southeastern korea fig 1 in the study area the mean annual precipitation and temperature from 2011 to 2017 were 1042 4 mm and 13 2 c respectively six underground domes with 50 m high were constructed for disposal of radioactive wastes these domes are located between 80 m and 130 m below sea level and are located hundreds of meters apart from the coast and groundwater monitoring wells were installed along the coast to check the impact of seawater 2 2 geology and hydrogeology geologically the area consists of cretaceous sedimentary rocks in its western and southern parts and granitic intrusive rocks in its central and northeastern parts there are five fractured zones z21 23 and z31 32 identified at the surface and also three fractured zones f31 33 detected in the tunnel fig 1 the granite in the northeastern part of the area has low hydraulic conductivity 10 8 m s but the fracture zone in the southeastern part has relatively high hydraulic conductivities ranging from 10 6 to 10 7 m s kim et al 2018 minerals in the fractured zones include mostly montmorillonite zeolite chlorite and illite in order of abundance which affect the chemical composition of the groundwater choi et al 2008 high mountains exist in the western part of the repository and groundwater flows from west to east toward the east sea kim et al 2008 since the beginning of the construction of the lilrw disposal facility with storage tanks leveled down to 130 m below mean sea level msl the groundwater level declined continuously to 136 m below msl converting the groundwater flow direction to flow from the sea to the inland lilrw disposal facility kim et al 2018 2 3 field investigation and hydrochemical analyses in this study quarterly field monitoring was performed from june 2015 to december 2017 during the operation stage of the facility we sampled groundwater from six monitoring wells screened at multi depths in discrete intervals gm1 gm2 gm4 gm5 gm6 and gm7 figs 1 and 8 and seawater at two points north and south of the facility boundary each well consists of pump multi packer systems solexperts which inject nitrogen gas through a gas line and sample groundwater through a sample line solexperts 2010 we collected groundwater samples after pumping about 2 l of groundwater until the field measurements stabilized observations from wells gm1 and gm7 were used as comparative backgrounds for those from the other wells depths and screen intervals are given in table 1 to identify the temporal variation in the chemical compositions of the groundwater in the monitoring wells data obtained during the construction stage of the facility were obtained from kim et al 2018 groundwater and seawater samples for chemical and isotope analysis were collected in every quarterly sampling campaign in this study samples were collected using 60 ml ldpe bottle in march june september and december of each year thus noted as 1q 2q 3q and 4q respectively in 2015 2q 3q 4q and 2016 3q when precipitation events occurred during the sampling period precipitation was collected for isotope analysis using a 15 ml ldpe bottle on site on site measurement of water samples included ph temperature electrical conductivity ec and alkalinity and all samples were filtered with a 0 45 µm membrane filter before laboratory analyses water samples for major cations na k ca mg were preserved by adding concentrated hno3 to attain ph 2 and then analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes thermo icap 7000 all samples used for anion and isotope analysis were collected without headspace anions cl so4 br of samples were measured using ion chromatography ic metrohm 883 basic ic plus stable isotope ratios of water samples for δ18o and δd were analyzed using a liquid water isotope analyzer lgr iwa 35 ep with a precision of 1 0 and 0 1 for δd and δ18o respectively δ34sso4 samples were collected in 2017 1q and again in 2017 3q for some samples that showed different trends from others these samples for δ34sso4 were analyzed at the korea basic science institute kbsi using stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry sirms elementar isoprime vision with an analytical precision of 0 2 data reliability was checked with the charge balance and all the samples have the balance less than 10 geochemical modeling with all of these data with phreeqc interactive https www usgs gov software phreeqc version 3 was conducted to identify the reactive mineral phases in the system 3 results discussion fig 2 shows a flowchart of the activities on the lilrw disposal facility from the pre construction phase to the post closure stage including a detailed information on environmental monitoring processes conducted in this study this study covers the hydrogeologic monitoring of the site of lilrw disposal facility during the operational stage from 2015 to 2017 and shows how the groundwater chemistry at the site has been changing continuously in time and space detailed time series monitoring data is provided with table s1 including chemical and stable isotopic compositions during the construction stage a significant groundwater level drop below sea level caused seawater intrusion and a subsequent increase in ec in monitoring wells along the coast kim et al 2018 3 1 changes in groundwater tds in time and space the water body was classified as fresh brackish saline or brinish according to the amount of total dissolved solids tds less than 1000 1000 10 000 10 000 100 000 and greater than 100 000 mg l respectively freeze and cherry 1979 for the samples of this study tds was calculated from the ionic concentrations and showed a proportional correlation with cl concentrations r2 0 999 fig 3 implying that cl could be the dominant component in the coastal groundwater of the study area especially in the high tds ranges the tds values of each monitoring well were plotted over time as shown in fig 4 and the groundwater was subdivided into several categories based on its water type and the pattern of temporal change first the groundwater from wells gm4 6 6 3 and 6 4 and all sampling depths of gm1 and gm7 showed tds values ranging from 170 to 921 mg l maintaining the freshwater type from the construction period to the operation period thus groundwater of these wells was considered to have background quality fig 4a second some groundwater showed tds that started increasing in 2012 1q reached a maximum with values of 9056 mg l and then remained in a steady condition this pattern characterized as delayed increase followed by stabilization occurred in wells gm2 3 2 4 4 3 4 4 4 5 6 1 and 6 2 which were thus classified as group 1 fig 4b third groundwater from gm2 1 2 2 4 1 and 4 2 showed tds values that increased from 2010 3q reached a maximum in around 2014 showing the saline water type and then declined and maintained somewhat steady conditions of the brackish water type during 2017 these wells characterized by rise and decline temporal changes through the monitoring period were grouped as group 2 fig 4c lastly wells of gm5 showed tds values that increased rapidly from 2010 3q reached a maximum within 2 years and then remained mostly within the saline water type except for gm5 4 which had the brackish water type these waters were grouped as group 3 which had the most direct and significant impact of the salinization processes fig 4d in the groundwater spatial variation in tds occurred simultaneously with temporal variation even in the same monitoring wells water types varied with depth for instance among the gm2 wells groundwaters from 2 1 and 2 2 with respective sampling depths of 86 4 and 136 4 m were in group 2 however groundwaters of gm2 3 and 2 4 from respective depths of 190 9 and 267 4 m were in group 1 only the groundwater of gm5 wells showed the same type throughout the whole sampling depth range however the water did show various ranges of tds values therefore the groundwater in the study area appears to have significant variation in time and 3d space and the varying water types indicate that the salinization process mainly explains the spatiotemporal variation in tds values 3 2 spatiotemporal variation in groundwater salinization based on the distinctive signatures of water isotopes numerous studies have applied isotopic analyses to swi studies in a coastal aquifer ma et al 2007 han et al 2015 mohanty and rao 2019 in this study water isotopes for determining δd and δ18o were analyzed to identify the source of salinization and the spatiotemporal variation in the groundwater salinization process during the operation stage of the lilrw disposal facility since 2015 as shown by the isotope ratios fig 5 δd and δ18o of the groundwater ranged from 53 2 to 13 2 and 8 8 to 1 5 respectively those of seawater varied from 4 7 to 1 1 and 0 8 to 0 9 respectively based on the precipitation samples collected in 2015 and 2016 mean δd 31 8 mean δ18o 5 3 the local meteoric water line lmwl was plotted with the equation of δd 8 78 δ18o 14 9 fig 5a table s2 the groundwater data plotted along the equation of δd 6 17 δ18o 1 76 which has a lower slope than the lmwl which implies that isotopic enrichment occurred after precipitation along the groundwater flows by the processes of evaporation and or mixing with seawater montenty et al 2006 the fao 1997 reported that comparing cl and δ18o can help distinguish whether groundwater has been affected by seawater plots of cl with δ18o value showed that all of the groundwater data plotted on a best fit line between seawater and the background fresh water with an r2 0 962 fig 5b indicating that swi was the main process of groundwater salinization additional analysis of swi using br cl ratio is also available in the supplementary material fig s1 richter and kreitler 1993 based on the mixing line of seawater and fresh background groundwater the mixing ratio and its spatiotemporal variation during the construction and operation periods were quantified for the groundwater except for the background samples fig 6 the seawater mixing ratio fsea was estimated based on cl concentrations due to the conservative characteristics of the element in water as follows appelo and postma 2005 f s e a c l m i x c l f r e s h c l s e a c l f r e s h 100 where fsea seawater mixing ratio clmix cl concentration in the mixed groundwater sample mg l clfresh cl concentration in the fresh groundwater sample mg l clsea cl concentration in the seawater sample mg l from 2010 to 2017 covering the construction and operation periods cl mixing ratios at the monitoring wells could also be distinguished according to the three groups fig 6 table s3 wells of group 1 showed a steadily increasing trend of swi with mixing ratios from 0 003 to 27 3 fig 6a those of group 2 showed the earliest detection of swi during the construction period and the most rapid decline of swi during the operation period after construction of the lilrw disposal facility had been completed in these wells the mixing ratios ranged from 0 019 to 36 4 fig 6b however in the well gm5 located close to the shoreline in all sampling depth of group 3 the mixing process proceeded rapidly for several years since construction began and reached a relatively stable phase during the monitoring period of this study after june 2015 the wells of group 3 had significantly varying mixing ratios ranging from 1 3 to 76 8 fig 6c in particular gm5 1 the shallowest one screened at the elevation of 78 4 m in the well of gm5 showed wide variation in mixing ratio with significant drops in 2015 2q for gm5 1 fig 4 d shows a decline of tds in 2015 2q which implies an increased contribution of fresh groundwater relative to that of seawater by contrast well gm5 4 screened at the elevation of 163 4 m showed relatively lower mixing ratios than other gm5 wells throughout the monitoring period this difference is probably attributable to less connected flow paths than for other wells between groundwater and seawater emphasizing the significant spatial variation in groundwater flows the amount of groundwater discharge from the disposal facility for lilrw peaked in 2011 but then declined rapidly to 2014 probably following the construction stages fig 7 since 2015 the groundwater discharge from the facility became relatively stable these changes in groundwater discharge could have driven the salinization of groundwater and re established new equilibriums in groundwater chemistry along the flow paths for instance from the fig 6 gm5 1 shown significant drop in cl mixing ratio from around 40 to about 20 in 2016 1q then rebounded to around 37 in 2016 2q and 20 in 2016 3q respectively these changes in mixing ratio could be attributed to the contribution of fresh groundwater into the well point in fig 7 the facility has been pumping groundwater to discharge under the dome structures and the amount of groundwater discharge has been changing by time such as 167 2 103 ton in 2015 4q 150 3 103 ton in 2016 1q and 155 103 ton in 2016 2q respectively thus the changes in groundwater pumping discharge could affect the induced amount of seawater intrusion for instance decreased pumping from 2015 4q to 2016 1q could draw the seawater intrusion in 2016 1q less than that of 2015 4q subsequently causing the fresh saline groundwater balance moving toward more fresh groundwater contribution resulting in lowering the mixing ratio then the next quarter 2016 2q more pumping discharge drew more seawater and the mixing ratio became rising again with increased tds values wells of groups 1 2 and 3 submitted to swi have depths ranging from 117 0 to 267 4 m 67 6 to 107 6 m and 78 4 to 191 4 m elevation amsl fig 8 in general high salinity groundwater is located nearer the bottom of an aquifer than low salinity groundwater due to the density difference between these waters however the seawater mixing ratios of the gm2 gm4 and gm5 wells along the coastal boundary in the study area showed no regular depth wise pattern following the density distribution in addition adjacent wells at similar depths also showed different mixing ratios thus we concluded as suggested by park et al 2012 that spatiotemporal variation in swi had been occurring at variable depths probably through preferential flow paths developed in the granitic bedrock at this study site 3 3 hydrogeochemical changes in groundwater groundwater chemistry in the mixing zone of a coastal aquifer is controlled by reactions among freshwater the minerals in bedrock and seawater thus depending on the extent of reactions the groundwater chemistry can be presented as typical types in piper plots hounslow 1995 fig 9 shows the temporal changes in groundwater chemistry from the initial state before construction 2010 3q to the final stage of construction 2014 3q and at the time after 3 years of operation 2017 3q of the lilrw disposal facility groundwaters from group 1 and 2 wells showed changes from the initial stage fig 9a to the construction stage fig 9b and to the operation stage fig 9c however the groundwater of group 3 wells already had some compositions indicating mixing with seawater subsequently during the construction stage the composition moved rapidly to that of seawater and then stabilized the temporal changes in water composition of the different groups are shown clearly in fig 10 wells gm4 4 4 2 and 5 2 were selected as representative wells of groups 1 2 and 3 respectively then the quarterly analytical results were plotted in a piper diagram the red and blue colors of the plots indicate those before and after the construction stages respectively groundwater of the gm4 4 well representing group 1 fig 10a showed dominant changes in composition through the ion exchange process along the swi the exchange of ca and na between aquifer matrix and intruding seawater is noted by an arrow as seawater intrudes ion exchange occurs in groundwater between ca in the aquifer matrix and na in seawater this ion exchange proceeds until the aquifer matrix is saturated with na and no additional ca is released from the matrix resulting in an increase in ca in the groundwater compared to the initial composition and subsequently changing the water from na ca hco3 type to ca cl type appelo and postma 2005 in this group 1 cl mixing ratio is not increasing until seawater composition but if swi continues after this time like group 2 there will be decreasing in ca and increasing in na in groundwater as consequence of the cationic exchange with the aquifer matrix resulting na cl type water as occurs in seawater intrusion experiments carried out in laboratory columns boluda botella et al 2008 the pathway between fresh and sea water described in piper diagrams carried out of those experiments are similar to the sample s evolution in gm4 2 representing group 2 groundwater fig 10b however as shown in fig 6 the cl mixing ratio was decreased during the operation period of the lilrw disposal facility and the final composition not reached that of the seawater therefore water type can evolve to similar composition with different salinity as can be seen moreover if the final composition not reached that of seawater the present state is apparently stabilized as can be seen in fig 6a but could modify their composition as consequence of flow rate variations or with the water mixture as shown in fig 6b plots of the major compositions of gm4 4 and gm4 2 representing groups 1 and 2 respectively also clearly show the trends of temporal change in major compositions fig 11 in a system in which the ion exchange process is dominant the slope in the relationship between major compositions is 1 rajmohan and elango 2004 thus the slope of 1 03 indicates that ion exchange is the main process in this groundwater system all samples correspond to this slope and their composition is consequence of the seawater intrusion or refreshing both with ion exchange wang and jiao 2012 proposed a quantitative method to calculate the ion exchange along the swi process they suggested the calculation of nareact and ca react using following equations c a o r n a m i x f s e a c a o r n a s e a 1 f s e a c a o r n a f r e s h where ca or na mix ca or na concentrations calculated by seawater fraction in conservative mixing mg l ca or na sea and ca or na fresh ca or na concentrations in seawater and freshwater mg l c a o r n a r e a c t c a o r n a s a m p l e c a o r n a m i x where ca or na react ca or na concentrations depleted or enriched by geochemical reactions mg l ca or na sample ca or na concentrations in groundwater sample mg l based on the nareact ca react relations table s4 fig 12 a shows a typical intrusion stage of na deficiency in reaction for group 1 samples and fig 12b for an intrusion following refreshing in time for group 2 samples specially group 2 samples shows that the change is still in action rather not stalled indicating the dynamic variation in the coastal groundwater system group 3 reached immediately the seawater composition groundwater in the gm5 2 group 3 well shows direct mixing with seawater although the mixing ratios vary with depth figs 6c and 10c this implies that the groundwater flow paths in the aquifer at the locations of gm5 wells extend to seawater causing direct connection between groundwater and seawater although the degree of connection varies with depth in summary during the operation of the lilrw disposal facility the groundwaters of groups 1 and 3 seem to be stabilize with their present equilibriums but if the conditions are different as occurred with the flow rate the composition could be different as in group 2 as commented in the next section 3 4 dynamic equilibrium of so4 in the transition process as noted earlier group 2 wells showed that clear temporal changes in groundwater chemistry occurred through the swi including ion exchange and mixing processes because pumping discharge from the lilrw disposal facility was lower during the operation stage than during the construction stage fig 7 the influence of swi became less and the mixing ratio started to decline in the detailed plots of the molar ratio of so4 cl fig 13 it decreased drastically close to that of 0 05 of seawater implying the swi from 2010 3q with the beginning of the lilrw disposal facility construction stage so4 cl of the background groundwater gm7 0 82 in average then with the beginning of the operation stage of the facility after 2015 2q the seawater mixing ratio started to decline and the molar ratio of so4 cl rebounded steadily this means that so4 is actively reflecting the changes in water chemistry along the swi process the saturation index si of gypsum in group 2 wells calculated using the speciation model phreeqci ver 3 increased up to the equilibrium state close to si 0 in the range 0 5 0 5 considered in appelo and postma 2005 through the swi process fig 13 gomis yagües et al 2000 reported that gypsum precipitation dissolution could occur in the contact zone of freshwater and seawater through the swi and ion exchange in an aquifer the activities of ca and so4 ions become sufficient to reach the solubility product of gypsum triggering precipitation of gypsum subsequently when ca release is reduced after sufficient ion exchange the si of gypsum decreases in 2014 4q until 0 9 and the so4 is liberated to solution causing so4 concentrations to become higher than those of seawater thus the seawater mixing ratio starts to decline at the end of the ion exchange and then precipitated gypsum along the transition zone can be dissolved to release ca and so4 boluda botella et al 2014 this gypsum precipitation and dissolution process conforms to the changes in ca and so4 concentrations in fig 14 following the ion exchange process showed ca na trend and continuous swi caused na ca trend resulting in na cl water type however at some points ca concentrations increased fig 14a which originated from additional source of ca the trend of ca concentration change appears to follow the gypsum dissolution line with so4 indicating that gypsum dissolution occurred in this groundwater system fig 14b the isotopic signature of sulfate in the groundwater samples also implies that the group 2 wells in this study area are affected not only by seawater mixing but also by other geochemical processes fig 15 δ34sso4 values have been used to identify sources of so4 in saline groundwater kim et al 2003 and modern seawater has isotopic signatures close to 21 han et al 2011 in the study area water samples have isotope values ranging from 5 3 for background fresh water to 20 2 for seawater along with intermediate values depending on the mixing ratio fig 15 when the mixing ratio exceeded 6 5 group 1 i e gm4 5 the isotopic signature reached 19 2 close to the value of seawater however group 2 wells such as gm4 1 and 4 2 had isotopically highly depleted signatures ranging from 9 5 to 11 7 even with mixing ratios of 6 9 10 1 relative to the other wells regarding these depleted isotopic values barker et al 1998 reported that groundwater affected by gypsum dissolution had δ34sso4 values of 8 15 and karim and veizer 2000 also noted that river water affected by dissolution of gypsum and anhydrite had a δ34sso4 value of 10 4 consequently the isotopic depletion of δ34sso4 in the group 2 wells fig 15 with a slight decline of the si of gypsum fig 13 implies that the groundwaters of these wells are under the influence of the gypsum dissolution process at the fresh saline water transition boundary precipitation dissolution of minerals during swi in a fractured aquifer can affect the preferential flow paths in the fractured carbonate aquifer in salento southern italy precipitated gypsum demonstrates the feasibility of barriers to swi barcelona et al 2006 therefore hydrochemical processes such as gypsum precipitation and dissolution and their changes in time and space could play an important role in the safety of the underground lilrw disposal facility within the aquifer through the connection or blockage of preferential flow paths between fresh groundwater and seawater 4 conclusions in this paper we reported the results of hydrogeochemical monitoring at the underground lilrw disposal site of korea during the facility operation period along with results obtained previously during the construction period kim et al 2018 the fractured coastal aquifer where the site is located has been intruded by seawater due to groundwater discharge accompanying the construction of the facility based on the water quality and the stable isotopic signatures groundwater salinization dominantly driven by swi was identified along preferential flow paths developed in the fractured aquifer which subsequently caused significant spatiotemporal variation groundwater samples were divided into three groups based on the temporal changes in seawater mixing ratio group 1 wells showing a pattern of increasing mixing ratio with some delayed responses to swi are still undergoing an ion exchange process group 2 wells presented the decreased mixing ratio and the water type changed to na cl type following swi process and refreshing due to decreased groundwater discharge from the facility and following increased contribution of fresh groundwater during the process the increase of sulfate concentrations in group 2 wells implies that gypsum precipitation and redissolution occur in the transition zone this process was confirmed by the simultaneous increase in so4 and ca depletion of δ34sso4 and slight decline of the si of gypsum group 3 wells have been rapidly and directly affected by seawater since the start of construction of the lilrw disposal facility the chemical properties of groundwater in the fractured coastal aquifer with different seawater mixing ratios vary over time and space and that the changes could result in the precipitation dissolution of gypsum possibly altering the flow paths of the groundwater and directly affecting the safety of the underground lilrw disposal facility therefore to evaluate the hydrogeologic stability of the lilrw disposal facility and provide current information on groundwater system changes continuous monitoring of changes in swi and hydrochemical reactions depending on mixing ratios in the aquifer and subsequent changes in reactive mineral phases is warranted credit authorship contribution statement eunhye kwon investigation writing original
