6125,dramatic land clearing occurred in central queensland of australia in the 1960s 1980s and its impacts on streamflow are of great importance for regional water resources inventory and management paired catchment studies at the small scale around 10 20 ha have shown conclusively that clearing forests for agriculture has more than doubled the streamflow in the region two previous investigations at the large scale the comet basin with an area of 16 460 km2 have drawn quite different conclusions about the land clearing effect on streamflow varying from 40 increases in streamflow due to land clearing to all the changes in streamflow occurring as a result of climate variability to further examine the effect of land clearing on streamflow at the large scale in central queensland this study attempts to resolve the discrepancy of the two previous studies by applying the same set of methods double mass curves flow duration curves budyko framework tanh function and conceptual hydrologic model simhyd for three distinct periods namely pre clearing transitional and post clearing periods and for two neighbouring large basins the main conclusions of this study are 1 the effect of land clearing on streamflow of large basins in central queensland are unmistakably detectable 2 the impact of land clearing manifested itself mostly during wetter years or for wetter basins 3 for a given basin the greater the extent of land clearing the larger the effect on streamflow and 4 a lack of consistent conclusions about the land use change effect on streamflow at the large scale for this region and for several other large basins around the world are likely a result of the different methodologies used different contrasting periods and the differing effect on streamflow in relation to the underlying climate variability keywords land clearing streamflow hydrological response large scale central queensland 1 introduction the importance of forests is widely acknowledged for its essential role in water balance and carbon cycling the hydrological impact on streamflow and meteorological impact on rainfall of forests has been of a great concern and these have been debated among foresters engineers policy makers and scientists since antiquity andréassian 2004 forest systems containing the vegetation and soil serve as global c pools and are believed to be carbon sink or sources in the future dixon et al 1994 however forest cover originally occupying more than 40 of the earth s land surface has been reduced by one third with its most rapid decline since 1950 myers 1995 the most extensive decrease is found in tropical and temperate forested regions largely for agriculture development foley et al 2005 australia has seen deforestation of a similar magnitude 37 7 since european settlement late 18th century with a sharp decrease in forest cover from 30 5 to 19 over the period 1788 1995 bradshaw 2012 barson et al 2000 in queensland the latest hot spot of land clearing for australia deo 2011 large areas have been cleared within brigalow belt bioregion in central queensland since the 1960s during the period from 1960 to 1979 extensive land clearing occurred in central queensland mostly in the fitzroy basin area 142 500 km2 as a result of a government sponsored development scheme the brigalow development scheme verwey and cameron 2007 more than half of the basin around 79 800 km2 was cleared between 1960 and 1972 with the annual rate of over 6600 km2 yr or about 4 7 of the land area verwey and cameron 2007 land clearing in central queensland was so intensive and extensive that there have been a number of investigations into the effect of land use change on basin water balance at a range of spatial scales siriwardena et al 2006 peña arancibia et al 2012 cowie et al 2007 thornton et al 2007 yu et al 2013 extensive deforestation is believed to have profound impacts on local water balance in terms of a reduction in the surface aerodynamic roughness the leaf area and the shallower rooting depth and most importantly of a decrease in the regional rate of evapotranspiration which can directly and indirectly contribute to an increase of long term streamflow costa and foley 1997 zhang et al 2001 costa 2003 to illustrate and quantify the impacts of deforestation on streamflow considerable efforts have been made during the past century

speaking the evidence is quite conclusive for small basins areas 1000 km2 that deforestation can increase water yield e g annual streamflow hibbert 1967 bosch and hewlett 1982 keppeler and ziemer 1990

discharge and of 28 for wet season discharge as a result of 19 deforestation in the tocantins river basin area 175 360 km2 costa 2003 but no systematic changes in streamflow are detected for the pasak river basin in northern thailand area 14 500 km2 where around 50 the forest was cleared during the same period dyhr nielsen 1986 another basin of north eastern thailand upper nam pong basin area 12 100 km2 also experienced no widespread changes in rainfall or any other water related terms despite of a dramatic decrease in the forested area from 80 to 27 wilk et al 2001 similarly the inconclusive results were also obtained so far for the comet basin 16 440 km2 in central queensland australia siriwardena et al 2006 peña arancibia et al 2012 the earlier paper concluded that streamflow has increased by 40 due to land clearing siriwardena et al 2006 which is consistent with the results from small basins of 10 20 ha brigalow catchments study thornton et al 2007 the more recent paper peña arancibia et al 2012 however has mostly attributed the increase in annual streamflow over the post clearing period 1970 2007 to the higher than usual rainfall linked to the la niña condition in the wet 1970s while suggesting that changes in basin water balance since land clearing has been limited peña arancibia et al 2012 methodologies applied to evaluate the impact of deforestation on streamflow are different for large and small basins paired watershed experiments were commonly applied to reconstitute the streamflow of the treated basins as if no treatment had occurred to assess the impact of treatment by comparing the reconstituted with the observed streamflows andréassian 2004 despite of its popularity in water forest studies in relatively small scale basins amatya and

gottfried 1991 hawthorne et al 2013 hornbeck et al 1970 ide et al 2013 kabeya et al 2016 thornton et al 2007 paired watershed is rarely applicable and practical for large basins because of the limited availability of large reference basins for comparison hydrological models e g swat bieger et al 2015 chen et al 2005 ma et al 2009 hbv and simhyd wilk et al 2001 gallart et al 2011 siriwardena et al 2006 carvalho santos et al 2016 beck et al 2013 are often combined with statistical analysis e g mann kendall t test and flow duration curve for both small and large basins close examination of the two previous studies indicates that 1 slightly different periods were used to quantify the changes in streamflow of the comet river basin in central queensland and 2 two completely separate sets of methods were used in two previous studies siriwardena et al 2006 peña arancibia et al 2012 the inconclusive and somewhat incompatible results of the two previous studies for the same comet basin siriwardena et al 2006 peña arancibia et al 2012 motivated the investigation into important research questions such as how land clearing affects water balance at the large scale for better informing water resources management strategies how much of the change in streamflow had occurred because of climate variability and to what extent their disparate conclusions about changes in streamflow have depended on the particular methods used and the set of periods selected for comparison purposes for this study methods as applied in the two previous papers will be used for carefully selected contrasting periods to examine consistently the effect of climate variability and land clearing on basin water balance the overall aim of this study is to quantify the impact of land clearing on streamflow in large basins in central queensland to achieve this aim two neighbouring basins the comet basin and the upper dawson basin that are similar in size land clearing history and recording periods were considered in this study a much longer period of record updated to september 2018 was used to better represent the climate variability more detailed information on forest clearing was collected to delineate various periods of forest cover change for each basin three specific objectives of this study are 1 to define and reconstruct a chronology of different periods of forest cover change for both basins 2 to determine the effect of land clearing on streamflow using a variety of methods applicable at different time scales 3 to isolate and separate the effect of land clearing on streamflow in the context of climate variability in central queensland australia 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the comet and dawson rivers are major tributaries of the fitzroy river the fitzroy is the largest catchment area 142 500 km2 along the east coast of australia fitzroy basin association https www fba org au in central queensland to the north of roma and to the south of mackay fig 1 a the comet basin and the upper dawson basin are neighbouring basins of a similar size 16 460 km2 and 15 580 km2 respectively located in the southern part of the fitzroy basin fig 1 a the comet basin has an elevation range of 144 1243 m a m s l with the mean of 336 m based on 1 s strm wilson et al 2011 and that for the upper dawson basin is 183 939 m averaging 362 m the climate for both basins is dry sub humid peel et al 2007 with around 70 rainfall occurring in november to april 2 2 climate land use and streamflow data mean annual rainfall map of the two basins was mapped as fig 2 a d based on gridded daily rainfall data at 0 05 degree resolution known as silo the silo rainfall data product was produced by spatially interpolating ground based observations qdnrm queensland department of natural resources and mines https silo longpaddock qld gov au jeffrey et al 2001 the same rainfall data set was also obtained and used for the two previous papers briefly the hilly area in the east and southwest of the comet basin received a higher rainfall mostly 650 mm yr than the rest of the area the upper dawson is drier than the comet on the whole with 54 of the area receiving rainfall 600 mm per year and only 16 650 mm yr for the period of 1920 1949 comparing the map mapping of 1920 1949 and 1989 2018 of the comet it is noted that area receiving annual rainfall 700 mm has increased from 9 1920 1949 to 19 for the period of 1989 2018 even though the north eastern part of the basin receives less rainfall compared to the comet the upper dawson is becoming drier recently with the 76 of the basin receiving an annual rainfall 600 mm for the period 1989 2018 there were slight differences in the potential evapotranspiration pet used in the previous two papers as siriwardena et al 2006 collected the mean monthly pet produced by cooperative research centre crc for catchment hydrology and the bureau of meteorology and estimated daily values by dividing the monthly pet with the number of days in that month peña arancibia et al 2012 used silo daily morton s wet environment areal evapotranspiration https silo longpaddock qld gov au gridded data which was also applied in this study overall the mean daily pet averaging over the period of 1889 2018 is 6 0 mm based on bom siriwardena et al 2006 or 28 higher than that of silo 4 7 mm peña arancibia et al 2012 and this study daily streamflow in mega litres ml was provided by queensland department of environment and resource management derm and available from water monitoring information portal https water monitoring information qld gov au as summarised in table 1 the streamflow of the comet basin has been recorded at 3 gauging stations gauging station 130501a covered the period from august 1919 to october 1973 before the station was relocated 6 4 km upstream and recoded as 130504a operating from august 1971 to january 2004 since june 2002 the station 130504b which was moved back to the original site has been in operation since the consistency of flow data was checked and described by two previous studies the relocation of the station resulted in minimum difference 40 km2 0 3 of the whole basin in gauging area further test was also carried out in this study by comparing the monthly streamflow for overlapping periods i e august 1971 to october 1973 for 130501a and 130504a june 2002 to december 2003 for 130504a and 130504b monthly streamflow matched well during the overlapping periods for both paired stations over the last 8 months for the two overlapping periods there was a minimal difference in the average monthly streamflow recorded at 130501a and 130504a with 12 787 ml and 12 943 ml respectively and the difference between 130504a 504 ml and 130504b 463 ml was less than 7 thus to have continuous time series of flow data records from older stations were selected where there was an overlap of two stations the gauging station on the upper dawson 130302a located nearly a small country town taroom has kept a continuous record of streamflow since january 1911 to be comparable with daily rainfall mm daily streamflow ml was divided by the basin area to obtain the streamflow depth in mm namely the runoff depth over the whole basin daily rainfall streamflow was accumulated as monthly and annual october september totals the forest dataset 2013 was available from australian bureau of agriculture and resource economics and sciences abares showing forest cover according to forest types https data gov au dataset forests of australia 2013 in this study all types of forests were accumulated as forest and the other area as non forest as mapped in fig 1 b c the remanent forest is mainly located in the hilly areas i e the northwest of the upper dawson and along the southwest and east drainage divide of the comet the detailed changes in forest cover was determined using satellite imagery since 1988 known as slats statewide landcover and trees survey time series of losses of forest cover were reported for 1988 1991 1991 1995 1995 1997 1997 1999 and each year for the period of 1999 2018 https data qld gov au dataset statewide landcover and trees study queensland series within the the basins forest loss in km2 was calculated for each year s using slats dataset and the forest cover in 2013 was taken as the baseline to reconstruct the forest cover change over time for each basin in addition arcgis was used to determine whether the forest loss was due to fresh clearing forest cleared for the first time or re clearing because the remaining forest cover of the basin could be underestimated if re cleared area was considered incorrectly as freshly cleared areas forest cover of the two basins before 1960 was determined based on verwey and cameron 2007 in which the re regional ecosystem pre clearing vegetation layer was represented fig a1 as the re pre clearing vegetation layer was obtained from the 1960 s aerial photograph the forest cover summarized from that layer was regarded as the forest cover of 1960 assuming limited clearing before 1960 a constant clearing rate was assumed for 1960 1989 for a lack of additional information during this transitional period 3 methodology various methods were used in the two previous studies but no common method has been applied in both to get rid of the non controlling situation of concluding discrepant results by using different methods on different periods as what has been drawn by previous two papers this study will use the methods already applied and verified in those two papers for selected periods in all two statistical technologies namely double mass curve and flow duration curve and 3 hydrological models at different temporal scales i e budyko annual average tanh function annual and simhyd daily will be applied for this study 3 1 double mass curve flow duration curve the double mass curve is commonly used to show accumulation of one variable e g precipitation against that of another variable over the same period searcy and hardison 1960 if the two variables are proportional a straight line would appear with a constant slope a break in the slope would imply a change in the proportionality between the two variables and the difference in the slope on either side of the break would indicate the magnitude of the change in the relationship between the two variables searcy and hardison 1960 the double mass curve method has been applied in the two previous studies for the relationship between cumulative rainfall and streamflow peña arancibia et al 2012 and for the observed and simulated streamflow siriwardena et al 2006 in this study this method was applied to illustrate the changes in rainfall streamflow relationship for different time periods by plotting cumulative rainfall against that of streamflow and comparing the slopes of rainfall streamflow relationship for each time period in addition to quantify the change in streamflow due to land clearing the rainfall streamflow relationship for the pre clearing period was applied to estimate the streamflow for the post clearing period as if no clearing had occurred and the difference between observed and estimated streamflow is taken to indicate the effect of land clearing on streamflow for these large basins the flow duration curve is the integral of the frequency diagram or the histogram showing the percentage of time during which a specified discharge is equalled or exceeded over a given period searcy 1959 this method is thought to provide a convenient way of representing the characteristics of streams and comparing one basin with another searcy 1959 this method has been used in previous study siriwardena et al 2006 to show the difference in rainfall and streamflow between the pre and post clearing periods in this study flow duration curves were applied to represent the difference in daily rainfall and streamflow patterns for different periods and further to quantify the changes in streamflow with respect to the pre clearing period due to land clearing in comparison to changes in rainfall 3 2 budyko framework at the long term scale the mean annual actual evapotranspiration et and streamflow q for a basin is believed to be controlled by the available water rainfall amount p and the energy represented by potential evapotranspiration pet budyko 1974 consequently a hypothesis can be expressed as 1 et p f pet p c where the parameter c indicates the characteristics of individual basins and et p q over a long period of time as the change in moisture in store is assumed to be zero a number of budyko functions were developed based on this theory including fu s equation f 1 1 ω 1 ω fu 1981 zhang et al 2004 zhang s equation f 1 w 1 w 1 zhang et al 2001 mezentsev choudhury yang s equation f 1 1 n 1 1 n choudhury 1999 yang et al 2008 and wang and tang s equation f 1 1 4 2 2 2 wang and tang 2014 for the budyko functions above indicates the aridity index pet p and f the fitting result et p the parameters ω w n and are related to the basin characteristics i e vegetation type soil properties and topographical characteristics zhang et al 2001 potter et al 2005 ma et al 2008 roderick and farquhar 2011 zhang et al 2016 to be consistent with the previous work where the budyko function was used to evaluate the effect of land use change on streamflow peña arancibia et al 2012 fu s equation was selected for this study and which can be written as 2 et p 1 pet p 1 pet p ω 1 ω ω 0 where a higher value of ω would indicate that the basins favour evapotranspiration zhang et al 2004 climate elasticity was combined with the budyko framework to separate the effects of climate variability and human activity forest clearing on streamflow according to schaake 1990 the change in streamflow due to climate variability could be expressed as 3 dq c q p d p q p e t d p e t where q p is related to the equation applied to calculate actual evaporation streamflow then according to the climate elasticity of runoff ε p q q p p and ε pet q q p e t p e t the equation can be rewritten as 4 δ q c ε p δ p p ε p e t δ p e t p e t q where δ q c indicates the change in streamflow due to climate change and ε p and ε pet are elasticity coefficients of streamflow with respect to p precipitation and pet potential evapotranspiration the change in streamflow due to human activity δ q h can be calculated as the difference between the total change in streamflow and that attributed to climate variations 5 δ q h δ q δ q c where δ q is the total change in streamflow then the eq 4 can be applied in the budyko equation in the finite difference form 6 δ q c q p δ p q p e t δ pet where 7 q p p ω 1 pet ω p ω 1 ω 1 8 q p e t pet ω 1 pet ω p ω 1 ω 1 1 in eqs 6 8 p mm indicates the mean annual rainfall amount and pet mm the mean annual potential evapotranspiration it should be noted that eq 6 is the first order approximation of the taylor expansion for the change in streamflow q due to changes in p and pet and uncertainties are introduced when eq 6 is used to evaluate climate related changes in streamflow yang et al 2014 peña arancibia et al 2012 has calibrated the parameter ω values for different intervals of each period i e 1920 1953 as the pre clearing period and 1970 2007 1979 2007 as post clearing periods before taking the averaged ω within the period to represent the overall condition and then compared the ω values to show the changes in streamflow due to land clearing in this study the value of the parameter ω for each period of land clearing with different forest clearing and forest cover conditions was calculated by solving eq 2 with the mean annual rainfall streamflow and the potential evapotranspiration as the other factors e g soil properties and topographical characteristics are assumed to be the same for a specified basin changes in the value of ω were mainly attributed to vegetation alteration thus comparison of ω values for different periods can be made to determine how the vegetation change forest clearing has affected streamflow of the basin the changes in the long term mean annual rainfall the potential evapotranspiration and streamflow would be obtained based on data of non clearing period and then applied in eqs 5 8 to quantify the effect of land clearing on streamflow to show the changes in streamflow due to human activities the human induced change in streamflow δ q h was divided by the difference between the observed streamflow and the effect of human activities for the post treatment period i e δ q h for the purpose of comparison mezentsev choudhury yang s equation choudhury 1999 yang et al 2008 9 et p pet p n 1 1 n n 0 was also used in a similar fashion following eqs 3 5 to quantitatively separate the effects of climate and human activities as the ratio of et over p is obtained from the mean annual rainfall and streamflow over a long period the uncertainty in the ratio can be represented by its standard deviation std the approximate variance of the ratio var was calculated as follows seltman 2012 10 v a r et p μ et 2 μ p 2 σ et 2 μ et 2 σ p 2 μ p 2 2 c o v et p μ et μ p where μ et and σ et 2 indicate the mean and variance of et respectively and similarly for p c o v et p is the covariance of et and p as the data were prepared annually i e annual rainfall p annual potential evapotranspiration pet and annual actual evapotranspiration et it should be noted that σ et 2 can be evaluated as 11 σ et 2 1 n σ et 2 where σ et 2 indicates the variance of et annual actual evapotranspiration obtained by subtracting annual streamflow from annual rainfall and c o v et p is obtained as 12 c o v et p 1 n c o v e t p and the μ et is the same as μ et and n the number of years 3 3 tanh function for the annual rainfall streamflow relationship siriwardena et al 2006 has modelled the non linear relationship between annual rainfall p and annual streamflow q by using the tanh function boughton 1966 grayson 1996 expressed as 13 q p l f t a n h p l f where l mm indicates the notional loss and f the shape parameter in this study eq 13 was also applied to fit the observed annual rainfall streamflow relationship the parameter values for l and f were calibrated with nonlinear fitting tool in matlab and least squares calibration method was applied using annual rainfall and streamflow from the pre clearing period and the parameter values were fixed and applied to estimate the streamflow for the periods with clearing had clearing not occurred the 95 prediction interval was also obtained by using nlpredci tool in matlab to show the uncertainty of the nonlinear fitting then the difference between the observed and estimated streamflow can be used to indicate the change in streamflow as a result of land clearing 3 4 simhyd simhyd as applied by siriwardena et al 2006 to detect the effect of land clearing on streamflow for large basin the comet in central queensland is a lumped hydrological model developed in australia and one of the models in rainfall runoff library for runoff simulation at the daily or monthly scale rrl1 0 podger 2003 simhyd has been widely applied in australia for simulating streamflow boughton and chiew 2003 chiew et al 2002a b zhang and chiew 2009 and to evaluate hydrological sensitivity to climate change jones et al 2006 simhyd was also applied to separate the effects of climate change and human activities and to predict streamflow of ungauged basins in china liang et al 2013 wang et al 2008 zhang et al 2008 zeng et al 2014 the structure and parameters of the model were described in detail in siriwardena et al 2006 and in the user guide of rrl1 0 podger 2003 the simhyd model has 8 parameters in total for non urbanised basins rrl1 0 podger 2003 for this study the pervious fraction was fixed as 1 and the other 7 parameters i e interception store capacity surface store capacity infiltration coefficient infiltration shape interflow coefficient recharge coefficient and baseflow coefficient were calibrated simhyd was calibrated and model parameters were estimated by minimizing the sum of squared errors sse 14 sse y i y i 2 where y i indicates the observed streamflow and y i the simulated streamflow the objective function i e sse could be computed using daily monthly or annual streamflow as simhyd can only be calibrated at daily or monthly scale in the rrl simhyd was re coded to accumulate to annual totals and a model independent parameter estimation package known as pest doherty 2011 was used for parameter estimation nash sutcliff coefficient nsc was also used to evaluate the model performance 15 nsc 1 y i y i y i y i where y i indicates the mean of annual streamflow parameter values were obtained based on the data of the pre clearing period 30 years of which the earlier 60 i e 18 years was applied for calibration and the rest 40 i e 12 years for validation then the parameter set was applied to simulate streamflow for transitional and post clearing periods as the baseline of no land clearing occurring comparison was made between simulated streamflow and observed streamflow to indicate the effect of land clearing on streamflow 4 results time series of forest cover for both basins were interpreted and presented in section 4 1 and the 3 periods of forest clearing namely pre clearing transitional and post clearing periods were identified based on the rate of forest cover change comparisons of rainfall streamflow and potential evapotranspiration for different periods were made to show how these have changed over time 4 2 results of statistical data analysis double mass and flow duration curves were presented in section 4 2 followed by applications of hydrological models at different time scales mean annual the budyko framework in section 4 3 annual tanh function in section 4 4 and daily simhyd in section 4 5 4 1 land clearing history forest cover was as high as 88 7 for the comet basin and 100 for the upper dawson basin based on a pre clearing vegetation map in the 1960s see fig a1 digitised map from verwey and cameron 2007 the total area covered with forest accounted for 39 4 of the comet basin and 30 3 for the upper dawson basin based on the forest cover map in 2013 fig 1 b c indicating considerable deforestation in this region the area of deforestation according to slats for the two basins since 1988 are summarized in table a1 presenting newly cleared areas and re cleared areas in separate columns only the newly cleared area was included to re construct the forest cover change history in total the re cleared area accounted for around 12 of the total cleared areas the sum of new cleared and re cleared during 1989 2018 the two basins shared a similar pattern of land clearing 1 extensive clearing occurred during the period 1988 2000 with the average clearing rates as high as 123 6 km2 yr for the comet and 80 1 km2 yr for the upper dawson 2 clearing was limited after 2000 while a small peak was seen in 2003 2005 probably caused by extensive re clearing 3 an increasing trending was detected in re clearing over recent years in summary 12 2 of the basin area was cleared for the comet and 10 0 for the upper dawson since 1988 time series of non forest cover 1 forest cover for the two basins are shown in fig 3 as limited information could be collected for the highest clearing rate period 1960 1989 a constant clearing rate assumption was made for that period in all the upper dawson has larger changes in forest cover than the comet does as around 70 of forest was cleared for the upper dawson decreasing from 100 to 30 and 50 lost for the comet from 89 to 39 while it is common to both basins that the most extensive land clearing occurred in the period 1960 1989 as a result three periods 30 years for each would be taken into account in terms of land clearing rates and remaining forested areas for the two basins pre clearing period 1920 1949 with the majority of the basins 90 and 100 covered with forest transitional period 1960 1989 with high clearing rates and post clearing period 1989 2018 with less than half 30 and 40 remnant forest and a slightly lower clearing rate 4 2 streamflow characteristics at different periods of land clearing time series of annual rainfall and streamflow for the period 1920 2018 of the two basins are presented in fig 4 a b annual rainfall showed highly inter annual variability for both basins with a wide range of 230 1257 mm for the comet and of 280 1095 mm for the upper dawson for the comet the 1950s the 1970s and the early 2010s were relatively wet periods indicated by both the amount of annual rainfall and streamflow similar pattern could be found for the upper dawson except that no sign of the wet 1970s was noted compared with the pre and post clearing periods defined by two previous papers presented in fig 4 a the three periods of different land clearing in this study presented in fig 4 b were more carefully determined and covering longer periods to better represent the climate variability the mean and coefficient of variation cv of annual rainfall streamflow and potential evapotranspiration within each period for both basins are summarized in table 2 for both basins potential evapotranspiration is the least variable and streamflow is the most variable for all 3 periods it is also common for the two basins that the rainfall and streamflow of post clearing period 1989 2018 were more variable than the other two periods the transitional period was the wettest with 7 5 4 3 more rainfall than the pre clearing period for the comet upper dawson basin rainfall has increased by 2 for post clearing period for the comet while decreased by 2 for the upper dawson despite of different patterns in rainfall change over time runoff coefficient of both basins kept increasing from 0 023 to 0 049 for the comet and from 0 031 to 0 046 for the upper dawson which was probably more attributed to the increase in streamflow double mass curves based on cumulative annual rainfall and annual streamflow are presented in fig 5 for the two basins slopes from linear regression between rainfall and streamflow show changes in the rainfall streamflow relationship fig 5 and a higher slope indicates more streamflow generated given the same amount of rainfall in all the slope of the regression line for post clearing period 0 054 0 004 was more than doubled of that for the pre clearing period 0 022 0 001 for the comet and an increase of 44 0 033 to 0 048 was also detected for the upper dawson this conclusion was consistent with the increases in the volumetric runoff coefficient table 2 applying the relationship linear equation for the pre clearing period to other two periods as if no clearing had occurred the difference between the observed and simulated streamflow for the transitional and post clearing periods would represent the changes in rainfall streamflow relationship due to land use change for the comet the totally observed streamflow for the transitional period was 747 5 mm over the 30 years or 65 higher than the expected streamflow of 452 9 mm without land clearing the post clearing period experienced a greater difference 119 between the observed 937 9 mm and expected 428 3 mm streamflow this indicates that the streamflow has increased by 65 and 119 due to land clearing for the transitional and post clearing period respectively for the comet assuming that the rainfall streamflow relationship remains unchanged for the upper dawson the transitional period showed no obvious changes in rainfall streamflow relationship compared with the pre clearing period and during the post clearing period the observed streamflow was 38 higher than the expected if no land clearing had occurred the duration curves for daily rainfall and streamflow for the three contrasting periods are presented in fig 6 a b it can be seen that the difference in daily rainfall and streamflow of different periods mainly occurred on relatively wet days the wettest 328 days of each of the 30 year period or an exceedance probability 3 contributed around 50 of the total rainfall and 80 of the total streamflow for all three periods and for both basins to better represent the difference the total rainfall and streamflow with an exceedance probability 3 for each period is shown in fig 7 and the rainfall and streamflow for the transitional and post clearing periods were compared with those during the pre clearing period for both basins fig 7 a b for the comet streamflow has increased by 69 for the transitional period and by 124 for the post clearing period with little changes in rainfall 4 for the upper dawson the change in streamflow was small for the transitional period while for the post clearing period the streamflow on the wettest days has increased by around 50 with only a 6 increase in rainfall and the total increase of 247 mm in streamflow was contributed mostly 76 by the wettest 76 days exceedance probability 0 7 of which 41 of the 76 days occurred in 2010 and 2011 the total streamflow on wetter days has increased considerably especially for both transitional and post clearing periods of the comet while rainfall total on these wettest days exceedance probability 3 showed minimal change 4 for the upper dawson large increase around 50 in streamflow was noted for the post clearing period although the change 8 during the transitional period was limited relative to the pre clearing period 4 3 mean annual streamflow based on budyko framework budyko curves for all 3 periods are shown in fig 8 a b based on different ω values for both basins the error bars show 1 standard deviation of the et p ratio generally speaking the vertical distance between different curves at the same pet p indicates the changes in ω representing basin characteristics including vegetation type cover soil properties and topography while the shifts along one specific curve should be induced only by the change of et p jiang et al 2015 the mean annual values for each period indicated by the dots with the error bars show that the climate has experienced considerable variability over the past 90 years for these two basins for the comet the pre clearing period was quite dry with the aridity index pet p as high as 2 80 and then it became much wetter the transitional period with the aridity index around 2 45 before another relatively dry period 1989 2018 occurred again aridity index 2 64 the upper dawson had similar pattern in climate variability as the comet but was even drier with a higher aridity index for all 3 periods especially for the post clearing period 1989 2018 different budyko curves were obtained due to different ω values from which the effect of land clearing can be inferred for the comet the ω value for the pre clearing period was higher than those of the transitional and the post clearing periods indicating that the basin favoured evapotranspiration during the pre clearing period it is also noted that the budyko curve for the transitional period ω 3 30 rather than the post clearing curve ω 2 97 is closer to pre clearing curve ω 3 46 indicating that the impact of land clearing increased as more area was cleared however the results for the upper dawson fig 8 b were not as conclusive because no sign of increase even a slight decrease in streamflow was detected for the transitional period the impact of clearing on streamflow is more pronounced for the post clearing period of the upper dawson as the ω value for the post clearing period has decreased to 2 92 from 3 20 for the pre clearing period the error bar 1 standard deviation of each dot was plotted as a result of variation of the mean in annual rainfall streamflow and pet within 30 years for each period from the results of the comet fig 8 a the curves for the pre clearing and transitional periods were statistically the same and both were different from that for post clearing period given 1 standard deviation which indicates transitional period has seen insignificantly decreased evaporation while post clearing has seen a significantly different evaporation condition of the basin from the other two periods with more forest areas cleared again this conclusion is not applicable for the upper dawson the evaporation of the basin has significantly changed for post clearing period compared with transitional period while the evaporating rate of the pre clearing period was somehow between the other two fig 8 b the mean annual rainfall potential evapotranspiration of transitional period 1960 1989 and post clearing period 1989 2018 were compared with those of the pre clearing period 1920 1949 to detect how much the variabilities in climate have contributed to the total change in streamflow using eqs 6 9 and then the effect of land clearing on streamflow was separated from that of climate variability table 3 according to the results of fu s equation it is evident for the comet that land clearing has increased streamflow and has contributed 50 of the increase in streamflow for transitional period and contributed 87 of streamflow increase for post clearing period conclusion for the upper dawson is not so clear because it is shown that land clearing has decreased annual streamflow by 3 mm for transitional period even though all the streamflow increase 8 3 mm for post clearing period was attributed to land clearing the results drawn from mezentsev choudhury yang s equation was consistent with those from fu s equation for both scenarios of two basins with only minor differences 4 4 annual streamflow using the tanh function by applying the tanh function the relationship between the observed annual rainfall and streamflow for different periods pre clearing transitional and post clearing periods was plotted against the fitting curve calibrated with the pre clearing period and the 95 prediction interval are also shown fig 9 a 10 a the residuals observed streamflow predicted streamflow of each year were also represented with the mean of each period figs 9 b 10 b for both basins tanh function had a good calibration of the pre clearing period with the averaged error close to 0 fig 9 b 10 b the basic conclusion for the comet is that land clearing had increased streamflow especially for the relatively wetter years with annual rainfall 800 mm figs 9 a 10 a for the comet streamflow in wetter years annual rainfall 800 mm has on average increased by 92 for the transitional period and by 165 for the post clearing period due to land clearing increases in streamflow 8 and 43 respectively for the transitional and post clearing period are also detected in relatively drier years annual rainfall 800 mm for the upper dawson although land clearing has increased streamflow in wetter years by 36 for the transitional period and 100 for the post clearing period no signs of increase in streamflow in drier years were detected the mean residual of the transitional period is 7 3 mm and 0 7 mm for the comet and the upper dawson respectively fig 9 b 10 b indicating that annual streamflow has increased by 7 3 mm for the comet and decreased by 0 7 mm for the upper dawson due to land clearing for this period meanwhile the average residual of post clearing period is 15 4 mm for the comet and 8 0 mm for the upper dawson fig 9 b 10 b showing annual streamflow has increased 15 4 8 0 mm for the comet upper dawson because of land clearing 4 5 water balance assessment using daily hydrological model simhyd for both basins simhyd was calibrated annually with data for the pre clearing period and applied for the transitional and post clearing periods and the simulated annual streamflow for different periods was plotted against the observed in fig 11 when calibrated the model performance was acceptable with the nash sutcliff coefficient of 0 87 for the comet and 0 77 for the upper dawson and a slight reduction in the coefficient 0 72 for the comet and 0 65 for the upper dawson for the validation period an underestimation of high annual streamflow was detected for the comet when simulating the streamflow for the transitional and post clearing periods showing that considerable increase in streamflow could be attributed to land clearing for high streamflow years with annual streamflow exceeding 50 mm which is also the case for the upper dawson during the post clearing period it seems that the model calibrated with the pre clearing period performed well for the transitional period for the upper dawson indicating limited changes in the rainfall streamflow relationship for both basins overestimation was noted for relatively lower streamflow 25 mm for all three contrasting periods this could be a result of the objective function selected for calibration when wet years were given greater weights than dry years with low streamflows on the other hand this could also indicate reduced effect of land clearing on streamflow generation for dry years with relatively low streamflow the difference between the observed and predicted streamflow using simhyd indicated that the annual streamflow has increased by 21 for the transitional period and by 42 for the post clearing period due to land clearing for the comet for the upper dawson an increase of 14 in annual streamflow was detected for the post clearing period and a slight increase 5 for the transitional period for a summary of the effect of land clearing on streamflow for these large basins the magnitude and direction of change in streamflow are collated together in table 4 for all the 5 methods for the 3 contrasting periods and for the two basins in central queensland all the results are presented in terms of the change in streamflow relative to that for the reference or the pre clearing periods the changes in the streamflow are presented by comparing the observed and the simulated using the parameters calibrated with data for the pre clearing periods for the double mass tanh function and simhyd as for the budyko framework the observed streamflow minus qh was taken as the streamflow if no land clearing had occurred the change in streamflow using the flow duration curve only focused on the wettest 328 days or an exceedance probability of 3 for which the change in streamflow mostly occurred the change in rainfall is also included in table 4 as a reference to indicate the climate variability fairly consistent conclusion can be drawn for the comet based on these results using 5 separate methods that land clearing has led to an increase in streamflow for both the transitional and post clearing periods and the increase is greater for the post clearing period than the transitional period it is also clear that for the upper dawson the streamflow has increased due to land clearing for the post clearing period while results for the transitional period are not as clear and conclusive the magnitude of the increases in streamflow derived from the double mass flow duration curve budyko and tanh functions is also consistent for the post clearing period for both basins streamflow for the comet is nearly doubled and the increase for the upper dawson was around 40 simhyd results showed a much lower increase in streamflow with about 35 of what was indicated the other 4 methods simhyd has simulated a much larger amount of streamflow for the wettest year 2011 than that estimated using all other methods this over estimation for wet years may have attributed to a lower magnitude of change in streamflow as a result of land clearing during the post clearing period 5 discussion siriwardena et al 2006 showed that the streamflow has increased as a result of land clearing in the comet basin while peña arancibia et al 2012 indicated that the land clearing induced increase in streamflow is minimal and most of the changes in streamflow can be attributed to climate variability for the region these somewhat inconsistent conclusions of these two previous studies require further discussion about the role of land clearing and associated hydrologic responses for large basins in central queensland of australia according to the earlier study by siriwardena et al 2006 deforestation from 83 to 38 has increased streamflow by approximately 40 for the comet basin during 1971 2000 however peña arancibia et al 2012 attributed most of the change in the observed streamflow to increases in rainfall associated with a series of la niña events in the 1970s and only a very small increase 0 001 could be detected and attributed to land clearing for the comet basin for 1979 2007 no direct comparison even for the same basin could be made of the two studies because neither the methods nor the periods pre and post clearing were identical consequently a combination of different methods most of which were used in the previous two papers was adopted in this study and three distinct periods i e pre clearing transitional and post clearing periods were defined based on a detailed forest cover change history in addition to the comet a neighbouring basin the upper dawson with similar soil vegetation basin area and clearing history was included in the study to provide another line of evidence to test the change in hydrologic response to large scale land clearing in central queensland all things considered the impact of land clearing on streamflow for large basins in central queensland evaluated in this study was not as large as that detected by siriwardena et al 2006 and the increase in streamflow due to land clearing was more pronounced for wetter years with annual rainfall exceeding 800 mm and the impact was limited for drier years the increase in streamflow due to land clearing for these two large basins was not as negligible as presented in the work of peña arancibia et al 2012 as our conclusion about the increase in streamflow can be supported by a series of methods including empirical data analysis e g runoff coefficient and duration curves semi theoretical analysis i e budyko framework and tanh function and conceptual hydrological model such as simhyd our conclusion could also be strengthened by comparing the effect of land clearing on streamflow for two neighbouring basins the wet basin the comet with the mean annual rainfall of 646 mm experienced greater increase in streamflow than the drier basins the upper dawson with the mean annual rainfall of 604 m table 4 shows that the increase in streamflow for the upper dawson even with a larger fractional area cleared fig 3 was not as large as that for the comet this could be attributed to the less rainfall received by the basin fig 2 and table 2 the increase in streamflow due to land clearing was more easily detectable for wetter years and for wetter basins the difference in hydrological responses to land clearing between the two basins was further investigated by comparing the spatiotemporal distribution of rainfall and basin topography to characterise the rainfall distribution annual rainfall for each grid cell 28 km2 in size for the period from 1920 to 2018 were used to produce the cumulative distribution of annual rainfall for the two basins fig 12 a the comet has a relatively larger area receiving higher rainfall than the upper dawson does if the annual rainfall of 800 mm was taken as a meaningful threshold above which the increase in streamflow due to land clearing was more pronounced fig 9 on average around 20 of the comet basin had annual rainfall above 800 mm while the fraction decreased to 13 for the upper dawson this partially explained why the upper dawson showed a weaker hydrological response to land clearing due to a lack of wetter areas with adequate annual rainfall in addition 30 m dem was used to generate the hypsometric curves for these two basins to indicate the difference in basin topography fig 12 b the hypsometric curves show that the comet has greater relief by comparison with 10 of the comet basin with elevation above 600 m while the upper dawson is flatter with less than 2 of the whole basin area with elevation higher than 600 m the lowest point of the two basins was nearly the same 144 m for the comet and 183 mm for the upper dawson the difference in topography provides corroborative evidence to support the observed contrast in rainfall distribution of the two basins and the differing hydrological response to land clearing between the two basins a number of methods were used in this study to isolate and quantify the impact of land clearing on basin hydrology different assumptions were made at different temporary scales for various methods to determine the effect either by deciding the elasticity of streamflow change to variations in climatic factors i e budyko framework or by extending the rainfall streamflow relationship of pre clearing period to post clearing period as if no land clearing had occurred i e double mass curves tanh function and simhyd in the long term the budyko framework allows prediction of the actual evaporation by coupling the water balance equation and two limitations of available energy and water at the annual scale linear and non linear relationships between rainfall and streamflow were assumed for double mass curves and the tanh function respectively at the daily scale rainfall and streamflow were considered to be correlated in the flow duration curve method and runoff generation process is simulated assuming a range of hydrological processes and associated parameters in simhyd there are limitations and uncertainties inherent in the methods used to evaluate the impact of land clearing on basin hydrology for example flow duration curves ignore soil moisture condition while high rainfall is assumed to bring about high streamflow the budyko framework ignores the variations in climatic factors at small temporary scales while focusing on to the long term water balance and constraints imposed by energy and water availability the relative error of about 5 in simulated qc using the budyko framework would be expected as a result of using the first order approximation eq 6 based on yang et al 2014 in addition the uncertainties in the estimated areal potential evapotranspiration and rainfall and the quality of streamflow data can also affect the accuracy of the results and the quality of the conclusions given the high inter annual variability in rainfall and the low mean annual streamflow in this relatively dry environment streamflow is particularly sensitive to variations in rainfall thus the magnitude of the effect of land clearing on streamflow in this environment may vary depending on the reference period and the method selected for evaluation it is therefore important to use different methods to provide multiple lines of evidence to quantify the changes in streamflow as a result of the large scale land clearing in this environment although undertaken at various temporal scales with different inputs all the 5 methods have led to similar and consistent conclusions as shown in table 4 that the streamflow has increased as a result of land clearing and that the larger the area cleared the larger the increase in streamflow while it is tempting to recommend a single method for quantifying the effect of land clearing on streamflow in this relative dry environment examining multiple lines of evidence using different methods at different time scales is much preferred given the unavoidable limitations and uncertainties no matter which method is used for basins in a dry environment with highly variable rainfall and streamflow daily conceptual hydrological models such as simhyd is better suited to capture the variations in rainfall at multiple time scales as the cost of setting up and running conceptual hydrological models is not much higher than using the methods involving aggregate flow and climate data these daily hydrologic models should be included to assess and quantify the changes in streamflow due to land clearing particularly in relatively dry environment peña arancibia et al 2012 largely attributed the increase in streamflow to the higher rainfall in the 1970s but did not attempt to relate the total change in streamflow into climate and land use factors in this study climate elasticity analysis was taken based on the budyko framework to quantify and we attributed the total change in streamflow to land clearing and climate variability our results showed that for the transitional period the wet 1970s were included for the comet basin the increase 47 0 mm in the mean annual rainfall only contributed about half of the increase 10 6 mm in the mean annual streamflow with the other half contributed by land clearing in addition the two previous studies excluded the 1950s citing that the 1950s were unusually wet siriwardena et al 2006 peña arancibia et al 2012 see also fig 5 in this study simhyd calibrated with data for the 1920 1949 period was applied to the comet basins for the wet 1950s it can be seen from fig 13 that simulated flows for the comet with simhyd were able to track the high flows of 1950s but failed to follow the observed flows for the wet 1970s and the early 2010s for this basin this further suggests that rainfall streamflow relationship has changed because of land clearing and the increase in streamflow occurred for a given amount of rainfall for these two large basins the budyko framework has been commonly used to separate the impact of climate variability and human activity on streamflow ma et al 2008 dong et al 2012 gao et al 2016 li et al 2007 liu et al 2009 roderick and farquhar 2011 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2008 zheng et al 2009 xu et al 2014 parameter values for ω in fu s equation were compiled from these previous studies to be consistent with this current study the ω values of the baseline period and the period when climate and or land use changes have occurred and the corresponding changes in the mean annual streamflow due to human activities i e δqh for these 88 basins are presented in table a2 the relationship between changes in the parameter ω for pre and post treatment periods δω and the corresponding δqh are plotted in fig 14 overall δω and δqh are negatively correlated r 0 67 for these 88 basins and an increase in ω is related to a decrease in streamflow and vice versa this observation is consistent with the statement that higher ω values indicate the basins in favour of evapotranspiration resulting in lower streamflow zhang et al 2004 much better linear fit was possible when all basins are classified according to ω values of the reference period or pre treatment period it can be concluded from fig 14 that 1 the linear relationship between δω and δqh is symmetric as δω can either be positive or negative 2 the larger the ω values the less sensitive of δqh to δω because the slope of the regression line decreases as the ω value increases 3 the relationship between δω and δqh is independent of climatic characteristics e g aridity index of the basin above all the human induced change in the mean annual streamflow can be directly estimated using the difference in the ω value between the pre and post treatment periods taking this study as an example each unit of decrease in ω value would lead to around 23 mm of increase in annual streamflow for basins with a ω value greater than 3 for the pre clearing period 6 conclusion both the comet and upper dawson basins shared the same pattern of land clearing and three distinct periods could be identified pre clearing period largely covered with forests 100 for the upper dawson and 89 for the comet before 1960 the transitional period extensively rapid period of land clearing from 1960 to 1989 when the forest cover was decreased to 49 for the comet and 38 for the upper dawson the post clearing period with a lower clearing rate since 1989 with only 11 and 10 of the whole area cleared respectively for the comet and upper dawson basins during the 30 years the increase in streamflow due to land clearing are evident in relatively wetter years than in drier years and it is also easier to be detected for wetter basins most of the increase in streamflow occurred within the wettest 328 days or with an exceedance probability of 3 of the 30 year period the increases in streamflow occurred mainly in years with the annual rainfall greater than 800 mm or when the annual streamflow greater than 50 mm the increase in streamflow was greater for the comet than the upper dawson because it is wetter although the extent of land clearing was slightly smaller in the comet than in the upper dawson for a given basin the greater the extent of land clearing the larger the increase in streamflow for the comet basin the increase in streamflow for the post clearing period 40 51 cleared was around double of that for the transitional period 0 40 cleared for the upper dawson basin 40 of the increase in streamflow was detected for the post clearing period while no sign of change in streamflow for the transitional period for previous studies at large scale in the region and for several large basins elsewhere in the world the conclusions regarding the effect of land use change on streamflow at the large scale are often inconsistent and occasionally contradictory this likely occurred because of different methods applied or different contrasting periods specified it is imperative to use several methods to provide multiple lines of evidence and take into account both the land use change as well as climate variability to isolate the impact of land use change on streamflow at the large scale declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix see fig a1 and tables a1 and a2 
6125,dramatic land clearing occurred in central queensland of australia in the 1960s 1980s and its impacts on streamflow are of great importance for regional water resources inventory and management paired catchment studies at the small scale around 10 20 ha have shown conclusively that clearing forests for agriculture has more than doubled the streamflow in the region two previous investigations at the large scale the comet basin with an area of 16 460 km2 have drawn quite different conclusions about the land clearing effect on streamflow varying from 40 increases in streamflow due to land clearing to all the changes in streamflow occurring as a result of climate variability to further examine the effect of land clearing on streamflow at the large scale in central queensland this study attempts to resolve the discrepancy of the two previous studies by applying the same set of methods double mass curves flow duration curves budyko framework tanh function and conceptual hydrologic model simhyd for three distinct periods namely pre clearing transitional and post clearing periods and for two neighbouring large basins the main conclusions of this study are 1 the effect of land clearing on streamflow of large basins in central queensland are unmistakably detectable 2 the impact of land clearing manifested itself mostly during wetter years or for wetter basins 3 for a given basin the greater the extent of land clearing the larger the effect on streamflow and 4 a lack of consistent conclusions about the land use change effect on streamflow at the large scale for this region and for several other large basins around the world are likely a result of the different methodologies used different contrasting periods and the differing effect on streamflow in relation to the underlying climate variability keywords land clearing streamflow hydrological response large scale central queensland 1 introduction the importance of forests is widely acknowledged for its essential role in water balance and carbon cycling the hydrological impact on streamflow and meteorological impact on rainfall of forests has been of a great concern and these have been debated among foresters engineers policy makers and scientists since antiquity andréassian 2004 forest systems containing the vegetation and soil serve as global c pools and are believed to be carbon sink or sources in the future dixon et al 1994 however forest cover originally occupying more than 40 of the earth s land surface has been reduced by one third with its most rapid decline since 1950 myers 1995 the most extensive decrease is found in tropical and temperate forested regions largely for agriculture development foley et al 2005 australia has seen deforestation of a similar magnitude 37 7

clearing for australia deo 2011 large areas have been cleared within brigalow belt bioregion in central queensland since the 1960s during the period from 1960 to 1979 extensive land clearing occurred in central queensland mostly in the fitzroy basin area 142 500 km2 as a result of a government sponsored development scheme the brigalow development scheme verwey and cameron 2007 more than half of the basin around 79 800 km2 was cleared between 1960 and 1972 with the annual rate of over 6600 km2 yr or about 4 7 of the land area verwey and cameron 2007 land clearing in central queensland was so intensive and extensive that there have been a number of investigations into the effect of land use change on basin water balance at a range of spatial scales siriwardena et al 2006 peña arancibia et al 2012 cowie et al 2007 thornton et al 2007 yu et al 2013 extensive deforestation is believed to have profound impacts on local water balance in terms of a reduction in the surface aerodynamic roughness the leaf area and the shallower rooting depth and most importantly of a decrease in the regional rate of evapotranspiration which can directly and indirectly contribute to an increase of long term streamflow costa and foley 1997 zhang et al 2001 costa 2003 to illustrate and quantify the impacts of deforestation on streamflow considerable efforts have been made during the past century

100 km2 also experienced no widespread changes in rainfall or any other water related terms despite of a dramatic decrease in the forested area from 80 to 27 wilk et al 2001 similarly the inconclusive results were also obtained so far for the comet basin 16 440 km2 in central queensland australia siriwardena et al 2006 peña arancibia et al 2012 the earlier paper concluded that streamflow has increased by 40 due to land clearing siriwardena et al 2006 which is consistent with the results from small basins of 10 20 ha brigalow catchments study thornton et al 2007 the more recent paper peña arancibia et al 2012 however has mostly attributed the increase in annual streamflow over the post clearing period 1970 2007 to the higher than usual rainfall linked to the la niña condition in the wet 1970s while suggesting that changes in basin water balance since land clearing has been limited peña arancibia et al 2012 methodologies applied to evaluate the impact of deforestation on streamflow are different for large and small basins paired watershed experiments were commonly applied to reconstitute the streamflow of the treated basins as if no treatment had occurred to assess

two previous studies indicates that 1 slightly different periods were used to quantify the changes in streamflow of the comet river basin in central queensland and 2 two completely separate sets of methods were used in two previous studies siriwardena et al 2006 peña arancibia et al 2012 the inconclusive and somewhat incompatible results of the two previous studies for the same comet basin siriwardena et al 2006 peña arancibia et al 2012 motivated the investigation into important research questions such as how land clearing affects water balance at the large scale for better informing water resources management strategies how much of the change in streamflow had occurred because of climate variability and to what extent their disparate conclusions about changes in streamflow have depended on the particular methods used and the set of periods selected for comparison purposes for this study methods as applied in the two previous papers will be used for carefully selected contrasting periods to examine consistently the effect of climate variability and land clearing on basin water balance the overall aim of this study is to quantify the impact of land clearing on streamflow in large basins in central queensland to achieve this aim two neighbouring basins the comet basin and the upper dawson basin that are similar in size land clearing history and recording periods were considered in this study a much longer period of record updated to september 2018 was used to better represent the climate variability more detailed information on forest clearing was collected to delineate various periods of forest cover change for each basin three specific objectives of this study are 1 to define and reconstruct a chronology of different periods of forest cover change for both basins 2 to determine the effect of land clearing on streamflow using a variety of methods applicable at different time scales 3 to isolate and separate the effect of land clearing on streamflow in the context of climate variability in central queensland australia 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the comet and dawson rivers are major tributaries of the fitzroy river the fitzroy is the largest catchment area 142 500 km2 along the east coast of australia fitzroy basin association https www fba org au in central queensland to the north of roma and to the south of mackay fig 1 a the comet basin and the upper dawson basin are neighbouring basins of a similar size 16 460 km2 and 15 580 km2 respectively located in the southern part of the fitzroy basin fig 1 a the comet basin has an elevation range of 144 1243 m a m s l with the mean of 336 m based on 1 s strm wilson et al 2011 and that for the upper dawson basin is 183 939 m averaging 362 m the climate for both basins is dry sub humid peel et al 2007 with around 70 rainfall occurring in november to april 2 2 climate land use and streamflow data mean annual rainfall map of the two basins was mapped as fig 2 a d based on gridded daily rainfall data at 0 05 degree resolution known as silo the silo rainfall data product was produced by spatially interpolating ground based observations qdnrm queensland department of natural resources and mines https silo longpaddock qld gov au jeffrey et al 2001 the same rainfall data set was also obtained and used for the two previous papers briefly the hilly area in the east and southwest of the comet basin received a higher rainfall mostly 650 mm yr than the rest of the area the upper dawson is drier than the comet on the whole with 54 of the area receiving rainfall 600 mm per year and only 16 650 mm yr for the period of 1920 1949 comparing the map mapping of 1920 1949 and 1989 2018 of the comet it is noted that area receiving annual rainfall 700 mm has increased from 9 1920 1949 to 19 for the period of 1989 2018 even though the north eastern part of the basin receives less rainfall compared to the comet the upper dawson is becoming drier recently with the 76 of the basin receiving an annual rainfall 600 mm for the period 1989 2018 there were slight differences in the potential evapotranspiration pet used in the previous two papers as siriwardena et al 2006 collected the mean monthly pet produced by cooperative research centre crc for catchment hydrology and the bureau of meteorology and estimated daily values by dividing the monthly pet with the number of days in that month peña arancibia et al 2012 used silo daily morton s wet environment areal evapotranspiration https silo longpaddock qld gov au gridded data which was also applied in this study overall the mean daily pet averaging over the period of 1889 2018 is 6 0 mm based on bom siriwardena et al 2006 or 28 higher than that of silo 4 7 mm peña arancibia et al 2012 and this study daily streamflow in mega litres ml was provided by queensland department of environment and resource management derm and available from water monitoring information portal https water monitoring information qld gov au as summarised in table 1 the streamflow of the comet basin has been recorded at 3 gauging stations gauging station 130501a covered the period from august 1919 to october 1973 before the station was relocated 6 4 km upstream and recoded as 130504a operating from august 1971 to january 2004 since june 2002 the station 130504b which was moved back to the original site has been in operation since the consistency of flow data was checked and described by two previous studies the relocation of the station resulted in minimum difference 40 km2 0 3 of the whole basin in gauging area further test was also carried out in this study by comparing the monthly streamflow for overlapping periods i e august 1971 to october 1973 for 130501a and 130504a june 2002 to december 2003 for 130504a and 130504b monthly streamflow matched well during the overlapping periods for both paired stations over the last 8 months for the two overlapping periods there was a minimal difference in the average monthly streamflow recorded at 130501a and 130504a with 12 787 ml and 12 943 ml respectively and the difference between 130504a 504 ml and 130504b 463 ml was less than 7 thus to have continuous time series of flow data records from older stations were selected where there was an overlap of two stations the gauging station on the upper dawson 130302a located nearly a small country town taroom has kept a continuous record of streamflow since january 1911 to be comparable with daily rainfall mm daily streamflow ml was divided by the basin area to obtain the streamflow depth in mm namely the runoff depth over the whole basin daily rainfall streamflow was accumulated as monthly and annual october september totals the forest dataset 2013 was available from australian bureau of agriculture and resource economics and sciences abares showing forest cover according to forest types https data gov au dataset forests of australia 2013 in this study all types of forests were accumulated as forest and the other area as non forest as mapped in fig 1 b c the remanent forest is mainly located in the hilly areas i e the northwest of the upper dawson and along the southwest and east drainage divide of the comet the detailed changes in forest cover was determined using satellite imagery since 1988 known as slats statewide landcover and trees survey time series of losses of forest cover were reported for 1988 1991 1991 1995 1995 1997 1997 1999 and each year for the period of 1999 2018 https data qld gov au dataset statewide landcover and trees study queensland series within the the basins forest loss in km2 was calculated for each year s using slats dataset and the forest cover in 2013 was taken as the baseline to reconstruct the forest cover change over time for each basin in addition arcgis was used to determine whether the forest loss was due to fresh clearing forest cleared for the first time or re clearing because the remaining forest cover of the basin could be underestimated if re cleared area was considered incorrectly as freshly cleared areas forest cover of the two basins before 1960 was determined based on verwey and cameron 2007 in which the re regional ecosystem pre clearing vegetation layer was represented fig a1 as the re pre clearing vegetation layer was obtained from the 1960 s aerial photograph the forest cover summarized from that layer was regarded as the forest cover of 1960 assuming limited clearing before 1960 a constant clearing rate was assumed for 1960 1989 for a lack of additional information during this transitional period 3 methodology various methods were used in the two previous studies but no common method has been applied in both to get rid of the non controlling situation of concluding discrepant results by using different methods on different periods as what has been drawn by previous two papers this study will use the methods already applied and verified in those two papers for selected periods in all two statistical technologies namely double mass curve and flow duration curve and 3 hydrological models at different temporal scales i e budyko annual average tanh function annual and simhyd daily will be applied for this study 3 1 double mass curve flow duration curve the double mass curve is commonly used to show accumulation of one variable e g precipitation against that of another variable over the same period searcy and hardison 1960 if the two variables are proportional a straight line would appear with a constant slope a break in the slope would imply a change in the proportionality between the two variables and the difference in the slope on either side of the break would indicate the magnitude of the change in the relationship between the two variables searcy and hardison 1960 the double mass curve method has been applied in the two previous studies for the relationship between cumulative rainfall and streamflow peña arancibia et al 2012 and for the observed and simulated streamflow siriwardena et al 2006 in this study this method was applied to illustrate the changes in rainfall streamflow relationship for different time periods by plotting cumulative rainfall against that of streamflow and comparing the slopes of rainfall streamflow relationship for each time period in addition to quantify the change in streamflow due to land clearing the rainfall streamflow relationship for the pre clearing period was applied to estimate the streamflow for the post clearing period as if no clearing had occurred and the difference between observed and estimated streamflow is taken to indicate the effect of land clearing on streamflow for these large basins the flow duration curve is the integral of the frequency diagram or the histogram showing the percentage of time during which a specified discharge is equalled or exceeded over a given period searcy 1959 this method is thought to provide a convenient way of representing the characteristics of streams and comparing one basin with another searcy 1959 this method has been used in previous study siriwardena et al 2006 to show the difference in rainfall and streamflow between the pre and post clearing periods in this study flow duration curves were applied to represent the difference in daily rainfall and streamflow patterns for different periods and further to quantify the changes in streamflow with respect to the pre clearing period due to land clearing in comparison to changes in rainfall 3 2 budyko framework at the long term scale the mean annual actual evapotranspiration et and streamflow q for a basin is believed to be controlled by the available water rainfall amount p and the energy represented by potential evapotranspiration pet budyko 1974 consequently a hypothesis can be expressed as 1 et p f pet p c where the parameter c indicates the characteristics of individual basins and et p q over a long period of time as the change in moisture in store is assumed to be zero a number of budyko functions were developed based on this theory including fu s equation f 1 1 ω 1 ω fu 1981 zhang et al 2004 zhang s equation f 1 w 1 w 1 zhang et al 2001 mezentsev choudhury yang s equation f 1 1 n 1 1 n choudhury 1999 yang et al 2008 and wang and tang s equation f 1 1 4 2 2 2 wang and tang 2014 for the budyko functions above indicates the aridity index pet p and f the fitting result et p the parameters ω w n and are related to the basin characteristics i e vegetation type soil properties and topographical characteristics zhang et al 2001 potter et al 2005 ma et al 2008 roderick and farquhar 2011 zhang et al 2016 to be consistent with the previous work where the budyko function was used to evaluate the effect of land use change on streamflow peña arancibia et al 2012 fu s equation was selected for this study and which can be written as 2 et p 1 pet p 1 pet p ω 1 ω ω 0 where a higher value of ω would indicate that the basins favour evapotranspiration zhang et al 2004 climate elasticity was combined with the budyko framework to separate the effects of climate variability and human activity forest clearing on streamflow according to schaake 1990 the change in streamflow due to climate variability could be expressed as 3 dq c q p d p q p e t d p e t where q p is related to the equation applied to calculate actual evaporation streamflow then according to the climate elasticity of runoff ε p q q p p and ε pet q q p e t p e t the equation can be rewritten as 4 δ q c ε p δ p p ε p e t δ p e t p e t q where δ q c indicates the change in streamflow due to climate change and ε p and ε pet are elasticity coefficients of streamflow with respect to p precipitation and pet potential evapotranspiration the change in streamflow due to human activity δ q h can be calculated as the difference between the total change in streamflow and that attributed to climate variations 5 δ q h δ q δ q c where δ q is the total change in streamflow then the eq 4 can be applied in the budyko equation in the finite difference form 6 δ q c q p δ p q p e t δ pet where 7 q p p ω 1 pet ω p ω 1 ω 1 8 q p e t pet ω 1 pet ω p ω 1 ω 1 1 in eqs 6 8 p mm indicates the mean annual rainfall amount and pet mm the mean annual potential evapotranspiration it should be noted that eq 6 is the first order approximation of the taylor expansion for the change in streamflow q due to changes in p and pet and uncertainties are introduced when eq 6 is used to evaluate climate related changes in streamflow yang et al 2014 peña arancibia et al 2012 has calibrated the parameter ω values for different intervals of each period i e 1920 1953 as the pre clearing period and 1970 2007 1979 2007 as post clearing periods before taking the averaged ω within the period to represent the overall condition and then compared the ω values to show the changes in streamflow due to land clearing in this study the value of the parameter ω for each period of land clearing with different forest clearing and forest cover conditions was calculated by solving eq 2 with the mean annual rainfall streamflow and the potential evapotranspiration as the other factors e g soil properties and topographical characteristics are assumed to be the same for a specified basin changes in the value of ω were mainly attributed to vegetation alteration thus comparison of ω values for different periods can be made to determine how the vegetation change forest clearing has affected streamflow of the basin the changes in the long term mean annual rainfall the potential evapotranspiration and streamflow would be obtained based on data of non clearing period and then applied in eqs 5 8 to quantify the effect of land clearing on streamflow to show the changes in streamflow due to human activities the human induced change in streamflow δ q h was divided by the difference between the observed streamflow and the effect of human activities for the post treatment period i e δ q h for the purpose of comparison mezentsev choudhury yang s equation choudhury 1999 yang et al 2008 9 et p pet p n 1 1 n n 0 was also used in a similar fashion following eqs 3 5 to quantitatively separate the effects of climate and human activities as the ratio of et over p is obtained from the mean annual rainfall and streamflow over a long period the uncertainty in the ratio can be represented by its standard deviation std the approximate variance of the ratio var was calculated as follows seltman 2012 10 v a r et p μ et 2 μ p 2 σ et 2 μ et 2 σ p 2 μ p 2 2 c o v et p μ et μ p where μ et and σ et 2 indicate the mean and variance of et respectively and similarly for p c o v et p is the covariance of et and p as the data were prepared annually i e annual rainfall p annual potential evapotranspiration pet and annual actual evapotranspiration et it should be noted that σ et 2 can be evaluated as 11 σ et 2 1 n σ et 2 where σ et 2 indicates the variance of et annual actual evapotranspiration obtained by subtracting annual streamflow from annual rainfall and c o v et p is obtained as 12 c o v et p 1 n c o v e t p and the μ et is the same as μ et and n the number of years 3 3 tanh function for the annual rainfall streamflow relationship siriwardena et al 2006 has modelled the non linear relationship between annual rainfall p and annual streamflow q by using the tanh function boughton 1966 grayson 1996 expressed as 13 q p l f t a n h p l f where l mm indicates the notional loss and f the shape parameter in this study eq 13 was also applied to fit the observed annual rainfall streamflow relationship the parameter values for l and f were calibrated with nonlinear fitting tool in matlab and least squares calibration method was applied using annual rainfall and streamflow from the pre clearing period and the parameter values were fixed and applied to estimate the streamflow for the periods with clearing had clearing not occurred the 95 prediction interval was also obtained by using nlpredci tool in matlab to show the uncertainty of the nonlinear fitting then the difference between the observed and estimated streamflow can be used to indicate the change in streamflow as a result of land clearing 3 4 simhyd simhyd as applied by siriwardena et al 2006 to detect the effect of land clearing on streamflow for large basin the comet in central queensland is a lumped hydrological model developed in australia and one of the models in rainfall runoff library for runoff simulation at the daily or monthly scale rrl1 0 podger 2003 simhyd has been widely applied in australia for simulating streamflow boughton and chiew 2003 chiew et al 2002a b zhang and chiew 2009 and to evaluate hydrological sensitivity to climate change jones et al 2006 simhyd was also applied to separate the effects of climate change and human activities and to predict streamflow of ungauged basins in china liang et al 2013 wang et al 2008 zhang et al 2008 zeng et al 2014 the structure and parameters of the model were described in detail in siriwardena et al 2006 and in the user guide of rrl1 0 podger 2003 the simhyd model has 8 parameters in total for non urbanised basins rrl1 0 podger 2003 for this study the pervious fraction was fixed as 1 and the other 7 parameters i e interception store capacity surface store capacity infiltration coefficient infiltration shape interflow coefficient recharge coefficient and baseflow coefficient were calibrated simhyd was calibrated and model parameters were estimated by minimizing the sum of squared errors sse 14 sse y i y i 2 where y i indicates the observed streamflow and y i the simulated streamflow the objective function i e sse could be computed using daily monthly or annual streamflow as simhyd can only be calibrated at daily or monthly scale in the rrl simhyd was re coded to accumulate to annual totals and a model independent parameter estimation package known as pest doherty 2011 was used for parameter estimation nash sutcliff coefficient nsc was also used to evaluate the model performance 15 nsc 1 y i y i y i y i where y i indicates the mean of annual streamflow parameter values were obtained based on the data of the pre clearing period 30 years of which the earlier 60 i e 18 years was applied for calibration and the rest 40 i e 12 years for validation then the parameter set was applied to simulate streamflow for transitional and post clearing periods as the baseline of no land clearing occurring comparison was made between simulated streamflow and observed streamflow to indicate the effect of land clearing on streamflow 4 results time series of forest cover for both basins were interpreted and presented in section 4 1 and the 3 periods of forest clearing namely pre clearing transitional and post clearing periods were identified based on the rate of forest cover change comparisons of rainfall streamflow and potential evapotranspiration for different periods were made to show how these have changed over time 4 2 results of statistical data analysis double mass and flow duration curves were presented in section 4 2 followed by applications of hydrological models at different time scales mean annual the budyko framework in section 4 3 annual tanh function in section 4 4 and daily simhyd in section 4 5 4 1 land clearing history forest cover was as high as 88 7 for the comet basin and 100 for the upper dawson basin based on a pre clearing vegetation map in the 1960s see fig a1 digitised map from verwey and cameron 2007 the total area covered with forest accounted for 39 4 of the comet basin and 30 3 for the upper dawson basin based on the forest cover map in 2013 fig 1 b c indicating considerable deforestation in this region the area of deforestation according to slats for the two basins since 1988 are summarized in table a1 presenting newly cleared areas and re cleared areas in separate columns only the newly cleared area was included to re construct the forest cover change history in total the re cleared area accounted for around 12 of the total cleared areas the sum of new cleared and re cleared during 1989 2018 the two basins shared a similar pattern of land clearing 1 extensive clearing occurred during the period 1988 2000 with the average clearing rates as high as 123 6 km2 yr for the comet and 80 1 km2 yr for the upper dawson 2 clearing was limited after 2000 while a small peak was seen in 2003 2005 probably caused by extensive re clearing 3 an increasing trending was detected in re clearing over recent years in summary 12 2 of the basin area was cleared for the comet and 10 0 for the upper dawson since 1988 time series of non forest cover 1 forest cover for the two basins are shown in fig 3 as limited information could be collected for the highest clearing rate period 1960 1989 a constant clearing rate assumption was made for that period in all the upper dawson has larger changes in forest cover than the comet does as around 70 of forest was cleared for the upper dawson decreasing from 100 to 30 and 50 lost for the comet from 89 to 39 while it is common to both basins that the most extensive land clearing occurred in the period 1960 1989 as a result three periods 30 years for each would be taken into account in terms of land clearing rates and remaining forested areas for the two basins pre clearing period 1920 1949 with the majority of the basins 90 and 100 covered with forest transitional period 1960 1989 with high clearing rates and post clearing period 1989 2018 with less than half 30 and 40 remnant forest and a slightly lower clearing rate 4 2 streamflow characteristics at different periods of land clearing time series of annual rainfall and streamflow for the period 1920 2018 of the two basins are presented in fig 4 a b annual rainfall showed highly inter annual variability for both basins with a wide range of 230 1257 mm for the comet and of 280 1095 mm for the upper dawson for the comet the 1950s the 1970s and the early 2010s were relatively wet periods indicated by both the amount of annual rainfall and streamflow similar pattern could be found for the upper dawson except that no sign of the wet 1970s was noted compared with the pre and post clearing periods defined by two previous papers presented in fig 4 a the three periods of different land clearing in this study presented in fig 4 b were more carefully determined and covering longer periods to better represent the climate variability the mean and coefficient of variation cv of annual rainfall streamflow and potential evapotranspiration within each period for both basins are summarized in table 2 for both basins potential evapotranspiration is the least variable and streamflow is the most variable for all 3 periods it is also common for the two basins that the rainfall and streamflow of post clearing period 1989 2018 were more variable than the other two periods the transitional period was the wettest with 7 5 4 3 more rainfall than the pre clearing period for the comet upper dawson basin rainfall has increased by 2 for post clearing period for the comet while decreased by 2 for the upper dawson despite of different patterns in rainfall change over time runoff coefficient of both basins kept increasing from 0 023 to 0 049 for the comet and from 0 031 to 0 046 for the upper dawson which was probably more attributed to the increase in streamflow double mass curves based on cumulative annual rainfall and annual streamflow are presented in fig 5 for the two basins slopes from linear regression between rainfall and streamflow show changes in the rainfall streamflow relationship fig 5 and a higher slope indicates more streamflow generated given the same amount of rainfall in all the slope of the regression line for post clearing period 0 054 0 004 was more than doubled of that for the pre clearing period 0 022 0 001 for the comet and an increase of 44 0 033 to 0 048 was also detected for the upper dawson this conclusion was consistent with the increases in the volumetric runoff coefficient table 2 applying the relationship linear equation for the pre clearing period to other two periods as if no clearing had occurred the difference between the observed and simulated streamflow for the transitional and post clearing periods would represent the changes in rainfall streamflow relationship due to land use change for the comet the totally observed streamflow for the transitional period was 747 5 mm over the 30 years or 65 higher than the expected streamflow of 452 9 mm without land clearing the post clearing period experienced a greater difference 119 between the observed 937 9 mm and expected 428 3 mm streamflow this indicates that the streamflow has increased by 65 and 119 due to land clearing for the transitional and post clearing period respectively for the comet assuming that the rainfall streamflow relationship remains unchanged for the upper dawson the transitional period showed no obvious changes in rainfall streamflow relationship compared with the pre clearing period and during the post clearing period the observed streamflow was 38 higher than the expected if no land clearing had occurred the duration curves for daily rainfall and streamflow for the three contrasting periods are presented in fig 6 a b it can be seen that the difference in daily rainfall and streamflow of different periods mainly occurred on relatively wet days the wettest 328 days of each of the 30 year period or an exceedance probability 3 contributed around 50 of the total rainfall and 80 of the total streamflow for all three periods and for both basins to better represent the difference the total rainfall and streamflow with an exceedance probability 3 for each period is shown in fig 7 and the rainfall and streamflow for the transitional and post clearing periods were compared with those during the pre clearing period for both basins fig 7 a b for the comet streamflow has increased by 69 for the transitional period and by 124 for the post clearing period with little changes in rainfall 4 for the upper dawson the change in streamflow was small for the transitional period while for the post clearing period the streamflow on the wettest days has increased by around 50 with only a 6 increase in rainfall and the total increase of 247 mm in streamflow was contributed mostly 76 by the wettest 76 days exceedance probability 0 7 of which 41 of the 76 days occurred in 2010 and 2011 the total streamflow on wetter days has increased considerably especially for both transitional and post clearing periods of the comet while rainfall total on these wettest days exceedance probability 3 showed minimal change 4 for the upper dawson large increase around 50 in streamflow was noted for the post clearing period although the change 8 during the transitional period was limited relative to the pre clearing period 4 3 mean annual streamflow based on budyko framework budyko curves for all 3 periods are shown in fig 8 a b based on different ω values for both basins the error bars show 1 standard deviation of the et p ratio generally speaking the vertical distance between different curves at the same pet p indicates the changes in ω representing basin characteristics including vegetation type cover soil properties and topography while the shifts along one specific curve should be induced only by the change of et p jiang et al 2015 the mean annual values for each period indicated by the dots with the error bars show that the climate has experienced considerable variability over the past 90 years for these two basins for the comet the pre clearing period was quite dry with the aridity index pet p as high as 2 80 and then it became much wetter the transitional period with the aridity index around 2 45 before another relatively dry period 1989 2018 occurred again aridity index 2 64 the upper dawson had similar pattern in climate variability as the comet but was even drier with a higher aridity index for all 3 periods especially for the post clearing period 1989 2018 different budyko curves were obtained due to different ω values from which the effect of land clearing can be inferred for the comet the ω value for the pre clearing period was higher than those of the transitional and the post clearing periods indicating that the basin favoured evapotranspiration during the pre clearing period it is also noted that the budyko curve for the transitional period ω 3 30 rather than the post clearing curve ω 2 97 is closer to pre clearing curve ω 3 46 indicating that the impact of land clearing increased as more area was cleared however the results for the upper dawson fig 8 b were not as conclusive because no sign of increase even a slight decrease in streamflow was detected for the transitional period the impact of clearing on streamflow is more pronounced for the post clearing period of the upper dawson as the ω value for the post clearing period has decreased to 2 92 from 3 20 for the pre clearing period the error bar 1 standard deviation of each dot was plotted as a result of variation of the mean in annual rainfall streamflow and pet within 30 years for each period from the results of the comet fig 8 a the curves for the pre clearing and transitional periods were statistically the same and both were different from that for post clearing period given 1 standard deviation which indicates transitional period has seen insignificantly decreased evaporation while post clearing has seen a significantly different evaporation condition of the basin from the other two periods with more forest areas cleared again this conclusion is not applicable for the upper dawson the evaporation of the basin has significantly changed for post clearing period compared with transitional period while the evaporating rate of the pre clearing period was somehow between the other two fig 8 b the mean annual rainfall potential evapotranspiration of transitional period 1960 1989 and post clearing period 1989 2018 were compared with those of the pre clearing period 1920 1949 to detect how much the variabilities in climate have contributed to the total change in streamflow using eqs 6 9 and then the effect of land clearing on streamflow was separated from that of climate variability table 3 according to the results of fu s equation it is evident for the comet that land clearing has increased streamflow and has contributed 50 of the increase in streamflow for transitional period and contributed 87 of streamflow increase for post clearing period conclusion for the upper dawson is not so clear because it is shown that land clearing has decreased annual streamflow by 3 mm for transitional period even though all the streamflow increase 8 3 mm for post clearing period was attributed to land clearing the results drawn from mezentsev choudhury yang s equation was consistent with those from fu s equation for both scenarios of two basins with only minor differences 4 4 annual streamflow using the tanh function by applying the tanh function the relationship between the observed annual rainfall and streamflow for different periods pre clearing transitional and post clearing periods was plotted against the fitting curve calibrated with the pre clearing period and the 95 prediction interval are also shown fig 9 a 10 a the residuals observed streamflow predicted streamflow of each year were also represented with the mean of each period figs 9 b 10 b for both basins tanh function had a good calibration of the pre clearing period with the averaged error close to 0 fig 9 b 10 b the basic conclusion for the comet is that land clearing had increased streamflow especially for the relatively wetter years with annual rainfall 800 mm figs 9 a 10 a for the comet streamflow in wetter years annual rainfall 800 mm has on average increased by 92 for the transitional period and by 165 for the post clearing period due to land clearing increases in streamflow 8 and 43 respectively for the transitional and post clearing period are also detected in relatively drier years annual rainfall 800 mm for the upper dawson although land clearing has increased streamflow in wetter years by 36 for the transitional period and 100 for the post clearing period no signs of increase in streamflow in drier years were detected the mean residual of the transitional period is 7 3 mm and 0 7 mm for the comet and the upper dawson respectively fig 9 b 10 b indicating that annual streamflow has increased by 7 3 mm for the comet and decreased by 0 7 mm for the upper dawson due to land clearing for this period meanwhile the average residual of post clearing period is 15 4 mm for the comet and 8 0 mm for the upper dawson fig 9 b 10 b showing annual streamflow has increased 15 4 8 0 mm for the comet upper dawson because of land clearing 4 5 water balance assessment using daily hydrological model simhyd for both basins simhyd was calibrated annually with data for the pre clearing period and applied for the transitional and post clearing periods and the simulated annual streamflow for different periods was plotted against the observed in fig 11 when calibrated the model performance was acceptable with the nash sutcliff coefficient of 0 87 for the comet and 0 77 for the upper dawson and a slight reduction in the coefficient 0 72 for the comet and 0 65 for the upper dawson for the validation period an underestimation of high annual streamflow was detected for the comet when simulating the streamflow for the transitional and post clearing periods showing that considerable increase in streamflow could be attributed to land clearing for high streamflow years with annual streamflow exceeding 50 mm which is also the case for the upper dawson during the post clearing period it seems that the model calibrated with the pre clearing period performed well for the transitional period for the upper dawson indicating limited changes in the rainfall streamflow relationship for both basins overestimation was noted for relatively lower streamflow 25 mm for all three contrasting periods this could be a result of the objective function selected for calibration when wet years were given greater weights than dry years with low streamflows on the other hand this could also indicate reduced effect of land clearing on streamflow generation for dry years with relatively low streamflow the difference between the observed and predicted streamflow using simhyd indicated that the annual streamflow has increased by 21 for the transitional period and by 42 for the post clearing period due to land clearing for the comet for the upper dawson an increase of 14 in annual streamflow was detected for the post clearing period and a slight increase 5 for the transitional period for a summary of the effect of land clearing on streamflow for these large basins the magnitude and direction of change in streamflow are collated together in table 4 for all the 5 methods for the 3 contrasting periods and for the two basins in central queensland all the results are presented in terms of the change in streamflow relative to that for the reference or the pre clearing periods the changes in the streamflow are presented by comparing the observed and the simulated using the parameters calibrated with data for the pre clearing periods for the double mass tanh function and simhyd as for the budyko framework the observed streamflow minus qh was taken as the streamflow if no land clearing had occurred the change in streamflow using the flow duration curve only focused on the wettest 328 days or an exceedance probability of 3 for which the change in streamflow mostly occurred the change in rainfall is also included in table 4 as a reference to indicate the climate variability fairly consistent conclusion can be drawn for the comet based on these results using 5 separate methods that land clearing has led to an increase in streamflow for both the transitional and post clearing periods and the increase is greater for the post clearing period than the transitional period it is also clear that for the upper dawson the streamflow has increased due to land clearing for the post clearing period while results for the transitional period are not as clear and conclusive the magnitude of the increases in streamflow derived from the double mass flow duration curve budyko and tanh functions is also consistent for the post clearing period for both basins streamflow for the comet is nearly doubled and the increase for the upper dawson was around 40 simhyd results showed a much lower increase in streamflow with about 35 of what was indicated the other 4 methods simhyd has simulated a much larger amount of streamflow for the wettest year 2011 than that estimated using all other methods this over estimation for wet years may have attributed to a lower magnitude of change in streamflow as a result of land clearing during the post clearing period 5 discussion siriwardena et al 2006 showed that the streamflow has increased as a result of land clearing in the comet basin while peña arancibia et al 2012 indicated that the land clearing induced increase in streamflow is minimal and most of the changes in streamflow can be attributed to climate variability for the region these somewhat inconsistent conclusions of these two previous studies require further discussion about the role of land clearing and associated hydrologic responses for large basins in central queensland of australia according to the earlier study by siriwardena et al 2006 deforestation from 83 to 38 has increased streamflow by approximately 40 for the comet basin during 1971 2000 however peña arancibia et al 2012 attributed most of the change in the observed streamflow to increases in rainfall associated with a series of la niña events in the 1970s and only a very small increase 0 001 could be detected and attributed to land clearing for the comet basin for 1979 2007 no direct comparison even for the same basin could be made of the two studies because neither the methods nor the periods pre and post clearing were identical consequently a combination of different methods most of which were used in the previous two papers was adopted in this study and three distinct periods i e pre clearing transitional and post clearing periods were defined based on a detailed forest cover change history in addition to the comet a neighbouring basin the upper dawson with similar soil vegetation basin area and clearing history was included in the study to provide another line of evidence to test the change in hydrologic response to large scale land clearing in central queensland all things considered the impact of land clearing on streamflow for large basins in central queensland evaluated in this study was not as large as that detected by siriwardena et al 2006 and the increase in streamflow due to land clearing was more pronounced for wetter years with annual rainfall exceeding 800 mm and the impact was limited for drier years the increase in streamflow due to land clearing for these two large basins was not as negligible as presented in the work of peña arancibia et al 2012 as our conclusion about the increase in streamflow can be supported by a series of methods including empirical data analysis e g runoff coefficient and duration curves semi theoretical analysis i e budyko framework and tanh function and conceptual hydrological model such as simhyd our conclusion could also be strengthened by comparing the effect of land clearing on streamflow for two neighbouring basins the wet basin the comet with the mean annual rainfall of 646 mm experienced greater increase in streamflow than the drier basins the upper dawson with the mean annual rainfall of 604 m table 4 shows that the increase in streamflow for the upper dawson even with a larger fractional area cleared fig 3 was not as large as that for the comet this could be attributed to the less rainfall received by the basin fig 2 and table 2 the increase in streamflow due to land clearing was more easily detectable for wetter years and for wetter basins the difference in hydrological responses to land clearing between the two basins was further investigated by comparing the spatiotemporal distribution of rainfall and basin topography to characterise the rainfall distribution annual rainfall for each grid cell 28 km2 in size for the period from 1920 to 2018 were used to produce the cumulative distribution of annual rainfall for the two basins fig 12 a the comet has a relatively larger area receiving higher rainfall than the upper dawson does if the annual rainfall of 800 mm was taken as a meaningful threshold above which the increase in streamflow due to land clearing was more pronounced fig 9 on average around 20 of the comet basin had annual rainfall above 800 mm while the fraction decreased to 13 for the upper dawson this partially explained why the upper dawson showed a weaker hydrological response to land clearing due to a lack of wetter areas with adequate annual rainfall in addition 30 m dem was used to generate the hypsometric curves for these two basins to indicate the difference in basin topography fig 12 b the hypsometric curves show that the comet has greater relief by comparison with 10 of the comet basin with elevation above 600 m while the upper dawson is flatter with less than 2 of the whole basin area with elevation higher than 600 m the lowest point of the two basins was nearly the same 144 m for the comet and 183 mm for the upper dawson the difference in topography provides corroborative evidence to support the observed contrast in rainfall distribution of the two basins and the differing hydrological response to land clearing between the two basins a number of methods were used in this study to isolate and quantify the impact of land clearing on basin hydrology different assumptions were made at different temporary scales for various methods to determine the effect either by deciding the elasticity of streamflow change to variations in climatic factors i e budyko framework or by extending the rainfall streamflow relationship of pre clearing period to post clearing period as if no land clearing had occurred i e double mass curves tanh function and simhyd in the long term the budyko framework allows prediction of the actual evaporation by coupling the water balance equation and two limitations of available energy and water at the annual scale linear and non linear relationships between rainfall and streamflow were assumed for double mass curves and the tanh function respectively at the daily scale rainfall and streamflow were considered to be correlated in the flow duration curve method and runoff generation process is simulated assuming a range of hydrological processes and associated parameters in simhyd there are limitations and uncertainties inherent in the methods used to evaluate the impact of land clearing on basin hydrology for example flow duration curves ignore soil moisture condition while high rainfall is assumed to bring about high streamflow the budyko framework ignores the variations in climatic factors at small temporary scales while focusing on to the long term water balance and constraints imposed by energy and water availability the relative error of about 5 in simulated qc using the budyko framework would be expected as a result of using the first order approximation eq 6 based on yang et al 2014 in addition the uncertainties in the estimated areal potential evapotranspiration and rainfall and the quality of streamflow data can also affect the accuracy of the results and the quality of the conclusions given the high inter annual variability in rainfall and the low mean annual streamflow in this relatively dry environment streamflow is particularly sensitive to variations in rainfall thus the magnitude of the effect of land clearing on streamflow in this environment may vary depending on the reference period and the method selected for evaluation it is therefore important to use different methods to provide multiple lines of evidence to quantify the changes in streamflow as a result of the large scale land clearing in this environment although undertaken at various temporal scales with different inputs all the 5 methods have led to similar and consistent conclusions as shown in table 4 that the streamflow has increased as a result of land clearing and that the larger the area cleared the larger the increase in streamflow while it is tempting to recommend a single method for quantifying the effect of land clearing on streamflow in this relative dry environment examining multiple lines of evidence using different methods at different time scales is much preferred given the unavoidable limitations and uncertainties no matter which method is used for basins in a dry environment with highly variable rainfall and streamflow daily conceptual hydrological models such as simhyd is better suited to capture the variations in rainfall at multiple time scales as the cost of setting up and running conceptual hydrological models is not much higher than using the methods involving aggregate flow and climate data these daily hydrologic models should be included to assess and quantify the changes in streamflow due to land clearing particularly in relatively dry environment peña arancibia et al 2012 largely attributed the increase in streamflow to the higher rainfall in the 1970s but did not attempt to relate the total change in streamflow into climate and land use factors in this study climate elasticity analysis was taken based on the budyko framework to quantify and we attributed the total change in streamflow to land clearing and climate variability our results showed that for the transitional period the wet 1970s were included for the comet basin the increase 47 0 mm in the mean annual rainfall only contributed about half of the increase 10 6 mm in the mean annual streamflow with the other half contributed by land clearing in addition the two previous studies excluded the 1950s citing that the 1950s were unusually wet siriwardena et al 2006 peña arancibia et al 2012 see also fig 5 in this study simhyd calibrated with data for the 1920 1949 period was applied to the comet basins for the wet 1950s it can be seen from fig 13 that simulated flows for the comet with simhyd were able to track the high flows of 1950s but failed to follow the observed flows for the wet 1970s and the early 2010s for this basin this further suggests that rainfall streamflow relationship has changed because of land clearing and the increase in streamflow occurred for a given amount of rainfall for these two large basins the budyko framework has been commonly used to separate the impact of climate variability and human activity on streamflow ma et al 2008 dong et al 2012 gao et al 2016 li et al 2007 liu et al 2009 roderick and farquhar 2011 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2008 zheng et al 2009 xu et al 2014 parameter values for ω in fu s equation were compiled from these previous studies to be consistent with this current study the ω values of the baseline period and the period when climate and or land use changes have occurred and the corresponding changes in the mean annual streamflow due to human activities i e δqh for these 88 basins are presented in table a2 the relationship between changes in the parameter ω for pre and post treatment periods δω and the corresponding δqh are plotted in fig 14 overall δω and δqh are negatively correlated r 0 67 for these 88 basins and an increase in ω is related to a decrease in streamflow and vice versa this observation is consistent with the statement that higher ω values indicate the basins in favour of evapotranspiration resulting in lower streamflow zhang et al 2004 much better linear fit was possible when all basins are classified according to ω values of the reference period or pre treatment period it can be concluded from fig 14 that 1 the linear relationship between δω and δqh is symmetric as δω can either be positive or negative 2 the larger the ω values the less sensitive of δqh to δω because the slope of the regression line decreases as the ω value increases 3 the relationship between δω and δqh is independent of climatic characteristics e g aridity index of the basin above all the human induced change in the mean annual streamflow can be directly estimated using the difference in the ω value between the pre and post treatment periods taking this study as an example each unit of decrease in ω value would lead to around 23 mm of increase in annual streamflow for basins with a ω value greater than 3 for the pre clearing period 6 conclusion both the comet and upper dawson basins shared the same pattern of land clearing and three distinct periods could be identified pre clearing period largely covered with forests 100 for the upper dawson and 89 for the comet before 1960 the transitional period extensively rapid period of land clearing from 1960 to 1989 when the forest cover was decreased to 49 for the comet and 38 for the upper dawson the post clearing period with a lower clearing rate since 1989 with only 11 and 10 of the whole area cleared respectively for the comet and upper dawson basins during the 30 years the increase in streamflow due to land clearing are evident in relatively wetter years than in drier years and it is also easier to be detected for wetter basins most of the increase in streamflow occurred within the wettest 328 days or with an exceedance probability of 3 of the 30 year period the increases in streamflow occurred mainly in years with the annual rainfall greater than 800 mm or when the annual streamflow greater than 50 mm the increase in streamflow was greater for the comet than the upper dawson because it is wetter although the extent of land clearing was slightly smaller in the comet than in the upper dawson for a given basin the greater the extent of land clearing the larger the increase in streamflow for the comet basin the increase in streamflow for the post clearing period 40 51 cleared was around double of that for the transitional period 0 40 cleared for the upper dawson basin 40 of the increase in streamflow was detected for the post clearing period while no sign of change in streamflow for the transitional period for previous studies at large scale in the region and for several large basins elsewhere in the world the conclusions regarding the effect of land use change on streamflow at the large scale are often inconsistent and occasionally contradictory this likely occurred because of different methods applied or different contrasting periods specified it is imperative to use several methods to provide multiple lines of evidence and take into account both the land use change as well as climate variability to isolate the impact of land use change on streamflow at the large scale declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix see fig a1 and tables a1 and a2 
6126,eutrophication of surface water bodies resulted from pollution of the farmland drainage water is a serious water pollution problem recently which has been paid more and more attention phytoremediation is to use specific aquatic or terrestrial plants for water pollutants such as nitrogen in situ absorption degradation and fixing with low cost and good effect of removing nitrogen pollutants which is gradually used in sewage disposal however impact factor of phytoremediation is not known comprehensively enough since people have done research on it recently and study on related dynamics is not much either so many numerical models are not accurate enough and the selection of reaction parameters is not unified in this paper two kinds of phytoremediation constructed wetlands such as surface wetland named cell a and vertical flow constructed wetland named cell b are used through experiments design operation of the field and sampling analysis combined with the principle of nitrogen transformation model phytoremediation of farmland in the water cycle nitrogen ecology dynamic conceptual numerical model is developed a kinetic model of nitrogen physical chemical biodegradation reaction is established in this study and genetic algorithm with the least squares method of nonlinear optimization is used via matlab which is an independent program to determine the unknown parameters in the developed model simulated results showed that the concentration of ammonia nitrogen nitrate nitrogen and organic nitrogen in the effluent of cell a is better than other pools the ecological dynamic model of nitrogen cycle and the first order kinetic model of removing total nitrogen tn were compared and analyzed in the simulation of the cell a it is indicated that the developed ecological dynamic model in this study could accurately predict the change of the effluent concentration in the constructed wetland and the model in this study can provide theoretical support for the design and operation of the constructed wetland and the prediction of the effluent concentration to facilitate the mastery for the actual purification effect of the constructed wetland keywords phytoremediation ecological dynamic model of nitrogen cycle phytoremediation of farmland drainage numerical simulation stella 1 introduction due to extensive use of chemical pesticides in farmland ecosystems the farmland return wastewater contains a lot of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus these substances with the farmland wastewater go back into the surface water and it can cause eutrophication of water bodies and lead to the death of fish and other aquatic animals in water at present the non point source pollution named eutrophication caused by over fertilization has become one of the largest water pollution sources tan et al 2015 thompson et al 2000 webster et al 2012 which not only affects the sustainable development of agriculture but also threatens the health of humans and it is paid much attention to all over the world ongley et al 2010 yang et al 2012 considering that the water environment pollution of eutrophication has the characteristics of wide pollution sources large pollution volume and high pollution load the conventional sewage treatment technology is mature but the operating cost is too high therefore it is urgent to find a reliable safe stable and economical operation the phytoremediation method in constructed wetland is a kind of green high quality sewage treatment technology which is gradually emerging in the second half of the last century it has the functions of retaining nutrients removing and transforming toxic and harmful substances and has the advantages of low investment low energy consumption simple operation and maintenance an in situ repair technology that is an eco friendly and solar dependent cleaning technology and it is becoming more and more popular now cheng et al 2010 coban et al 2015 jae 2013 jahangir et al 2016 montpetit and lachapelle 2017 rozema et al 2016 vasavi et al 2010 the contribution of plants to wastewater treatment is summarized in two main aspects firstly the plant can directly absorb a part of nutrients from the sewage for its own growth and at the same time the pollutants flowing through the plant roots can also adsorb and block a part of the pollutants yuan et al 2004 and the broad root tissues of the plants growing inside the wetland are microorganisms survival carriers especially for the aerobic microorganisms to decompose organic matter deliver sufficient oxygen which is a favorable guarantee for the nitrification reaction to be fully carried out providing a place for the microbial survival activities and indirectly improving the wetland s ability to purify pollutants kalliman and virupakshi 2015 nitrogen pollutants in sewage can be divided into organic nitrogen and inorganic nitrogen while plants directly absorb inorganic nitrogen which is mainly nitrate nitrogen plants convert inorganic nitrogen in water into useful nutrients for their own growth the removed nitrogen only accounts for a small part of the total amount of nitrogen removed from the wetland even in the optimum growth environment the total amount of nitrogen removed by plant absorption is still less than 15 lu et al 2006 li et al 2009 because plants have nitrogen phosphorus and other substances planted in wetlands every year when the plants are withered and zeroed if plants are not harvested in time the fallen leaves of the plants will decompose and rot in the water releasing the organic matter into the water so the nitrogen in the constructed wetlands in the long term operation process corresponding measures need to be taken to harvest in time but some people have found that the efficiency of removing nitrogen pollutants from artificial wetlands is not obvious by harvesting plants gloser and vymazal 2004 therefore whether it is helpful to remove the residual leaves of the plant and the removal of wetland pollutants is currently uncertain in addition many people have explored the nitrogen uptake ability of different plant species for example yuan et al 2004 compared the nitrogen removal efficiency of three plant types it was found that the ability of the plant to absorb nitrogen was stronger than that of the wick and the absorption rates of reed and cattail to nitrate nitrogen were about 0 5 g m 2 a 1 and 3 3 g m 2 a 1 respectively it is generally believed that the decontamination process of constructed wetland systems can be described by a kinetic model the most common application is the first order kinetic model which is mainly based on the assumption of an ideal push flow reactor and steady state conditions by establishing a dynamic equation and indicates the relationship between the concentration of pollutants in the ingress and egress of the wetland system the biggest advantage of this model is that it is easy to calculate requiring a small amount of data and can clearly represent the mathematical relationship between the concentrations of study indicators in and out of the water the attenuation equation simulates the influent and water concentration in the form of a certain equation it is based on the black box principle compared with the first order dynamics it adds traffic and other factors to the equation which is more in line with the actual situation fu et al 2014 huang 2008 yoon 2009 at present scholars generally believe that the monod dynamic model can well describe the purification process of pollutants in wetlands by microorganisms kaplan et al 2011 fogler 2010 the specific pollutant concentrations are lower and higher respectively using first order and zero order models although the monod kinetic model can better describe the denitrification of microorganisms it is difficult to calculate and apply due to the biochemical reaction parameters involved in the model in addition the model does not have the effect of reaction temperature season etc on nitrogen removal so the accuracy is not high enough mitchell and mcnevin 2001 langergraber 2003 the ecological dynamics model of the pollutants removal from constructed wetlands is based on the box model the transformation process of various forms of pollutants is defined as different boxes by establishing the relationship between different kinds of nitrogen based on the study of pollutant conversion mechanism and transformation process each box is defined by kinetic equation and mass conservation equation and the parameters are determined by experimental data the dynamics conceptual model is established by using simulation software finally using the wetland operation data to verify the model the final ecological dynamics model is obtained zhang and zhou 2004 liu 2011 however the ecological dynamics of constructed wetlands still need further study in order to improve the ecological dynamics model many people strive to add a number of wetland internal transformation boxes during the construction process such as taking biomass plants environment and other factors into consideration to improve the prediction accuracy of the model mayo et al 2013 liu et al 2011 the influence factor of system removal ability such as the analysis of nitrogen substrate removal effects by different substrates and different plants are studied in recent years xie et al 2009 liu 2011 the monitoring of water quality and the continuous monitoring of water quality changes in the intermediate process are rare the kinetic model of nitrogen pollutant removal in constructed wetlands have not studied the influencing factors in the process of model establishment are not considered either and the models currently are based on the laboratory model where the influent concentration operating parameters are controllable the environmental conditions are relatively stable and the actual engineering operation is quite different therefore only one aquatic plant is selected this paper we will monitor the water quality changes in the continuous wetland along the field constructed wetland and attempt to clearly observe the removal process of nitrogen pollutants in the constructed wetland nitrogen pollutants removal mechanism and influencing factors will be analyzed later with principle of nitrogen transformation model considering nitrogen physical chemical biodegradation reactions the dynamics of nitrogen pollutant removal model will be developed and used in this study it is of great theory significance and practical application value to grasp the prediction accuracy of the model for the actual project effluent quality 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the experiment the study was conducted in static pot experimental box located at the agricultural water irrigation technology station in the qingpu district of shanghai china 31 12 n 121 07 e the experiment was conducted from july 24th to september 2th in 2017 the climate of study area was the southeast monsoon with distinct seasons and sufficient sunlight mean annual precipitation was 1388 8 mm mean annual days of raining were 91 days and the mean annual temperature was 19 0 c the study area was flat and local average altitude was 3 1 m during the test period water was continuously fed and the device was exposed to the natural environment which completely simulated the real natural environment the test device area consisted of three reaction tanks a large water tank a small water tank multiple sets of distribution pipes and a submersible pump the planting of aquatic plants was yellow iris two different constructed wetland systems cell a and cell b were established their sizes were 2 0 m 1 0 m 0 6 m made of abs plastic with 15 mm thickness cell a was used to simulate vertical subsurface flow constructed wetlands as shown in fig 1 b the soil layer thickness was 30 cm 10 cm thickness of quartz sand was laid on the bottom and a pvc pipe with holes was used to collect groundwater samples one vertical pipe was set at the outlet about 15 cm from the bottom and the groundwater level was kept constant in the reaction tank overflow control cell b was used to simulate surface flow constructed wetlands as shown in fig 1 c soil layer thickness was 40 cm and the water level was kept at 10 cm from the bottom in the three reaction tank inlets a switch adjusting the flow rate and a flow meter recording the flow rate were provided at each outlet and inlet by driving the farmland back into the water storage tank from the channel a water tank was installed at the outlet of the water storage device to control the water level of the influent and water level of the inflow was consistent after being connected to the reaction pool through the distribution port the reaction pools were operated in parallel and the water was continuously fed in and out while the inlet and outlet water flow rates were adjusted through the inlet and outlet valves during the test the growth of the plants was observed daily while the height of the plants was measured regularly pre test preparation was made with the soil bulk density determination the soil mass calculation and its fill into the experimental device soil saturated moisture content and soil nitrogen content were simultaneously measured aquatic plants of yellow iris was planted in a 40 cm bundle consisting of 5 pieces the height of the plant was about 25 cm and they were planted in the device 4 days before the experiment to ensure its survival 2 2 sampling and analysis the farmland was pumped back into the storage tank and evenly flowed into the reaction tank through the pipeline the water was fed from one end at a constant flow rate the water level in the two reaction tanks and the flow rate in the three flow meters were recorded every day the import and export water samples and the groundwater samples were collected once every three days to measure the ammonia nitrogen nitrate nitrogen and total nitrogen we also measured the temperature of the water and ph the plant nitrogen content and soil nitrogen content at the bottom were measured every 15 days the water samples and soil samples should be stored in the refrigerator in a timely manner the temperature was 0 4 c to prevent the samples from deteriorating and affecting the test results the water soil and plant samples obtained were all prepared for testing after the water samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm filter head the method of determination was in accordance with the water and wastewater monitoring and analysis methods sepa 2009 where the ammonia nitrogen was determined by using nessler s reagent spectrophotometer method water quality ammonia nitrogen determination nessler s reagent spectrophotometric method hj535 2009 and nitrate nitrogen was determined by using the ultraviolet spectrophotometric method determination of water quality nitrate salt uv differentiation spectrophotometry hj t346 2007 which was used to determine the total nitrogen soil nitrogen and plants nitrogen after digestion with a continuous flow analyzer and the average initial characteristics of the wastewater in the study is shown in table 1 3 a mathematical model of nitrogen transformation and removal the nitrogen available for plant uptake and root zone release depends on different nitrogen species transformations that undergo in the soil water plant atmosphere system chowdary et al 2004 the conceptual nitrogen transformations and removal description with major processes were described in fig 2 the ecological restoration model has considered organic nitrogen ammonia nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen as the major forms of nitrogen including organic nitrogen ammonia nitrogen nitrate nitrogen in the wastewater nitrogen in the sediment and organic nitrogen in plants zhang 2012 because nitrate nitrogen changed into gass n oxide and nitrous oxide by denitrification the amount of gass n was very small the reaction equation was ignored to understand the relationship between the model results and the case study the systems were modeled by a set of differential equations called the mass balance equation the main conversion mechanisms considered in the model included nine types of reactions such as mineralization nitrification denitrification plant uptake sedimentation plant decaying process regeneration adsorption of ammonia nitrogen on sediment into water volatilization uptake of ammonia and nitrates into organic nitrogen by microorganisms mayo and bigambo 2005 wang et al 2009 all these transformation processes are carried out by both suspended and biofilm biomass therefore mathematical equations developed in this study would incorporate the suspended and attached biomass activities in determining the mathematical expressions a complete material balance including all forms of substances produced and consumed in

4 1 model calibration and parameter optimization by fitting the mathematical model to the experimental data based on the empirical values of each parameter the unknown parameters in the model were identified the numerical solution of the differential equations was solved by a genetic algorithm combined with the least squares method of nonlinear optimization and independently programmed by matlab 2017a software in the program nonlinear optimization is achieved by lsqnonlin lsqnonlin is a subroutine function of matlab and it is a general algorithm for solving nonlinear least squares problem the input parameter of the subroutine lsqnonlin is the error between the predicted and measured values the initial value of the unknown parameter is obtained by ode45 to solve the differential equation group based on process and literature knowledge since the initial value of the least squares method has a great influence on the result the genetic algorithm is used to find the optimal initial value which will be substituted into the model and then the equation is solved with the ode45 subroutine to generate the final parameter value the same group of data was repeatedly fitted to calculate the parameters and multiple groups of parameters were obtained to calculate the average value the ph value measured in cell a is 8 5 or less but it is generally worthwhile to consider the volatilization of ammonia with ph 8 5 lian et al 2011 therefore the volatilization effect of ammonia gas is not considered in this model the model parameters were fitted by using data of cell a from august 1 2017 to september 1 2017 based on the empirical values of various parameters the measured values are brought into the matlab program to identify the unknown parameters and most parameters are within the empirical range table 2 lists some of the unknown parameters and the corresponding identified values after calibration it was found that the organic nitrogen released from plant spoilage and roots was 31 678 mg l 1 d 1 the release of organic nitrogen depends on a variety of factors such as vegetation biomass temperature and the decay rate of nutrients however the data related to these factors are lacking in addition there is little description in the literature for nitrogen release from biodegradation nitrogen assimilation is the inorganic nitrogen conversion into organic nitrogen form and this serves as a building block for cells and tissues where ammonia nitrogen and nitrate are the two main forms of nitrogen sources by calculation the ammonia nitrogen assimilation rate 134 564 mg l 1 d 1 is much greater than the nitrate nitrogen assimilation rate 83 784 mg l 1 d 1 this is similar to the study by shin and polprasert 1988 and autotrophic microorganisms absorb ammonia nitrogen preferentially 4 2 model solution method stella is a powerful system dynamics software consisting of stella architect stella designer and stella professional stella architect is an advanced modeling and interactive simulation software stella designer makes dynamic system thinking briefs and stella professional is dynamic stella is a complete modeling tool for modeling policy analysis and strategy development therefore stella was used as a simulation tool for ecological dynamics in this study various operating parameters and related ecological dynamic equations were input into stella 9 1 3 software to establish a dynamic model and various biochemical reaction processes were cascaded to form the structural model of the stella system as shown in fig 2 the four basic building blocks of stella were used in the modeling process including stock flow converter and connector which was shown in fig 3 stock is the most fundamental building block for modeling used to represent the accumulation of things both material and non material and can be used to represent state variables the above model uses five state variables namely no3 n nh4 n org n plant n and biomass flow is used to describe the activities in the system streams connected to the stack will cause the stack to increase or decrease the direction of flow can be divided into unidirectional flow and bidirectional flow unidirectional streams can only take non negative values and bidirectional streams can take any value streams are generally unidirectional but in some cases it may be necessary to use the same stream to represent the input and output of a stack and then use bidirectional streams stella kinetic model structure for this study was presented in fig 4 from the figure we can see that the flow was used to represent the input and output items in the system namely inflow nh4 outflow nh4 inflow no3 outflow no3 influent organic nitrogen inflow org n outflow org n and conversion between ammonia nitrogen nitrate nitrogen organic nitrogen and plant nitrogen including nitrification denitrification mineralization plant decay assimilation 1 and assimilation 2 the connector is a red line with an arrow or a dashed line in fig 3 the difference between a connector and a stream is that the connector passes information and the stream transfers material the converter is very powerful and is often used to receive information and transfer it to other modules for other variables it can be connected to streams or converters but not to the stack it contains equations that produce output values over time while it also accepts information and passes it to other variables in the model and the converter can also be used to store constants 4 3 statistical analysis the calibrated parameters were input into the stella model to simulate the effluent concentrations of organic nitrogen ammonia nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen in cell a the model simulations observations and influent concentrations of ammonia nitrogen nitrate nitrogen and organic nitrogen in cell a are shown in figs 5 7 respectively from the figures we can see that the model simulation results were in agreement with the observed data overall in fig 5 the simulated effluent nh4 n concentration is equivalent to the observed concentration especially there is no high or low peak changes for effluent nh4 n the average simulated value of nh4 n is 2 380 mg l 1 and the average observed nh4 n is 2 396 mg l 1 these two averaged value were very close which indicated that the model could simulate the effluent nh4 n concentrations the relationship between simulated and observed effluent nh4 n concentrations in fig 5 is similar to the relationship between simulated and observed effluent no3 n concentration in fig 6 while in fig 6 the average simulated value for the effluent no3 n concentrations is 0 404 mg l 1 and the corresponding average observed value is 0 408 mg l 1 the average simulated value is approximately the same as the average observed value which indicated that the model could successfully simulate the effluent no3 n concentrations however there was a large difference on the 4th day the observed effluent no3 n concentration on that day was 0 518 mg l 1 and the simulated effluent no3 n concentration was 0 609 mg l 1 this may be because the effluent no3 n concentration was simulated based on the effluent nh4 n concentration by nitration from fig 5 it can be seen that the effluent concentration of nh4 n on the fourth day was relatively large which resulted in a higher simulated value of effluent no3 n concentration on the same date in fig 7 the average effluent organic nitrogen concentration of the model simulation was 9 063 mg l 1 which was close to the average observed value as 8 418 mg l 1 this suggested that the model in this study could simulate the effluent organic nitrogen concentration in the experiment both the simulated effluent organic nitrogen concentration and the observed concentration were lower than the influent concentration in a whole which indicated that the dissolved oxygen concentration in the device is relatively high this is because under aerobic conditions the ammoniated efficiency is higher than that of anaerobic so more organic nitrogen could be converted to nh4 n and the organic nitrogen concentration in the effluent would be lower in a word figs 5 7 showed that the model could reflect the trends of three different forms of nitrogen concentrations in water however there were still differences between the simulated results and the measured concentrations in the effluent in order to quantitatively analyze the accuracy of the model simulation results three statistical analysis parameters namely correlation coefficient r 2 root mean square error rmse willmott 1982 and nash efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 were used and they were defined as following 12 r 2 i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n y i y 2 13 rmse i 1 n y i y i 2 n 14 nse 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where n is the number of all observation data in the effluent y i represents the ith measured effluent concentration value mg l 1 y represents the average concentration of the measured value mg l 1 y i represents the simulated concentration value corresponding to the ith measured effluent concentration value mg l 1 and the calculation results were shown in table 3 comparing the data in the above table it could be found that the model was accurate for the simulated nitrate nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen concentration but there was a big gap for the simulated and observed ammonia nitrogen concentration this is maybe because there was a certain bias in the calibration based on empirical values the parameters nitrification r n mineralization r m the rate of nitrogen utilized by plants uptake for growth r p1 in the literature were limited to the operation in specific conditions but the biochemical reaction process changed with time quickly which is calculated as a constant in this study it is maybe also because there was not enough experimental data which resulted in larger errors 4 4 model validation without neglecting the interference of external conditions both of cell a and cell b can be used to describe the transformation process of nitrogen the experimental data of cell b from august 5 2017 to september 1 2017 was used to verify the model the effluent concentration of nh4 n org n and no3 n in cell b were simulated by substituting the identified parameters of section 4 1 into the stella kinetic model the corresponding results were shown in figs 8 10 it could be seen from the figures that the effluent nh4 n org n and no3 n concentrations were lower than the influent concentrations which indicated that the plants had a purifying effect on nitrogen pollution it could also be seen from the figures that the simulated data had the same trends with the observed data for the effluent nh4 n org n and no3 n concentrations in cell b moreover the average simulated value of effluent ammonia nitrogen concentration was 0 4786 mg l 1 and the actual observed average value was 0 4194 mg l 1 while the average simulated value of effluent nitrate nitrogen concentration was 0 3462 mg l 1 and the actual observed average value was 0 4194 mg l 1 meanwhile the average simulated value of the effluent organic nitrogen concentration was 17 8899 mg l 1 and the actual observed average value was 15 6667 mg l 1 therefore the simulated data and observed data in the figures indicates that the model simulates the effluent concentrations of nh4 n org n and no3 n in cell b based on the identified parameters moreover statistical analysis for parameters were shown in table 4 there were partial deviations between the model simulated values and the observed values but they could reflect the concentrations variation in a whole the simulated effluent nitrate nitrogen concentration in fig 10 was not very good which may be due to the fact that cell b was in a flooded state where anaerobic microorganisms were active this was belonged to the reducing environment and denitrifying bacteria were active resulting in a decrease of the nitrate concentration in effluent 4 5 simulation results analysis of ecological dynamic model and traditional first order dynamic model for a long time some people have evaluated the design operation and removal effects of constructed wetlands based on the first order kinetic model proposed by epa the model was simple and practical with a small amount of calculation requiring less parameter data however it was assumed in the model that the influent water concentration was constant and that the inflow and outflow flow rates remained constant and the water flow was assumed to be ideal it is obvious that the concentration and flow of influent water in an actual constructed wetland project are unlikely to be constant and will change over time these constraints directly affect the prediction of water quality by the first order kinetic model resulting in great simulation errors and the first order kinetic model is usually expressed as following 15 c out c in e k v t where c in was the influent concentration mg l 1 c out was the effluent concentration mg l 1 k v was the volume removal rate constant d 1 t was the hydraulic retention time d in order to verify the accuracy of the ecological dynamic model established in this study the first order kinetic model of tn removal was established based on the data from august 1th 2017 to september 1th 2017 in cell a the least squares method was used to filter and fit the original data and the simulated results with the first order kinetic model and fit curve were shown in fig 11 from the figure we could see that the first order kinetic model equation of tn removal in cell a was c o u t c in 0 6686 e 0 011 t so the deformation coefficient was c o u t c in 0 6686 e 0 011 â t and the correlation coefficient of the fitting curve was r 2 0 8254 this equation was used to predict the effluent concentration in cell a from august 1th to september 1th 2017 which was compared with the actual observed effluent tn concentration the simulated effluent tn concentrations with first order kinetic model and ecological dynamics model in the study observed data of the effluent tn concentrations and influent tn concentrations were shown in fig 12 from the figure we can see that the simulated data for the effluent tn concentrations by the ecological dynamics model in this study was much closer to the simulated data that by the first order kinetic model which suggested that the developed ecological dynamics model in this study is better and more efficient to simulate the effluent tn concentrations in cell a moreover the sum square ss was used to indicate the difference between the simulated value and observed value and simulated effluent tn concentrations in two models were shown in table 5 from table 5 we can see that the ss with the ecological dynamic model in the study 25 8456 mg2 l 2 was much less than that with the first order kinetic model 295 4318 mg2 l 2 it further indicated that the ecological dynamic model in the study was more accurate than the first order kinetic model to simulate the effluent tn concentration and it can reflect the actual effluent tn concentration change of the constructed wetland in cell a the average observed effluent tn concentration was 11 856 mg l 1 while the simulated average value with the first order kinetic model and ecological dynamics model in this study was 11 222 mg l 1 and 12 390 mg l 1 respectively which suggested that simulated data by the ecological dynamics model was closer to the observed data than that by first order kinetic model it was further proved that the developed ecological dynamics model in this study was more accurate to simulate the effluent tn concentrations in cell a this was mainly due to the fact that the ecological dynamics model took into account various forms of nitrogen and various biophysical and chemical effects which was of more information than the first order kinetic model 5 conclusions in this paper the design on site sampling laboratory testing and various transformation laws for two different forms of constructed wetlands were compared to analyze the removal effects of pollutants from two kinds of constructed wetlands the important factors influencing the nitrogen removal efficiency were determined through analysis based on the understanding of the relationship and principles of nitrogen transformation a conceptual model of ecological dynamics was established and the unknown parameters in the model were identified by using a genetic algorithm combined with least squares method finally the nitrogen changes in the wetland system were determined by using stella software the process was simulated and the model was verified with the measured data based on the ecological dynamics model and the conservation mass law an ecological dynamic model for the nitrogen restoration in the farmland was established the effect of ammonia nitrogen nitrate nitrogen and organic nitrogen concentration in the effluent of cell a pond was found the ecological dynamic model of nitrogen cycle and the first order kinetic model of removing tn were compared and analyzed for the cell a it was shown that the ecological dynamic model could accurately predict the change of the effluent concentration in the constructed wetland the model can provide theoretical support for the design and operation of the constructed wetland which can provide the prediction of the effluent concentration to facilitate the mastery of the actual purification effect for the constructed wetland however because of the long repair cycle only one aquatic plant was selected in our study in future wetlands and plant types will be considered and many natural factors such as some nitrogen conversion on dead plants and the effects of plant growth stages on nitrogen removal can not be considered by the model parameters which is a further issue needs to study moreover the empirical parameters used in the model are constants which may lead to model bias in future experiments physical and chemical indexes can be added to make the parameters of the model more accurate moreover the plant n uptake should also be measured in future study declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

6126,eutrophication of surface water bodies resulted from pollution of the farmland drainage water is a serious water pollution problem recently which has been paid more and more attention phytoremediation is to use specific aquatic or terrestrial plants for water pollutants such as nitrogen in situ absorption degradation and fixing with low cost and good effect of removing nitrogen pollutants which is gradually used in sewage disposal however impact factor of phytoremediation is not known comprehensively enough since people have done research on it recently and study on related dynamics is not much either so many numerical models are not accurate enough and the selection of reaction parameters is not unified in this paper two kinds of phytoremediation constructed wetlands such as surface wetland named cell a and vertical flow constructed wetland named cell b are used through experiments design operation of the field and sampling analysis combined with the principle of nitrogen transformation model phytoremediation of farmland in the water cycle nitrogen ecology dynamic conceptual numerical model is developed a kinetic model of nitrogen physical chemical biodegradation reaction is established in this study and genetic algorithm with the least squares method of nonlinear optimization is used via matlab which is an independent program to determine the unknown parameters in the developed model simulated results showed that the concentration of ammonia nitrogen nitrate nitrogen and organic nitrogen in the effluent of cell a is better than other pools the ecological dynamic model of nitrogen cycle and the first order kinetic model of removing total nitrogen tn were compared and analyzed in the simulation of the cell a it is indicated that the developed ecological dynamic model in this study could accurately predict the change of the effluent concentration in the constructed wetland and the model in this study can provide theoretical support for the design and operation of the constructed wetland and the prediction of the effluent concentration to facilitate the mastery for the actual purification effect of the constructed wetland keywords phytoremediation ecological dynamic model of nitrogen cycle phytoremediation of farmland drainage numerical simulation stella 1 introduction due to extensive use of chemical pesticides in farmland ecosystems the farmland return wastewater contains a lot of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus these substances with the farmland wastewater go back into the surface water and it can cause eutrophication of water bodies and lead to the death of fish and other aquatic animals in water at present the non point source pollution named eutrophication caused by over fertilization has become one of the largest water pollution sources tan et al 2015 thompson et al 2000 webster et al 2012 which not only affects the sustainable development of agriculture but also threatens the health of humans and it is paid much attention to all over the world ongley et al 2010 yang et al 2012 considering that the water environment pollution of eutrophication has the characteristics of wide pollution sources large pollution volume and high pollution load the conventional sewage treatment technology is mature but the operating cost is too high therefore it is urgent to find a reliable safe stable and economical operation the phytoremediation method in constructed wetland is a kind of green high quality sewage treatment technology which is gradually emerging in the second half of the last century it has the functions of retaining nutrients removing and transforming toxic and harmful substances and has the advantages of low investment low energy consumption simple operation and maintenance an in situ repair technology that is an eco friendly and solar dependent cleaning technology and it is becoming more and more popular now cheng et al 2010 coban et al 2015 jae 2013 jahangir et al 2016 montpetit and lachapelle 2017 rozema et al 2016 vasavi et al 2010 the contribution of plants to wastewater treatment is summarized in two main aspects firstly the plant can directly absorb a part of nutrients from the sewage for its own growth and at the same time the pollutants flowing through the plant roots can also adsorb and block a part of the pollutants yuan et al 2004 and the broad root tissues of the plants growing inside the wetland are microorganisms survival carriers especially for the aerobic microorganisms to decompose organic matter deliver sufficient oxygen which is a favorable guarantee for the nitrification reaction to be fully carried out providing a place for the microbial survival activities and indirectly improving the wetland s ability to purify pollutants kalliman and virupakshi 2015 nitrogen pollutants in sewage can be divided into organic nitrogen and inorganic nitrogen while plants directly absorb inorganic nitrogen which is mainly nitrate nitrogen plants convert inorganic nitrogen in water into useful nutrients for their own growth the removed nitrogen only accounts for a small part of the total amount of nitrogen removed from the wetland even in the optimum growth environment the total amount of nitrogen removed by plant absorption is still less than 15 lu et al 2006 li et al 2009 because plants have nitrogen phosphorus and other substances planted in wetlands every year when the plants are withered and zeroed if plants are not harvested in time the fallen leaves of the plants will decompose and rot in the water releasing the organic matter into the water so the nitrogen in the constructed wetlands in the long term operation process corresponding measures need to be taken to harvest in time but some people have found that the efficiency of removing nitrogen pollutants from artificial wetlands is not obvious by harvesting plants gloser and vymazal 2004 therefore whether it is helpful to remove the residual leaves of the plant and the removal of wetland pollutants is currently uncertain in addition many people have explored the nitrogen uptake ability of different plant species for example yuan et al 2004 compared the nitrogen removal efficiency of three plant types it was found that the ability of the plant to absorb nitrogen was stronger than that of the wick and the absorption rates of reed and cattail to nitrate nitrogen were about 0 5 g m 2 a 1 and 3 3 g m 2 a 1 respectively it is generally believed that the decontamination process of constructed wetland systems can be described by a kinetic model the most common application is the first order kinetic model which is mainly based on the assumption of an ideal push flow reactor and steady state conditions by establishing a dynamic equation and indicates the relationship between the concentration of pollutants in the ingress and egress of the wetland system the biggest advantage of this model is that it is easy to calculate requiring a small amount of data and can clearly represent the mathematical relationship between the concentrations of study indicators in and out of the water the attenuation equation simulates the influent and water concentration in the form of a certain equation it is based on the black box principle compared with the first order dynamics it adds traffic and other factors to the equation which is more in line with the actual situation fu et al 2014 huang 2008 yoon 2009 at present scholars generally believe that the monod dynamic model can well describe the purification process of pollutants in wetlands by microorganisms kaplan et al 2011 fogler 2010 the specific pollutant concentrations are lower and higher respectively using first order and zero order models although the monod kinetic model can better describe the denitrification of microorganisms it is difficult to calculate and apply due to the biochemical reaction parameters involved in the model in addition the model does not have the effect of reaction temperature season etc on nitrogen removal so the accuracy is not high enough mitchell and mcnevin 2001 langergraber 2003 the ecological dynamics model of the pollutants removal from constructed wetlands is based on the box model the transformation process of various forms of pollutants is defined as different boxes by establishing the relationship between different kinds of nitrogen based on the study of pollutant conversion mechanism and transformation process each box is defined by kinetic equation and mass conservation equation and the parameters are determined by experimental data the dynamics conceptual model is established by using simulation software finally using the wetland operation data to verify the model the final ecological dynamics model is obtained zhang and zhou 2004 liu 2011 however the ecological dynamics of constructed wetlands still need further study in order to improve the ecological dynamics model many people strive to add a number of wetland internal transformation boxes during the construction process such as taking biomass plants environment and other factors into consideration to improve the prediction accuracy of the model mayo et al 2013 liu et al 2011 the influence factor of system removal ability such as the analysis of nitrogen substrate removal effects by different substrates and different plants are studied in recent years xie et al 2009 liu 2011 the monitoring of water quality and the continuous monitoring of water quality changes in the intermediate process are rare the kinetic model of nitrogen pollutant removal in constructed wetlands have not studied the influencing factors in the process of model establishment are not considered either and the models currently are based on the laboratory model where the influent concentration operating parameters are controllable the environmental conditions are relatively stable and the actual engineering operation is quite different therefore only one aquatic plant is selected this paper we will monitor the water quality changes in the continuous wetland along the field constructed wetland and attempt to clearly observe the removal process of nitrogen pollutants in the constructed wetland nitrogen pollutants removal mechanism and influencing factors will be analyzed later with principle of nitrogen transformation model considering nitrogen physical chemical biodegradation reactions the dynamics of nitrogen pollutant removal model will be developed and used in this study it is of great theory significance and practical application value to grasp the prediction accuracy of the model for the actual project effluent quality 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the experiment the study was conducted in static pot experimental box located at the agricultural water irrigation technology station in the qingpu district of shanghai china 31 12 n 121 07 e the experiment was conducted from july 24th to september 2th in 2017 the climate of study area was the southeast monsoon with distinct seasons and sufficient sunlight mean annual precipitation was 1388 8 mm mean annual days of raining were 91 days and the mean annual temperature was 19 0 c the study area was flat and local average altitude was 3 1 m during the test period water was continuously fed and the device was exposed to the natural environment which completely simulated the real natural environment the test device area consisted of three reaction tanks a large water tank a small water tank multiple sets of distribution pipes and a submersible pump the planting of aquatic plants was yellow iris two different constructed wetland systems cell a and cell b were established their sizes were 2 0 m 1 0 m 0 6 m made of abs plastic with 15 mm thickness cell a was used to simulate vertical subsurface flow constructed wetlands as shown in fig 1 b the soil layer thickness was 30 cm 10 cm thickness of quartz sand was laid on the bottom and a pvc pipe with holes was used to collect groundwater samples one vertical pipe was set at the outlet about 15 cm from the bottom and the groundwater level was kept constant in the reaction tank overflow control cell b was used to simulate surface flow constructed wetlands as shown in fig 1 c soil layer thickness was 40 cm and the water level was kept at 10 cm from the bottom in the three reaction tank inlets a switch adjusting the flow rate and a flow meter recording the flow rate were provided at each outlet and inlet by driving the farmland back into the water storage tank from the channel a water tank was installed at the outlet of the water storage device to control the water level of the influent and water level of the inflow was consistent after being connected to the reaction pool through the distribution port the reaction pools were operated in parallel and the water was continuously fed in and out while the inlet and outlet water flow rates were adjusted through the inlet and outlet valves during the test the growth of the plants was observed daily while the height of the plants was measured regularly pre test preparation was made with the soil bulk density determination the soil mass calculation and its fill into the experimental device soil saturated moisture content and soil nitrogen content were simultaneously measured aquatic plants of yellow iris was planted in a 40 cm bundle consisting of 5 pieces the height of the plant was about 25 cm and they were planted in the device 4 days before the experiment to ensure its survival 2 2 sampling and analysis the farmland was pumped back into the storage tank and evenly flowed into the reaction tank through the pipeline the water was fed from one end at a constant flow rate the water level in the two reaction tanks and the flow rate in the three flow meters were recorded every day the import and export water samples and the groundwater samples were collected once every three days to measure the ammonia nitrogen nitrate nitrogen and total nitrogen we also measured the temperature of the water and ph the plant nitrogen content and soil nitrogen content at the bottom were measured every 15 days the water samples and soil samples should be stored in the refrigerator in a timely manner the temperature was 0 4 c to prevent the samples from deteriorating and affecting the test results the water soil and plant samples obtained were all prepared for testing after the water samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm filter head the method of determination was in accordance with the water and wastewater monitoring and analysis methods sepa 2009 where the ammonia nitrogen was determined by using nessler s reagent spectrophotometer method water quality ammonia nitrogen determination nessler s reagent spectrophotometric method hj535 2009 and nitrate nitrogen was determined by using the ultraviolet spectrophotometric method determination of water quality nitrate salt uv differentiation spectrophotometry hj t346 2007 which was used to determine the total nitrogen soil nitrogen and plants nitrogen after digestion with a continuous flow analyzer and the average initial characteristics of the wastewater in the study is shown in table 1 3 a mathematical model of nitrogen transformation and removal the nitrogen available for plant uptake and root zone release depends on different nitrogen species transformations that undergo in the soil water plant atmosphere system chowdary et al 2004 the conceptual nitrogen transformations and removal description with major processes were described in fig 2 the ecological restoration model has considered organic nitrogen ammonia nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen as the major forms of nitrogen including organic nitrogen ammonia nitrogen nitrate nitrogen in the wastewater nitrogen in the sediment and organic nitrogen in plants zhang 2012 because nitrate nitrogen changed into gass n oxide and nitrous oxide by denitrification the amount of gass n was very small the reaction equation was ignored to understand the relationship between the model results and the case study the systems were modeled by a set of differential equations called the mass balance equation the main conversion mechanisms considered in the model included nine types of reactions such as mineralization nitrification denitrification plant uptake sedimentation plant decaying process regeneration adsorption of ammonia nitrogen on sediment into water volatilization uptake of ammonia and nitrates into organic nitrogen by microorganisms mayo and bigambo 2005 wang et al 2009 all these transformation processes are carried out by both suspended and biofilm biomass therefore mathematical equations developed in this study would incorporate the suspended and attached biomass activities in determining the mathematical expressions a complete material balance including all forms of substances produced and consumed in

and is proportional to the light intensity the absorption rates of ammonia nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen are basically the same and they are in direct proportion to the concentration of inorganic

4 1 model calibration and parameter optimization by fitting the mathematical model to the experimental data based on the empirical values of each parameter the unknown parameters in the model were identified the numerical solution of the differential equations was solved by a genetic algorithm combined with the least squares method of nonlinear optimization and independently programmed by matlab 2017a software in the program nonlinear optimization is achieved by lsqnonlin lsqnonlin is a subroutine function of matlab and it is a general algorithm for solving nonlinear least squares problem the input parameter of the subroutine lsqnonlin is the error between the predicted and measured values the initial value of the unknown parameter is obtained by ode45 to solve the differential equation group based on process and literature knowledge since the initial value of the least squares method has a great influence on the result the genetic algorithm is used to find the optimal initial value which will be substituted into the model and then the equation is solved with the ode45 subroutine to generate the final parameter value the same group of data was repeatedly fitted to calculate the parameters and multiple groups of parameters were obtained to calculate the average value the ph value measured in cell a is 8 5 or less but it is generally worthwhile to consider the volatilization of ammonia with ph 8 5 lian et al 2011 therefore the volatilization effect of ammonia gas is not considered in this model the model parameters were fitted by using data of cell a from august 1 2017 to september 1 2017 based on the empirical values of various parameters the measured values are brought into the matlab program to identify the unknown parameters and most parameters are within the empirical range table 2 lists some of the unknown parameters and the corresponding identified values after calibration it was found that the organic nitrogen released from plant spoilage and roots was 31 678 mg l 1 d 1 the release of organic nitrogen depends on a variety of factors such as vegetation biomass temperature and the decay rate of nutrients however the data related to these factors are lacking in addition there is little description in the literature for nitrogen release from biodegradation nitrogen assimilation is the inorganic nitrogen conversion into organic nitrogen form and this serves as a building block for cells and tissues where ammonia nitrogen and nitrate are the two main forms of nitrogen sources by calculation the ammonia nitrogen assimilation rate 134 564 mg l 1 d 1 is much greater than the nitrate nitrogen assimilation rate 83 784 mg l 1 d 1 this is similar to the study by shin and polprasert 1988 and autotrophic microorganisms absorb ammonia nitrogen preferentially 4 2 model solution method stella is a powerful system dynamics software consisting of stella architect stella designer and stella professional stella architect is an advanced modeling and interactive simulation software stella designer makes dynamic system thinking briefs and stella professional is dynamic stella is a complete modeling tool for modeling policy analysis and strategy development therefore stella was used as a simulation tool for ecological dynamics in this study various operating parameters and related ecological dynamic equations were input into stella 9 1 3 software to establish a dynamic model and various biochemical reaction processes were cascaded to form the structural model of the stella system as shown in fig 2 the four basic building blocks of stella were used in the modeling process including stock flow converter and connector which was shown in fig 3 stock is the most fundamental building block for modeling used to represent the accumulation of things both material and non material and can be used to represent state variables the above model uses five state variables namely no3 n nh4 n org n plant n and biomass flow is used to describe the activities in the system streams connected to the stack will cause the stack to increase or decrease the direction of flow can be divided into unidirectional flow and bidirectional flow unidirectional streams can only take non negative values and bidirectional streams can take any value streams are generally unidirectional but in some cases it may be necessary to use the same stream to represent the input and output of a stack and then use bidirectional streams stella kinetic model structure for this study was presented in fig 4 from the figure we can see that the flow was used to represent the input and output items in the system namely inflow nh4 outflow nh4 inflow no3 outflow no3 influent organic nitrogen inflow org n outflow org n and conversion between ammonia nitrogen nitrate nitrogen organic nitrogen and plant nitrogen including nitrification denitrification mineralization plant decay assimilation 1 and assimilation 2 the connector is a red line with an arrow or a dashed line in fig 3 the difference between a connector and a stream is that the connector passes information and the stream transfers material the converter is very powerful and is often used to receive information and transfer it to other modules for other variables it can be connected to streams or converters but not to the stack it contains equations that produce output values over time while it also accepts information and passes it to other variables in the model and the converter can also be used to store constants 4 3 statistical analysis the calibrated parameters were input into the stella model to simulate the effluent concentrations of organic nitrogen ammonia nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen in cell a the model simulations observations and influent concentrations of ammonia nitrogen nitrate nitrogen and organic nitrogen in cell a are shown in figs 5 7 respectively from the figures we can see that the model simulation results were in agreement with the observed data overall in fig 5 the simulated effluent nh4 n concentration is equivalent to the observed concentration especially there is no high or low peak changes for effluent nh4 n the average simulated value of nh4 n is 2 380 mg l 1 and the average observed nh4 n is 2 396 mg l 1 these two averaged value were very close which indicated that the model could simulate the effluent nh4 n concentrations the relationship between simulated and observed effluent nh4 n concentrations in fig 5 is similar to the relationship between simulated and observed effluent no3 n concentration in fig 6 while in fig 6 the average simulated value for the effluent no3 n concentrations is 0 404 mg l 1 and the corresponding average observed value is 0 408 mg l 1 the average simulated value is approximately the same as the average observed value which indicated that the model could successfully simulate the effluent no3 n concentrations however there was a large difference on the 4th day the observed effluent no3 n concentration on that day was 0 518 mg l 1 and the simulated effluent no3 n concentration was 0 609 mg l 1 this may be because the effluent no3 n concentration was simulated based on the effluent nh4 n concentration by nitration from fig 5 it can be seen that the effluent concentration of nh4 n on the fourth day was relatively large which resulted in a higher simulated value of effluent no3 n concentration on the same date in fig 7 the average effluent organic nitrogen concentration of the model simulation was 9 063 mg l 1 which was close to the average observed value as 8 418 mg l 1 this suggested that the model in this study could simulate the effluent organic nitrogen concentration in the experiment both the simulated effluent organic nitrogen concentration and the observed concentration were lower than the influent concentration in a whole which indicated that the dissolved oxygen concentration in the device is relatively high this is because under aerobic conditions the ammoniated efficiency is higher than that of anaerobic so more organic nitrogen could be converted to nh4 n and the organic nitrogen concentration in the effluent would be lower in a word figs 5 7 showed that the model could reflect the trends of three different forms of nitrogen concentrations in water however there were still differences between the simulated results and the measured concentrations in the effluent in order to quantitatively analyze the accuracy of the model simulation results three statistical analysis parameters namely correlation coefficient r 2 root mean square error rmse willmott 1982 and nash efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 were used and they were defined as following 12 r 2 i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n y i y 2 13 rmse i 1 n y i y i 2 n 14 nse 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where n is the number of all observation data in the effluent y i represents the ith measured effluent concentration value mg l 1 y represents the average concentration of the measured value mg l 1 y i represents the simulated concentration value corresponding to the ith measured effluent concentration value mg l 1 and the calculation results were shown in table 3 comparing the data in the above table it could be found that the model was accurate for the simulated nitrate nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen concentration but there was a big gap for the simulated and observed ammonia nitrogen concentration this is maybe because there was a certain bias in the calibration based on empirical values the parameters nitrification r n mineralization r m the rate of nitrogen utilized by plants uptake for growth r p1 in the literature were limited to the operation in specific conditions but the biochemical reaction process changed with time quickly which is calculated as a constant in this study it is maybe also because there was not enough experimental data which resulted in larger errors 4 4 model validation without neglecting the interference of external conditions both of cell a and cell b can be used to describe the transformation process of nitrogen the experimental data of cell b from august 5 2017 to september 1 2017 was used to verify the model the effluent concentration of nh4 n org n and no3 n in cell b were simulated by substituting the identified parameters of section 4 1 into the stella kinetic model the corresponding results were shown in figs 8 10 it could be seen from the figures that the effluent nh4 n org n and no3 n concentrations were lower than the influent concentrations which indicated that the plants had a purifying effect on nitrogen pollution it could also be seen from the figures that the simulated data had the same trends with the observed data for the effluent nh4 n org n and no3 n concentrations in cell b moreover the average simulated value of effluent ammonia nitrogen concentration was 0 4786 mg l 1 and the actual observed average value was 0 4194 mg l 1 while the average simulated value of effluent nitrate nitrogen concentration was 0 3462 mg l 1 and the actual observed average value was 0 4194 mg l 1 meanwhile the average simulated value of the effluent organic nitrogen concentration was 17 8899 mg l 1 and the actual observed average value was 15 6667 mg l 1 therefore the simulated data and observed data in the figures indicates that the model simulates the effluent concentrations of nh4 n org n and no3 n in cell b based on the identified parameters moreover statistical analysis for parameters were shown in table 4 there were partial deviations between the model simulated values and the observed values but they could reflect the concentrations variation in a whole the simulated effluent nitrate nitrogen concentration in fig 10 was not very good which may be due to the fact that cell b was in a flooded state where anaerobic microorganisms were active this was belonged to the reducing environment and denitrifying bacteria were active resulting in a decrease of the nitrate concentration in effluent 4 5 simulation results analysis of ecological dynamic model and traditional first order dynamic model for a long time some people have evaluated the design operation and removal effects of constructed wetlands based on the first order kinetic model proposed by epa the model was simple and practical with a small amount of calculation requiring less parameter data however it was assumed in the model that the influent water concentration was constant and that the inflow and outflow flow rates remained constant and the water flow was assumed to be ideal it is obvious that the concentration and flow of influent water in an actual constructed wetland project are unlikely to be constant and will change over time these constraints directly affect the prediction of water quality by the first order kinetic model resulting in great simulation errors and the first order kinetic model is usually expressed as following 15 c out c in e k v t where c in was the influent concentration mg l 1 c out was the effluent concentration mg l 1 k v was the volume removal rate constant d 1 t was the hydraulic retention time d in order to verify the accuracy of the ecological dynamic model established in this study the first order kinetic model of tn removal was established based on the data from august 1th 2017 to september 1th 2017 in cell a the least squares method was used to filter and fit the original data and the simulated results with the first order kinetic model and fit curve were shown in fig 11 from the figure we could see that the first order kinetic model equation of tn removal in cell a was c o u t c in 0 6686 e 0 011 t so the deformation coefficient was c o u t c in 0 6686 e 0 011 â t and the correlation coefficient of the fitting curve was r 2 0 8254 this equation was used to predict the effluent concentration in cell a from august 1th to september 1th 2017 which was compared with the actual observed effluent tn concentration the simulated effluent tn concentrations with first order kinetic model and ecological dynamics model in the study observed data of the effluent tn concentrations and influent tn concentrations were shown in fig 12 from the figure we can see that the simulated data for the effluent tn concentrations by the ecological dynamics model in this study was much closer to the simulated data that by the first order kinetic model which suggested that the developed ecological dynamics model in this study is better and more efficient to simulate the effluent tn concentrations in cell a moreover the sum square ss was used to indicate the difference between the simulated value and observed value and simulated effluent tn concentrations in two models were shown in table 5 from table 5 we can see that the ss with the ecological dynamic model in the study 25 8456 mg2 l 2 was much less than that with the first order kinetic model 295 4318 mg2 l 2 it further indicated that the ecological dynamic model in the study was more accurate than the first order kinetic model to simulate the effluent tn concentration and it can reflect the actual effluent tn concentration change of the constructed wetland in cell a the average observed effluent tn concentration was 11 856 mg l 1 while the simulated average value with the first order kinetic model and ecological dynamics model in this study was 11 222 mg l 1 and 12 390 mg l 1 respectively which suggested that simulated data by the ecological dynamics model was closer to the observed data than that by first order kinetic model it was further proved that the developed ecological dynamics model in this study was more accurate to simulate the effluent tn concentrations in cell a this was mainly due to the fact that the ecological dynamics model took into account various forms of nitrogen and various biophysical and chemical effects which was of more information than the first order kinetic model 5 conclusions in this paper the design on site sampling laboratory testing and various transformation laws for two different forms of constructed wetlands were compared to analyze the removal effects of pollutants from two kinds of constructed wetlands the important factors influencing the nitrogen removal efficiency were determined through analysis based on the understanding of the relationship and principles of nitrogen transformation a conceptual model of ecological dynamics was established and the unknown parameters in the model were identified by using a genetic algorithm combined with least squares method finally the nitrogen changes in the wetland system were determined by using stella software the process was simulated and the model was verified with the measured data based on the ecological dynamics model and the conservation mass law an ecological dynamic model for the nitrogen restoration in the farmland was established the effect of ammonia nitrogen nitrate nitrogen and organic nitrogen concentration in the effluent of cell a pond was found the ecological dynamic model of nitrogen cycle and the first order kinetic model of removing tn were compared and analyzed for the cell a it was shown that the ecological dynamic model could accurately predict the change of the effluent concentration in the constructed wetland the model can provide theoretical support for the design and operation of the constructed wetland which can provide the prediction of the effluent concentration to facilitate the mastery of the actual purification effect for the constructed wetland however because of the long repair cycle only one aquatic plant was selected in our study in future wetlands and plant types will be considered and many natural factors such as some nitrogen conversion on dead plants and the effects of plant growth stages on nitrogen removal can not be considered by the model parameters which is a further issue needs to study moreover the empirical parameters used in the model are constants which may lead to model bias in future experiments physical and chemical indexes can be added to make the parameters of the model more accurate moreover the plant n uptake should also be measured in future study declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

6127,soil moisture systems generally exhibit complex spatiotemporal patterns due to their nonlinear interactions with surrounding environments in this paper the possible existence of chaotic behaviors in soil moisture time series was investigated using the chaos theory specifically based on the techniques of phase space reconstruction correlation dimension cd largest lyapunov exponent lle and local approximation prediction lap methods daily soil moisture data for six years along with different influencing factors were obtained for 35 nebraska mesonet nm stations with varying hydroclimatic conditions and soil properties the results of cds and lles revealed the presence of chaos in soil moisture systems implying that soil moisture dynamics was controlled by deterministic systems with a limited number of governing variables the results obtained by the lap method offered further evidence on the chaotic behavior of soil moisture systems specifically median of cd values of 4 51 4 06 3 23 and 1 40 were obtained for soil moisture time series at the depths of 10 25 50 and 100 cm respectively indicating that the complexity of soil moisture systems decreased with increasing depth moreover the correlations of cds with different influencing factors showed that the dominant controls on soil moisture dynamics switched at different depths at shallower depths e g 10 and 25 cm cds were more correlated with meteorological forcings while stronger correlations emerged between cds and soil texture in deeper soil layers e g 50 and 100 cm as the first attempt to analyze the complexity of soil moisture systems from the perspective of the chaos theory the results of this study offer additional avenues for understanding chaotic behaviors of soil moisture dynamics keywords soil moisture chaos deterministic correlation dimension local approximation prediction nebraska mesonet 1 introduction hydrological processes generally exhibit complex temporal and spatial patterns in part due to their highly nonlinear interactions with the surrounding environment sivapalan 2003 mcdonnell et al 2007 sivakumar and singh 2012 for instance as an important state variable in terrestrial water cycles soil moisture interacts with a multitude of environmental factors in complex nonlinear manners such as climate koster et al 2004 soil vereecken et al 2007 wang et al 2019 and vegetation abedi koupai et al 2008 wang et al 2015 as a result soil moisture tends to display considerable spatial and temporal variability from field to regional scales brocca et al 2010 given the importance of soil moisture in controlling various land surface and subsurface processes it is thus imperative to understand the spatial and temporal characteristics of soil moisture dynamics and associated influencing factors across different spatial and temporal scales brocca et al 2010 vereecken et al 2014 the substantial variability in hydrological response to external forcings such as soil moisture systems presents grand challenges to the scientific community for understanding their underlying controls and more importantly for predicting their spatial and temporal evolutions in order to search for common spatial and temporal patterns numerous concepts and techniques sometimes even contradictory ones have been proposed to diagnose the signals embedded in hydrological processes for example there have been intense debates as to whether uncertainty in hydrological processes is of stochastic or chaotic origins see the reviews by sivakumar 2004 conceptually a stochastic system is governed by a large number of variables of which only statistical structures are known therefore it is not easy to predict system behaviors even within short term ranges by comparison the chaos theory suggests that a nonlinear deterministic system which can be described by only a few independent variables and nonlinear partial differential equations can also produce complex dynamic patterns may 1976 the main characteristic of chaotic systems is that small perturbations in the initial conditions may have tremendous effects on long term evolutions of the systems e g the so called butterfly effect resulting in the limited long term predictability of the system behaviors since the 1970 s the chaos theory has witnessed its burgeoning applications in numerous scientific fields such as atmospheric science astronomy geophysics and economics c f yasmin and sivakumar 2018 li et al 2019 gilmore 2019 despite the controversy revolving around the applicability of the chaos theory in the field of hydrology i e whether low dimensional chaos exists in hydrological systems it has attracted a great deal of attention in the past to quantitatively analyze the complexity of hydrological processes most notably streamflow and rainfall among existing techniques e g correlation dimension cd lyapunov exponent and kolmogorov entropy the cd method has been mostly adopted for analyzing the chaotic behaviors of hydrological processes for instance rodriguez iturbe et al 1989 studied rainfall time series at two different temporal scales i e 15 s vs weekly using the cd method the authors found a low cd of 3 78 and chaotic behavior in the 15 s rainfall data whereas the chaotic behavior was shown to be absent in the weekly rainfall data later studies also reported the existence of low dimensional chaos i e low cd in rainfall data at various locations and temporal scales sivakumar 2001 fuwape et al 2017 similar issues were also raised on the existence of chaotic behaviors in streamflow e g porporato and ridolfi 1997 sivakumar and singh 2012 karunasingha and liong 2018 the application of the chaos theory in hydrological studies has been broadened including streamflow and rainfall prediction and catchment classification dhanya and kumar 2010 sivakumar 2017 the importance of soil moisture is manifested by its role in linking atmosphere biosphere and hydrosphere through affecting a variety of land surface and subsurface processes seneviratne et al 2010 however to the authors knowledge no attempt has been made yet to examine whether chaos exists in soil moisture systems it is thus of great interest to investigate the soil moisture dynamics using the chaos theory for both research and application purposes as such the primary goals of this study were two fold 1 to examine the existence of chaos in soil moisture systems and 2 to explore the factors that affect the complexity of soil moisture systems based on the chaos theory to this end long term daily soil moisture data for six years were acquired from the nebraska mesonet nm located in the continental united states along with hydrometeorological and soil property data here we used the cd largest lyapunov exponent lle and local approximation prediction lap methods to investigate whether soil moisture systems existed chaotic behaviors the results of this study offer additional revenues for understanding soil moisture dynamics and relevant influencing factors for the soil moisture system complexity from the perspective of the chaos theory 2 materials and methodology 2 1 study area and data the soil moisture data at the depths of 10 25 50 and 100 cm analyzed in this study were obtained from the nm https mesonet unl edu previously known as the automated weather data network which reports soil moisture conditions across the state of nebraska united states fig 1 the detailed information on the nm can be found elsewhere e g you et al 2010 wang et al 2016 and only a brief description is given here the study area has a continental semiarid climate type with mean annual precipitation p ranging from around 300 mm year in the west to more than 700 mm year in the east wang et al 2016 meanwhile during the study period from 2008 to 2013 the study region experienced both wet e g 2008 with mean annual precipitation of the selected nm stations of 660 mm year and dry e g 2012 with mean annual precipitation of 292 mm year periods the nm sites are covered by natural grasses under rainfed conditions without anthropogenic disturbances and soil texture varies considerably across those sites istanbulluoglu et al 2012b table 1 provides the summary of the 35 nm stations which were selected in this study for the chaotic analysis of soil moisture dynamics specifically daily soil moisture data spanning from 2008 to 2013 were retrieved from the selected stations at the depths of 10 25 50 and 100 cm note that due to deep water tables groundwater was assumed to play a negligible role in affecting soil moisture dynamics at the sites wang et al 2016 at each site volumetric soil moisture content was measured using theta probes ml2x delta t devices cambridge uk which was then quality controlled for any further use you et al 2010 in addition daily precipitation and potential evapotranspiration etp from 2008 to 2013 were acquired from the nm which were integrated to mean annual values i e p and et p for the analysis to diagnose the factors that affect the complexity of soil moisture systems we investigated the associations between soil moisture dynamics and environmental variables including soil texture meteorological forcings e g precipitation and potential evapotranspiration topographic attributes and vegetation characteristics due to the lack of in situ data on soil properties the global soil database of shangguan et al 2014 was used to extract sand and clay fractions at each site based on the geographical coordinates the accuracy of shangguan et al 2014 s soil database has been tested using in situ measurements across the continental united states with satisfactory results avery et al 2016 topographic attributes e g slope aspect and topographic wetness index twi were derived from a 30 m digital elevation model dem http dnr ne gov digital elevation models the method of beven and kirkby 1979 was utilized to compute twis based on the dem in addition annual gross net primary production gpp npp were used to approximate vegetation conditions during the study period annual npp data were obtained from the modis17 dataset http www ntsg umt edu project mod17 since gpp data from the modis17 dataset were given at 8 day intervals annual gpp data were synthesized using 1350 scenes of 8 day gpp images at each site 2 2 correlation dimension method the cd method has been widely used for analyzing chaotic behaviors of hydrological systems c f sivakumar 2017 a cd of a time series of a hydrological variable indicates the number of dominant variables that control the temporal evolution of the hydrological system in general systems with infinite cd values are considered to be stochastic whereas the ones with finite non integer cd values are considered to be chaotic see sivakumar 2017 for detailed discussions furthermore it is generally believed that systems with high cds are more complex while those with low cds are simpler and exhibit low dimensional deterministic behaviors various algorithms have been proposed to calculate cds among which the algorithm of grassberger and procaccia 1983 was mostly used denoted as the g p algorithm hereafter the g p algorithm adopts the concept of phase space reconstruction for representing the dynamics of a system from a single variable time series the phase space also called state space presents all possible data points of a time series of the variable therefore each point represents one state of the underlying dynamic system geometrically if these points are attracted into a region in the phase space towards which the system tends to evolve this set of data points is known as an attractor following previous studies e g sivakumar 2017 taken s delay embedding theorem was adopted for reconstructing the phase space of soil moisture data in this study takens 1981 specifically given a time series x i i 1 2 n a multi dimensional phase space can be reconstructed as 1 y j x j x j τ x j 2 τ x j m 1 τ where j 1 2 n m 1 τ n and m are the dimension of x i and y j respectively called embedding dimension and τ is the time delay choosing optimal τ and m is critical for the phase space reconstruction in this study the value of τ was selected when the autocorrelation function of the soil moisture data dropped to 1 1 e of its initial values where e is base of natural logarithm rosenstein et al 1994 the optimal m was determined based on the false nearest neighbor fnn method with the fraction of fnn dropped to zero kennel et al 1992 for the reconstructed m dimensional phase space in eqs 1 the correlation function c r m is defined as 2 c r m lim m 2 m m 1 i j 1 m h r y i y j 1 i j m where y i y j is defined as the euclidean distance between y i and y j and h u is the heaviside function with h u 1 for u greater than 0 and h u 0 for u 0 where u r y i y j and r is the radius of a sphere centered on y i or y j if there exists an attractor in the reconstructed phase space the correlation exponent d2 m has a relationship with c r m through the following equation 3 c r m r 0 n α r d 2 m where α is a constant d 2 m is usually determined by fitting a straight line through ln r vs ln c r m over a certain range of r i e scaling region using the least squares method note that the determination of scaling regions is critical for computing cds however previous g p applications relied on visual inspections to choose scaling regions which was not adaptive and subject to human errors di et al 2018 here an improved g p algorithm proposed by di et al 2018 was used to compute cds this new method is based on the normal k means clustering technique and the random sample consensus algorithm ransac to select scaling regions finally cd can be obtained according to the relationship between d2 m and m by varying m if d2 m reaches a saturation value after a certain value of m the saturation value is defined as the cd of the time series x i 2 3 largest lyapunov exponent the lyapunov exponent is another commonly used metric for the estimation of chaos in a system it quantifies the rate of separation between two infinitesimally close trajectories in the phase space generally the existence of a positive lyapunov exponent indicates the presence of chaos in a system while a negative one indicates that the system is stable or exhibits periodic behaviors rodriguez iturbe et al 1989 otherwise if the lyapunov exponent is 0 it suggests that the underlying system is in a quasi stable state in applications the lle is usually utilized to identify whether a system exhibits chaotic behaviors wolf et al 1985 rosenstein et al 1993 similar to the computation of cds the phase space reconstruction is also the first step for calculating lles here the optimal τ and m were selected as previously described the method proposed by wolf et al 1985 was employed to compute the lle denoted as î max 4 λ max 1 t m t 0 i 1 m ln l t i l t i 1 where l t i and l t i 1 are the euclidean distance between two closest neighboring points on two different trajectories in the phase space at time ti and ti 1 respectively the ratio of l t i l t i 1 describes the temporal evolution of these two points on the attractor in eqs 4 t 0 is the time at the initial point m is the number of iterations and t m is the final iteration time as m increases the value of the exponent converges to a constant which is viewed as î max when î max 0 there exists at least one positive lyapunov exponent indicating chaotic behaviors whereas λ max 0 indicates that the time series has a regular motion process 2 4 local approximation prediction another chaos identification method is an inverse approach using the nonlinear prediction casdagli 1989 islam and sivakumar 2002 such as the lap method using lap chaotic time series can be predicted within a short range based on the phase space reconstruction according to eq 1 to represent underlying dynamics of the system the basic idea for the phase space based prediction is to assume a functional relationship between the current state y j and future state y j t to predict the future state in the form 5 y j t f t y j where y j and y j t are m dimensional vectors and t is time lag to predict y j t it is necessary to find an appropriate predictor f t to approximate f t in this study a classical and well known lap method proposed by farmer and sidorowich 1987 was employed for determining f t specifically it first subdivides the domain f t into different subsets i e neighborhood with each subset determining f t separately for the given state yj the k nearest neighbors n j y j p p 1 k of y j is identified by fixing a metric y j y j p then the local approximation function f t can be constructed using the least squares method 6 min f t p 1 k y j 1 p f t y j p 2 for determining f t local polynomial functions are recommended sivakumar 2007 in this study a cubic polynomial function was used to approximate f t to this point the prediction of y j t can be obtained by y j t f t y j in this way further predictions can be achieved forward step by step from a new state y j locally in the phase space in this study nash sutcliffe efficiency nse correlation coefficient r and coefficient of determination r 2 were used to assess the prediction accuracy of soil moisture using the lap method then the presence of chaos in the soil moisture time series can be determined on the basis of the results of the lap method casdagli 1989 islam and sivakumar 2002 theoretically if a system is chaotic the prediction accuracy will increase with increasing embedding dimensions to a certain point namely the optimal embedding dimension m opt whereas there would be no increase in the prediction accuracy with increasing embedding dimensions for a stochastic time series casdagli 1989 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of chaotic behaviors of soil moisture systems 3 1 1 phase space existence of chaos or not in a hydrological process can be first qualitatively evaluated by visually inspecting the reconstructed multi dimensional phase space using eq 1 taking the minden site see fig 1 as an example fig 2 a presents the daily soil moisture time series at 10 cm and precipitation data from 2008 to 2013 with m 1 and τ 1 day a 2 d phase space diagram xi xi 1 for the minden site is shown in fig 2b which characterizes the long term soil moisture behavior from 2008 to 2013 visually the trajectories were attracted to a a well structured narrow region called an attractor as shown in fig 2b indicating the soil moisture system was chaotic when x i 1 x i it suggests the input of water into the soil moisture system e g rainfall and the wetting arrow indicates the direction of the soil moisture trajectories during rainfall events when xi 1 xi it indicates the net loss of soil moisture due to leakage and evapotranspiration and the drying arrow illustrates the direction of soil moisture trajectories during draw down periods to compare the complexity of soil moisture dynamics at different sites four sites i e sidney minden meadagro farm and higgins ranch with different mean annual precipitation are selected as representations and the phase space diagrams are shown in fig 3 in general if an attractor follows a clear pattern i e the attractor has well structure and relative deterministic obits for example its trajectories have obvious cycles but not irregular structures and evolve within a relative narrow boundary the dynamics of the underlying soil moisture system can be considered as simple with low dimensional deterministic characteristics otherwise it is perceived as complex with high dimensional stochastic characteristics as can be seen in fig 3 soil moisture levels varied noticeably across locations and at different depths for example higgins ranch had the lowest soil moisture content and subsequently the narrowest range of orbits in the phase space among the four sites however its soil moisture trajectories cannot be seen clearly to resolve this issue following previous studies sivakumar 2017 soil moisture data were normalized using the equation xi x min x max x min where xi is soil moisture data on day i and x max and x min are maximum and minimum values of soil moisture time series respectively the phase space diagrams for the normalized soil moisture data are shown in fig 4 overall the soil moisture trajectories in fig 4 show clear patterns and evolve within a boundary suggesting certain low dimensional deterministic behaviors of soil moisture however the degree of the complexity of the attractors differed considerably first for all sites the attractors at shallower depths e g 10 and 25 cm had more complex geometries over the phase space than those at deeper depths e g 50 and 100 cm suggesting that soil moisture systems were more complex or temporally dynamic at shallower depths in addition fig 4 shows that at the same depth the complexity of the attractors also varied noticeably across locations for instance the attractors obtained for sidney and minden were defined within relatively narrower regions and had clearer trajectories in the reconstructed phase space indicating that associated soil moisture dynamics were simpler with lower dimensions at those two sites by comparison the trajectories for the meadagro farm and the higgins ranch were more complex and scattered over the phase space especially at the depths of 10 and 25 cm indicating that the soil moisture systems had more complex behaviors with higher dimensions at those two sites overall the phase space diagrams show evidence for chaotic behavior and that the complexity of soil moisture systems at the nm sites depended both on specific depths and locations 3 1 2 correlation dimension before calculating the cd and lle the time delay τ of each soil moisture time series was determined by autocorrelation functions as previously explained and the optimal m was determined by the fnn method the values of τ and m for all 35 nm stations are given in table 1s the cds of soil moisture were then calculated using the improved g p method of di et al 2018 to illustrate the calculation procedures in details fig 5 shows the results for the soil moisture data at 10 cm at minden the optimal τ was found to be 22 days as the autocorrelation function first crossed the 1 1 e of its initial value fig 5a fig 5b shows that the fraction of the false nearest neighbors dropped to 0 when m increased to 12 indicating that the percentage of close neighboring points stayed constant when m was larger than 12 as such the value of 12 was determined as the optimal embedding dimension kennel et al 1992 the relationships between ln c r m and ln r with m varying from 2 to 20 are shown in fig 5c and d displays the obtained relationship between d2 m and m it can be seen that cd increased to approximately 4 22 and then flattened when m reached 12 which was called as a saturation value according to the dynamical system theory the number of dominant variables that are needed to describe the underlying system can be denoted by the next highest integer value above the correlation dimension sivakumar 2017 therefore the result indicated that there were 5 variables that governed the evolution of the soil moisture system at 10 cm at minden and that an attractor of low dimensionality i e 5 existed in the soil moisture system with chaotic behaviors the cd values for the soil moisture time series at four different depths for all 35 nm sites are listed in table 2s and shown in fig 6 a overall the cd values provide a preliminary support for the presence of chaotic behaviors in soil moisture dynamics at the nm sites specifically the cds for soil moisture varied in the ranges of 3 20 6 10 median 4 51 2 28 5 70 4 06 1 65 4 90 3 23 and 1 01 3 97 1 40 at the depths of 10 25 50 and 100 cm respectively table 2 clearly the obtained cd values tended to decrease with increasing depth meaning that soil moisture systems were more complex and temporally dynamic at shallower depths with higher dimensionality than those at deeper depths this finding is consistent with our interpretation from the phase space diagrams in fig 3 on average the mean cd values indicated there were approximately 5 5 4 and 2 dominant variables which primarily controlled soil moisture dynamics at the depths of 10 25 50 and 100 cm respectively at the nm sites more importantly the low cd values we found at the nm sites suggests that the soil moisture time series are the outcome of deterministic systems and thus soil moisture is highly predictable if inputs are well characterized our study also suggests that if the dominant variables that control soil moisture dynamics can be identified process based model complexity for predicting soil moisture at different soil depths could be different which could make predictions more certain 3 1 3 largest lyapunov exponent due to the limitations associated with the cd method for detecting low dimensional chaos in hydrological systems e g data size data noise and time delay selection see sivakumar 2017 for details the lle method was also employed to further examine the possible existence of chaotic characteristics in soil moisture time series at the nm sites based on the values of optimal τ and m from table 1s the lle values computed for all soil moisture time series are shown in fig 6b across the nm sites the ranges of lles for soil moisture were 0 011 0 066 median 0 036 0 012 0 052 0 030 0 002 0 048 0 014 and 0 0 025 0 007 at the depths of 10 25 50 and 100 cm respectively table 2 the decreasing trend in the lles with increasing depth confirmed the aforementioned results from the analysis of phase space diagrams and cds moreover the positive lles indicate that the soil moisture systems at the nm sites exhibit chaotic characteristics note that some of the lles were 0 at 100 cm implying that the soil moisture time series were marginally stable and might have a periodic attractor sivakumar 2017 it could be attributed to the fact that soil moisture was more temporally stable in deeper soil layers due to less influences of land surface processes on soil moisture dynamics zhang and shao 2017 to evaluate the consistency of the results between cds and lles the nonparametric spearman s rank and kendall s tau correlation methods were utilized to quantify the relationship between cds and lles the spearman s rank correlation coefficient rs is 0 883 significant at p 0 001 at 10 cm 0 920 p 0 001 at 25 cm 0 902 p 0 001 at 50 cm and 0 708 p 0 001 at 100 cm the kendall s tau correlation coefficient is 0 724 p 0 001 at 10 cm 0 766 p 0 001 at 25 cm 0 756 p 0 001 at 50 cm and 0 558 p 0 001 at 100 cm the strong positive correlations between cds and lles attested the consistency of both methods in examining the chaotic characteristics of soil moisture dynamics in summary the results from the phase space diagram cd and lle analyses revealed that soil moisture systems at the nm sites were of deterministic types with chaotic behaviors in general due to the complexity of climate systems precipitation exhibits chaotic behaviors rodriguez iturbe et al 1989 sivakumar 2001 as external inputs e g precipitation into the soil moisture system the signal as in chaos embedded in precipitation propagates into the soil moisture system which leads to the chaotic behavior of soil moisture more importantly the propagation of the signal from precipitation to soil moisture can be modulated by the environmental factors that affect soil moisture dynamics as illustrated in the following section resulting in the varying degree of the complexity of soil moisture systems at different locations and depths nevertheless further investigation is still warranted to illustrate the nature of soil moisture processes e g deterministic vs stochastic across different landscapes and climate regimes 3 1 4 nonlinear prediction analysis the lap method was employed to further identify the presence of chaotic behavior and predict the soil moisture dynamics here 85 of the soil moisture data were used as a training dataset and the remaining 15 of the data were used as a testing dataset the phase space was reconstructed with embedding dimensions from 1 to 10 and predictions were made one step ahead figs 7 and 8 present the prediction results for soil moisture at 10 cm for sidney minden meadagro farm and higgins ranch taking the sidney site as an example fig 7a shows that the prediction accuracy increased with increasing embedding dimensions up to m 4 and then decreased when m greater than 4 the presence of an optimal embedding dimension m opt 4 r 0 965 and nse 0 927 indicated that the soil moisture dynamics exhibited chaotic behaviors casdagli 1989 furthermore the comparison between the observed and predicted values with r2 0 929 in fig 8a presents an excellent agreement in the overall trends and appearances such results indicate the good performance of phase space based lap method for predicting the soil moisture dynamics note that m opt 4 was also consistent with the correlation dimension cd 3 27 obtained at sidney indicating that there were approximately 4 variables that primarily controlled soil moisture dynamics at 10 cm at sidney similarly the best prediction results were achieved when the embedding dimension reached 5 r 0 969 and nse 0 937 6 r 0 972 and nse 0 943 and 6 r 0 917 and nse 0 824 for minden meadagro farm and higgins ranch respectively the good agreement between predicted and observed data with r 2 0 939 0 942 and 0 832 for minden meadagro farm and higgins ranch respectively revealed the suitability of lap method for forecasting the soil moisture dynamics fig 8b d 3 2 controls on soil moisture system complexity understanding the complexity of hydrological systems can be astonishingly challenging mostly due to the nonlinear interactions among interconnected parts in hydrological systems sivakumar and singh 2012 especially for soil moisture it can be further complicated by spatial heterogeneities in climate inputs land surface processes vegetation dynamics and soil properties all of which can affect soil moisture dynamics seneviratne et al 2010 wang et al 2017 for example as indicated in fig 6 the complexity of soil moisture systems at the nm sites varied considerably across locations and at different depths therefore it is of great interest to further assess the impacts of different environmental controls on the soil moisture system complexity to this end the correlations of cds with different factors including soil texture meteorological forcings topographical attributes and vegetation characteristics were considered in this study note that the correlations of lles with those factors are not discussed here because of the strong correlations between cds and lles as previously shown the rs values between cds and different factors derived from the 35 nm sites are reported in table 3 interestingly table 3 shows that the dominant factors that controlled cds switched at different depths specifically cds were primarily correlated with meteorological forcings at the depths of 10 and 25 cm there existed significant positive correlations between cds and p with rs 0 680 p 0 001 at 10 cm and rs 0 534 p 0 01 at 25 cm whereas a strong negative correlation emerged between cds and et p at 10 cm with rs 0 439 p 0 01 for further illustration the relationships of cds with p and et p are also shown in fig 9 the positive correlation between cds and p and the negative one between cds and et p are obvious in fig 9 at the depths of 10 and 25 cm whereas no significant correlation can be seen between cds and p and et p at the depths of 50 and 100 cm overall with increasing depth the correlation of cds with p and et p weakened at the nm sites clearly meteorological forcings were the primary controls on soil moisture dynamics and thus the complexity of soil moisture systems in near surface soil layers across the study region physically with higher levels of p the occurrence of rainfall events tended to become more frequent resulting in more wetting drying cycles of soil moisture and subsequently more complex soil moisture systems which can be also demonstrated by fig 2b as such there existed positive correlations between cds and p however as land surface processes had less influences on soil moisture dynamics in deeper soil layers zhang and shao 2017 the positive correlation between cds and p disappeared at deeper depths meanwhile there was a strong negative relationship between p and et p across nebraska wang et al 2016 which could be the explanation for the negative correlation between cds and et p at 10 cm by comparison soil texture exerted much less influences on cds at the depths of 10 and 25 cm however cds had much stronger correlations with soil texture at the depths of 50 and 100 cm table 3 specifically at the depths of 50 and 100 cm cds were significantly correlated with sand fraction in positive manners i e rs 0 433 and p 0 01 at 50 cm and rs 0 420 and p 0 05 at 100 cm whereas negative correlations existed between cds and silt fraction i e rs 0 445 and p 0 01 at 50 cm and rs 0 344 and p 0 05 at 100 cm and clay fraction i e rs 0 494 and p 0 01 at 50 cm and rs 0 424 and p 0 05 at 100 cm for illustration fig 10 shows the relationships of cds with sand silt and clay fractions at different depths as expected fig 10 shows that no obvious correlations existed between cds and soil texture at the depths of 10 and 25 cm whereas the positive correlation between cds and sand fraction and negative ones between cds and silt and clay fractions were clearer at the depths of 50 and 100 cm physically coarser textured soils tend to have lower water holding capacities and larger hydraulic conductivities resulting in faster drainage of soil moisture wang et al 2015 therefore it is reasonable to argue that soil moisture reservoirs in sandier soils have shorter memories and thus faster responses to the changes in surrounding environments mathematically due to the faster changes in soil moisture in sandier soils the position of a point in the phase space is less dependent on the positions of previous points and thus the associated attractor becomes more scattered over the phase space with higher dimensionality e g attractors for soil moisture at the higgins ranch where sand fractions were 84 81 89 and 95 at 10 25 50 and 100 cm respectively as shown in fig 3 therefore cds tended to be larger for sandier soils at the nm sites leading to the positive correlation between cds and sand fraction similar reasons can be also applied to explain the negative correlations of cds with silt and clay fractions overall the above results revealed that soil texture had a stronger impact on cds in deeper soil layers which overrode the influences of land surface processes on soil moisture dynamics in addition to the correlations with meteorological forcings and soil texture cds were also shown to have strong correlations with vegetation conditions in near surface soil layers although no significant correlations were found between cds and topographical attributes except for the one with twi at 50 cm specifically rs between cds and gpp was 0 474 p 0 01 at 10 cm and 0 432 p 0 05 at 25 cm and rs between cds and npp was 0 451 p 0 01 at 10 cm table 3 as previously noted teuling and troch 2005 ivanov et al 2010 wang et al 2015 vegetation dynamics could play important roles in controlling soil moisture dynamics however in the semiarid region of nebraska vegetation conditions e g npp and leaf area index were found to be predominantly affected by precipitation levels in positive manners istanbulluoglu et al 2012a in this study it is thus premature to discriminate the effects of meteorological forcings and vegetation conditions on cds at the nm sites which still deserves future investigation e g different vegetation types under the same climatic conditions 4 conclusions the existence of chaotic behaviors in the soil moisture systems across the nm stations was investigated using multiple chaotic analysis methods including phase space reconstruction correlation dimension largest lyapunov exponent and local approximation prediction to understand the factors that affected the complexity of soil moisture systems the obtained cds were then correlated with different environmental factors which showed the switching of dominant controls on soil moisture dynamics at different depths the main conclusions that can be summarized are 1 the well defined trajectories in the phase space the finite cds and the positive lles for the soil moisture data revealed the existence of chaotic behaviors of soil moisture at the nm sites suggesting that soil moisture systems at those sites had deterministic characteristics 2 good prediction performances of the soil moisture time series were obtained by the lap method the presence of optimal embedding dimension mopt further indicated that the soil moisture dynamics exhibited chaotic behaviors 3 both the cd and lle values showed that the complexity of soil moisture systems generally decreased with increasing depth at the nm sites on average as suggested by the cd method there were roughly 5 variables at 10 and 25 cm 4 at 50 cm and 2 at 100 cm that dominantly controlled soil moisture dynamics at the nm sites 4 the relationships between cds and different environmental factors showed that soil moisture dynamics were more correlated with meteorological forcings at 10 and 25 cm while with soil texture at 50 and 100 cm declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

6127,soil moisture systems generally exhibit complex spatiotemporal patterns due to their nonlinear interactions with surrounding environments in this paper the possible existence of chaotic behaviors in soil moisture time series was investigated using the chaos theory specifically based on the techniques of phase space reconstruction correlation dimension cd largest lyapunov exponent lle and local approximation prediction lap methods daily soil moisture data for six years along with different influencing factors were obtained for 35 nebraska mesonet nm stations with varying hydroclimatic conditions and soil properties the results of cds and lles revealed the presence of chaos in soil moisture systems implying that soil moisture dynamics was controlled by deterministic systems with a limited number of governing variables the results obtained by the lap method offered further evidence on the chaotic behavior of soil moisture systems specifically median of cd values of 4 51 4 06 3 23 and 1 40 were obtained for soil moisture time series at the depths of 10 25 50 and 100 cm respectively indicating that the complexity of soil moisture systems decreased with increasing depth

soil moisture chaos deterministic correlation dimension local approximation prediction nebraska mesonet 1 introduction hydrological processes generally exhibit complex temporal and spatial patterns in part due to their highly nonlinear interactions with the surrounding environment sivapalan 2003 mcdonnell et al 2007 sivakumar and singh 2012 for instance as an important state variable in terrestrial water cycles soil moisture interacts with a multitude of environmental factors in complex nonlinear manners such as climate koster et al 2004 soil vereecken et al 2007 wang et al 2019 and vegetation abedi koupai et al 2008 wang et al 2015 as a result soil moisture tends to display considerable spatial and temporal variability from field to regional scales brocca et al 2010 given the importance of soil moisture in controlling various land surface and subsurface processes it is thus imperative to understand the spatial and temporal characteristics of soil moisture dynamics and associated influencing factors across different spatial and temporal scales brocca et al 2010 vereecken et al 2014 the substantial variability in hydrological response to external forcings such as soil moisture systems presents grand challenges to the scientific community for understanding their underlying controls and more importantly for predicting their spatial and temporal evolutions in order to search for common spatial and temporal patterns numerous concepts and techniques sometimes even contradictory ones have been proposed to diagnose the signals embedded in hydrological processes for example there have been intense debates as to whether uncertainty in hydrological processes is of stochastic or chaotic origins see the reviews by sivakumar 2004 conceptually a stochastic system is governed by a large number of variables of which only statistical structures are known therefore it is not easy to predict system behaviors even within short term ranges by comparison the chaos theory suggests that a nonlinear deterministic system which can be described by only a few independent variables and nonlinear partial differential equations can also produce complex dynamic patterns may 1976 the main characteristic of chaotic systems is that small perturbations in the initial conditions may have tremendous effects on long term evolutions of the systems e g the so called butterfly effect resulting in the limited long term predictability of the system behaviors since the 1970 s the chaos theory has witnessed its burgeoning applications in numerous scientific fields such as atmospheric science astronomy geophysics and economics c f yasmin and sivakumar 2018 li et al 2019 gilmore 2019 despite the controversy revolving around the applicability of the chaos theory in the field of hydrology i e whether low dimensional chaos exists in hydrological systems it has attracted a great deal of attention in the past to quantitatively analyze the complexity of hydrological processes most notably streamflow and rainfall among existing techniques e g correlation dimension cd lyapunov exponent and kolmogorov entropy the cd method has been mostly adopted for analyzing the chaotic behaviors of hydrological processes for instance rodriguez iturbe et al 1989 studied rainfall time series at two different temporal scales i e 15 s vs weekly using the cd method the authors found a low cd of 3 78 and chaotic behavior in the 15 s rainfall data whereas the chaotic behavior was shown to be absent in the weekly rainfall data later studies also reported the existence of low dimensional chaos i e low cd in rainfall data at various locations and temporal scales sivakumar 2001 fuwape et al 2017 similar issues were also raised on the existence of chaotic behaviors in streamflow e g porporato and ridolfi 1997 sivakumar and singh 2012 karunasingha and liong 2018 the application of the chaos theory in hydrological studies has been broadened including streamflow and rainfall prediction and catchment classification dhanya and kumar 2010 sivakumar 2017 the importance of soil moisture is manifested by its role in linking atmosphere biosphere and hydrosphere through affecting a variety of land surface and subsurface processes seneviratne et al 2010 however to the authors knowledge no attempt has been made yet to examine whether chaos exists in soil moisture systems it is thus of great interest to investigate the soil moisture dynamics using the chaos theory for both research and application purposes as such the primary goals of this study were two fold 1 to examine the existence of chaos in soil moisture systems and 2 to explore the factors that affect the complexity of soil moisture systems based on the chaos theory to this end long term daily soil moisture data for six years were acquired from the nebraska mesonet nm located in the continental united states along with hydrometeorological and soil property data here we used the cd largest lyapunov exponent lle and local approximation prediction lap methods to investigate whether soil moisture systems existed chaotic behaviors the results of this study offer additional revenues for understanding soil moisture dynamics and relevant influencing factors for the soil moisture system complexity from the perspective of the chaos theory 2 materials and methodology 2 1 study area and data the soil moisture data at the depths of 10 25 50 and 100 cm analyzed in this study were obtained from the nm https mesonet unl edu previously known as the automated weather data network which reports soil moisture conditions across the state of nebraska united states fig 1 the detailed information on the nm can be found elsewhere e g you et al 2010 wang et al 2016 and only a brief description is given here the study area has a continental semiarid climate type with mean annual precipitation p ranging from around 300 mm year in the west to more than 700 mm year in the east wang et al 2016 meanwhile during the study period from 2008 to 2013 the study region experienced both wet e g 2008 with mean annual precipitation of the selected nm stations of 660 mm year and dry e g 2012 with mean annual precipitation of 292 mm year periods the nm sites are covered by natural grasses under rainfed conditions without anthropogenic disturbances and soil texture varies considerably across those sites istanbulluoglu et al 2012b table 1 provides the summary of the 35 nm stations which were selected in this study for the chaotic analysis of soil moisture dynamics specifically daily soil moisture data spanning from 2008 to 2013 were retrieved from the selected stations at the depths of 10 25 50 and 100 cm note that due to deep water tables groundwater was assumed to play a negligible role in affecting soil moisture dynamics at the sites wang et al 2016 at each site volumetric soil moisture content was measured using theta probes ml2x delta t devices cambridge uk which was then quality controlled for any further use you et al 2010 in addition daily precipitation and potential evapotranspiration etp from 2008 to 2013 were acquired from the nm which were integrated to mean annual values i e p and et p for the analysis to diagnose the factors that affect the complexity of soil moisture systems we investigated the associations between soil moisture dynamics and environmental variables including soil texture meteorological forcings e g precipitation and potential evapotranspiration topographic attributes and vegetation characteristics due to the lack of in situ data on soil properties the global soil database of shangguan et al 2014 was used to extract sand and clay fractions at each site based on the geographical coordinates the accuracy of shangguan et al 2014 s soil database has been tested using in situ measurements across the continental united states with satisfactory results avery et al 2016 topographic attributes e g slope aspect and topographic wetness index twi were derived from a 30 m digital elevation model dem http dnr ne gov digital elevation models the method of beven and kirkby 1979 was utilized to compute twis based on the dem in addition annual gross net primary production gpp npp were used to approximate vegetation conditions during the study period annual npp data were obtained from the modis17 dataset http www ntsg umt edu project mod17 since gpp data from the modis17 dataset were given at 8 day intervals annual gpp data were synthesized using 1350 scenes of 8 day gpp images at each site 2 2 correlation dimension method the cd method has been widely used for analyzing chaotic behaviors of hydrological systems c f sivakumar 2017 a cd of a time series of a hydrological variable indicates the number of dominant variables that control the temporal evolution of the hydrological system in general systems with infinite cd values are considered to be stochastic whereas the ones with finite non integer cd values are considered to be chaotic see sivakumar 2017 for detailed discussions furthermore it is generally believed that systems with high cds are more complex while those with low cds are simpler and exhibit low dimensional deterministic behaviors various algorithms have been proposed to calculate cds among which the algorithm of grassberger and procaccia 1983 was mostly used denoted as the g p algorithm hereafter the g p algorithm adopts the concept of phase space reconstruction for representing the dynamics of a system from a single variable time series the phase space also called state space presents all possible data points of a time series of the variable therefore each point represents one state of the underlying dynamic system geometrically if these points are attracted into a region in the phase space towards which the system tends to evolve this set of data points is known as an attractor following previous studies e g sivakumar 2017 taken s delay embedding theorem was adopted for reconstructing the phase space of soil moisture data in this study takens 1981 specifically given a time series x i i 1 2 n a multi dimensional phase space can be reconstructed as 1 y j x j x j τ x j 2 τ x j m 1 τ where j 1 2 n m 1 τ n and m are the dimension of x i and y j respectively called embedding dimension and τ is the time delay choosing optimal τ and m is critical for the phase space reconstruction in this study the value of τ was selected when the autocorrelation function of the soil moisture data dropped to 1 1 e of its initial values where e is base of natural logarithm rosenstein et al 1994 the optimal m was determined based on the false nearest neighbor fnn method with the fraction of fnn dropped to zero kennel et al 1992 for the reconstructed m dimensional phase space in eqs 1 the correlation function c r m is defined as 2 c r m lim m 2 m m 1 i j 1 m h r y i y j 1 i j m where y i y j is defined as the euclidean distance between y i and y j and h u is the heaviside function with h u 1 for u greater than 0 and h u 0 for u 0 where u r y i y j and r is the radius of a sphere centered on y i or y j if there exists an attractor in the reconstructed phase space the correlation exponent d2 m has a relationship with c r m through the following equation 3 c r m r 0 n α r d 2 m where α is a constant d 2 m is usually determined by fitting a straight line through ln r vs ln c r m over a certain range of r i e scaling region using the least squares method note that the determination of scaling regions is critical for computing cds however previous g p applications relied on visual inspections to choose scaling regions which was not adaptive and subject to human errors di et al 2018 here an improved g p algorithm proposed by di et al 2018 was used to compute cds this new method is based on the normal k means clustering technique and the random sample consensus algorithm ransac to select scaling regions finally cd can be obtained according to the relationship between d2 m and m by varying m if d2 m reaches a saturation value after a certain value of m the saturation value is defined as the cd of the time series x i 2 3 largest lyapunov exponent the lyapunov exponent is another commonly used metric for the estimation of chaos in a system it quantifies the rate of separation between two infinitesimally close trajectories in the phase space generally the existence of a positive lyapunov exponent indicates the presence of chaos in a system while a negative one indicates that the system is stable or exhibits periodic behaviors rodriguez iturbe et al 1989 otherwise if the lyapunov exponent is 0 it suggests that the underlying system is in a quasi stable state in applications the lle is usually utilized to identify whether a system exhibits chaotic behaviors wolf et al 1985 rosenstein et al 1993 similar to the computation of cds the phase space reconstruction is also the first step for calculating lles here the optimal τ and m were selected as previously described the method proposed by wolf et al 1985 was employed to compute the lle denoted as î max 4 λ max 1 t m t 0 i 1 m ln l t i l t i 1 where l t i and l t i 1 are the euclidean distance between two closest neighboring points on two different trajectories in the phase space at time ti and ti 1 respectively the ratio of l t i l t i 1 describes the temporal evolution of these two points on the attractor in eqs 4 t 0 is the time at the initial point m is the number of iterations and t m is the final iteration time as m increases the value of the exponent converges to a constant which is viewed as î max when î max 0 there exists at least one positive lyapunov exponent indicating chaotic behaviors whereas λ max 0 indicates that the time series has a regular motion process 2 4 local approximation prediction another chaos identification method is an inverse approach using the nonlinear prediction casdagli 1989 islam and sivakumar 2002 such as the lap method using lap chaotic time series can be predicted within a short range based on the phase space reconstruction according to eq 1 to represent underlying dynamics of the system the basic idea for the phase space based prediction is to assume a functional relationship between the current state y j and future state y j t to predict the future state in the form 5 y j t f t y j where y j and y j t are m dimensional vectors and t is time lag to predict y j t it is necessary to find an appropriate predictor f t to approximate f t in this study a classical and well known lap method proposed by farmer and sidorowich 1987 was employed for determining f t specifically it first subdivides the domain f t into different subsets i e neighborhood with each subset determining f t separately for the given state yj the k nearest neighbors n j y j p p 1 k of y j is identified by fixing a metric y j y j p then the local approximation function f t can be constructed using the least squares method 6 min f t p 1 k y j 1 p f t y j p 2 for determining f t local polynomial functions are recommended sivakumar 2007 in this study a cubic polynomial function was used to approximate f t to this point the prediction of y j t can be obtained by y j t f t y j in this way further predictions can be achieved forward step by step from a new state y j locally in the phase space in this study nash sutcliffe efficiency nse correlation coefficient r and coefficient of determination r 2 were used to assess the prediction accuracy of soil moisture using the lap method then the presence of chaos in the soil moisture time series can be determined on the basis of the results of the lap method casdagli 1989 islam and sivakumar 2002 theoretically if a system is chaotic the prediction accuracy will increase with increasing embedding dimensions to a certain point namely the optimal embedding dimension m opt whereas there would be no increase in the prediction accuracy with increasing embedding dimensions for a stochastic time series casdagli 1989 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of chaotic behaviors of soil moisture systems 3 1 1 phase space existence of chaos or not in a hydrological process can be first qualitatively evaluated by visually inspecting the reconstructed multi dimensional phase space using eq 1 taking the minden site see fig 1 as an example fig 2 a presents the daily soil moisture time series at 10 cm and precipitation data from 2008 to 2013 with m 1 and τ 1 day a 2 d phase space diagram xi xi 1 for the minden site is shown in fig 2b which characterizes the long term soil moisture behavior from 2008 to 2013 visually the trajectories were attracted to a a well structured narrow region called an attractor as shown in fig 2b indicating the soil moisture system was chaotic when x i 1 x i it suggests the input of water into the soil moisture system e g rainfall and the wetting arrow indicates the direction of the soil moisture trajectories during rainfall events when xi 1 xi it indicates the net loss of soil moisture due to leakage and evapotranspiration and the drying arrow illustrates the direction of soil moisture trajectories during draw down periods to compare the complexity of soil moisture dynamics at different sites four sites i e sidney minden meadagro farm and higgins ranch with different mean annual precipitation are selected as representations and the phase space diagrams are shown in fig 3 in general if an attractor follows a clear pattern i e the attractor has well structure and relative deterministic obits for example its trajectories have obvious cycles but not irregular structures and evolve within a relative narrow boundary the dynamics of the underlying soil moisture system can be considered as simple with low dimensional deterministic characteristics otherwise it is perceived as complex with high dimensional stochastic characteristics as can be seen in fig 3 soil moisture levels varied noticeably across locations and at different depths for example higgins ranch had the lowest soil moisture content and subsequently the narrowest range of orbits in the phase space among the four sites however its soil moisture trajectories cannot be seen clearly to resolve this issue following previous studies sivakumar 2017 soil moisture data were normalized using the equation xi x min x max x min where xi is soil moisture data on day i and x max and x min are maximum and minimum values of soil moisture time series respectively the phase space diagrams for the normalized soil moisture data are shown in fig 4 overall the soil moisture trajectories in fig 4 show clear patterns and evolve within a boundary suggesting certain low dimensional deterministic behaviors of soil moisture however the degree of the complexity of the attractors differed considerably first for all sites the attractors at shallower depths e g 10 and 25 cm had more complex geometries over the phase space than those at deeper depths e g 50 and 100 cm suggesting that soil moisture systems were more complex or temporally dynamic at shallower depths in addition fig 4 shows that at the same depth the complexity of the attractors also varied noticeably across locations for instance the attractors obtained for sidney and minden were defined within relatively narrower regions and had clearer trajectories in the reconstructed phase space indicating that associated soil moisture dynamics were simpler with lower dimensions at those two sites by comparison the trajectories for the meadagro farm and the higgins ranch were more complex and scattered over the phase space especially at the depths of 10 and 25 cm indicating that the soil moisture systems had more complex behaviors with higher dimensions at those two sites overall the phase space diagrams show evidence for chaotic behavior and that the complexity of soil moisture systems at the nm sites depended both on specific depths and locations 3 1 2 correlation dimension before calculating the cd and lle the time delay τ of each soil moisture time series was determined by autocorrelation functions as previously explained and the optimal m was determined by the fnn method the values of τ and m for all 35 nm stations are given in table 1s the cds of soil moisture were then calculated using the improved g p method of di et al 2018 to illustrate the calculation procedures in details fig 5 shows the results for the soil moisture data at 10 cm at minden the optimal τ was found to be 22 days as the autocorrelation function first crossed the 1 1 e of its initial value fig 5a fig 5b shows that the fraction of the false nearest neighbors dropped to 0 when m increased to 12 indicating that the percentage of close neighboring points stayed constant when m was larger than 12 as such the value of 12 was determined as the optimal embedding dimension kennel et al 1992 the relationships between ln c r m and ln r with m varying from 2 to 20 are shown in fig 5c and d displays the obtained relationship between d2 m and m it can be seen that cd increased to approximately 4 22 and then flattened when m reached 12 which was called as a saturation value according to the dynamical system theory the number of dominant variables that are needed to describe the underlying system can be denoted by the next highest integer value above the correlation dimension sivakumar 2017 therefore the result indicated that there were 5 variables that governed the evolution of the soil moisture system at 10 cm at minden and that an attractor of low dimensionality i e 5 existed in the soil moisture system with chaotic behaviors the cd values for the soil moisture time series at four different depths for all 35 nm sites are listed in table 2s and shown in fig 6 a overall the cd values provide a preliminary support for the presence of chaotic behaviors in soil moisture dynamics at the nm sites specifically the cds for soil moisture varied in the ranges of 3 20 6 10 median 4 51 2 28 5 70 4 06 1 65 4 90 3 23 and 1 01 3 97 1 40 at the depths of 10 25 50 and 100 cm respectively table 2 clearly the obtained cd values tended to decrease with increasing depth meaning that soil moisture systems were more complex and temporally dynamic at shallower depths with higher dimensionality than those at deeper depths this finding is consistent with our interpretation from the phase space diagrams in fig 3 on average the mean cd values indicated there were approximately 5 5 4 and 2 dominant variables which primarily controlled soil moisture dynamics at the depths of 10 25 50 and 100 cm respectively at the nm sites more importantly the low cd values we found at the nm sites suggests that the soil moisture time series are the outcome of deterministic systems and thus soil moisture is highly predictable if inputs are well characterized our study also suggests that if the dominant variables that control soil moisture dynamics can be identified process based model complexity for predicting soil moisture at different soil depths could be different which could make predictions more certain 3 1 3 largest lyapunov exponent due to the limitations associated with the cd method for detecting low dimensional chaos in hydrological systems e g data size data noise and time delay selection see sivakumar 2017 for details the lle method was also employed to further examine the possible existence of chaotic characteristics in soil moisture time series at the nm sites based on the values of optimal τ and m from table 1s the lle values computed for all soil moisture time series are shown in fig 6b across the nm sites the ranges of lles for soil moisture were 0 011 0 066 median 0 036 0 012 0 052 0 030 0 002 0 048 0 014 and 0 0 025 0 007 at the depths of 10 25 50 and 100 cm respectively table 2 the decreasing trend in the lles with increasing depth confirmed the aforementioned results from the analysis of phase space diagrams and cds moreover the positive lles indicate that the soil moisture systems at the nm sites exhibit chaotic characteristics note that some of the lles were 0 at 100 cm implying that the soil moisture time series were marginally stable and might have a periodic attractor sivakumar 2017 it could be attributed to the fact that soil moisture was more temporally stable in deeper soil layers due to less influences of land surface processes on soil moisture dynamics zhang and shao 2017 to evaluate the consistency of the results between cds and lles the nonparametric spearman s rank and kendall s tau correlation methods were utilized to quantify the relationship between cds and lles the spearman s rank correlation coefficient rs is 0 883 significant at p 0 001 at 10 cm 0 920 p 0 001 at 25 cm 0 902 p 0 001 at 50 cm and 0 708 p 0 001 at 100 cm the kendall s tau correlation coefficient is 0 724 p 0 001 at 10 cm 0 766 p 0 001 at 25 cm 0 756 p 0 001 at 50 cm and 0 558 p 0 001 at 100 cm the strong positive correlations between cds and lles attested the consistency of both methods in examining the chaotic characteristics of soil moisture dynamics in summary the results from the phase space diagram cd and lle analyses revealed that soil moisture systems at the nm sites were of deterministic types with chaotic behaviors in general due to the complexity of climate systems precipitation exhibits chaotic behaviors rodriguez iturbe et al 1989 sivakumar 2001 as external inputs e g precipitation into the soil moisture system the signal as in chaos embedded in precipitation propagates into the soil moisture system which leads to the chaotic behavior of soil moisture more importantly the propagation of the signal from precipitation to soil moisture can be modulated by the environmental factors that affect soil moisture dynamics as illustrated in the following section resulting in the varying degree of the complexity of soil moisture systems at different locations and depths nevertheless further investigation is still warranted to illustrate the nature of soil moisture processes e g deterministic vs stochastic across different landscapes and climate regimes 3 1 4 nonlinear prediction analysis the lap method was employed to further identify the presence of chaotic behavior and predict the soil moisture dynamics here 85 of the soil moisture data were used as a training dataset and the remaining 15 of the data were used as a testing dataset the phase space was reconstructed with embedding dimensions from 1 to 10 and predictions were made one step ahead figs 7 and 8 present the prediction results for soil moisture at 10 cm for sidney minden meadagro farm and higgins ranch taking the sidney site as an example fig 7a shows that the prediction accuracy increased with increasing embedding dimensions up to m 4 and then decreased when m greater than 4 the presence of an optimal embedding dimension m opt 4 r 0 965 and nse 0 927 indicated that the soil moisture dynamics exhibited chaotic behaviors casdagli 1989 furthermore the comparison between the observed and predicted values with r2 0 929 in fig 8a presents an excellent agreement in the overall trends and appearances such results indicate the good performance of phase space based lap method for predicting the soil moisture dynamics note that m opt 4 was also consistent with the correlation dimension cd 3 27 obtained at sidney indicating that there were approximately 4 variables that primarily controlled soil moisture dynamics at 10 cm at sidney similarly the best prediction results were achieved when the embedding dimension reached 5 r 0 969 and nse 0 937 6 r 0 972 and nse 0 943 and 6 r 0 917 and nse 0 824 for minden meadagro farm and higgins ranch respectively the good agreement between predicted and observed data with r 2 0 939 0 942 and 0 832 for minden meadagro farm and higgins ranch respectively revealed the suitability of lap method for forecasting the soil moisture dynamics fig 8b d 3 2 controls on soil moisture system complexity understanding the complexity of hydrological systems can be astonishingly challenging mostly due to the nonlinear interactions among interconnected parts in hydrological systems sivakumar and singh 2012 especially for soil moisture it can be further complicated by spatial heterogeneities in climate inputs land surface processes vegetation dynamics and soil properties all of which can affect soil moisture dynamics seneviratne et al 2010 wang et al 2017 for example as indicated in fig 6 the complexity of soil moisture systems at the nm sites varied considerably across locations and at different depths therefore it is of great interest to further assess the impacts of different environmental controls on the soil moisture system complexity to this end the correlations of cds with different factors including soil texture meteorological forcings topographical attributes and vegetation characteristics were considered in this study note that the correlations of lles with those factors are not discussed here because of the strong correlations between cds and lles as previously shown the rs values between cds and different factors derived from the 35 nm sites are reported in table 3 interestingly table 3 shows that the dominant factors that controlled cds switched at different depths specifically cds were primarily correlated with meteorological forcings at the depths of 10 and 25 cm there existed significant positive correlations between cds and p with rs 0 680 p 0 001 at 10 cm and rs 0 534 p 0 01 at 25 cm whereas a strong negative correlation emerged between cds and et p at 10 cm with rs 0 439 p 0 01 for further illustration the relationships of cds with p and et p are also shown in fig 9 the positive correlation between cds and p and the negative one between cds and et p are obvious in fig 9 at the depths of 10 and 25 cm whereas no significant correlation can be seen between cds and p and et p at the depths of 50 and 100 cm overall with increasing depth the correlation of cds with p and et p weakened at the nm sites clearly meteorological forcings were the primary controls on soil moisture dynamics and thus the complexity of soil moisture systems in near surface soil layers across the study region physically with higher levels of p the occurrence of rainfall events tended to become more frequent resulting in more wetting drying cycles of soil moisture and subsequently more complex soil moisture systems which can be also demonstrated by fig 2b as such there existed positive correlations between cds and p however as land surface processes had less influences on soil moisture dynamics in deeper soil layers zhang and shao 2017 the positive correlation between cds and p disappeared at deeper depths meanwhile there was a strong negative relationship between p and et p across nebraska wang et al 2016 which could be the explanation for the negative correlation between cds and et p at 10 cm by comparison soil texture exerted much less influences on cds at the depths of 10 and 25 cm however cds had much stronger correlations with soil texture at the depths of 50 and 100 cm table 3 specifically at the depths of 50 and 100 cm cds were significantly correlated with sand fraction in positive manners i e rs 0 433 and p 0 01 at 50 cm and rs 0 420 and p 0 05 at 100 cm whereas negative correlations existed between cds and silt fraction i e rs 0 445 and p 0 01 at 50 cm and rs 0 344 and p 0 05 at 100 cm and clay fraction i e rs 0 494 and p 0 01 at 50 cm and rs 0 424 and p 0 05 at 100 cm for illustration fig 10 shows the relationships of cds with sand silt and clay fractions at different depths as expected fig 10 shows that no obvious correlations existed between cds and soil texture at the depths of 10 and 25 cm whereas the positive correlation between cds and sand fraction and negative ones between cds and silt and clay fractions were clearer at the depths of 50 and 100 cm physically coarser textured soils tend to have lower water holding capacities and larger hydraulic conductivities resulting in faster drainage of soil moisture wang et al 2015 therefore it is reasonable to argue that soil moisture reservoirs in sandier soils have shorter memories and thus faster responses to the changes in surrounding environments mathematically due to the faster changes in soil moisture in sandier soils the position of a point in the phase space is less dependent on the positions of previous points and thus the associated attractor becomes more scattered over the phase space with higher dimensionality e g attractors for soil moisture at the higgins ranch where sand fractions were 84 81 89 and 95 at 10 25 50 and 100 cm respectively as shown in fig 3 therefore cds tended to be larger for sandier soils at the nm sites leading to the positive correlation between cds and sand fraction similar reasons can be also applied to explain the negative correlations of cds with silt and clay fractions overall the above results revealed that soil texture had a stronger impact on cds in deeper soil layers which overrode the influences of land surface processes on soil moisture dynamics in addition to the correlations with meteorological forcings and soil texture cds were also shown to have strong correlations with vegetation conditions in near surface soil layers although no significant correlations were found between cds and topographical attributes except for the one with twi at 50 cm specifically rs between cds and gpp was 0 474 p 0 01 at 10 cm and 0 432 p 0 05 at 25 cm and rs between cds and npp was 0 451 p 0 01 at 10 cm table 3 as previously noted teuling and troch 2005 ivanov et al 2010 wang et al 2015 vegetation dynamics could play important roles in controlling soil moisture dynamics however in the semiarid region of nebraska vegetation conditions e g npp and leaf area index were found to be predominantly affected by precipitation levels in positive manners istanbulluoglu et al 2012a in this study it is thus premature to discriminate the effects of meteorological forcings and vegetation conditions on cds at the nm sites which still deserves future investigation e g different vegetation types under the same climatic conditions 4 conclusions the existence of chaotic behaviors in the soil moisture systems across the nm stations was investigated using multiple chaotic analysis methods including phase space reconstruction correlation dimension largest lyapunov exponent and local approximation prediction to understand the factors that affected the complexity of soil moisture systems the obtained cds were then correlated with different environmental factors which showed the switching of dominant controls on soil moisture dynamics at different depths the main conclusions that can be summarized are 1 the well defined trajectories in the phase space the finite cds and the positive lles for the soil moisture data revealed the existence of chaotic behaviors of soil moisture at the nm sites suggesting that soil moisture systems at those sites had deterministic characteristics 2 good prediction performances of the soil moisture time series were obtained by the lap method the presence of optimal embedding dimension mopt further indicated that the soil moisture dynamics exhibited chaotic behaviors 3 both the cd and lle values showed that the complexity of soil moisture systems generally decreased with increasing depth at the nm sites on average as suggested by the cd method there were roughly 5 variables at 10 and 25 cm 4 at 50 cm and 2 at 100 cm that dominantly controlled soil moisture dynamics at the nm sites 4 the relationships between cds and different environmental factors showed that soil moisture dynamics were more correlated with meteorological

6128,flooding is a major concern for canadian society as it is the costliest natural disaster type in canada southern ontario which houses one third of the canadian population is located in an area of high vulnerability for floods the most significant floods in the region have historically occurred during the months of march and april due to snowmelt coupled with extreme rain events however during the last three decades there has been a shift of flooding events to earlier months the aim of this study was to understand the impacts of atmospheric circulation on the temporal shift of streamflow and high flow events observed in southern ontario over 1957 2013 period predominant weather regimes over north america corresponding to recurrent meteorological situations were identified using a discretization of daily geopotential height at 500hpa level z500 a regime normalized hypothetical temperature and precipitation dataset was constructed to quantify the contribution of atmospheric circulation on streamflow response the hypothetical dataset was used as input in the precipitation runoff modeling system prms a rainfall runoff semi distributed hydrological model and applied to four watersheds in southern ontario the results showed an increase in the temporal frequency of the regime identified here as high pressure hp close to eight occurrences per decade regime hp characterized by a northern position of the polar vortex is correlated with a positive phase of the nao and is associated with warm and wet conditions over southern ontario during winter the temporal increase in hp contributed more than 40 of the increase in streamflow in winter and 30 45 decrease in streamflow in april this atmospheric situation also contributed to increase the number of high flows by 25 50 in january these results are important to improve the seasonal forecasting of high flows and to assess the uncertainty in the temporal evolution of streamflow in the great lakes region keywords streamflow hydrological modelling precipitation runoff modeling system prms weather regimes southern ontario atmospheric circulation 1 introduction a shift to earlier streamflow has been commonly observed around the world in glaciated or snow dominated watersheds barnett et al 2005 bliss et al 2014 this shift attributed to global warming has a large impact in water resource stability wu et al 2015 water quality chen et al 2016 or flood management hamlet and lettenmaier 2007 canada is greatly affected by this shift because the country has a high snowmelt contribution to streamflow burn and whitfield 2016 and is highly dependent on fluvial resources southern ontario is a densely populated region in canada and is a critical area to produce high quality agriculture products pim et al 2005 the heterogeneous combination of urban areas industrial activity and agricultural lands makes this region particularly vulnerable to the change in water resources and flood events historically the number of high flow events in southern ontario has peaked in march and april in correspondence with the snow melt period burn and whitfield 2016 buttle et al 2016 in recent decades similarly to what was observed worldwide there has been an observed decline in spring maximum peak flows and an increase in winter flows attributed to an increase in winter temperatures to promote an earlier snowmelt adamowski et al 2013 cunderlik and ouarda 2009 global warming that increased winter snowmelt in numerous snow dominated catchments around the world barnett et al 2005 is modulated regionally by atmospheric circulation in the mid latitudes nilsen et al 2017 recent studies have attempted to identify the contribution of large scale climate variability to the local variability of climate or hydrological processes in southern ontario but the results are generally not promising tan and gan 2015 vincent et al 2015 zhang et al 2010 zhao et al 2013 some of these studies consider monthly values of streamflow nalley et al 2016 or used coarse hydrometric data from large areas in canada coulibaly and burn 2005 a recent study found that pacific north american pattern pna characterized in it positive phase by low pressure anomalies in eastern north america was negatively correlated to extreme precipitation in southern ontario thiombiano et al 2017 similar results were found in the region south of the great lakes where a negative phase of the pna was associated with more extreme precipitations events and higher frequency peak streamflow mallakpour and villarini 2016 meanwhile the negative phase of pna was associated with lower mean winter streamflow in the northeastern united states bradbury et al 2002 the positive phase of the north atlantic oscillation nao associated with a strong gradient between low pressure in iceland and high pressure in the azores has also been found to increase mean winter streamflow in the northeastern united states bradbury et al 2002 while it was found to delay winter peak flows in québec beauchamp et al 2015 other methods described by jones 1994 examined forcing of atmospheric circulation onto local meteorological conditions in the region of great lakes a manual circulation to environment synoptical classification shows that high flows in pennsylvania u s were associated with intense low level pressure cells in the region yarnal and frakes 1997 a manual environment to circulation method was used in atlantic canada to show that great lakes low pressure cells were important processes to generate floods in this region collins et al 2014 in rohli et al 2001 an eigenvector based map pattern classification scheme shows high stream discharge in the u s great lakes basin associated to high pressure anomalies over the northeast north american coast these studies show that the impact of atmospheric circulation on streamflow may vary among different regions of the great lakes basin the lack of robust studies on the relationship between atmospheric circulation and streamflow in southern ontario suggest relevance on focusing further work in this populated region of canada the objective of this study is to examine the impact of atmospheric circulation on the modulation of streamflow in four diverse watersheds i e grand river upper thames river credit river and big creek in southern ontario and to quantify its role in overall streamflow shifts temporal evolution of atmospheric circulation is assessed using classes of recurrent large scale meteorological patterns called weather regimes weather regimes calculation was developed by michelangeli et al 1995 and have been used in europe to identify impacts of regional atmospheric circulation on local climate variability and particularly extreme temperatures cassou et al 2005 fernández montes et al 2013 extreme rainfall pfahl 2014 ullmann et al 2014 or flood events santos et al 2015 the sensitivity of mean streamflow and high flows to temporal shifts of weather regime occurrence frequency is tested by replacing the original precipitation and temperatures datasets with hypothetical regime normalized climate datasets as input in the precipitation runoff modeling system prms the use of hypothetical datasets to understand the role of atmospheric circulation on local or regional weather conditions have been used in the past fleig et al 2015 this method has been previously applied in the great lakes region to understand the impact of atmospheric circulation on the evolution of snowfall leathers and ellis 1996 in our study weather patterns driven hypothetical dataset is used for the first time as input in a hydrological model 2 methods 2 1 study area four watersheds in southern ontario were selected for their long hydrometric time series archives and represent well the diversity of scale soil type and land use in this region fig 1 and table 1 land use in all four watersheds is dominated by agricultural activity credit river has the highest proportion of forest cover two major cities brantford in grand river and london in thames river are present in the study area and additional urban areas are located in the credit river watershed the big creek watershed contains the lowest proportion of urbanization 2 the watersheds also vary in soil type sand predominates in big creek 79 and credit river 43 but a large area of credit is also covered by loamy soil 49 grand river has almost an equal proportion of sand 30 loam 32 and clay 38 while thames river contains more clay 39 the elevation is also highly variable with the highest elevations in the north parts of grand river 531 m and credit river 521 m watersheds while the lowest areas are located in the sandplains further south in grand river 178 m and big creek 179 m 2 2 hydrological modelling the precipitation and runoff modeling system prms a semi distributed conceptual hydrological model was applied to all four watersheds prms has been widely used in snowmelt dominated regions in united states dressler et al 2006 mastin et al 2011 surfleet et al 2012 teng et al 2018 and has been recently applied in china teng et al 2017 and high latitude regions liao and zhuang 2017 with a good representation of the snowmelt processes the hydrological calculations in prms are based on physical laws and empirical relations between measured and estimated quantities markstrom et al 2015 a series of hydrologic reservoirs is used plant canopy interception snowpack soil zone subsurface and the water flowing between the reservoirs is computed for each hydrological response unit hru in this study hrus consisted of surface grid cells of 200mx200m for big creek and credit river watersheds and 400mx400m for grand river and thames river these two watersheds used coarser hrus to reduce the parametrization calculations time for each step of the model calculation prms allows to choose among different modules that are described in the supplementary materials section s1 and in markstrom et al 2015 parameter values used by prms were found in the literature and were spatialized for each hru table s1 these parameters were estimated according to land use elevation aspect slope and soil type using arcpy gsflow under arcgis gardner et al 2018 arcpy gsflow was also used to estimate the water cascade between the hrus and the river segments some of these parameters were modified during calibration while keeping the relative spatial variability of the processes table s1 calibration was done by a trial and error approach and followed three steps 1 calibration of daily shortwave radiation using satellite data 2002 2008 furnished by natural resources canada at 1 10 degree almost 10 km resolution djebbar et al 2012 2 adjustment of potential evapotranspiration pet parameters with value of pet estimated using the thornthwaite method thornthwaite 1948 and 3 calibration of 17 parameters by the normal root mean square error nrmse between daily and monthly mean streamflow the thornthwaite method was used in this study because of readily available gridded temperature data these steps were repeated until the set of parameters produces satisfactory results parameter sources spatial and temporal resolution and values after calibration are listed in table s1 five years were used as the warm up period oct 1984 to sept 1989 to remove the errors due to initial conditions different simulations with a varying warm up period length were tested in the big creek watershed and showed that five years were necessary to eliminate variability due to the initial conditions of the reservoirs the calibration period was from 1989 to 2008 providing a 20 year calibration period and 2009 2013 period were used as the validation period the input variables for prms were precipitation minimum temperature and maximum temperature values these variables were obtained from the gridded historical weather station data cangrid produced by mckenney et al 2011 using natural resources canada and eccc data archives at 10 km spatial resolution 186 data points were needed to cover the area of the four watersheds red markers on fig 1 for model calculations each hru used climate data from the closest grid point 2 3 construction of north american temporal weather regimes temporal evolution of atmospheric circulation was assessed using discretization of daily geopotential height anomalies at 500 hpa level z500 hereafter in recurrent weather regime patterns michelangeli et al 1995 these maps documented the most robust location and intensity of anticyclone positive geopotential height anomalies relative to the climatological mean and depression negative anomalies z500 fields were derived from the 20th century reanalysis version 2 available for all years since 1871 compo et al 2011 the domain used was centered on the great lakes and extended into the eastern part of north america 30 n 60 n 110 w 50 w the weather regimes were calculated for the period 1950 2014 by a k means algorithm applied to the first principal components explaining 80 of the total z500 daily variance 100 k means partitions were performed for each potential number of class 2 10 and the final number of classes were determined by a red noise test described in the supplementary materials section s3 a complete description of the use of the k means algorithm to compute the weather regimes is described in michelangeli et al 1995 the relationship between weather regimes and large scale mode of variability i e nao and pna were also considered as these modes are known for having impacts on local winter conditions in the region beauchamp et al 2015 bradbury et al 2002 thiombiano et al 2017 zhao et al 2013 monthly nao indices were based on iceland and gibraltar sea level pressure furnished by the climatic research unit jones 1994 the pna oscillation monthly indices were furnished by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration barnston and livezey 1987 2 4 construction of original and experimental climate datasets cangrid temperature and precipitation data for the period 1957 2013 are taken as a control data set ctl ctl data are used to create experimental exp climate data sets that represent climate variability that would occur without the influence of atmospheric circulation in previous studies experimental climate datasets were based on average conditions of each weather pattern fleig et al 2015 but had limited application in hydrological models which require realistic daily data series in this study a new algorithm was developed under matlab to create regime normalized climate occurrence data sets to be used as input in hydrological models weather regimes occurrences were first modified to remove their 1957 2013 monthly frequency trend in order to detrend the monthly regime frequencies the regimes were replaced with respect to the observed sequence of regimes between 1957 and 2013 keeping a reasonable sequence of regimes is fundamental because the atmospheric variability is continuous over time and the sequence of regimes that naturally occurs follows a specific order table s2 the construction of the detrended sequence of regimes is described in detail in the supplementary material section s4 following the construction of the new sequence of regime temperature and precipitation conditions associated to the removed regimes were replaced by conditions associated to the new regime new temperature and precipitation conditions were taken from daily observations in each grid point over the 1957 2013 period for each month the daily temperature and precipitation conditions for all grid points in the watersheds were averaged these mean daily conditions were ranked for each regime the observation of the old regime was replaced by conditions situated in the same rank of the new regime for example in january if the day to switch corresponded to the regime hp high pressure and was associated to the highest intra regime temperature ranked first the new conditions will be from the day associated to the first rank of the new regime 5 degrees on average if regime north east fig 2 the same process was performed for the precipitation data even though the algorithm used the observed sequence of regime to construct the experimental dataset several possibilities in the switch of regime can be often made section s4 therefore it was important to repeat the algorithm several times to create different experimental dataset and consider the range of possible changes in weather regimes in consideration of these different possibilities of new experimental datasets we repeated the algorithm 100 times this method produced an experimental dataset to identify climate variability associated with the large scale atmospheric circulation and preserved climate variability from all other sources it also kept the same statistical properties as the original data section s4 and can be used in hydrological models the ctl and 100 exp climate dataset were used as input in prms for each watershed 3 results 3 1 weather regimes and local meteorological conditions five regimes were identified as the most robust and recurrent atmospheric configurations over northeast north america in the 1957 2013 period fig 3 two of the regimes consisted of high geopotential hp high pressure or low geopotential lp low pressure anomalies centered in the eastern great lakes region the regime north east was characterized by high geopotential in northeastern québec while low geopotential conditions occurred in the atlantic ocean northeasterly winds are more likely to occur in this configuration the regime south was characterized by anticyclonic conditions anomalies over the atlantic ocean but cyclonic conditions in northern ontario and northern manitoba causing southerly winds over the region regime north was characterized by low geopotential anomalies in the east with high geopotential conditions in the west causing northerly winds over the great lakes region fig 3 the regimes annual frequencies are depicted in fig 4 and show a seasonal variability for the regimes lp north and north east fig 4 the regime north was more frequent during summer while regimes lp and north east occurred more frequently in winter months inter annual and decadal variability of weather regimes frequency was also observed over the 1957 2013 period fig 4 the regime hp increased every month except october when no trend was found the most significant increasing trend for hp was between january and april july and september and in november regime north also demonstrated significant increases in january and february regime north east increased significantly during june and regime south increased the most during october notable decreasing trends were also observed in the regime north east and south between january and march regime north also declined during warm season april through october while regime lp declined during the cold months november to march however these negative trends were found to be non significant inter annual occurrences of weather regimes were compared to pna and nao indices to identify if a significant correlation exists with the most influential indices over the region fig 5 between january and march the occurrence of regimes hp and north were positively correlated to a positive nao nao while regimes lp and north east were correlated to negative nao nao between october and june the regime lp was correlated to the positive phase of pna pna while regime south was correlated to negative pna pna fig 5 fig 6 shows monthly average temperature and precipitation conditions in all watersheds for each regime and season the regime hp was the warmest during all months of the year while lp and north were the coldest regimes south and north east were similar throughout the year except that north east was warmer during summer south was the wettest regime throughout the year but the inter regime variability of precipitation was higher between months during winter hp was relatively wet from november to april and was the driest regime in august the other three regimes produced less precipitation amount compared to hp between january and april but were wetter during the warm season while the regimes lp and north east remained wet during the fall season north was the driest regime after september these results showed that the weather conditions were well discretized by the regimes in all four watersheds but does not quantify the impacts of trend in weather regimes occurrence on the change of temperature and precipitation in the region temperature fig 7 and precipitation fig 8 trends for each month between 1957 and 2013 in southern ontario are shown for the control dataset ctl the experiment dataset exp and the contribution of weather regimes to the change of temperature or precipitation ctl minus exp the ctl dataset showed a significant increase of temperature in the entire area during every month with the exception of october and november the increasing trend of temperature was highest between december and march in areas further north from the great lakes the warming was also higher in the eastern part of the study area during winter and in the greater toronto area during summer the exp data set showed less intense warming and was generally non significant with more intense cooling during october as compared to ctl the weather regime contribution to temperature increases was higher in winter particularly during march and december during march weather regimes showed more intense warming west of the greatest toronto area while in december the warming was higher in the eastern part of the area spatially ctl precipitation was found to vary on a monthly basis fig 8 precipitation was found to significantly increase in october in most of the study area a trend toward wetter conditions also occurred in the eastern part of the area in june and september and in the northern part of the region in march dryer conditions were observed in the greater toronto region during august and in the east during february the exp dataset showed weaker increases of precipitation during october and march while during june and september the increase of precipitation was enhanced the dryer conditions observed with the ctl data set were also detected by the exp data with drier conditions near lake huron in july the weather regimes contributed to an increase of precipitation between october and december and during march and april in july weather regimes contributed to the increase of precipitation near lake huron 3 2 contribution of weather regimes to the change in streamflow streamflow in the four watersheds have been calculated between 1951 and 2013 with prms using the best set of parameters retained after calibration table 2 the nash sutcliff efficiency nse values were higher than 0 65 for both calibration and validation periods table 2 the percent bias pbias was between 15 and 15 with the exception of credit river during the validation period and big creek during the calibration period in winter a nse higher than 0 65 and a pbias lower than 15 is generally considered a good quantitative fit moriasi et al 2007 fig 9 shows the simulation and the observation of the daily streamflow in all four watersheds and confirms visually the goodness of simulation fit the observed peak at the beginning of the validation period is not well captured by prms fig 9 but similar results were found with the model mike she in another watershed located in the same region sultana and coulibaly 2011 snowpack and snow water equivalent are also reasonably well simulated by prms section s2 the monthly trend of streamflow simulated by the ctl and exp dataset between 1957 and 2013 are shown for all four watersheds in fig 10 in ctl streamflow was increasing between december and march and was decreasing in april the increase of streamflow was significant for all four watersheds in january but only for grand river and credit river in february and march between may and december the evolution of streamflow was lower and non significant removing the trend in the occurrence of weather regimes had a clear impact on streamflow with lower increases of streamflow between december and march and lower decreases during april fig 10 the ratio of the 100 exp average to ctl calculated for each month showed that between december and march 40 50 of the increase of streamflow was due to the shift in weather regimes in april 45 of the decrease of streamflow was due to the shift in weather regimes in thames and big creek and 30 in credit and grand river fig 10 shows the temporal evolution of the number of high flow counts in all months between 1957 and 2013 for the ctl and the exp datasets the high flow counts were determined by peak over threshold approach where the threshold was defined as the average streamflow plus 3sd standard deviation for each watershed high flow counts increased in all four watersheds during january increasing high flow counts were highest in thames river and continued into february while the trend declined for the three other watersheds in march the trend was increasing again for grand and credit river watersheds and was decreasing for thames and big creek in april a decrease of number of high flows was observed in grand and credit rivers removing the trend of weather regimes attenuated the increase of high flows but amplified the decrease of high flows in april for grand and credit watersheds to examine processes driving the shift of streamflow fig 11 shows the change of rain and snowmelt values between two equal periods 1957 1984 and 1985 2012 for both ctl and exp simulations the ctl simulation fig 11 red and purple or purple without blue showed rain and snowmelt increased for all four watersheds in january the increase of snowmelt was also observed in february with the exception of the big creek river watershed in march only credit river showed an increase of snowmelt in april a large decrease of snowmelt was simulated in all four watersheds with the big creek watershed demonstrating the smallest decrease changes due to rain remain low between february and april in the exp simulation purple and blue or purple without red weather regimes contributed to both rain and snowmelt the weather regimes contributed to increase snowmelt and rain during january in february and march weather regimes contributed to increase or attenuate the decrease of snowmelt and rain in april weather regimes contributed to decrease the snowmelt but at the same time attenuate the decrease of rain 4 discussion 4 1 temperature and precipitation drivers on seasonal and spatial variability of streamflow the results of this study suggest an increase of streamflow between december and march and decline in april this shift was also observed by previous studies and was attributed to reduction of snow as a fraction of total precipitation and a reduction of spring snowpack both caused by recent warming burn et al 2010 burn and whitfield 2016 cunderlik and ouarda 2009 monthly streamflow analyses in these four watersheds in southern ontario showed that processes differ among months and among watersheds significant streamflow increases during january in all watersheds fig 10 may have occurred because both temperature and precipitation have increased to enhance the snowmelt and rain figs 7 and 8 the temperature was also increasing in february and march fig 7 but snowmelt increases were diminished fig 11 probably because of thinner snowpack available a seasonal approach was often used by previous studies to describe the past change of precipitation and temperature which oversimplify the results change of temperature and precipitation will not have a similar impact of streamflow for all the months of the same season for example considering the spring march to mai snow is still an important component of the streamflow in march while it completely disappeared in may previous studies that analyzed monthly projections of streamflow in southern ontario showed a shift to early winter clearly due to a shift in snowmelt but also due to increase in precipitation in january grillakis et al 2011 rahman et al 2012 sultana and coulibaly 2011 variability in streamflow change between watersheds is likely due to differences in latitude elevation or proximity of the great lakes in lower latitude lower elevation and lakeshore watersheds such as big creek the snowpack was thinner and the increase of temperature in winter depletes completely the snowpack as soon as january causing a lack of melting later in the winter season fig 11 snowmelt contribution to streamflow started to decrease later in the other watersheds in march for thames and grand river and in april for the credit river probably because the conditions are colder and the increase of temperature were not sufficient to deplete completely the snowpack or to significantly reduce snowfall amounts therefore streamflow increase is enhanced by snowmelt earlier in big creek watershed and later in credit river in april the streamflow decreases in all four watersheds fig 10 is likely due to reduced snowpack availability for snowmelt in recent decades previous studies projecting the near future evolution of streamflow in southern ontario suggests a similar spatial variability in the canard watershed situated near lake erie streamflow is projected to increase in january but decrease in february and march rahman et al 2012 further north the shift is expected to occur later between february and march near lake ontario grillakis et al 2011 sultana and coulibaly 2011 or lake simcoe kuo et al 2017 oni et al 2014 4 2 atmospheric circulation drivers on hydrological processes the shift in streamflow can be attributed to global warming as changes in streamflow were driven by changes in snowmelt volume fig 11 and warming between december and march fig 7 however the shift in atmospheric circulation contributed for a part to the warming fig 7 and to the increase in snowmelt and rain early in the winter fig 11 the part of the warming due to atmospheric circulation between december and april can be associated to the increase of frequency of regime hp fig 4 which is associated with warmer and wetter conditions than average over the region fig 6 the regime hp was characterized by high geopotential anomalies in the east side of north east north america fig 3 these conditions were classically associated to a northern shift of the rossby wave in northeastern north america and a southern shift of the waves in western north america ahrens 1994 this distortion of the rossby waves coincided with the development of extratropical cyclones ahrens 1994 these cyclones were associated with frontal systems bringing significant amount of rain in their east side where the air masses were warm and charged with humidity the regime south was also characterized by a poleward shift of the rossby waves but the waves were shifted to the east fig 3 in this situation the region would have been closer to the center of the depressions making the warm periods shorter than for a regime hp the regime north characterized by negative geopotential anomalies centered on the saint lawrence estuary fig 3 was also increasing in january and february fig 4 and was associated with cold and dry conditions on great lakes fig 6 the increase of frequency of this regime probably offset a part of the warming due to the regime hp in january and february this was why the largest warming from atmospheric circulation occurred in march fig 7 when the regime hp was the only regime increasing significantly fig 4 previous studies have presented correlations of local climate and hydrological processes to the large scale atmospheric indices in the great lakes region and found conclusive links with nao and pna nao is known for being associated with the southward migration of the polar front in eastern north america and therefore negative z500 anomalies over southern ontario and the east coast zhao et al 2013 this situation corresponds well to the regime lp or the regime north east fig 3 which were correlated to nao fig 5 regimes hp and north on the contrary were characterized by high pressure anomalies in southern canada and low anomalies close to the arctic fig 3 conditions typically associated with nao in winter ning and bradley 2015 evidence of warmer temperature corresponding to winter nao had been found in a large region surrounding the great lakes ning and bradley 2015 nao occurrences have been shown to reduce the maximum snowpack zhao et al 2013 and increase the winter streamflow bradbury et al 2002 nao has occurred more frequently since the end of the 1980s ning and bradley 2015 vincent et al 2015 but a low contribution of nao was found to the recent warming vincent et al 2015 in our study that focused on southern ontario higher geopotential anomalies around the great lakes in winter which are characteristic of nao were able to explain 25 30 of the observed warming in winter fig 7 and 40 of the increase of streamflow between december and march fig 10 the pna index has also been shown to impact local conditions with pna correlated to more precipitation extremes and peak flows mallakpour and villarini 2016 thiombiano et al 2017 mallakpour villarini 2016 found that winter pna is associated with positive z500 anomalies in the east coast of united states while negative anomalies occur in the west bringing high moisture transport heavy precipitation and flooding events in the ohio valley region the z500 anomalies that correspond to the regime south fig 3 are similar to the situation associated with pna defined by mallakpour and villarini 2016 long term trends in the pna index shows a positive trend between 1950 and 2000 which could explain the negative trend in the occurrence of the regime south in winter fig 4 regime lp also follows a negative trend correlated to pna however this relationship is complicated as this regime is also correlated to nao fig 5 the long term trends of regimes south or lp were not significant fig 4 so their role in the evolution of climate variables and streamflow may be limited these results emphasize the advantage of weather regimes analyses over large scale mode of variability to study the impact of atmospheric circulation on streamflow the weather regimes showed more directly the different variable sources of temperature and precipitation by composing the different modes of variability in a single series of recurrent weather patterns during the warm season changes in weather regimes had a less clear impact on streamflow this may be due to the dominance of precipitation variability as a driver of streamflow while temperature played a larger role in winter by changing the snow ratio and the snowmelt period summer precipitation are also largely derived from local convective systems and not from large frontal systems associated with the changes in atmospheric circulation 4 3 calibration method in this study a trial and error approach has been used to calibrate prms this manual calibration approach directs the parameters search toward local improvements and may be unable to find a global optimal solution sorooshian 2008 the main drawback in these local improvement approaches is that satisfactory results in term of streamflow does not mean that all hydrological processes are well simulated mendoza et al 2016 despite this shortcoming the simulation shows satisfactory results in term of streamflow fig 9 and table 2 and snow processes section s2 moreover the purpose of this study was not to investigate the different hydrological processes but to focus on the contribution of atmospheric circulation to the trend of streamflow for future works focusing on the different components of the water balance or on prms coupled with the modflow groundwater model a global search algorithm should be used the shuffle complex evolution sce ue a global search calibration method previously used for prms markstrom et al 2015 could be considered 4 4 non stationarity of weather data and land use for the purpose of this study the prms model was used at a daily time step therefore the change in intensity of precipitation at a higher timescale i e hourly was not taken into consideration a study to characterize extreme precipitation in southern ontario have shown an increase of precipitation intensity between 1960 and 2012 at a sub daily timescale soulis et al 2016 the increase of sub daily intensity of precipitation may have an impact on streamflow through the enhancement of surface runoff a higher hourly intensity of precipitation supports an increase in streamflow due to a reduction of the infiltration rate this is particularly true for summer streamflow affected by convective storms in winter precipitation is primarily derived from extratropical cyclonic systems which has a large temporal and spatial extension and therefore captured by the daily time step the aim of our study was to assess the impact of atmospheric circulation on the shift of streamflow during winter and spring the hourly time step would therefore have not significantly improved the results of this study but could be considered in future studies focusing on summer streamflow the evolution of land use was not taken into consideration in prms geospatial data showed that forest and urban land cover have been increasing during the 20th century lake erie source protection region technical team 2008 shifts in land use may have implication on the streamflow through a change in evapotranspiration land use in the watersheds is dominated by agriculture and evapotranspiration values varied considerably depending on crop types stage of the crops and irrigation practices irmak 2017 the shape and size of the plants modulate interception evaporation and plants have different water needs for the photosynthesis process irmak 2017 agricultural techniques and especially in their drainage systems would have also impacted streamflow king et al 2014 even though it appeared low in southern ontario spaling 1995 the advantage of not taking into consideration land use change in our study was that the relative change of streamflow due to atmospheric circulation or global warming were better assessed and not affected by an eventual change in land use 5 conclusion this study investigated the role played by atmospheric circulation on the shift of observed streamflow in southern ontario from 1957 to 2013 five recurrent and robust weather regimes were computed for northeastern north america the trend of occurrence of weather regimes was removed to create experimental climate dataset used as input in the precipitation runoff modelling system prms hydrological model the results showed that 40 of the increase of streamflow between december and march and 45 decrease of streamflow in april was due to more frequent z500 positive anomalies in the great lakes region associated with the northern shift of the polar vortex this shift in atmospheric circulation was also contributing to increase the number of high flows by 25 50 in early winter and especially in january this study will help to highlight the significance of atmospheric circulation for local hydrologic conditions and streamflow in a highly populated region of southern ontario it also encourages future studies to consider the internal variability of climate in streamflow projections climate data from multi members ensemble may be used as input in hydrological models to assess the hydrological processes projections uncertainties due to internal variability of climate this will help planers to improve the

6128,flooding is a major concern for canadian society as it is the costliest natural disaster type in canada southern ontario which houses one third of the canadian population is located in an area of high vulnerability for floods the most significant floods in the region have historically occurred during the months of march and april due to snowmelt coupled with extreme rain events however during the last three decades there has been a shift of flooding events to earlier months the aim of this study was to understand the impacts of atmospheric circulation on the temporal shift of streamflow and high flow events observed in southern ontario over 1957 2013 period predominant weather regimes over north america corresponding to recurrent meteorological situations were identified using a discretization of daily geopotential height at 500hpa level z500 a regime normalized hypothetical temperature and precipitation dataset was constructed to quantify the contribution of atmospheric circulation on streamflow response the hypothetical dataset was used as input in the precipitation runoff modeling system prms a rainfall runoff semi distributed hydrological model and applied to four watersheds in southern ontario the results showed an increase in the temporal frequency of the regime identified here as high pressure hp close to eight occurrences per decade regime hp characterized by a northern position of the polar vortex is correlated with a positive phase of the nao and is associated with warm and wet conditions over southern ontario during winter the temporal increase in hp contributed more than 40 of the increase in streamflow in winter and 30 45 decrease in streamflow in april this atmospheric situation also contributed to increase the number of high flows by 25 50 in january these results are important to improve the seasonal forecasting of high flows and to assess the uncertainty in the temporal evolution of streamflow in the great lakes region keywords streamflow hydrological modelling precipitation runoff modeling system prms weather regimes southern ontario atmospheric circulation 1 introduction a shift to earlier streamflow has been commonly observed around the world in glaciated or snow dominated watersheds barnett et al 2005 bliss et al 2014 this shift attributed to global warming has a large impact in water resource stability wu et al 2015 water quality chen et al 2016 or flood management hamlet and lettenmaier 2007 canada is greatly affected by this shift because the country has a high snowmelt contribution to streamflow burn and whitfield 2016 and is highly dependent on fluvial resources southern ontario is a densely populated region in canada and is a critical area to produce high quality agriculture products pim et al 2005 the heterogeneous combination of urban areas industrial activity and agricultural lands makes this region particularly vulnerable to the change in water resources and flood events historically the number of high flow events in southern ontario has peaked in march and april in correspondence with the snow melt period burn and whitfield 2016 buttle et al 2016 in recent decades similarly to what was observed worldwide there has been an observed decline in spring maximum peak flows and an increase in winter flows attributed to an increase in winter temperatures to promote an earlier snowmelt adamowski et al 2013 cunderlik and ouarda 2009 global warming that increased winter snowmelt in numerous snow dominated catchments around the world barnett et al 2005 is modulated regionally by atmospheric circulation in the mid latitudes nilsen et al 2017 recent studies have attempted to identify the contribution of large scale climate variability to the local variability of climate or hydrological processes in southern ontario but the results are generally not promising tan and gan 2015 vincent et al 2015 zhang et al 2010 zhao et al 2013 some of these studies consider monthly values of streamflow nalley et al 2016 or used coarse hydrometric data from large areas in canada coulibaly and burn 2005 a recent study found that pacific north american pattern pna characterized in it positive phase by low pressure anomalies in eastern north america was negatively correlated to extreme precipitation in southern ontario thiombiano et al 2017 similar results were found in the region south of the great lakes where a negative phase of the pna was associated with more extreme precipitations events and higher frequency peak streamflow mallakpour and villarini 2016 meanwhile the negative phase of pna was associated with lower mean winter streamflow in the northeastern united states bradbury et al 2002 the positive phase of the north atlantic oscillation nao associated with a strong gradient between low pressure in iceland and high pressure in the azores has also been found to increase mean winter streamflow in the northeastern united states bradbury et al 2002 while it was found to delay winter peak flows in québec beauchamp et al 2015 other methods described by jones 1994 examined forcing of atmospheric circulation onto local meteorological conditions in the region of great lakes a manual circulation to environment synoptical classification shows that high flows in pennsylvania u s were associated with intense low level pressure cells in the region yarnal and frakes 1997 a manual environment to circulation method was used in atlantic canada to show that great lakes low pressure cells were important processes to generate floods in this region collins et al 2014 in rohli et al 2001 an eigenvector based map pattern classification scheme shows high stream discharge in the u s great lakes basin associated to high pressure anomalies over the northeast north american coast these studies show that the impact of atmospheric circulation on streamflow may vary among different regions of the great lakes basin the lack of robust studies on the relationship between atmospheric circulation and streamflow in southern ontario suggest relevance on focusing further work in this populated region of canada the objective of this study is to examine the impact of atmospheric circulation on the modulation of streamflow in four diverse watersheds i e grand river upper thames river credit river and big creek in southern ontario and to quantify its role in overall streamflow shifts temporal evolution of atmospheric circulation is assessed using classes of recurrent large scale meteorological patterns called weather regimes weather regimes calculation was developed by michelangeli et al 1995 and have been used in europe to identify impacts of regional atmospheric circulation on local climate variability and particularly extreme temperatures cassou et al 2005 fernández montes et al 2013 extreme rainfall pfahl 2014 ullmann et al 2014 or flood events santos et al 2015 the sensitivity of mean streamflow and high flows to temporal shifts of weather regime occurrence frequency is tested by replacing the original precipitation and temperatures datasets with hypothetical regime normalized climate datasets as input in the precipitation runoff modeling system prms the use of hypothetical datasets to understand the role of atmospheric circulation on local or regional weather conditions have been used in the past fleig et al 2015 this method has been previously applied in the great lakes region to understand the impact of atmospheric circulation on the evolution of snowfall leathers and ellis 1996 in our study weather patterns driven hypothetical dataset is used for the first time as input in a hydrological model 2 methods 2 1 study area four watersheds in southern ontario were selected for their long hydrometric time series archives and represent well the diversity of scale soil type and land use in this region fig 1 and table 1 land use in all four watersheds is dominated by agricultural activity credit river has the highest proportion of forest cover two major cities brantford in grand river and london in thames river are present in the study area and additional urban areas are located in the credit river watershed the big creek watershed contains the lowest proportion of urbanization 2 the watersheds also vary in soil type sand predominates in big creek 79 and credit river 43 but a large area of credit is also covered by loamy soil 49 grand river has almost an equal proportion of sand 30 loam 32 and clay 38 while thames river contains more clay 39 the elevation is also highly variable with the highest elevations in the north parts of grand river 531 m and credit river 521 m watersheds while the lowest areas are located in the sandplains further south in grand river 178 m and big creek 179 m 2 2 hydrological modelling the precipitation and runoff modeling system prms a semi distributed conceptual hydrological model was applied to all four watersheds prms has been widely used in snowmelt dominated regions in united states dressler et al 2006 mastin et al 2011 surfleet et al 2012 teng et al 2018 and has been recently applied in china teng et al 2017 and high latitude regions liao and zhuang 2017 with a good representation of the snowmelt processes the hydrological calculations in prms are based on physical laws and empirical relations between measured and estimated quantities markstrom et al 2015 a series of hydrologic reservoirs is used plant canopy interception snowpack soil zone subsurface and the water flowing between the reservoirs is computed for each hydrological response unit hru in this study hrus consisted of surface grid cells of 200mx200m for big creek and credit river watersheds and 400mx400m for grand river and thames river these two watersheds used coarser hrus to reduce the parametrization calculations time for each step of the model calculation prms allows to choose among different modules that are described in the supplementary materials section s1 and in markstrom et al 2015 parameter values used by prms were found in the literature and were spatialized for each hru table s1 these parameters were estimated according to land use elevation aspect slope and soil type using arcpy gsflow under arcgis gardner et al 2018 arcpy gsflow was also used to estimate the water cascade between the hrus and the river segments some of these parameters were modified during calibration while keeping the relative spatial variability of the processes table s1 calibration was done by a trial and error approach and followed three steps 1 calibration of daily shortwave radiation using satellite data 2002 2008 furnished by natural resources canada at 1 10 degree almost 10 km resolution djebbar et al 2012 2 adjustment of potential evapotranspiration pet parameters with value of pet estimated using the thornthwaite method thornthwaite 1948 and 3 calibration of 17 parameters by the normal root mean square error nrmse between daily and monthly mean streamflow the thornthwaite method was used in this study because of readily available gridded temperature data these steps were repeated until the set of parameters produces satisfactory results parameter sources spatial and temporal resolution and values after calibration are listed in table s1 five years were used as the warm up period oct 1984 to sept 1989 to remove the errors due to initial conditions different simulations with a varying warm up period length were tested in the big creek watershed and showed that five years were necessary to eliminate variability due to the initial conditions of the reservoirs the calibration period was from 1989 to 2008 providing a 20 year calibration period and 2009 2013 period were used as the validation period the input variables for prms were precipitation minimum temperature and maximum temperature values these variables were obtained from the gridded historical weather station data cangrid produced by mckenney et al 2011 using natural resources canada and eccc data archives at 10 km spatial resolution 186 data points were needed to cover the area of the four watersheds red markers on fig 1 for model calculations each hru used climate data from the closest grid point 2 3 construction of north american temporal weather regimes temporal evolution of atmospheric circulation was assessed using discretization of daily geopotential height anomalies at 500 hpa level z500 hereafter in recurrent weather regime patterns michelangeli et al 1995 these maps documented the most robust location and intensity of anticyclone positive geopotential height anomalies relative to the climatological mean and depression negative anomalies z500 fields were derived from the 20th century reanalysis version 2 available for all years since 1871 compo et al 2011 the domain used was centered on the great lakes and extended into the eastern part of north america 30 n 60 n 110 w 50 w the weather regimes were calculated for the period 1950 2014 by a k means algorithm applied to the first principal components explaining 80 of the total z500 daily variance 100 k means partitions were performed for each potential number of class 2 10 and the final number of classes were determined by a red noise test described in the supplementary materials section s3 a complete description of the use of the k means algorithm to compute the weather regimes is described in michelangeli et al 1995 the relationship between weather regimes and large scale mode of variability i e nao and pna were also considered as these modes are known for having impacts on local winter conditions in the region beauchamp et al 2015 bradbury et al 2002 thiombiano et al 2017 zhao et al 2013 monthly nao indices were based on iceland and gibraltar sea level pressure furnished by the climatic research unit jones 1994 the pna oscillation monthly indices were furnished by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration barnston and livezey 1987 2 4 construction of original and experimental climate datasets cangrid temperature and precipitation data for the period 1957 2013 are taken as a control data set ctl ctl data are used to create experimental exp climate data sets that represent climate variability that would occur without the influence of atmospheric circulation in previous studies experimental climate datasets were based on average conditions of each weather pattern fleig et al 2015 but had limited application in hydrological models which require realistic daily data series in this study a new algorithm was developed under matlab to create regime normalized climate occurrence data sets to be used as input in hydrological models weather regimes occurrences were first modified to remove their 1957 2013 monthly frequency trend in order to detrend the monthly regime frequencies the regimes were replaced with respect to the observed sequence of regimes between 1957 and 2013 keeping a reasonable sequence of regimes is fundamental because the atmospheric variability is continuous over time and the sequence of regimes that naturally occurs follows a specific order table s2 the construction of the detrended sequence of regimes is described in detail in the supplementary material section s4 following the construction of the new sequence of regime temperature and precipitation conditions associated to the removed regimes were replaced by conditions associated to the new regime new temperature and precipitation conditions were taken from daily observations in each grid point over the 1957 2013 period for each month the daily temperature and precipitation conditions for all grid points in the watersheds were averaged these mean daily conditions were ranked for each regime the observation of the old regime was replaced by conditions situated in the same rank of the new regime for example in january if the day to switch corresponded to the regime hp high pressure and was associated to the highest intra regime temperature ranked first the new conditions will be from the day associated to the first rank of the new regime 5 degrees on average if regime north east fig 2 the same process was performed for the precipitation data even though the algorithm used the observed sequence of regime to construct the experimental dataset several possibilities in the switch of regime can be often made section s4 therefore it was important to repeat the algorithm several times to create different experimental dataset and consider the range of possible changes in weather regimes in consideration of these different possibilities of new experimental datasets we repeated the algorithm 100 times this method produced an experimental dataset to identify climate variability associated with the large scale atmospheric circulation and preserved climate variability from all other sources it also kept the same statistical properties as the original data section s4 and can be used in hydrological models the ctl and 100 exp climate dataset were used as input in prms for each watershed 3 results 3 1 weather regimes and local meteorological conditions five regimes were identified as the most robust and recurrent atmospheric configurations over northeast north america in the 1957 2013 period fig 3 two of the regimes consisted of high geopotential hp high pressure or low geopotential lp low pressure anomalies centered in the eastern great lakes region the regime north east was characterized by high geopotential in northeastern québec while low geopotential conditions occurred in the atlantic ocean northeasterly winds are more likely to occur in this configuration the regime south was characterized by anticyclonic conditions anomalies over the atlantic ocean but cyclonic conditions in northern ontario and northern manitoba causing southerly winds over the region regime north was characterized by low geopotential anomalies in the east with high geopotential conditions in the west causing northerly winds over the great lakes region fig 3 the regimes annual frequencies are depicted in fig 4 and show a seasonal variability for the regimes lp north and north east fig 4 the regime north was more frequent during summer while regimes lp and north east occurred more frequently in winter months inter annual and decadal variability of weather regimes frequency was also observed over the 1957 2013 period fig 4 the regime hp increased every month except october when no trend was found the most significant increasing trend for hp was between january and april july and september and in november regime north also demonstrated significant increases in january and february regime north east increased significantly during june and regime south increased the most during october notable decreasing trends were also observed in the regime north east and south between january and march regime north also declined during warm season april through october while regime lp declined during the cold months november to march however these negative trends were found to be non significant inter annual occurrences of weather regimes were compared to pna and nao indices to identify if a significant correlation exists with the most influential indices over the region fig 5 between january and march the occurrence of regimes hp and north were positively correlated to a positive nao nao while regimes lp and north east were correlated to negative nao nao between october and june the regime lp was correlated to the positive phase of pna pna while regime south was correlated to negative pna pna fig 5 fig 6 shows monthly average temperature and precipitation conditions in all watersheds for each regime and season the regime hp was the warmest during all months of the year while lp and north were the coldest regimes south and north east were similar throughout the year except that north east was warmer during summer south was the wettest regime throughout the year but the inter regime variability of precipitation was higher between months during winter hp was relatively wet from november to april and was the driest regime in august the other three regimes produced less precipitation amount compared to hp between january and april but were wetter during the warm season while the regimes lp and north east remained wet during the fall season north was the driest regime after september these results showed that the weather conditions were well discretized by the regimes in all four watersheds but does not quantify the impacts of trend in weather regimes occurrence on the change of temperature and precipitation in the region temperature fig 7 and precipitation fig 8 trends for each month between 1957 and 2013 in southern ontario are shown for the control dataset ctl the experiment dataset exp and the contribution of weather regimes to the change of temperature or precipitation ctl minus exp the ctl dataset showed a significant increase of temperature in the entire area during every month with the exception of october and november the increasing trend of temperature was highest between december and march in areas further north from the great lakes the warming was also higher in the eastern part of the study area during winter and in the greater toronto area during summer the exp data set showed less intense warming and was generally non significant with more intense cooling during october as compared to ctl the weather regime contribution to temperature increases was higher in winter particularly during march and december during march weather regimes showed more intense warming west of the greatest toronto area while in december the warming was higher in the eastern part of the area spatially ctl precipitation was found to vary on a monthly basis fig 8 precipitation was found to significantly increase in october in most of the study area a trend toward wetter conditions also occurred in the eastern part of the area in june and september and in the northern part of the region in march dryer conditions were observed in the greater toronto region during august and in the east during february the exp dataset showed weaker increases of precipitation during october and march while during june and september the increase of precipitation was enhanced the dryer conditions observed with the ctl data set were also detected by the exp data with drier conditions near lake huron in july the weather regimes contributed to an increase of precipitation between october and december and during march and april in july weather regimes contributed to the increase of precipitation near lake huron 3 2 contribution of weather regimes to the change in streamflow streamflow in the four watersheds have been calculated between 1951 and 2013 with prms using the best set of parameters retained after calibration table 2 the nash sutcliff efficiency nse values were higher than 0 65 for both calibration and validation periods table 2 the percent bias pbias was between 15 and 15 with the exception of credit river during the validation period and big creek during the calibration period in winter a nse higher than 0 65 and a pbias lower than 15 is generally considered a good quantitative fit moriasi et al 2007 fig 9 shows the simulation and the observation of the daily streamflow in all four watersheds and confirms visually the goodness of simulation fit the observed peak at the beginning of the validation period is not well captured by prms fig 9 but similar results were found with the model mike she in another watershed located in the same region sultana and coulibaly 2011 snowpack and snow water equivalent are also reasonably well simulated by prms section s2 the monthly trend of streamflow simulated by the ctl and exp dataset between 1957 and 2013 are shown for all four watersheds in fig 10 in ctl streamflow was increasing between december and march and was decreasing in april the increase of streamflow was significant for all four watersheds in january but only for grand river and credit river in february and march between may and december the evolution of streamflow was lower and non significant removing the trend in the occurrence of weather regimes had a clear impact on streamflow with lower increases of streamflow between december and march and lower decreases during april fig 10 the ratio of the 100 exp average to ctl calculated for each month showed that between december and march 40 50 of the increase of streamflow was due to the shift in weather regimes in april 45 of the decrease of streamflow was due to the shift in weather regimes in thames and big creek and 30 in credit and grand river fig 10 shows the temporal evolution of the number of high flow counts in all months between 1957 and 2013 for the ctl and the exp datasets the high flow counts were determined by peak over threshold approach where the threshold was defined as the average streamflow plus 3sd standard deviation for each watershed high flow counts increased in all four watersheds during january increasing high flow counts were highest in thames river and continued into february while the trend declined for the three other watersheds in march the trend was increasing again for grand and credit river watersheds and was decreasing for thames and big creek in april a decrease of number of high flows was observed in grand and credit rivers removing the trend of weather regimes attenuated the increase of high flows but amplified the decrease of high flows in april for grand and credit watersheds to examine processes driving the shift of streamflow fig 11 shows the change of rain and snowmelt values between two equal periods 1957 1984 and 1985 2012 for both ctl and exp simulations the ctl simulation fig 11 red and purple or purple without blue showed rain and snowmelt increased for all four watersheds in january the increase of snowmelt was also observed in february with the exception of the big creek river watershed in march only credit river showed an increase of snowmelt in april a large decrease of snowmelt was simulated in all four watersheds with the big creek watershed demonstrating the smallest decrease changes due to rain remain low between february and april in the exp simulation purple and blue or purple without red weather regimes contributed to both rain and snowmelt the weather regimes contributed to increase snowmelt and rain during january in february and march weather regimes contributed to increase or attenuate the decrease of snowmelt and rain in april weather regimes contributed to decrease the snowmelt but at the same time attenuate the decrease of rain 4 discussion 4 1 temperature and precipitation drivers on seasonal and spatial variability of streamflow the results of this study suggest an increase of streamflow between december and march and decline in april this shift was also observed by previous studies and was attributed to reduction of snow as a fraction of total precipitation and a reduction of spring snowpack both caused by recent warming burn et al 2010 burn and whitfield 2016 cunderlik and ouarda 2009 monthly streamflow analyses in these four watersheds in southern ontario showed that processes differ among months and among watersheds significant streamflow increases during january in all watersheds fig 10 may have occurred because both temperature and precipitation have increased to enhance the snowmelt and rain figs 7 and 8 the temperature was also increasing in february and march fig 7 but snowmelt increases were diminished fig 11 probably because of thinner snowpack available a seasonal approach was often used by previous studies to describe the past change of precipitation and temperature which oversimplify the results change of temperature and precipitation will not have a similar impact of streamflow for all the months of the same season for example considering the spring march to mai snow is still an important component of the streamflow in march while it completely disappeared in may previous studies that analyzed monthly projections of streamflow in southern ontario showed a shift to early winter clearly due to a shift in snowmelt but also due to increase in precipitation in january grillakis et al 2011 rahman et al 2012 sultana and coulibaly 2011 variability in streamflow change between watersheds is likely due to differences in latitude elevation or proximity of the great lakes in lower latitude lower elevation and lakeshore watersheds such as big creek the snowpack was thinner and the increase of temperature in winter depletes completely the snowpack as soon as january causing a lack of melting later in the winter season fig 11 snowmelt contribution to streamflow started to decrease later in the other watersheds in march for thames and grand river and in april for the credit river probably because the conditions are colder and the increase of temperature were not sufficient to deplete completely the snowpack or to significantly reduce snowfall amounts therefore streamflow increase is enhanced by snowmelt earlier in big creek watershed and later in credit river in april the streamflow decreases in all four watersheds fig 10 is likely due to reduced snowpack availability for snowmelt in recent decades previous studies projecting the near future evolution of streamflow in southern ontario suggests a similar spatial variability in the canard watershed situated near lake erie streamflow is projected to increase in january but decrease in february and march rahman et al 2012 further north the shift is expected to occur later between february and march near lake ontario grillakis et al 2011 sultana and coulibaly 2011 or lake simcoe kuo et al 2017 oni et al 2014 4 2 atmospheric circulation drivers on hydrological processes the shift in streamflow can be attributed to global warming as changes in streamflow were driven by changes in snowmelt volume fig 11 and warming between december and march fig 7 however the shift in atmospheric circulation contributed for a part to the warming fig 7 and to the increase in snowmelt and rain early in the winter fig 11 the part of the warming due to atmospheric circulation between december and april can be associated to the increase of frequency of regime hp fig 4 which is associated with warmer and wetter conditions than average over the region fig 6 the regime hp was characterized by high geopotential anomalies in the east side of north east north america fig 3 these conditions were classically associated to a northern shift of the rossby wave in northeastern north america and a southern shift of the waves in western north america ahrens 1994 this distortion of the rossby waves coincided with the development of extratropical cyclones ahrens 1994 these cyclones were associated with frontal systems bringing significant amount of rain in their east side where the air masses were warm and charged with humidity the regime south was also characterized by a poleward shift of the rossby waves but the waves were shifted to the east fig 3 in this situation the region would have been closer to the center of the depressions making the warm periods shorter than for a regime hp the regime north characterized by negative geopotential anomalies centered on the saint lawrence estuary fig 3 was also increasing in january and february fig 4 and was associated with cold and dry conditions on great lakes fig 6 the increase of frequency of this regime probably offset a part of the warming due to the regime hp in january and february this was why the largest warming from atmospheric circulation occurred in march fig 7 when the regime hp was the only regime increasing significantly fig 4 previous studies have presented correlations of local climate and hydrological processes to the large scale atmospheric indices in the great lakes region and found conclusive links with nao and pna nao is known for being associated with the southward migration of the polar front in eastern north america and therefore negative z500 anomalies over southern ontario and the east coast zhao et al 2013 this situation corresponds well to the regime lp or the regime north east fig 3 which were correlated to nao fig 5 regimes hp and north on the contrary were characterized by high pressure anomalies in southern canada and low anomalies close to the arctic fig 3 conditions typically associated with nao in winter ning and bradley 2015 evidence of warmer temperature corresponding to winter nao had been found in a large region surrounding the great lakes ning and bradley 2015 nao occurrences have been shown to reduce the maximum snowpack zhao et al 2013 and increase the winter streamflow bradbury et al 2002 nao has occurred more frequently since the end of the 1980s ning and bradley 2015 vincent et al 2015 but a low contribution of nao was found to the recent warming vincent et al 2015 in our study that focused on southern ontario higher geopotential anomalies around the great lakes in winter which are characteristic of nao were able to explain 25 30 of the observed warming in winter fig 7 and 40 of the increase of streamflow between december and march fig 10 the pna index has also been shown to impact local conditions with pna correlated to more precipitation extremes and peak flows mallakpour and villarini 2016 thiombiano et al 2017 mallakpour villarini 2016 found that winter pna is associated with positive z500 anomalies in the east coast of united states while negative anomalies occur in the west bringing high moisture transport heavy precipitation and flooding events in the ohio valley region the z500 anomalies that correspond to the regime south fig 3 are similar to the situation associated with pna defined by mallakpour and villarini 2016 long term trends in the pna index shows a positive trend between 1950 and 2000 which could explain the negative trend in the occurrence of the regime south in winter fig 4 regime lp also follows a negative trend correlated to pna however this relationship is complicated as this regime is also correlated to nao fig 5 the long term trends of regimes south or lp were not significant fig 4 so their role in the evolution of climate variables and streamflow may be limited these results emphasize the advantage of weather regimes analyses over large scale mode of variability to study the impact of atmospheric circulation on streamflow the weather regimes showed more directly the different variable sources of temperature and precipitation by composing the different modes of variability in a single series of recurrent weather patterns during the warm season changes in weather regimes had a less clear impact on streamflow this may be due to the dominance of precipitation variability as a driver of streamflow while temperature played a larger role in winter by changing the snow ratio and the snowmelt period summer precipitation are also largely derived from local convective systems and not from large frontal systems associated with the changes in atmospheric circulation 4 3 calibration method in this study a trial and error approach has been used to calibrate prms this manual calibration approach directs the parameters search toward local improvements and may be unable to find a global optimal solution sorooshian 2008 the main drawback in these local improvement approaches is that satisfactory results in term of streamflow does not mean that all hydrological processes are well simulated mendoza et al 2016 despite this shortcoming the simulation shows satisfactory results in term of streamflow fig 9 and table 2 and snow processes section s2 moreover the purpose of this study was not to investigate the different hydrological processes but to focus on the contribution of atmospheric circulation to the trend of streamflow for future works focusing on the different components of the water balance or on prms coupled with the modflow groundwater model a global search algorithm should be used the shuffle complex evolution sce ue a global search calibration method previously used for prms markstrom et al 2015 could be considered 4 4 non stationarity of weather data and land use for the purpose of this study the prms model was used at a daily time step therefore the change in intensity of precipitation at a higher timescale i e hourly was not taken into consideration a study to characterize extreme precipitation in southern ontario have shown an increase of precipitation intensity between 1960 and 2012 at a sub daily timescale soulis et al 2016 the increase of sub daily intensity of precipitation may have an impact on streamflow through the enhancement of surface runoff a higher hourly intensity of precipitation supports an increase in streamflow due to a reduction of the infiltration rate this is particularly true for summer streamflow affected by convective storms in winter precipitation is primarily derived from extratropical cyclonic systems which has a large temporal and spatial extension and therefore captured by the daily time step the aim of our study was to assess the impact of atmospheric circulation on the shift of streamflow during winter and spring the hourly time step would therefore have not significantly improved the results of this study but could be considered in future studies focusing on summer streamflow the evolution of land use was not taken into consideration in prms geospatial data showed that forest and urban land cover have been increasing during the 20th century lake erie source protection region technical team 2008 shifts in land use may have implication on the streamflow through a change in evapotranspiration land use in the watersheds is dominated by agriculture and evapotranspiration values varied considerably depending on crop types stage of the crops and irrigation practices irmak 2017 the shape and size of the plants modulate interception evaporation and plants have different water needs for the photosynthesis process irmak 2017 agricultural techniques and especially in their drainage systems would have also impacted streamflow king et al 2014 even though it appeared low in southern ontario spaling 1995 the advantage of not taking into consideration land use change in our study was that the relative change of streamflow due to atmospheric circulation or global warming were better assessed and not affected by an eventual change in land use 5 conclusion this study investigated the role played by atmospheric circulation on the shift of observed streamflow in southern ontario from 1957 to 2013 five recurrent and robust weather regimes were computed for northeastern north america the trend of occurrence of weather regimes was removed to create experimental climate dataset used as input in the precipitation runoff modelling system prms hydrological model the results showed that 40 of the increase of streamflow between december and march and 45 decrease of streamflow in april was due to more frequent z500 positive anomalies in the great lakes region associated with the northern shift of the polar vortex this shift in atmospheric circulation was also contributing to increase the number of high flows by 25 50 in early winter and especially in january this study will help to highlight the significance of atmospheric circulation for local hydrologic conditions and streamflow in a highly populated region of southern ontario it also encourages future studies to consider the internal variability of climate in streamflow projections climate data from multi members ensemble may be used as input in hydrological models to assess the hydrological processes projections uncertainties due to internal variability of climate this will help planers to improve the

6129,the stability of a residual gravelly soil slope during heavy rainfall is closely related to the seepage field which is directly affected by the seepage boundaries of the slope to examine the boundary effect a novel model flume that can implement permeable and impermeable boundary conditions was designed with this flume hydraulic model tests of a gravelly soil slope considering those two seepage boundaries were carried out the results show that distinct spatial morphology of seepage fields is reflected by the hydraulic characteristics of the slope models with different seepage boundaries the slope with permeable boundaries generally exhibits a larger average infiltration rate as well as a relatively smaller moving speed of wetting front in the lower part compared to the slope with impermeable boundaries the residual moisture content in the deep lower part of the slope with permeable boundaries is 6 6 cm3 cm3 smaller than that of the slope with impermeable boundaries nevertheless the maximum pore water pressure in the middle part of the slope with permeable boundaries is 1 2 kpa higher than that in the corresponding part of the slope with impermeable boundaries it is noted that regional pore water pressures in the shallow lower and shallow middle parts of the slope with impermeable boundaries exhibit large fluctuations with an amplitude over 0 5 kpa the seepage field in the slope with permeable boundaries presents a multi dimensional development which may lead to a local failure of the slope the results are of great significance in studying the similarity of seepage boundary condition in the field of similarity theory on landslide model tests and provide an experimental basis for establishing rainfall induced landslide theory keywords landslide seepage boundary model test gravelly soil hydraulic characteristics 1 introduction it was reported that over 94 of landslides were caused by rainfall and human activities ye et al 2005 the rainfall induced landslides that take place in gravelly soils account for a large proportion of geological disasters and have posed a serious threat to people s lives and property he et al 2004 the formation of landslides and other disasters associated with gravelly soils is closely related to the change in the hydraulic characteristics in the process of rainfall infiltration bordoni et al 2015 take et al 2004 ooi et al 2014 okura et al 2002 reid et al 2008 cui et al 2018 loritz et al 2018 generally the moisture content of a slope increases after rainfall and the pore water pressure and pore air pressure change correspondingly subsequently the shear strength of the soil decreases and the safety of the slope degrades when the overall or local sliding force of the slope exceeds the shear resistance of the soil the landslide occurs therefore it is necessary to examine the hydraulic characteristics of gravelly soil slopes during rainfall for landslide warning and prevention at present the methods for studying rainfall induced landslide problems include in situ test model test and numerical simulation tang et al 2016 shi et al 2016 hu et al 2017a b xia and liang 2018 yang et al 2018 zhong et al 2018 among the above methods the in situ test is usually used to monitor the complex evolution of multi physical fields during landslides tang et al 2016 hu et al 2017a b and the numerical simulation is generally applied to simulate the landslides approximatively from theory shi et al 2016 xia and liang 2018 in addition the model test is a very important and widely used mean to investigate the rainfall induced landslides because it allows conveniently reproducing the whole process of landslide visually tami et al 2004 lee et al 2011 sun et al 2012 shen et al 2012 chen et al 2016 however most of the previous studies e g yang et al 2018 zhong et al 2018 sun et al 2012 shen et al 2012 chen et al 2016 considered impermeable boundaries rather than permeable boundaries in landslide model tests which have great influences on the results of model tests particularly those using gravelly soils as materials gravelly soils as heterogeneous masses that consist of soil material and or rock fragments are widely distributed in the southwest and northwest of china yuan et al 2009 zhang et al 2016 dong et al 2017 the stability problems of gravelly soil slopes under rainfall infiltration are complicated and susceptible to many factors this is because the coarse grained phase and fine grained phase of gravelly soils have different hydraulic physical and mechanical properties and the soil structures usually show spatial variability hu et al 2014 ni 2015 chen et al 2016 ma et al 2017 dong et al 2017 ran et al 2018 gao et al 2019 gravelly soils have large spatially distributed porosities along natural gravelly soil slopes of which the porous and permeable boundaries frequently exist thus pipe flow often appears following pore channels formed from the connection of large pores after a certain period of rainfall sun et al 2012 shen et al 2012 and the inhomogeneous distribution of the grains of different sizes in the vertical direction of gravelly soils may lead to the phenomenon of capillary barrier this usually contributes a lot to the occurrence of landslides during rainfall infiltration under the influence of different seepage boundaries tami et al 2004 lee et al 2011 hence the adoption of different seepage boundaries in gravelly soil slopes may have great influences on the formation of seepage field and further the stability of gravelly soil slopes obviously for a rainfall induced landslide in gravelly soils the degree of similarity between the prototype and model would be reduced if impermeable boundaries are applied to reproduce the real hydraulic processes and rainfall induced landslides in natural slopes by model tests the application of proper seepage boundaries that satisfy the boundary similarity is very important on the other hand rainfall induced landslides and related disasters show sundry characteristics in different types of soil take et al 2004 spickermann et al 2009 chen et al 2010 for instance the complete liquefaction phenomenon often occurs in local regions of loose sandy soil slopes and causes a type of landslide similar to the flow slide of soil take et al 2004 while the transient liquefaction usually takes place in the landslide model tests of clayey soil slopes and leads to a failure of local soil instability spickermann et al 2009 the clay content in gravelly soils can affect the pore water pressure through its influence on soil pore structures during rainfall and finally it affects the triggering mechanism and failure mode of debris flow chen et al 2010 as stated above what can be taken into account is that the seepage boundary has different effects on the hydraulic characteristics of the slope models made of different types of soil wang et al 2005 seifeddine et al 2012 lu godt 2008 ali et al 2014 therefore it is meaningful to prepare the slope model with an artificial gravelly soil that can both represent the characteristics of sandy soil and clayey soil to comprehensively understand the influence of seepage boundary as for the experimental forms and major concerns about test results many earlier researchers used destructive model tests to investigate the relationship between the change in some hydraulic parameters caused by rainfall and the occurrence process of landslide while the non destructive experimental studies concerning the hydraulic characteristics in the whole rainfall process are less zuo et al 2015 jia et al 2009 reid et al 2008 take et al 2004 chen et al 2010 bogaard et al 2014 it is worth noting that most of previous studies e g bordoni et al 2015 zuo et al 2015 reid et al 2008 chen et al 2010 concerning model tests paid little attention to the hydraulic characteristics in different regions of slopes during rainfall infiltration which is related to the forms of landslides i e overall landslide and local landslide actually the understanding of the regional hydraulic characteristics is helpful for analyzing regional variation rules of hydraulic characteristics in the whole rainfall process and evaluating the internal factors triggering landslides and other disasters from multiple perspectives based on the above considerations a novel model flume is self developed two different seepage boundaries are designed and gravelly soil slopes are prepared from a fine grained soil and the grains of quartz sandstone to analyze the effects of different seepage boundaries on the whole hydraulic process in this paper the hydraulic characteristics obtained from the slope model test under the permeable boundary condition are compared with the existing research results the mechanism of the influence of seepage boundary on the hydraulic characteristics of gravelly soil slopes is discussed the results would be beneficial for studying the similarity of slope seepage boundary in the field of model tests and provide an experimental basis for the theory establishment of rainfall induced landslides 2 model flume with different seepage boundaries 2 1 model flume in order to simulate the hydraulic characteristics of gravelly soil slopes during rainfall a novel model flume with a length of 2 m a width of 0 5 m and a height of 1 m was designed based on several references sun et al 2012 ni 2015 hu et al 2014 ma et al 2017 chen et al 2010 zuo et al 2015 the european standard aluminum profile was selected as the framework of the model flume fig 1 the flume can be broken down into three parts i e the upper structure the lower structure and the connection structure the upper structure consisted of a water supply tank a soil tank and a water collection tank the side plates of the soil tank had drainage holes to simulate the permeable seepage boundary fig 2 a to attain an impermeable boundary the internal surfaces of the porous side plates were covered with 5 mm acrylic sheets as shown in fig 2b the two large sides were double deck structures consisted of multiple water storage compartments the water collection tank was divided into multiple water storage compartments from the top to the bottom the lower structure that was anchored to the ground consisted of a bracket and a pad with bolt holes the connection structure included a hydraulic pressure cylinder three steel shafts and several t shaped bearings it was a scalable triangular structure allowing the adjustment of the slope angle of the flume between 0 and 40 2 2 horizontal seepage test of gravelly soil horizontal seepage tests were carried out to obtain the horizontal hydraulic conductivity and infiltration law of the gravelly soil with a representative grading the results of the horizontal seepage tests could provide guidance for the design of model flume the test material was a gravelly soil composed of a fine grained soil whose particles were smaller than 5 mm and quartz sandstone grains whose sizes were between 5 mm and 40 mm collected from a slope gps coordinates 27 55 n 113 1 e in the zhaoshan mountain xiangtan china fig 3 a and b the soil matrix i e fine grained soil had the same mineral composition and the quartz sandstone grains were artificially crushed fresh fragments of a non weathered rock in this way the interference of the heterogeneity in soil matrix and the influence of the differences in rock weathering were excluded and the reproducibility of test results can be ensured the physical and mechanical properties of the fine grained soil are listed in table 1 the fractions of the gravelly soil are shown in fig 3c in the horizontal seepage tests representative grain gradations at the top of the slope middle of the slope and toe of the slope gao et al 2019 respectively were considered to take the grading variability of gravelly soil slope into account the grading design of the test gravelly soil is shown in table 2 a specific test device was self designed to complete the horizontal seepage tests see fig 4 the inner dimension of the horizontal square column was 300 mm in width 300 mm in height and 700 mm in length the wall thickness of the column was 10 mm and the head cover could be opened the seepage tests were carried out at room temperature 20 after the horizontal seepage tests darcy s law was adopted to calculate the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the gravelly soil darcy s law has the following form 1 k q l a δ h t where k is the hydraulic conductivity m s q is the seepage flow m3 l is the length m a is the cross sectional area m2 of the sample δh is the head difference m t is the seepage time s the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of gravelly soil was calculated by the exponential function proposed by gardner gardner 1958 2 k φ 1 k s e α φ 1 φ 1 0 where k φ 1 is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity m s φ 1 is the soil water potential m a negative value represents the unsaturated state k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity m s α is the pore size distribution parameter m 1 the calculation parameters were determined from the green ampt infiltration model green and ampt 1911 and the philip horizontal infiltration formula philip 1957 the horizontal seepage test was performed twice on each gravelly soil of a given grain gradation and the average results were used for analyses see table 3 2 3 seepage boundary conditions as mentioned previously the boundary of the model flume for seepage tests was set as a porous structure to simulate the pore characteristics of the gravelly soil note that the hydraulic conductivity should not be used as a reference index for designing the seepage boundary condition because it depends on not only the factors related to the soil pore structure but also the temperature and viscosity of the fluid instead the intrinsic permeability was selected in this study as a reference index because it is only influenced by the pore structure of the gravelly soil an intrinsic permeability not less than that of the test gravelly soil was taken for the seepage boundary of the flume thus the boundary had the same or a larger hydraulic conductivity than the test gravelly soil the pore structure of the side plates of the model flume could be adjusted according to the test materials in practical tests according to the capillary model bear 2013 the hagen poisseuile law that controls the steady flow can be expressed by 3 q s π δ 4 ρ g 128 φ 2 s where q s is the total flow volume m3 δ is the diameter of aperture m ρ is the density of fluid kg m3 g is the gravitational acceleration n kg φ 2 is the piezometric head m s is the length measured along a capillary tube m φ 2 s is the pressure potential gradient substituting eq 3 into the equation of darcy s law we can obtain the following equation for intrinsic permeability 4 κ k ν ρ g n π δ 4 128 where κ is the intrinsic permeability m2 ν is the dynamic viscosity of water n s m2 n is the number of holes per unit area m 2 to endow the side plate with enough water discharge capacity a k s value of 3 96 10 3 m s of the test material measured in section 2 2 was selected as the maximum k value and thus a κ value of 6 347 10 9 m2 was calculated from k according to eq 4 the porous structure of the side plates of the model flume was similar to the profile of the gravelly soil the circular holes on the side plates can be regarded as the pore space in the gravelly soil and the solid part of the side plates can be regarded as the soil grains hence the circular holes on the side plates should have the same scale with the pores of the gravelly soil and the distance between two circular holes should have the same scale with the average particle size of gravels according to the size threshold between soil matrix and rock in gravelly soils barahona et al 1999 dong et al 2017 a δ value of 2 0 10 3 m or 3 0 10 3 m was selected and the following results were obtained when δ 2 0 10 3 m and n 15839 487 m 2 n 0 5 125 m 1 it represents that the circular holes with 2 mm diameters are distributed on the side plates every 8 mm when δ 3 0 10 3 m and n 3128 787 m 2 n 0 5 56 m 1 it represents that the circular holes with 3 mm diameters are distributed on the side plate every 17 mm according to the grading characteristics of gravelly soils dong et al 2017 gao et al 2019 17 mm is close to the average size of gravels and able to characterize the gravel scale whereupon the latter scheme was chosen to design the flume 3 hydraulic model tests of slopes with two seepage boundaries 3 1 test system the model test system was composed of a model flume a rainfall system and a measurement system the flume was assembly molded by aluminum steel wood and acrylic materials the design details are introduced in section 2 1 the rainfall system consisted of micro spray nozzles connecting pipes a water pump and hydraulic control valves as shown in fig 5 the nozzles can spray highly uniform water drops with diameters 65 μm two rows of interlaced nozzles connected through the connecting pipes were placed above the model flume in addition the water pump and hydraulic control valves were arranged between the connecting pipe and tap water prior to testing the rainfall system was adjusted and the rainwater was collected by 20 measuring cylinders of 100 ml placed below the bottom of the flume to test the rainfall uniformity an empirical equation was proposed to evaluate the rainfall uniformity based on the collected rainfall data the empirical equation is as follows 5 u 1 i 1 n r i r n r where u is the rainfall uniformity ri is the collected precipitation of ith measuring cylinder during rainfall mm n is the number of the measuring cylinders r is the average precipitation mm it was found that when the rainfall intensity was 1 1 mm min controlled by adjusting the hydraulic control valve the rainfall uniformity approximated 90 the measurement system consisted of many sensors a data acquisition system and water collection containers the sensors used in the test included pore water pressure gauges moisture content sensors and matric potential sensors note that the moisture content sensors used in this study output volumetric moisture contents and the negative values of the outputs of the matric potential sensors are referred to as matric suctions the pore water pressure gauges present negative values of the real pore water pressures the data acquisition system included the dh3821 device produced by the jiangsu liyang instrument factory in china the em50 device produced by the decagon devices company in the usa and a computer the water collection containers included white drums basins etc the volumes of water were measured during the test in real time the sensor specifications are shown in table 4 and the information of the data acquisition instruments is given in table 5 before the test all sensors were calibrated 3 2 test design and procedures the purpose of the hydraulic model tests was to examine the influence of seepage boundary on the hydraulic characteristics of gravelly soil slopes under rainfall for the colluvium with cohesive strengths it must have enough depths the minimum depth is termed the critical depth to cause large driving force otherwise landslides cannot be initiated in the colluvium in this study the critical depth of soil was 0 62 m and the slope angle was 20 referring to the statistical data of colluvial soil landslides reported by parker et al 2016 according to the annual water resources information of hunan province a rainfall intensity of 1 1 mm min was selected the specification of hydraulic model tests is listed in table 6 the slope model was made of the same material as that presented in section 2 2 but the grading was adjusted to meet the gravimetric stone content i e the mass fraction of soil particles greater than 5 mm in gravelly soil of 50 as shown in table 7 the initial moisture content of the test material was 8 for comparison purposes two groups of tests were conducted these two groups had the same experimental conditions except that the seepage boundaries were different the influence of seepage boundary conditions on the variation of hydraulic characteristics and outflow in the infiltration process was particularly analyzed as shown in fig 6 l m and u represent the lower part middle part and upper part of the slope respectively the numbers 1 and 2 after l m or u represent the shallow layer and deep layer respectively generally the lower part of the slope is often the key area triggering landslide disasters and the middle and upper parts move successively after the failure of the lower part nevertheless the local instability failure is prone to appear in the upper part of the slope the regional testing of the slope is helpful to understand the regional movement behavior of slope and analyze the mechanism of rainfall induced landslides to perform the test the boundary was treated with abrasive paper according to the roughness of the material the slope model was made using the multi layer compaction method and the sensors were properly embedded fig 7 afterward the prepared slope model was rested until the readings of the sensors were stable next the rainfall intensity was adjusted to the desired value of 1 1 mm min finally the test was stopped once the slope was completely wet i e the water flow phenomenon was seen outside from the bottom plate of the flume and the outflow at the slope boundary was steady in order to accurately record the outflow and its location during the test the water storage compartments of the model flume were numbered as illustrated in fig 8 to reveal the infiltration law in different areas of the slopes the moisture migration data and the moisture content data were used to calculate the cumulative infiltration in each part of the slopes by the green ampt infiltration model green and ampt 1911 the green ampt infiltration model is expressed by 6 i δ θ z f where i is the cumulative infiltration δθ is the difference between the saturated moisture content and the initial moisture content z f is the migration distance of wetting front the soil water characteristic curve characterizes the changing law of matric suction with moisture content in soil and basically reflects the change of energy for the movement of water and air in soil in the literature the most commonly used empirical formula of the soil water characteristic curve is the van genuchten model for instance shao et al 2010 used the van genuchten model to fit the moisture characteristic parameters of rock soil mixtures and obtained good results in this study the van genuchten model was also employed to characterize the soil water characteristic curve the van genuchten model has the following expression 7 θ θ r θ s θ r 1 1 α h n m where θ s is the saturated moisture content θ r is the residual moisture content h is the pressure head α is the air entry suction n and m are the model parameters 4 results as the rainfall begins the soil slope gets wet gradually the wetting front starts moving and the moisture content and other hydraulic characteristics of the slope change accordingly in this section the preliminary results of the hydraulic characteristics of the two different slopes are presented and compared meanwhile the secondary results of hydraulic characteristics calculated via eqs 6 and 7 and the properties of seepage field are given 4 1 preliminary results of hydraulic characteristics 4 1 1 movement of wetting fronts the results show that the elapsed time for the slope with permeable boundaries to be completely wet is 4 h and 53 min which is about 40 min earlier than that for the slope with impermeable boundaries the average moving speed of wetting front in the slope with permeable boundaries is fast while that of wetting front in the deep upper part of the slope with impermeable boundaries is slow fig 9 illustrates the positions of wetting fronts in the slope models at different time one can note several different phenomena at the beginning of rainfall i e 0 30 min the movement of wetting front in the model with permeable boundaries is significantly faster than that of wetting front in the slope with impermeable boundaries during the period of 30 95 min the moving speed of wetting front in the slope with impermeable boundaries exceeds that of wetting front in the slope with permeable boundaries at last these two slopes have a close value of the average moving speed of wetting front on the whole the moving speed of wetting front is more stable and the slope of wetting front in the lower part is smaller in the slope with permeable boundaries than those in the slope with impermeable boundaries during the movement of wetting fronts different performances of the slopes are noted the 10 min moving distance of wetting front in the slope with permeable boundaries reaches its maximum between 55 min and 65 min by contrast the 10 min moving distance of wetting front in the slope with impermeable boundaries presents two extreme values the first occurs between 25 min and 35 min and the second appears between 75 min and 85 min these results are probably caused by the different movements of the air phase and the water phase 4 1 2 moisture content in fig 10 u 1 water refers to the moisture content sensor in the shallow upper part of a slope when the wetting front reaches the test position the moisture content rapidly increases up to a maximum value and then remains stable indicating that the gravelly soil is gradually saturated after rainfall the moisture contents in different parts decrease successively at different rates under gravity the responding time at which the moisture content starts to change greatly is earlier and the wetting front moves faster in the middle and upper parts of the slope with permeable boundaries than those in the same parts of the slope with impermeable boundaries meanwhile the responding time of the moisture content sensor in the lower part of the slope with impermeable boundaries is earlier than that of the sensor in the same part of the slope with permeable boundaries this result is consistent with the movement of wetting fronts and reflects the influence of air resistance table 8 shows that the increase in the average moisture content of the slope with permeable boundaries is slightly greater than that of the slope with impermeable boundaries both the maximum value and maximum increment of the moisture content of the slope with permeable boundaries occur in l 2 i e the catchment in the slope with impermeable boundaries the moisture content has two peak values that appear in m 2 and l 2 respectively because of the reduced hydraulic conductivity at the end of rainfall the maximum residual moisture content that appears in l 2 is 44 8 cm3 cm3 which is higher than those in other areas it is worth noting that the residual moisture content in l 2 of the slope with permeable boundaries is 38 2 which is 6 6 smaller than that in the same area of the slope with impermeable boundaries nevertheless the residual moisture content in u 1 of the slope with impermeable boundaries is 24 7 which is 5 3 smaller than that in the same area of the slope with permeable boundaries 4 1 3 pore water pressure fig 10 shows that the changing process of pore water pressure presents a coordinated variability the pore water pressure peaks between the shallow layer and the deep layer of the middle and lower parts show a conformity characteristic while the pore water pressure in the upper part shows variability the relationship between pore water pressure and moisture content is not clear it is observed that the curve contours of pore water pressures in the two slopes with different boundaries are similar but the variation amplitudes are quite different the variation amplitude of pore water pressure in the shallow layer of the slope with permeable boundaries is larger than that in the slope with impermeable boundaries whereas the variation amplitude of pore water pressure was smaller in the deep layer of the slope with permeable boundaries furthermore the maximum difference of about 1 2 kpa between the pore water pressures in the two slope models occurs in the middle part the curves of the shallow layer of the lower and middle parts of the slope with impermeable boundaries exhibit large fluctuations of over 0 5 kpa fig 10b and c 4 1 4 matric suction the initial matric suctions i e the negative values of matric potentials are listed in table 9 it shows that the initial matric suctions in various positions of each slope model are highly different exhibiting an uneven distribution of matric suctions the maximum matric suction occurs at the bottom of the deep layer fig 11 presents the variation in matric suction during rainfall infiltration in the process of rainfall infiltration the matric suctions rapidly increase up to the maximums and then become stable after the wetting fronts reach the test positions after rainfall infiltration the matric suction of the slope with permeable boundaries keeps stable at approximately 9 8 kpa while that of the slope with impermeable boundaries remains at approximately 8 7 kpa 4 2 secondary results of hydraulic characteristics 4 2 1 cumulative infiltration fig 12 shows the cumulative infiltration in three parts of the two slope models the cumulative infiltration ordered from large to small in different parts of the slope with permeable boundaries is that in the lower part that in the middle part and that in the upper part by contrast the cumulative infiltration in the lower and middle parts of the slope with impermeable boundaries is almost equivalent during rainfall the cumulative infiltration curve shows a linear variation within 80 min for the two slope models which is similar to the vertical infiltration performance of gravelly soils reported by dong et al 2017 subsequently the changing rate of cumulative infiltration in the upper part slows down and levels off 4 2 2 soil water characteristic curve the soil water characteristic curve is indispensable to analyze the hydraulic characteristics of unsaturated soils lu and godt 2013 the van genuchten model was used to fit the experimental data collected by moisture content sensors and matric potential sensors in the shallow layer of each slope the soil water characteristic curves of the upper and middle parts of the two different slopes are shown in fig 13 and the fitting parameters are shown in table 10 the coefficients of determination r 2 of the data fitting are larger than 90 which indicates that the van genuchten model can be used to characterize the soil water characteristic curve of the test gravel soil it appears that the fitting effect of the data of the middle part is better than that of the upper part moreover the shapes of the soil water characteristic curves for the slopes with different boundary conditions are different due to different moving states of air and water in slopes the fitting parameters are also different in the two tests the α value of the slope with impermeable boundaries is smaller than that of the slope with permeable boundaries while the n value of the slope with impermeable boundaries is larger than that of the slope with permeable boundaries the θ r values of the two slopes are quite similar and the θ s value of the slope with permeable boundaries is smaller than that of the slope with impermeable boundaries 4 3 properties of seepage field 4 3 1 seepage field in the slope fig 9 illustrates the formation of seepage fields in the slopes with different seepage boundaries the seepage fields formed in the two slope models are quite different which is probably resulted from the distinct distributions of the air resistance to water infiltration the moving speed of wetting front in the lower part of the slope with impermeable boundaries is significantly faster than that in the similar part of the slope with permeable boundaries exhibiting a strongly centralized water diversion phenomenon concerning the slope with impermeable boundaries the formation of seepage channels is fast in the shallow lower part relatively late in the deep lower part and lagged in the upper part 4 3 2 boundary flow the slope runoff data i e runoff on the slope surface seepage flow on the lateral boundary seepage flow on the bottom etc were observed and recorded from the beginning to the end of rainfall see figs 14 16 1 overland runoff during rainfall the overland runoff does not occur and the rainwater completely infiltrates into the gravelly soil for the slope with permeable boundaries however with respect to the slope with impermeable boundaries the infiltration rate is smaller than the rainfall intensity under the effect of gas resistance thus an obvious runoff phenomenon occurs as shown in fig 14 the cut off point on the curve of cumulative flow is termed the feature point d the cumulative flow nonlinearly increases in the stage before the d point and linearly increases after the d point 2 lateral flow the lateral drainage pathways of the slope with impermeable boundaries are closed and thus the lateral flow is not produced the lateral flow in the slope with permeable boundaries occurs in 2 1 3 1 3 2 3 3 areas see the blue areas in fig 15 slight running water appears at a height of 15 cm above the wetting front at the permeable boundary and the phenomenon stops when the wetting front continues migrating downward according to the value of cumulative flow the locations can be ordered as 3 3 3 2 3 1 and 2 1 3 subsurface flow the subsurface flow includes the flow in soil and groundwater flow due to the difference in lateral seepage boundary conditions the subsurface flow presents different characteristics over time in the two slopes as shown in fig 16 the region marked blue in the schematic diagram of the model flume represents the development of subsurface flow fig 16a shows that the drainage area on the bottom of the slope with permeable boundaries is concentrated in the underground flow area the underground flow area begins to produce flow at 50 min during rainfall and the outflow rate suddenly increases up to 11 52 ml s at 111 min as shown in fig 16b the time when the outflow appears in all parts except 2 5 on the bottom of the slope with impermeable boundaries is earlier than that of the slope with permeable boundaries subsurface flow is developed strongly in the slope with permeable boundaries except for the 2 4 area as expected the subsurface flow rate in the 2 5 area is faster than the groundwater flow rate after 225 min the 2 4 area has a limited development of seepage pathways compared with the other areas 5 discussion 5 1 inner relationship among hydraulic characteristics from the test results see figs 9 13 the inner relationships among different hydraulic characteristics can be identified the regions where the wetting front moves faster usually present a higher moisture content as reported by zuo et al 2015 this finding is in agreement with the test results of the current study see table 8 in the deep part while is inconsistent with those concerning the shallow part the moving rate of wetting front can influence but not determine the moisture content because the latter is also affected by many other factors including material properties e g stone content and external environmental factors e g boundary conditions cui et al 2018 loritz et al 2018 with respect to the results of this study the stone content in the shallow layers of three parts may have an uneven distribution so the moisture content does not follow the changing rule shown in the work of zuo et al 2015 and the deep lower part is the place where the preferential flow exists sun et al 2012 yang et al 2017 the formation of the preferential flow leads to the acceleration of wetting front so the moisture content tends to increase in this region the relationship among the cumulative infiltration moisture migration and moisture content are expressed by eq 6 the calculation results in fig 12 reveal the infiltration law of rainfall the cumulative infiltration in the slope with permeable boundaries has a positive correlation with the moving rate of wetting front see figs 9 and 12 nevertheless in the slope with impermeable boundaries the cumulative infiltration in the lower part and the middle part has a similar value although the moving rate of wetting front in the lower part is larger than that in the middle part this phenomenon is attributed to the change in δθ when the seepage boundary condition varies hu et al 2017a b ma et al 2016 the relationship between pore water pressure and moisture content is shown in fig 10 during rainfall except for the shallow upper part a major law ooi et al 2014 okura et al 2002 reid et al 2008 that the pore water pressure increases negatively with the increase in moisture content until 500 min nearly 100 min after rainfall appears after 500 min the pore water pressure shows a general trend of returning to the initial state with the decrease in moisture content which indicates the dissipation process of pore water pressure the immediate change in pore water pressure affected by the moisture content is not consistent with the results of shuo et al 2019 because the pore water pressure is also related to soil matrix bordoni et al 2015 however the pore water pressures in the shallow upper part and the shallow middle part keep their original paths although the moisture contents in these two parts have obvious decreases according to the work of shuo et al 2019 the change in pore water pressure may be relevant to the deformation of soil the pores are compressed during the deformation progress leading to the compression of the air in the pores hence the pore water pressures in the shallow upper part and the shallow middle part continue to increase after rainfall it is important to note that there is no obvious quantitative relationship between the moisture content and the pore water pressure for the two groups of results high moisture contents and high pore water pressures do not always appear at the same time similar findings were also reported by bordoni et al 2015 and jia et al 2009 such results may be related to the variability of pore structures in different positions of a slope böttcher et al 2012 the relationship between the matric suction and the moisture content basically satisfies the van genuchten model see fig 13 the matric suction decreases with the increase in moisture content it is noted that there are many data points not located on the fitting curve two aspects of reasons result in this phenomenon i the moisture content and the matric suction are not measured from the same position so the change in matric suction may not synchronize with the change in moisture content ii the measurement precision of the matric potential sensor is not very high leading to certain errors of matric suction when the wetting front approaches the measurement areas the matric suction responds faster than pore water pressure and they show the same changing trend since the matric suction has an earlier response than the pore water pressure it is usually applied to evaluate the safety of slopes eichenberger et al 2013 5 2 influence mechanism of boundary conditions 5 2 1 influence on the movement of wetting fronts the test results indicate the uneven moving speed of the wetting front in the slope with impermeable boundaries compared to the slope with impermeable boundaries it is revealed that the restriction on the development of wetting front appears see fig 9 if the seepage boundary changes from a permeable type to an impermeable one when the lateral boundary is closed the exhaust passage of soil is limited and the air in the soil near the lower part of the slope is discharged rapidly from the bottom under the dynamic pressure of water flow lee et al 2011 hu et al 2014 ma et al 2017 this gives priority to the formation of an unobstructed seepage path which is characterized by concentrated diversion and preferential water discharging i e preferential flow in the lower part of the slope with impermeable boundaries shen et al 2012 by contrast a large part of the air in the slope with permeable boundaries is discharged from the side showing that the average downward infiltration rate is faster than the slope with impermeable boundaries and the wetting front moves faster in the upper part of the slope with permeable boundaries than that in the upper part of the slope with impermeable boundaries see fig 12 the boundary effect on the movement of wetting fronts is mainly during the period of 0 95 min after the beginning of rainfall especially the period of 0 30 min it seems that the seepage boundary has a great influence on the formation process of seepage field at the initial stage especially the formation of preferential flow sidle et al 2001 5 2 2 influence on the moisture distribution the slope with impermeable boundaries has smaller water and air conductivities than the slope with permeable boundaries therefore the highest moisture content increases in the deep lower part i e the water storage region where the static liquefaction happens and the streamlines are dense as reported by related works take et al 2004 yuan et al 2009 in addition the moisture content and water storage capacity in the deep middle part of the slope with impermeable boundaries are larger than those in the same part of the slope with permeable boundaries because of the closed lateral boundaries a smaller average moisture content i e 36 1 in the slope with impermeable boundaries see table 8 indicates that there is a larger residual air phase about 0 8 in the slope with impermeable boundaries and thus the average degree of saturation is lower in this case the discrepancies i e 6 6 and 5 3 in the residual moisture contents of the deep lower parts and shallow upper parts between the two slopes with different seepage boundaries display different gas liquid ratios in different positions of the slopes frankenberger et al 1999 the most affected regions by the seepage boundary condition are consistent with the results of the movement of wetting fronts it is noted that the moisture content can be used to predict a landslide and the change of moisture content distributions will have a significant effect on the failure of slopes abramson et al 2002 hence the two slopes with different boundary conditions may have different performances in maintaining stability 5 2 3 influence on the pore water pressure compared to the slope with permeable boundaries the slope with impermeable boundaries has closed lateral exhaust passages of gas in the latter case there is a minimum distance between the outlet and air so the pore air pressure goes up and air is difficult to discharge influencing the water leakage process in the shallow layer larson and gupta 1980 bobet 2003 fox et al 2010 yin and zhu 1999 hence rainwater will meet a larger air resistance during infiltration presented by the slower moving speed of wetting front see fig 9 the internal water and air stayed in the deep layer of the slope with impermeable boundaries can only discharge from the top and bottom boundaries as a result the growing amplitude of positive pore water pressure in the upper part of the slope with impermeable boundaries is half the value of the slope with permeable boundaries and the decreasing amplitude of positive pore water pressure in the shallow middle part of the slope with impermeable boundaries is less than half of the value of the slope with permeable boundaries see fig 10 hence large fluctuations of pore water pressure appear in the shallow middle part and shallow lower part of the slope with impermeable boundaries resulted from unbalanced pore air pressures such results were also reported by shuo et al 2019 the pore water pressure in the deep upper part increases at first then decreases and finally ascends due to the impact of rainfall rutter and brodie 1988 yang and zou 2006 rinaldi et al 2010 smethurst et al 2006 when rainfall begins the gravelly soil around a sensor is gradually wetted after the wetting front arrives at the measurement position and thus the pore water pressure obviously drops yang and zou 2006 rinaldi et al 2010 after rainfall the air enters the gravelly soil the pore water pressure goes up and the decreasing amplitude of pore water pressure in the deep middle part and deep lower part is very large after the arrival of wetting front showing a catchment phenomenon yuan et al 2009 this indicates that because of the lateral drainage jams the wetting degree of the deep middle and deep lower parts of the slope with impermeable boundaries is larger than that of the slope with permeable boundaries and the excess pore water pressure may appear smethurst et al 2006 xu and yang 2017 5 2 4 influence on the matric suction the air flow channels in gravelly soil are restricted when the lateral boundary is sealed this affects the tension between particles and the residual moisture in pores leading to the change of both pore air pressure and pore water pressure lim et al 1996 tham 2005 trandafir et al 2008 therefore the value of the matric suction changes and a great difference in matric suctions occurs between the two slopes in the shallow upper shallow middle and deep lower parts the data of high matric suction and moisture content in the deep lower part are consistent between the two slopes and the area with a high matric suction is characterized by water accumulation during rainfall lim et al 1996 trandafir et al 2008 5 2 5 influence on the soil water characteristic curve the soil water characteristic curves for the two slopes with different seepage boundaries present different shapes although the soils used in the two tests are the same see fig 3c the curve for the slope with impermeable boundaries has a general shape bordoni et al 2015 however the curve for the slope with permeable boundaries shows an unusual shape this is in agreement with the result of yang et al 2017 it is indicated that the phenomenon is caused by the development of the preferential flows in the slope with permeable boundaries the preferential flows associated with moisture content have a faster response than the matrix flows associated with matric suction yang et al 2017 the permeable boundary promotes the development of preferential flows the gravelly soil in the slope with permeable boundaries shows a larger air entry suction due to the change of seepage boundary in the shallow middle and shallow upper parts 5 2 6 influence on the boundary flow from the perspective of water balance xu 1999 xiong and guo 1999 the hydraulic process can be divided into single input and multiple outputs generally there is underlying bedrock beneath gravelly soil layers however for an impermeable boundary condition the output does not include the lateral flow the changes of cumulative runoff in the slope with impermeable boundaries see fig 14 reflect that the infiltration rate in the slope with impermeable boundaries experiences a gradual decrease before the d point and reaches a steady value at the d point the results are consistent with the description rule of the philip infiltration model philip 1957 shao et al 2010 for the overland runoff the d point is the critical point that the runoff changes from unsteady state to steady state ni 2015 the development trend of lateral seepage see fig 15 occurs only after the slope is nearly saturated while the vertical seepage in soil caused by gravity primarily takes place when the soil is unsaturated sun et al 2012 the lateral drainage pathway mainly appears in the deep lower part of the slope with permeable boundaries where the soil is fully saturated due to the high moisture content preferential flows sidle et al 2001 uchida et al 2001 are mainly formed in the deep lower part it can be seen that the fluid tends to flow along the shortest path in the development of seepage field and the curve of the moisture content of the slope with permeable boundaries only appears a single peak with a position in the deep lower part due to the formation of the lateral seepage path see fig 10 subsurface flow see fig 16 experiences a redistribution after the change of seepage boundaries for the slope with permeable boundaries the subsurface flow in other areas i e bottoms 3 5 is small due to the shunting at lateral boundaries compared with underground flow for the slope with impermeable boundaries the time when outflow appears is consistent with the observation result of wetting front the limited development of seepage in the 2 4 area and the fast runoff rate in the 2 5 area show the complexity of the seepage development in the gravelly soil slope in the 2 4 area there is a dense structure with a relatively poor hydraulic conductivity formed by fine grained soil and stone in this case water may bypass this area and go down to increase the runoff in the 2 5 area sidle et al 2001 the results indicate that the seepage boundary conditions have significant impacts on the developments of the water flow in soil and the groundwater flow figs 14 16 the outflow on the slope bottom is redistributed which reflects the change of seepage channels in the slope sun et al 2012 meanwhile the seepage field in the slope changes and the seepage force changes therefore it is necessary to consider the effect of different seepage boundaries on the stability of gravelly soil slopes uchida et al 2001 5 3 discussion on the slope with permeable boundaries in engineering practice the surrounding hydraulic environment is usually the permeable boundary when geological hazards e g gravelly soil landslide occur tang et al 2016 however most previous landslide model tests used impermeable lateral boundaries which may result in an insufficient accuracy therefore it is necessary to make a detailed analysis of the hydraulic characteristics of the slope with permeable boundaries to reveal the differences and similarities between the two slope models considering different seepage boundaries in this paper the variation characteristics of the distributions of moisture content and pore water pressure obtained in the model test considering permeable boundaries are not totally consistent with the results reported in the literature tami et al 2004 bordoni et al 2015 zuo et al 2015 jia et al 2009 reid et al 2008 take et al 2004 chen et al 2010 5 3 1 moisture distribution fig 17 a shows the moisture content variation of the slope with permeable boundaries during slope mode test at the beginning of the test the infiltration is similar to that in a vertical one dimensional infiltration test dong et al 2017 lee et al 2011 and the seepage development along the slope is not obvious the difference of responding time between the moisture content sensors in the lower and middle parts is large the seepage along the slope is fully developed at the responding time and flow channels on the bottom are formed when the moisture content of each part of the slope reaches the maximum value it appears that the moisture content of the deep lower part is the largest while the moisture contents of the other parts of the slope are close but the moisture content 42 is almost the minimum in the middle part including the deep and shallow layers where the main water channels may be located woo and xia 1995 the water in the shallow upper part remains under the effect of strong suction see fig 11 after the rainfall ends the shallow layer of the slope basically keeps the same pace at the water depletion stage after 700 min the water in the deep lower part is gradually discharged while the moisture content in the deep middle part remains relatively stable showing a strong water holding capacity aaronb et al 2008 the characteristics of the slope are divided according to the changing characteristics of moisture contents in different regions of the slope fig 17b as shown in fig 17a the peak moisture content appears in the deep lower part of the slope which is partly consistent with the related works zuo et al 2015 chen et al 2010 shuo et al 2019 the minimum equilibrium value of moisture content appears in the middle part of this slope after the wetting front arrives while it is in the upper part of the slope according to the related results zuo et al 2015 dong et al 2017 the reason is that the seepage flow in the shallow middle part is fully developed with less moisture stayed when the permeable boundary is adopted and more moisture is absorbed in the upper part of the slope due to the effect of high matric suction there was only one outlet in the model flume of zuo et al 2015 because the impermeable boundary was considered thus the streamlines with the orientation towards the discharge port in the seepage field of their slope are different from those in the tests of this study therefore the moisture content is the highest in the lower part the moderate in the middle part and the minimum in the upper part in addition there is no inverted v shaped or u shaped curve of moisture content existed in the related studies chen et al 2010 bordoni et al 2015 indicating that the curve shape is mainly influenced by soil types the soil matrix used in this experiment seems to have high water holding and water absorbing capacities aaronb et al 2008 5 3 2 pore water pressure fig 18 shows the entire changing process of pore water pressure inside the slope with permeable boundaries except the upward trend of the pore water pressure in the shallow upper part after the arrival of the wetting front the pore water pressure in other parts of the slope presents a downward trend as a result of the influence of gas liquid motion fox et al 2010 yin and zhu 1999 the largest decreasing amplitude of pore water pressure occurs in the shallow middle part which is probably influenced by the dynamic seepage pressure bear 2013 intrinsically one important reason for this phenomenon is that the major passageway for seepage exists in the central area of the shallow layer of the slope woo and xia 1995 after rainfall the pore water pressure in the shallow upper part keeps rising with a reducing rate exhibiting a reverse trend compared to those in the shallow lower part and the shallow middle part this is probably because the soil used in the test is somewhat cohesive and the rainfall infiltration is not sufficiently developed in the shallow upper part leading to some closed unsaturated zones there rahardjo et al 2013 ng et al 2015 the pore water pressure in the deep upper part decreases slightly due to drainage it is worth noting that the shallow middle part deforms greatly after water is discharged and the pores are compressed hence the pore water pressure in the shallow middle part generally declines and tends to be stable with time the pore water pressure in the shallow lower part and deep lower part rises rapidly because of strong seepage flow guo et al 2016 in addition the pore water pressure is relatively stable in the whole progress in the deep middle part where the flow field is not fully developed the curves of pore water pressure in the shallow middle part shallow lower part and deep lower part are similar the pore water pressure experiences an ascent stage and then a sudden drop showing an intermittent drainage process the above three parts are the areas affected by dynamic seepage pressures xu and yang 2017 the curve of the pore water pressure in the lower part of the slope is presented in fig 19 a it is observed that the pore water pressure in the shallow lower part is larger than that in the deep layer near the end of rainfall a zone the lower part of the slope is the seepage concentrated zone where dynamic seepage pressure is formed due to the interconnection of seepage channels jia et al 2009 bordoni et al 2015 and tami et al 2004 studied the distribution pattern of pore water pressure and reported that the pore water pressure was higher in the deeper soil layer where a higher moisture content appeared their results contradict with the experimental data of this study regarding the speed of moisture movement in soil jia et al 2009 studied the effects of the rising and falling of water level on a slope the authors found that the pore water pressure was close to the static pore water pressure and the water was almost stationary when pore water pressure was stable bordoni et al 2015 monitored the underground pore water pressures and moisture contents at different depths of landslide zone the scale of their test slope was large and the speed of water flow in the soil was relatively small their results showed that landslide is prone to happen in the area with large pore water pressure and moisture content in our test the slope scale is small the boundary condition is porous and allows easy drainage of both water and air during heavy rainfall the seepage flow is fully developed in the slope with a relatively high flow rate under the action of high speed moving water the pore water pressure performs differently compared with the static water pressure additionally chen et al 2010 revealed that the inconsistency in the pore water pressure and moisture content among local areas was probably caused by the variability of gravelly soil from fig 19b it is noted that the amplitude of pore water pressure in the deep middle part with a low moisture content is smaller than that in the shallow middle part when the pores are connected with the porous lateral wall as shown in fig 26a the characteristic of pore water pressure in the shallow middle part is different from the related works reid et al 2008 take et al 2004 bordoni et al 2015 after rainfall the pore water pressure does not rebound but shows a decreasing tendency of change rate the soil settlement is relatively large under the effect of gravity in the shallow middle part where rich seepage channels exist shuo et al 2019 thus the pores are compressed and pore water pressure increases related results were discussed in the previous work okura et al 2002 xu and yang 2017 rinaldi et al 2010 in addition local areas in the shallow layer of the slope are in the unsaturated state as shown in fig 19c the volume of air space decreases because of the additional pressure induced by the change of slope gravity after rainfall in the regions close to the porous lateral wall the gas is compressed and discharged and water is not replenished in time the increase in positive pore water pressure indicates a state of high suction which presents the capillary barrier phenomenon as reported by lee et al 2011 and tami et al 2004 among others the difference between the shallow layer and deep layer lies in the opposite signs of pore water pressures the shallow lower part shows a water absorption effect after rainfall resulted from the settlement of slope and water redistribution the hydraulic characteristics are obviously different in different regions of the slope with permeable boundaries compared with relevant previous studies the slope is no longer a relatively closed system if the slope boundary becomes permeable chen et al 2010 rahardjo et al 2013 ali et al 2014 moreover it is a semi open system connected with air and can conduct water and gas in the process of rainfall the gas liquid movement in the slope changes the gas resistance decreases and the formation of seepage field changes accordingly these changes interact with the subsidence deformation of the slope hence the characteristics of the slope model change in the hydraulic process during rainfall in addition these changes will inevitably lead to the change of slope stability for instance a local crack appeared in the slope model with permeable boundaries as shown in fig 20 6 conclusion in order to examine the influence of seepage boundaries on hydraulic characteristics of gravelly soil slopes a novel model test device was developed two groups of slope model test considering different seepage boundaries were then carried out and then their results were compared and analyzed the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 different hydraulic characteristics were observed in the slopes with different seepage boundaries i compared to the slope with impermeable boundaries the slope with permeable boundaries generally exhibits a larger average infiltration rate as well as a relatively smaller moving speed and a smaller slope gradient of wetting front especially in the lower part according to the cumulative infiltration the local regions are ordered as the lower part the middle part and the upper part regarding the slope with permeable boundaries however the cumulative infiltration in the middle part approximates that in the lower part and is larger than that in the upper part for the slope with impermeable boundaries ii the residual moisture content of l 2 in the slope with permeable boundaries is 38 2 which is 6 6 smaller than that of the slope with impermeable boundaries by contrast the residual moisture content of u 1 in the slope with permeable boundaries is 24 7 which is 5 3 larger than that of the slope with permeable boundaries moreover the zone with a high moisture content in the deep layer expands in the slope with impermeable boundaries iii the maximum difference of about 1 2 kpa between pore water pressures occurs in the middle parts of the two slope models the values of regional pore water pressures in the shallow lower and shallow middle parts of the slope with impermeable boundaries exhibit large fluctuations over 0 5 kpa 2 distinct spatial morphology of seepage field is reflected by the hydraulic characteristics in the slope models with different seepage boundaries the most affected part is the middle and lower parts of a slope which will directly threaten the stability of the slope 3 in the slope model with permeable boundaries the pore water pressure in the middle and lower parts shows obviously abnormal changes resulted from the dynamic seepage pressure compared with the previous studies it is found that the formation process of seepage field is determined by seepage boundary in the slope model and the permeable boundary enables the multi dimensional development of slope seepage flow rather than the centralized diversion to a critical local zone 4 it seems that the slope with permeable boundaries is prone to appear local failures as a result of the multi dimensional development of seepage flow field nevertheless the overall instability is likely to take place in the slope with impermeable boundaries due to the concentration of seepage field to a critical local zone therefore it is necessary to pay attention to the seepage boundary environment of the target slope when evaluating the stability of a slope declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

6129,the stability of a residual gravelly soil slope during heavy rainfall is closely related to the seepage field which is directly affected by the seepage boundaries of the slope to examine the boundary effect a novel model flume that can implement permeable and impermeable boundary conditions was designed with this flume hydraulic model tests of a gravelly soil slope considering those two seepage boundaries were carried out the results show that distinct spatial morphology of seepage fields is reflected by the hydraulic characteristics of the slope models with different seepage boundaries the slope with permeable boundaries generally exhibits a larger average infiltration rate as well as a relatively smaller moving speed of wetting front in the lower part compared to the slope with impermeable boundaries the residual moisture content in the deep lower part of the slope with permeable boundaries is 6 6 cm3 cm3 smaller than that of the slope with impermeable boundaries nevertheless the maximum pore water pressure in the middle part of the slope with permeable boundaries is 1 2 kpa higher than that in the corresponding part of the slope with impermeable boundaries it is noted that regional pore water pressures in the shallow lower and shallow middle parts of the slope with impermeable boundaries exhibit large fluctuations with an amplitude over 0 5 kpa the seepage field in the slope with permeable boundaries presents a multi dimensional development which may lead to a local failure of the slope the results are of great significance in studying the similarity of seepage boundary condition in the field of similarity theory on landslide model tests and provide an experimental basis for establishing rainfall induced landslide theory keywords landslide seepage boundary model test gravelly soil hydraulic characteristics 1 introduction it was reported that over 94 of landslides were caused by rainfall and human activities ye et al 2005 the rainfall induced landslides that take place in gravelly soils account for a large proportion of geological disasters and have posed a serious threat to people s lives and property he et al 2004 the formation of landslides and other disasters associated with gravelly soils is closely related to the change in the hydraulic characteristics in the process of rainfall infiltration bordoni et al 2015 take et al 2004 ooi et al 2014 okura et al 2002 reid et al 2008 cui et al 2018 loritz et al 2018 generally the moisture content of a slope increases after rainfall and the pore water pressure and pore air pressure change correspondingly subsequently the shear strength of the soil decreases and the safety of the slope degrades when the overall or local sliding force of the slope exceeds the shear resistance of the soil the landslide occurs therefore it is necessary to examine the hydraulic characteristics of gravelly soil slopes during rainfall for landslide warning and prevention at present the methods for studying rainfall induced landslide problems include in situ test model test and numerical simulation tang et al 2016 shi et al 2016 hu et al 2017a b xia and liang 2018 yang et al 2018 zhong et al 2018 among the above methods the in situ test is usually used to monitor the complex evolution of multi physical fields during landslides tang et al 2016 hu et al 2017a b and the numerical simulation is generally applied to simulate the landslides approximatively from theory shi et al 2016 xia and liang 2018 in addition the model test is a very important and widely used mean to investigate the rainfall induced landslides because it allows conveniently reproducing the whole process of landslide visually tami et al 2004 lee et al 2011 sun et al 2012 shen et al 2012 chen et al 2016 however most of the previous studies e g yang et al 2018 zhong et al 2018 sun et al 2012 shen et al 2012 chen et al 2016 considered impermeable boundaries rather than permeable boundaries in landslide model tests which have great influences on the results of model tests particularly those using gravelly soils as materials gravelly soils as heterogeneous masses that consist of soil material and or rock fragments are widely distributed in the southwest and northwest of china yuan et al 2009 zhang et al 2016 dong et al 2017 the stability problems of gravelly soil slopes under rainfall infiltration are complicated and susceptible to many factors this is because the coarse grained phase and fine grained phase of gravelly soils have different hydraulic physical and mechanical properties and the soil structures usually show spatial variability hu et al 2014 ni 2015 chen et al 2016 ma et al 2017 dong et al 2017 ran et al 2018 gao et al 2019 gravelly soils have large spatially distributed porosities along natural gravelly soil slopes of which the porous and permeable boundaries frequently exist thus pipe flow often appears following pore channels formed from the connection of large pores after a certain period of rainfall sun et al 2012 shen et al 2012 and the inhomogeneous distribution of the grains of different sizes in the vertical direction of gravelly soils may lead to the phenomenon of capillary barrier this usually contributes a lot to the occurrence of landslides during rainfall infiltration under the influence of different seepage boundaries tami et al 2004 lee et al 2011 hence the adoption of different seepage boundaries in gravelly soil slopes may have great influences on the formation of seepage field and further the stability of gravelly soil slopes obviously for a rainfall induced landslide in gravelly soils the degree of similarity between the prototype and model would be reduced if impermeable boundaries are applied to reproduce the real hydraulic processes and rainfall induced landslides in natural slopes by model tests the application of proper seepage boundaries that satisfy the boundary similarity is very important on the other hand rainfall induced landslides and related disasters show sundry characteristics in different types of soil take et al 2004 spickermann et al 2009 chen et al 2010 for instance the complete liquefaction phenomenon often occurs in local regions of loose sandy soil slopes and causes a type of landslide similar to the flow slide of soil take et al 2004 while the transient liquefaction usually takes place in the landslide model tests of clayey soil slopes and leads to a failure of local soil instability spickermann et al 2009 the clay content in gravelly soils can affect the pore water pressure through its influence on soil pore structures during rainfall and finally it affects the triggering mechanism and failure mode of debris flow chen et al 2010 as stated above what can be taken into account is that the seepage boundary has different effects on the hydraulic characteristics of the slope models made of different types of soil wang et al 2005 seifeddine et al 2012 lu godt 2008 ali et al 2014 therefore it is meaningful to prepare the slope model with an artificial gravelly soil that can both represent the characteristics of sandy soil and clayey soil to comprehensively understand the influence of seepage boundary as for the experimental forms and major concerns about test results many earlier researchers used destructive model tests to investigate the relationship between the change in some hydraulic parameters caused by rainfall and the occurrence process of landslide while the non destructive experimental studies concerning the hydraulic characteristics in the whole rainfall process are less zuo et al 2015 jia et al 2009 reid et al 2008 take et al 2004 chen et al 2010 bogaard et al 2014 it is worth noting that most of previous studies e g bordoni et al 2015 zuo et al 2015 reid et al 2008 chen et al 2010 concerning model tests paid little attention to the hydraulic characteristics in different regions of slopes during rainfall infiltration which is related to the forms of landslides i e overall landslide and local landslide actually the understanding of the regional hydraulic characteristics is helpful for analyzing regional variation rules of hydraulic characteristics in the whole rainfall process and evaluating the internal factors triggering landslides and other disasters from multiple perspectives based on the above considerations a novel model flume is self developed two different seepage boundaries are designed and gravelly soil slopes are prepared from a fine grained soil and the grains of quartz sandstone to analyze the effects of different seepage boundaries on the whole hydraulic process in this paper the hydraulic characteristics obtained from the slope model test under the permeable boundary condition are compared with the existing research results the mechanism of the influence of seepage boundary on the hydraulic characteristics of gravelly soil slopes is discussed the results would be beneficial for studying the similarity of slope seepage boundary in the field of model tests and provide an experimental basis for the theory establishment of rainfall induced landslides 2 model flume with different seepage boundaries 2 1 model flume in order to simulate the hydraulic characteristics of gravelly soil slopes during rainfall a novel model flume with a length of 2 m a width of 0 5 m and a height of 1 m was designed based on several references sun et al 2012 ni 2015 hu et al 2014 ma et al 2017 chen et al 2010 zuo et al 2015 the european standard aluminum profile was selected as the framework of the model flume fig 1 the flume can be broken down into three parts i e the upper structure the lower structure and the connection structure the upper structure consisted of a water supply tank a soil tank and a water collection tank the side plates of the soil tank had drainage holes to simulate the permeable seepage boundary fig 2 a to attain an impermeable boundary the internal surfaces of the porous side plates were covered with 5 mm acrylic sheets as shown in fig 2b the two large sides were double deck structures consisted of multiple water storage compartments the water collection tank was divided into multiple water storage compartments from the top to the bottom the lower structure that was anchored to the ground consisted of a bracket and a pad with bolt holes the connection structure included a hydraulic pressure cylinder three steel shafts and several t shaped bearings it was a scalable triangular structure allowing the adjustment of the slope angle of the flume between 0 and 40 2 2 horizontal seepage test of gravelly soil horizontal seepage tests were carried out to obtain the horizontal hydraulic conductivity and infiltration law of the gravelly soil with a representative grading the results of the horizontal seepage tests could provide guidance for the design of model flume the test material was a gravelly soil composed of a fine grained soil whose particles were smaller than 5 mm and quartz sandstone grains whose sizes were between 5 mm and 40 mm collected from a slope gps coordinates 27 55 n 113 1 e in the zhaoshan mountain xiangtan china fig 3 a and b the soil matrix i e fine grained soil had the same mineral composition and the quartz sandstone grains were artificially crushed fresh fragments of a non weathered rock in this way the interference of the heterogeneity in soil matrix and the influence of the differences in rock weathering were excluded and the reproducibility of test results can be ensured the physical and mechanical properties of the fine grained soil are listed in table 1 the fractions of the gravelly soil are shown in fig 3c in the horizontal seepage tests representative grain gradations at the top of the slope middle of the slope and toe of the slope gao et al 2019 respectively were considered to take the grading variability of gravelly soil slope into account the grading design of the test gravelly soil is shown in table 2 a specific test device was self designed to complete the horizontal seepage tests see fig 4 the inner dimension of the horizontal square column was 300 mm in width 300 mm in height and 700 mm in length the wall thickness of the column was 10 mm and the head cover could be opened the seepage tests were carried out at room temperature 20 after the horizontal seepage tests darcy s law was adopted to calculate the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the gravelly soil darcy s law has the following form 1 k q l a δ h t where k is the hydraulic conductivity m s q is the seepage flow m3 l is the length m a is the cross sectional area m2 of the sample δh is the head difference m t is the seepage time s the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of gravelly soil was calculated by the exponential function proposed by gardner gardner 1958 2 k φ 1 k s e α φ 1 φ 1 0 where k φ 1 is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity m s φ 1 is the soil water potential m a negative value represents the unsaturated state k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity m s α is the pore size distribution parameter m 1 the calculation parameters were determined from the green ampt infiltration model green and ampt 1911 and the philip horizontal infiltration formula philip 1957 the horizontal seepage test was performed twice on each gravelly soil of a given grain gradation and the average results were used for analyses see table 3 2 3 seepage boundary conditions as mentioned previously the boundary of the model flume for seepage tests was set as a porous structure to simulate the pore characteristics of the gravelly soil note that the hydraulic conductivity should not be used as a reference index for designing the seepage boundary condition because it depends on not only the factors related to the soil pore structure but also the temperature and viscosity of the fluid instead the intrinsic permeability was selected in this study as a reference index because it is only influenced by the pore structure of the gravelly soil an intrinsic permeability not less than that of the test gravelly soil was taken for the seepage boundary of the flume thus the boundary had the same or a larger hydraulic conductivity than the test gravelly soil the pore structure of the side plates of the model flume could be adjusted according to the test materials in practical tests according to the capillary model bear 2013 the hagen poisseuile law that controls the steady flow can be expressed by 3 q s π δ 4 ρ g 128 φ 2 s where q s is the total flow volume m3 δ is the diameter of aperture m ρ is the density of fluid kg m3 g is the gravitational acceleration n kg φ 2 is the piezometric head m s is the length measured along a capillary tube m φ 2 s is the pressure potential gradient substituting eq 3 into the equation of darcy s law we can obtain the following equation for intrinsic permeability 4 κ k ν ρ g n π δ 4 128 where κ is the intrinsic permeability m2 ν is the dynamic viscosity of water n s m2 n is the number of holes per unit area m 2 to endow the side plate with enough water discharge capacity a k s value of 3 96 10 3 m s of the test material measured in section 2 2 was selected as the maximum k value and thus a κ value of 6 347 10 9 m2 was calculated from k according to eq 4 the porous structure of the side plates of the model flume was similar to the profile of the gravelly soil the circular holes on the side plates can be regarded as the pore space in the gravelly soil and the solid part of the side plates can be regarded as the soil grains hence the circular holes on the side plates should have the same scale with the pores of the gravelly soil and the distance between two circular holes should have the same scale with the average particle size of gravels according to the size threshold between soil matrix and rock in gravelly soils barahona et al 1999 dong et al 2017 a δ value of 2 0 10 3 m or 3 0 10 3 m was selected and the following results were obtained when δ 2 0 10 3 m and n 15839 487 m 2 n 0 5 125 m 1 it represents that the circular holes with 2 mm diameters are distributed on the side plates every 8 mm when δ 3 0 10 3 m and n 3128 787 m 2 n 0 5 56 m 1 it represents that the circular holes with 3 mm diameters are distributed on the side plate every 17 mm according to the grading characteristics of gravelly soils dong et al 2017 gao et al 2019 17 mm is close to the average size of gravels and able to characterize the gravel scale whereupon the latter scheme was chosen to design the flume 3 hydraulic model tests of slopes with two seepage boundaries 3 1 test system the model test system was composed of a model flume a rainfall system and a measurement system the flume was assembly molded by aluminum steel wood and acrylic materials the design details are introduced in section 2 1 the rainfall system consisted of micro spray nozzles connecting pipes a water pump and hydraulic control valves as shown in fig 5 the nozzles can spray highly uniform water drops with diameters 65 μm two rows of interlaced nozzles connected through the connecting pipes were placed above the model flume in addition the water pump and hydraulic control valves were arranged between the connecting pipe and tap water prior to testing the rainfall system was adjusted and the rainwater was collected by 20 measuring cylinders of 100 ml placed below the bottom of the flume to test the rainfall uniformity an empirical equation was proposed to evaluate the rainfall uniformity based on the collected rainfall data the empirical equation is as follows 5 u 1 i 1 n r i r n r where u is the rainfall uniformity ri is the collected precipitation of ith measuring cylinder during rainfall mm n is the number of the measuring cylinders r is the average precipitation mm it was found that when the rainfall intensity was 1 1 mm min controlled by adjusting the hydraulic control valve the rainfall uniformity approximated 90 the measurement system consisted of many sensors a data acquisition system and water collection containers the sensors used in the test included pore water pressure gauges moisture content sensors and matric potential sensors note that the moisture content sensors used in this study output volumetric moisture contents and the negative values of the outputs of the matric potential sensors are referred to as matric suctions the pore water pressure gauges present negative values of the real pore water pressures the data acquisition system included the dh3821 device produced by the jiangsu liyang instrument factory in china the em50 device produced by the decagon devices company in the usa and a computer the water collection containers included white drums basins etc the volumes of water were measured during the test in real time the sensor specifications are shown in table 4 and the information of the data acquisition instruments is given in table 5 before the test all sensors were calibrated 3 2 test design and procedures the purpose of the hydraulic model tests was to examine the influence of seepage boundary on the hydraulic characteristics of gravelly soil slopes under rainfall for the colluvium with cohesive strengths it must have enough depths the minimum depth is termed the critical depth to cause large driving force otherwise landslides cannot be initiated in the colluvium in this study the critical depth of soil was 0 62 m and the slope angle was 20 referring to the statistical data of colluvial soil landslides reported by parker et al 2016 according to the annual water resources information of hunan province a rainfall intensity of 1 1 mm min was selected the specification of hydraulic model tests is listed in table 6 the slope model was made of the same material as that presented in section 2 2 but the grading was adjusted to meet the gravimetric stone content i e the mass fraction of soil particles greater than 5 mm in gravelly soil of 50 as shown in table 7 the initial moisture content of the test material was 8 for comparison purposes two groups of tests were conducted these two groups had the same experimental conditions except that the seepage boundaries were different the influence of seepage boundary conditions on the variation of hydraulic characteristics and outflow in the infiltration process was particularly analyzed as shown in fig 6 l m and u represent the lower part middle part and upper part of the slope respectively the numbers 1 and 2 after l m or u represent the shallow layer and deep layer respectively generally the lower part of the slope is often the key area triggering landslide disasters and the middle and upper parts move successively after the failure of the lower part nevertheless the local instability failure is prone to appear in the upper part of the slope the regional testing of the slope is helpful to understand the regional movement behavior of slope and analyze the mechanism of rainfall induced landslides to perform the test the boundary was treated with abrasive paper according to the roughness of the material the slope model was made using the multi layer compaction method and the sensors were properly embedded fig 7 afterward the prepared slope model was rested until the readings of the sensors were stable next the rainfall intensity was adjusted to the desired value of 1 1 mm min finally the test was stopped once the slope was completely wet i e the water flow phenomenon was seen outside from the bottom plate of the flume and the outflow at the slope boundary was steady in order to accurately record the outflow and its location during the test the water storage compartments of the model flume were numbered as illustrated in fig 8 to reveal the infiltration law in different areas of the slopes the moisture migration data and the moisture content data were used to calculate the cumulative infiltration in each part of the slopes by the green ampt infiltration model green and ampt 1911 the green ampt infiltration model is expressed by 6 i δ θ z f where i is the cumulative infiltration δθ is the difference between the saturated moisture content and the initial moisture content z f is the migration distance of wetting front the soil water characteristic curve characterizes the changing law of matric suction with moisture content in soil and basically reflects the change of energy for the movement of water and air in soil in the literature the most commonly used empirical formula of the soil water characteristic curve is the van genuchten model for instance shao et al 2010 used the van genuchten model to fit the moisture characteristic parameters of rock soil mixtures and obtained good results in this study the van genuchten model was also employed to characterize the soil water characteristic curve the van genuchten model has the following expression 7 θ θ r θ s θ r 1 1 α h n m where θ s is the saturated moisture content θ r is the residual moisture content h is the pressure head α is the air entry suction n and m are the model parameters 4 results as the rainfall begins the soil slope gets wet gradually the wetting front starts moving and the moisture content and other hydraulic characteristics of the slope change accordingly in this section the preliminary results of the hydraulic characteristics of the two different slopes are presented and compared meanwhile the secondary results of hydraulic characteristics calculated via eqs 6 and 7 and the properties of seepage field are given 4 1 preliminary results of hydraulic characteristics 4 1 1 movement of wetting fronts the results show that the elapsed time for the slope with permeable boundaries to be completely wet is 4 h and 53 min which is about 40 min earlier than that for the slope with impermeable boundaries the average moving speed of wetting front in the slope with permeable boundaries is fast while that of wetting front in the deep upper part of the slope with impermeable boundaries is slow fig 9 illustrates the positions of wetting fronts in the slope models at different time one can note several different phenomena at the beginning of rainfall i e 0 30 min the movement of wetting front in the model with permeable boundaries is significantly faster than that of wetting front in the slope with impermeable boundaries during the period of 30 95 min the moving speed of wetting front in the slope with impermeable boundaries exceeds that of wetting front in the slope with permeable boundaries at last these two slopes have a close value of the average moving speed of wetting front on the whole the moving speed of wetting front is more stable and the slope of wetting front in the lower part is smaller in the slope with permeable boundaries than those in the slope with impermeable boundaries during the movement of wetting fronts different performances of the slopes are noted the 10 min moving distance of wetting front in the slope with permeable boundaries reaches its maximum between 55 min and 65 min by contrast the 10 min moving distance of wetting front in the slope with impermeable boundaries presents two extreme values the first occurs between 25 min and 35 min and the second appears between 75 min and 85 min these results are probably caused by the different movements of the air phase and the water phase 4 1 2 moisture content in fig 10 u 1 water refers to the moisture content sensor in the shallow upper part of a slope when the wetting front reaches the test position the moisture content rapidly increases up to a maximum value and then remains stable indicating that the gravelly soil is gradually saturated after rainfall the moisture contents in different parts decrease successively at different rates under gravity the responding time at which the moisture content starts to change greatly is earlier and the wetting front moves faster in the middle and upper parts of the slope with permeable boundaries than those in the same parts of the slope with impermeable boundaries meanwhile the responding time of the moisture content sensor in the lower part of the slope with impermeable boundaries is earlier than that of the sensor in the same part of the slope with permeable boundaries this result is consistent with the movement of wetting fronts and reflects the influence of air resistance table 8 shows that the increase in the average moisture content of the slope with permeable boundaries is slightly greater than that of the slope with impermeable boundaries both the maximum value and maximum increment of the moisture content of the slope with permeable boundaries occur in l 2 i e the catchment in the slope with impermeable boundaries the moisture content has two peak values that appear in m 2 and l 2 respectively because of the reduced hydraulic conductivity at the end of rainfall the maximum residual moisture content that appears in l 2 is 44 8 cm3 cm3 which is higher than those in other areas it is worth noting that the residual moisture content in l 2 of the slope with permeable boundaries is 38 2 which is 6 6 smaller than that in the same area of the slope with impermeable boundaries nevertheless the residual moisture content in u 1 of the slope with impermeable boundaries is 24 7 which is 5 3 smaller than that in the same area of the slope with permeable boundaries 4 1 3 pore water pressure fig 10 shows that the changing process of pore water pressure presents a coordinated variability the pore water pressure peaks between the shallow layer and the deep layer of the middle and lower parts show a conformity characteristic while the pore water pressure in the upper part shows variability the relationship between pore water pressure and moisture content is not clear it is observed that the curve contours of pore water pressures in the two slopes with different boundaries are similar but the variation amplitudes are quite different the variation amplitude of pore water pressure in the shallow layer of the slope with permeable boundaries is larger than that in the slope with impermeable boundaries whereas the variation amplitude of pore water pressure was smaller in the deep layer of the slope with permeable boundaries furthermore the maximum difference of about 1 2 kpa between the pore water pressures in the two slope models occurs in the middle part the curves of the shallow layer of the lower and middle parts of the slope with impermeable boundaries exhibit large fluctuations of over 0 5 kpa fig 10b and c 4 1 4 matric suction the initial matric suctions i e the negative values of matric potentials are listed in table 9 it shows that the initial matric suctions in various positions of each slope model are highly different exhibiting an uneven distribution of matric suctions the maximum matric suction occurs at the bottom of the deep layer fig 11 presents the variation in matric suction during rainfall infiltration in the process of rainfall infiltration the matric suctions rapidly increase up to the maximums and then become stable after the wetting fronts reach the test positions after rainfall infiltration the matric suction of the slope with permeable boundaries keeps stable at approximately 9 8 kpa while that of the slope with impermeable boundaries remains at approximately 8 7 kpa 4 2 secondary results of hydraulic characteristics 4 2 1 cumulative infiltration fig 12 shows the cumulative infiltration in three parts of the two slope models the cumulative infiltration ordered from large to small in different parts of the slope with permeable boundaries is that in the lower part that in the middle part and that in the upper part by contrast the cumulative infiltration in the lower and middle parts of the slope with impermeable boundaries is almost equivalent during rainfall the cumulative infiltration curve shows a linear variation within 80 min for the two slope models which is similar to the vertical infiltration performance of gravelly soils reported by dong et al 2017 subsequently the changing rate of cumulative infiltration in the upper part slows down and levels off 4 2 2 soil water characteristic curve the soil water characteristic curve is indispensable to analyze the hydraulic characteristics of unsaturated soils lu and godt 2013 the van genuchten model was used to fit the experimental data collected by moisture content sensors and matric potential sensors in the shallow layer of each slope the soil water characteristic curves of the upper and middle parts of the two different slopes are shown in fig 13 and the fitting parameters are shown in table 10 the coefficients of determination r 2 of the data fitting are larger than 90 which indicates that the van genuchten model can be used to characterize the soil water characteristic curve of the test gravel soil it appears that the fitting effect of the data of the middle part is better than that of the upper part moreover the shapes of the soil water characteristic curves for the slopes with different boundary conditions are different due to different moving states of air and water in slopes the fitting parameters are also different in the two tests the α value of the slope with impermeable boundaries is smaller than that of the slope with permeable boundaries while the n value of the slope with impermeable boundaries is larger than that of the slope with permeable boundaries the θ r values of the two slopes are quite similar and the θ s value of the slope with permeable boundaries is smaller than that of the slope with impermeable boundaries 4 3 properties of seepage field 4 3 1 seepage field in the slope fig 9 illustrates the formation of seepage fields in the slopes with different seepage boundaries the seepage fields formed in the two slope models are quite different which is probably resulted from the distinct distributions of the air resistance to water infiltration the moving speed of wetting front in the lower part of the slope with impermeable boundaries is significantly faster than that in the similar part of the slope with permeable boundaries exhibiting a strongly centralized water diversion phenomenon concerning the slope with impermeable boundaries the formation of seepage channels is fast in the shallow lower part relatively late in the deep lower part and lagged in the upper part 4 3 2 boundary flow the slope runoff data i e runoff on the slope surface seepage flow on the lateral boundary seepage flow on the bottom etc were observed and recorded from the beginning to the end of rainfall see figs 14 16 1 overland runoff during rainfall the overland runoff does not occur and the rainwater completely infiltrates into the gravelly soil for the slope with permeable boundaries however with respect to the slope with impermeable boundaries the infiltration rate is smaller than the rainfall intensity under the effect of gas resistance thus an obvious runoff phenomenon occurs as shown in fig 14 the cut off point on the curve of cumulative flow is termed the feature point d the cumulative flow nonlinearly increases in the stage before the d point and linearly increases after the d point 2 lateral flow the lateral drainage pathways of the slope with impermeable boundaries are closed and thus the lateral flow is not produced the lateral flow in the slope with permeable boundaries occurs in 2 1 3 1 3 2 3 3 areas see the blue areas in fig 15 slight running water appears at a height of 15 cm above the wetting front at the permeable boundary and the phenomenon stops when the wetting front continues migrating downward according to the value of cumulative flow the locations can be ordered as 3 3 3 2 3 1 and 2 1 3 subsurface flow the subsurface flow includes the flow in soil and groundwater flow due to the difference in lateral seepage boundary conditions the subsurface flow presents different characteristics over time in the two slopes as shown in fig 16 the region marked blue in the schematic diagram of the model flume represents the development of subsurface flow fig 16a shows that the drainage area on the bottom of the slope with permeable boundaries is concentrated in the underground flow area the underground flow area begins to produce flow at 50 min during rainfall and the outflow rate suddenly increases up to 11 52 ml s at 111 min as shown in fig 16b the time when the outflow appears in all parts except 2 5 on the bottom of the slope with impermeable boundaries is earlier than that of the slope with permeable boundaries subsurface flow is developed strongly in the slope with permeable boundaries except for the 2 4 area as expected the subsurface flow rate in the 2 5 area is faster than the groundwater flow rate after 225 min the 2 4 area has a limited development of seepage pathways compared with the other areas 5 discussion 5 1 inner relationship among hydraulic characteristics from the test results see figs 9 13 the inner relationships among different hydraulic characteristics can be identified the regions where the wetting front moves faster usually present a higher moisture content as reported by zuo et al 2015 this finding is in agreement with the test results of the current study see table 8 in the deep part while is inconsistent with those concerning the shallow part the moving rate of wetting front can influence but not determine the moisture content because the latter is also affected by many other factors including material properties e g stone content and external environmental factors e g boundary conditions cui et al 2018 loritz et al 2018 with respect to the results of this study the stone content in the shallow layers of three parts may have an uneven distribution so the moisture content does not follow the changing rule shown in the work of zuo et al 2015 and the deep lower part is the place where the preferential flow exists sun et al 2012 yang et al 2017 the formation of the preferential flow leads to the acceleration of wetting front so the moisture content tends to increase in this region the relationship among the cumulative infiltration moisture migration and moisture content are expressed by eq 6 the calculation results in fig 12 reveal the infiltration law of rainfall the cumulative infiltration in the slope with permeable boundaries has a positive correlation with the moving rate of wetting front see figs 9 and 12 nevertheless in the slope with impermeable boundaries the cumulative infiltration in the lower part and the middle part has a similar value although the moving rate of wetting front in the lower part is larger than that in the middle part this phenomenon is attributed to the change in δθ when the seepage boundary condition varies hu et al 2017a b ma et al 2016 the relationship between pore water pressure and moisture content is shown in fig 10 during rainfall except for the shallow upper part a major law ooi et al 2014 okura et al 2002 reid et al 2008 that the pore water pressure increases negatively with the increase in moisture content until 500 min nearly 100 min after rainfall appears after 500 min the pore water pressure shows a general trend of returning to the initial state with the decrease in moisture content which indicates the dissipation process of pore water pressure the immediate change in pore water pressure affected by the moisture content is not consistent with the results of shuo et al 2019 because the pore water pressure is also related to soil matrix bordoni et al 2015 however the pore water pressures in the shallow upper part and the shallow middle part keep their original paths although the moisture contents in these two parts have obvious decreases according to the work of shuo et al 2019 the change in pore water pressure may be relevant to the deformation of soil the pores are compressed during the deformation progress leading to the compression of the air in the pores hence the pore water pressures in the shallow upper part and the shallow middle part continue to increase after rainfall it is important to note that there is no obvious quantitative relationship between the moisture content and the pore water pressure for the two groups of results high moisture contents and high pore water pressures do not always appear at the same time similar findings were also reported by bordoni et al 2015 and jia et al 2009 such results may be related to the variability of pore structures in different positions of a slope böttcher et al 2012 the relationship between the matric suction and the moisture content basically satisfies the van genuchten model see fig 13 the matric suction decreases with the increase in moisture content it is noted that there are many data points not located on the fitting curve two aspects of reasons result in this phenomenon i the moisture content and the matric suction are not measured from the same position so the change in matric suction may not synchronize with the change in moisture content ii the measurement precision of the matric potential sensor is not very high leading to certain errors of matric suction when the wetting front approaches the measurement areas the matric suction responds faster than pore water pressure and they show the same changing trend since the matric suction has an earlier response than the pore water pressure it is usually applied to evaluate the safety of slopes eichenberger et al 2013 5 2 influence mechanism of boundary conditions 5 2 1 influence on the movement of wetting fronts the test results indicate the uneven moving speed of the wetting front in the slope with impermeable boundaries compared to the slope with impermeable boundaries it is revealed that the restriction on the development of wetting front appears see fig 9 if the seepage boundary changes from a permeable type to an impermeable one when the lateral boundary is closed the exhaust passage of soil is limited and the air in the soil near the lower part of the slope is discharged rapidly from the bottom under the dynamic pressure of water flow lee et al 2011 hu et al 2014 ma et al 2017 this gives priority to the formation of an unobstructed seepage path which is characterized by concentrated diversion and preferential water discharging i e preferential flow in the lower part of the slope with impermeable boundaries shen et al 2012 by contrast a large part of the air in the slope with permeable boundaries is discharged from the side showing that the average downward infiltration rate is faster than the slope with impermeable boundaries and the wetting front moves faster in the upper part of the slope with permeable boundaries than that in the upper part of the slope with impermeable boundaries see fig 12 the boundary effect on the movement of wetting fronts is mainly during the period of 0 95 min after the beginning of rainfall especially the period of 0 30 min it seems that the seepage boundary has a great influence on the formation process of seepage field at the initial stage especially the formation of preferential flow sidle et al 2001 5 2 2 influence on the moisture distribution the slope with impermeable boundaries has smaller water and air conductivities than the slope with permeable boundaries therefore the highest moisture content increases in the deep lower part i e the water storage region where the static liquefaction happens and the streamlines are dense as reported by related works take et al 2004 yuan et al 2009 in addition the moisture content and water storage capacity in the deep middle part of the slope with impermeable boundaries are larger than those in the same part of the slope with permeable boundaries because of the closed lateral boundaries a smaller average moisture content i e 36 1 in the slope with impermeable boundaries see table 8 indicates that there is a larger residual air phase about 0 8 in the slope with impermeable boundaries and thus the average degree of saturation is lower in this case the discrepancies i e 6 6 and 5 3 in the residual moisture contents of the deep lower parts and shallow upper parts between the two slopes with different seepage boundaries display different gas liquid ratios in different positions of the slopes frankenberger et al 1999 the most affected regions by the seepage boundary condition are consistent with the results of the movement of wetting fronts it is noted that the moisture content can be used to predict a landslide and the change of moisture content distributions will have a significant effect on the failure of slopes abramson et al 2002 hence the two slopes with different boundary conditions may have different performances in maintaining stability 5 2 3 influence on the pore water pressure compared to the slope with permeable boundaries the slope with impermeable boundaries has closed lateral exhaust passages of gas in the latter case there is a minimum distance between the outlet and air so the pore air pressure goes up and air is difficult to discharge influencing the water leakage process in the shallow layer larson and gupta 1980 bobet 2003 fox et al 2010 yin and zhu 1999 hence rainwater will meet a larger air resistance during infiltration presented by the slower moving speed of wetting front see fig 9 the internal water and air stayed in the deep layer of the slope with impermeable boundaries can only discharge from the top and bottom boundaries as a result the growing amplitude of positive pore water pressure in the upper part of the slope with impermeable boundaries is half the value of the slope with permeable boundaries and the decreasing amplitude of positive pore water pressure in the shallow middle part of the slope with impermeable boundaries is less than half of the value of the slope with permeable boundaries see fig 10 hence large fluctuations of pore water pressure appear in the shallow middle part and shallow lower part of the slope with impermeable boundaries resulted from unbalanced pore air pressures such results were also reported by shuo et al 2019 the pore water pressure in the deep upper part increases at first then decreases and finally ascends due to the impact of rainfall rutter and brodie 1988 yang and zou 2006 rinaldi et al 2010 smethurst et al 2006 when rainfall begins the gravelly soil around a sensor is gradually wetted after the wetting front arrives at the measurement position and thus the pore water pressure obviously drops yang and zou 2006 rinaldi et al 2010 after rainfall the air enters the gravelly soil the pore water pressure goes up and the decreasing amplitude of pore water pressure in the deep middle part and deep lower part is very large after the arrival of wetting front showing a catchment phenomenon yuan et al 2009 this indicates that because of the lateral drainage jams the wetting degree of the deep middle and deep lower parts of the slope with impermeable boundaries is larger than that of the slope with permeable boundaries and the excess pore water pressure may appear smethurst et al 2006 xu and yang 2017 5 2 4 influence on the matric suction the air flow channels in gravelly soil are restricted when the lateral boundary is sealed this affects the tension between particles and the residual moisture in pores leading to the change of both pore air pressure and pore water pressure lim et al 1996 tham 2005 trandafir et al 2008 therefore the value of the matric suction changes and a great difference in matric suctions occurs between the two slopes in the shallow upper shallow middle and deep lower parts the data of high matric suction and moisture content in the deep lower part are consistent between the two slopes and the area with a high matric suction is characterized by water accumulation during rainfall lim et al 1996 trandafir et al 2008 5 2 5 influence on the soil water characteristic curve the soil water characteristic curves for the two slopes with different seepage boundaries present different shapes although the soils used in the two tests are the same see fig 3c the curve for the slope with impermeable boundaries has a general shape bordoni et al 2015 however the curve for the slope with permeable boundaries shows an unusual shape this is in agreement with the result of yang et al 2017 it is indicated that the phenomenon is caused by the development of the preferential flows in the slope with permeable boundaries the preferential flows associated with moisture content have a faster response than the matrix flows associated with matric suction yang et al 2017 the permeable boundary promotes the development of preferential flows the gravelly soil in the slope with permeable boundaries shows a larger air entry suction due to the change of seepage boundary in the shallow middle and shallow upper parts 5 2 6 influence on the boundary flow from the perspective of water balance xu 1999 xiong and guo 1999 the hydraulic process can be divided into single input and multiple outputs generally there is underlying bedrock beneath gravelly soil layers however for an impermeable boundary condition the output does not include the lateral flow the changes of cumulative runoff in the slope with impermeable boundaries see fig 14 reflect that the infiltration rate in the slope with impermeable boundaries experiences a gradual decrease before the d point and reaches a steady value at the d point the results are consistent with the description rule of the philip infiltration model philip 1957 shao et al 2010 for the overland runoff the d point is the critical point that the runoff changes from unsteady state to steady state ni 2015 the development trend of lateral seepage see fig 15 occurs only after the slope is nearly saturated while the vertical seepage in soil caused by gravity primarily takes place when the soil is unsaturated sun et al 2012 the lateral drainage pathway mainly appears in the deep lower part of the slope with permeable boundaries where the soil is fully saturated due to the high moisture content preferential flows sidle et al 2001 uchida et al 2001 are mainly formed in the deep lower part it can be seen that the fluid tends to flow along the shortest path in the development of seepage field and the curve of the moisture content of the slope with permeable boundaries only appears a single peak with a position in the deep lower part due to the formation of the lateral seepage path see fig 10 subsurface flow see fig 16 experiences a redistribution after the change of seepage boundaries for the slope with permeable boundaries the subsurface flow in other areas i e bottoms 3 5 is small due to the shunting at lateral boundaries compared with underground flow for the slope with impermeable boundaries the time when outflow appears is consistent with the observation result of wetting front the limited development of seepage in the 2 4 area and the fast runoff rate in the 2 5 area show the complexity of the seepage development in the gravelly soil slope in the 2 4 area there is a dense structure with a relatively poor hydraulic conductivity formed by fine grained soil and stone in this case water may bypass this area and go down to increase the runoff in the 2 5 area sidle et al 2001 the results indicate that the seepage boundary conditions have significant impacts on the developments of the water flow in soil and the groundwater flow figs 14 16 the outflow on the slope bottom is redistributed which reflects the change of seepage channels in the slope sun et al 2012 meanwhile the seepage field in the slope changes and the seepage force changes therefore it is necessary to consider the effect of different seepage boundaries on the stability of gravelly soil slopes uchida et al 2001 5 3 discussion on the slope with permeable boundaries in engineering practice the surrounding hydraulic environment is usually the permeable boundary when geological hazards e g gravelly soil landslide occur tang et al 2016 however most previous landslide model tests used impermeable lateral boundaries which may result in an insufficient accuracy therefore it is necessary to make a detailed analysis of the hydraulic characteristics of the slope with permeable boundaries to reveal the differences and similarities between the two slope models considering different seepage boundaries in this paper the variation characteristics of the distributions of moisture content and pore water pressure obtained in the model test considering permeable boundaries are not totally consistent with the results reported in the literature tami et al 2004 bordoni et al 2015 zuo et al 2015 jia et al 2009 reid et al 2008 take et al 2004 chen et al 2010 5 3 1 moisture distribution fig 17 a shows the moisture content variation of the slope with permeable boundaries during slope mode test at the beginning of the test the infiltration is similar to that in a vertical one dimensional infiltration test dong et al 2017 lee et al 2011 and the seepage development along the slope is not obvious the difference of responding time between the moisture content sensors in the lower and middle parts is large the seepage along the slope is fully developed at the responding time and flow channels on the bottom are formed when the moisture content of each part of the slope reaches the maximum value it appears that the moisture content of the deep lower part is the largest while the moisture contents of the other parts of the slope are close but the moisture content 42 is almost the minimum in the middle part including the deep and shallow layers where the main water channels may be located woo and xia 1995 the water in the shallow upper part remains under the effect of strong suction see fig 11 after the rainfall ends the shallow layer of the slope basically keeps the same pace at the water depletion stage after 700 min the water in the deep lower part is gradually discharged while the moisture content in the deep middle part remains relatively stable showing a strong water holding capacity aaronb et al 2008 the characteristics of the slope are divided according to the changing characteristics of moisture contents in different regions of the slope fig 17b as shown in fig 17a the peak moisture content appears in the deep lower part of the slope which is partly consistent with the related works zuo et al 2015 chen et al 2010 shuo et al 2019 the minimum equilibrium value of moisture content appears in the middle part of this slope after the wetting front arrives while it is in the upper part of the slope according to the related results zuo et al 2015 dong et al 2017 the reason is that the seepage flow in the shallow middle part is fully developed with less moisture stayed when the permeable boundary is adopted and more moisture is absorbed in the upper part of the slope due to the effect of high matric suction there was only one outlet in the model flume of zuo et al 2015 because the impermeable boundary was considered thus the streamlines with the orientation towards the discharge port in the seepage field of their slope are different from those in the tests of this study therefore the moisture content is the highest in the lower part the moderate in the middle part and the minimum in the upper part in addition there is no inverted v shaped or u shaped curve of moisture content existed in the related studies chen et al 2010 bordoni et al 2015 indicating that the curve shape is mainly influenced by soil types the soil matrix used in this experiment seems to have high water holding and water absorbing capacities aaronb et al 2008 5 3 2 pore water pressure fig 18 shows the entire changing process of pore water pressure inside the slope with permeable boundaries except the upward trend of the pore water pressure in the shallow upper part after the arrival of the wetting front the pore water pressure in other parts of the slope presents a downward trend as a result of the influence of gas liquid motion fox et al 2010 yin and zhu 1999 the largest decreasing amplitude of pore water pressure occurs in the shallow middle part which is probably influenced by the dynamic seepage pressure bear 2013 intrinsically one important reason for this phenomenon is that the major passageway for seepage exists in the central area of the shallow layer of the slope woo and xia 1995 after rainfall the pore water pressure in the shallow upper part keeps rising with a reducing rate exhibiting a reverse trend compared to those in the shallow lower part and the shallow middle part this is probably because the soil used in the test is somewhat cohesive and the rainfall infiltration is not sufficiently developed in the shallow upper part leading to some closed unsaturated zones there rahardjo et al 2013 ng et al 2015 the pore water pressure in the deep upper part decreases slightly due to drainage it is worth noting that the shallow middle part deforms greatly after water is discharged and the pores are compressed hence the pore water pressure in the shallow middle part generally declines and tends to be stable with time the pore water pressure in the shallow lower part and deep lower part rises rapidly because of strong seepage flow guo et al 2016 in addition the pore water pressure is relatively stable in the whole progress in the deep middle part where the flow field is not fully developed the curves of pore water pressure in the shallow middle part shallow lower part and deep lower part are similar the pore water pressure experiences an ascent stage and then a sudden drop showing an intermittent drainage process the above three parts are the areas affected by dynamic seepage pressures xu and yang 2017 the curve of the pore water pressure in the lower part of the slope is presented in fig 19 a it is observed that the pore water pressure in the shallow lower part is larger than that in the deep layer near the end of rainfall a zone the lower part of the slope is the seepage concentrated zone where dynamic seepage pressure is formed due to the interconnection of seepage channels jia et al 2009 bordoni et al 2015 and tami et al 2004 studied the distribution pattern of pore water pressure and reported that the pore water pressure was higher in the deeper soil layer where a higher moisture content appeared their results contradict with the experimental data of this study regarding the speed of moisture movement in soil jia et al 2009 studied the effects of the rising and falling of water level on a slope the authors found that the pore water pressure was close to the static pore water pressure and the water was almost stationary when pore water pressure was stable bordoni et al 2015 monitored the underground pore water pressures and moisture contents at different depths of landslide zone the scale of their test slope was large and the speed of water flow in the soil was relatively small their results showed that landslide is prone to happen in the area with large pore water pressure and moisture content in our test the slope scale is small the boundary condition is porous and allows easy drainage of both water and air during heavy rainfall the seepage flow is fully developed in the slope with a relatively high flow rate under the action of high speed moving water the pore water pressure performs differently compared with the static water pressure additionally chen et al 2010 revealed that the inconsistency in the pore water pressure and moisture content among local areas was probably caused by the variability of gravelly soil from fig 19b it is noted that the amplitude of pore water pressure in the deep middle part with a low moisture content is smaller than that in the shallow middle part when the pores are connected with the porous lateral wall as shown in fig 26a the characteristic of pore water pressure in the shallow middle part is different from the related works reid et al 2008 take et al 2004 bordoni et al 2015 after rainfall the pore water pressure does not rebound but shows a decreasing tendency of change rate the soil settlement is relatively large under the effect of gravity in the shallow middle part where rich seepage channels exist shuo et al 2019 thus the pores are compressed and pore water pressure increases related results were discussed in the previous work okura et al 2002 xu and yang 2017 rinaldi et al 2010 in addition local areas in the shallow layer of the slope are in the unsaturated state as shown in fig 19c the volume of air space decreases because of the additional pressure induced by the change of slope gravity after rainfall in the regions close to the porous lateral wall the gas is compressed and discharged and water is not replenished in time the increase in positive pore water pressure indicates a state of high suction which presents the capillary barrier phenomenon as reported by lee et al 2011 and tami et al 2004 among others the difference between the shallow layer and deep layer lies in the opposite signs of pore water pressures the shallow lower part shows a water absorption effect after rainfall resulted from the settlement of slope and water redistribution the hydraulic characteristics are obviously different in different regions of the slope with permeable boundaries compared with relevant previous studies the slope is no longer a relatively closed system if the slope boundary becomes permeable chen et al 2010 rahardjo et al 2013 ali et al 2014 moreover it is a semi open system connected with air and can conduct water and gas in the process of rainfall the gas liquid movement in the slope changes the gas resistance decreases and the formation of seepage field changes accordingly these changes interact with the subsidence deformation of the slope hence the characteristics of the slope model change in the hydraulic process during rainfall in addition these changes will inevitably lead to the change of slope stability for instance a local crack appeared in the slope model with permeable boundaries as shown in fig 20 6 conclusion in order to examine the influence of seepage boundaries on hydraulic characteristics of gravelly soil slopes a novel model test device was developed two groups of slope model test considering different seepage boundaries were then carried out and then their results were compared and analyzed the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 different hydraulic characteristics were observed in the slopes with different seepage boundaries i compared to the slope with impermeable boundaries the slope with permeable boundaries generally exhibits a larger average infiltration rate as well as a relatively smaller moving speed and a smaller slope gradient of wetting front especially in the lower part according to the cumulative infiltration the local regions are ordered as the lower part the middle part and the upper part regarding the slope with permeable boundaries however the cumulative infiltration in the middle part approximates that in the lower part and is larger than that in the upper part for the slope with impermeable boundaries ii the residual moisture content of l 2 in the slope with permeable boundaries is 38 2 which is 6 6 smaller than that of the slope with impermeable boundaries by contrast the residual moisture content of u 1 in the slope with permeable boundaries is 24 7 which is 5 3 larger than that of the slope with permeable boundaries moreover the zone with a high moisture content in the deep layer expands in the slope with impermeable boundaries iii the maximum difference of about 1 2 kpa between pore water pressures occurs in the middle parts of the two slope models the values of regional pore water pressures in the shallow lower and shallow middle parts of the slope with impermeable boundaries exhibit large fluctuations over 0 5 kpa 2 distinct spatial morphology of seepage field is reflected by the hydraulic characteristics in the slope models with different seepage boundaries the most affected part is the middle and lower parts of a slope which will directly threaten the stability of the slope 3 in the slope model with permeable boundaries the pore water pressure in the middle and lower parts shows obviously abnormal changes resulted from the dynamic seepage pressure compared with the previous studies it is found that the formation process of seepage field is determined by seepage boundary in the slope model and the permeable boundary enables the multi dimensional development of slope seepage flow rather than the centralized diversion to a critical local zone 4 it seems that the slope with permeable boundaries is prone to appear local failures as a result of the multi dimensional development of seepage flow field nevertheless the overall instability is likely to take place in the slope with impermeable boundaries due to the concentration of seepage field to a critical local zone therefore it is necessary to pay attention to the seepage boundary environment of the target slope when evaluating the stability of a slope declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could
