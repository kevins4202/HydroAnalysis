6890,the compound dry and hot event has attracted much attention in recent decades due to their disastrous impacts on different sectors the impact from compound dry and hot events is generally more severe than that from individual dry or hot event understanding the physical mechanism of this compound event is thus of particular importance for early warning to reduce potential impacts in this study we quantitatively assessed the relationship between the occurrence of compound dry and hot events and el niño southern oscillation enso during the warm season at the global scale monthly precipitation and temperature from the climatic research unit cru were used to estimate the occurrence of compound events and niño 3 4 index nino34 was used to represent the enso phenomenon the logistic regression model was employed to model the occurrence of compound events with respect to nino34 results from the logistic regression model showed that enso played an important role in the occurrence of compound dry and hot events during the warm season in regions such as northern part of south america southern africa southeastern asia and australia a higher likelihood of the occurrence of compound dry and hot events in these regions was shown to be associated with higher values of nino34 based on empirical analysis from observations results from this study will help improve our understanding of compound dry and hot events and aid with mitigation efforts for ameliorating their adverse impacts keywords drought hot extreme enso compound events 1 introduction the concurrence of dry and hot extreme is one type of compound extremes which is commonly defined as the occurrence of multiple events with extreme impacts seneviratne et al 2012 leonard et al 2014 zscheischler et al 2018 hao et al 2018 the compound dry and hot extreme may lead to detrimental impacts on agriculture energy health and ecosystems ciais et al 2005 lyon 2009 williams et al 2010 for example the 2012 drought in the central u s which was accompanied by high temperature anomalies had caused at least 30 billion damages largely agricultural losses rippey 2015 the severe drought and heat wave that struck europe during the summer of 2003 had led to enormous impacts on economics and society including around 40 000 deaths garcía herrera et al 2010 thus understanding the physical mechanism of compound dry and hot extremes or events is of particular importance for modeling and early warning of compound extremes to reduce the adverse impacts different mechanisms may cause the occurrence of compound dry and hot events or extremes including the land atmospheric interactions or persistent large scale circulation anomalies seneviratne et al 2012 the land atmospheric interaction feedback has been shown to play an important role in the occurrence and evolution of compound dry and hot extremes during warm seasons over global land areas déry and wood 2005 trenberth and shea 2005 adler et al 2008 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 though droughts and hot extremes generally span different time scales with the drought being typically longer months to years than the hot extreme days to weeks miralles et al 2018 it is well known that soil moisture plays a key role in the coupling of the land surface and atmosphere and may affect the partitioning of the surface net radiation into the latent heat flux and sensible heat flux contributing to the surface temperature change berg et al 2014 hauser et al 2016 with dry soil and vegetation the land evaporation or evapotranspiration decreases which may reduce the likelihood of rainfall favoring the occurrence of meteorological drought miralles et al 2018 concurrently the moisture deficit tends to reduce evaporative cooling and increase sensible heat flux leading to increased surface air temperature that may result in a heat wave or exaggerate its magnitude seneviratne et al 2010 hirschi et al 2011 miralles et al 2014 santanello et al 2017 schwingshackl et al 2017 dirmeyer et al 2018 miralles et al 2018 this soil moisture temperature interaction during summer generally leads to the negative dependence of dry and hot condition particularly in transitional climate regions koster et al 2009 seneviratne et al 2010 trenberth 2011 contributing to the occurrence of compound dry and hot extremes compound extremes may also result from common forcing factors such as natural cycles like el niño southern oscillation enso or large scale atmospheric circulation patterns seneviratne et al 2012 kopp et al 2017 enso is among the most important atmospheric oceanic mode of variability on interannual time scales which has been shown to affect precipitation and temperature around the globe especially in tropical and subtropical areas with distinct regional patterns mason and goddard 2001 mcphaden et al 2006 alexander et al 2009 mishra and singh 2011 arblaster and alexander 2012 yang and delsole 2012 sun et al 2015 cheng et al 2017 sun et al 2017 dittus et al 2018 studies have shown enso impacts of drier warmer conditions in much of australia southeast asia india northwest u s and canada during el niño and wetter cooler conditions in roughly the same regions during la niña chiew et al 1998 power et al 1998 alexander et al 2009 apart from the assessment of how enso affects the mean climate an improved understanding of enso impacts on the occurrence of extremes is required which may impose larger impacts on the society and ecosystems alexander et al 2009 lyon 2009 for example kenyon and hegerl 2010 showed that enso substantially affected precipitation extremes in many regions including the pacific rim north america south america africa and india and also affected temperature extremes most clearly around the pacific rim and north america kenyon and hegerl 2008 alexander et al 2009 assessed the influence of sea surface temperature sst variability on global temperature and precipitation extremes and showed strong statistically significant opposite temperature and precipitation extremes associated with strong la niña and strong el niño however most of these studies focused on the individual precipitation temperature or associated extremes while studies on the influence on compound dry and hot events extremes at the global scale is still lacking the objective of this study therefore is to quantify the relationship between the occurrence of compound dry and hot events or extremes and enso for the warm season at the global scale a binary variable of the occurrence of compound dry and hot events for the warm season is first defined which is then modelled with respect to the corresponding niño 3 4 sst index nino34 i e area averaged sst from 5s 5n and 170 120w based on the logistic regression model the odd ratio of the occurrence of compound events is then estimated to assess the impact from enso for the warm season over global land areas 2 method 2 1 definition of compound dry and hot events the individual precipitation or temperature extreme can be defined based on a specific threshold or percentile zhang et al 2011 for example based on monthly precipitation and temperature data the dry condition can be defined based on precipitation lower than 20th percentile while the hot temperature extreme can be defined based on temperature higher than 80th percentile the compound dry and hot temperature event or extreme for each month or period can then be defined as the concurrence of the dry condition and hot extreme 2 2 logistic regression model previous studies have shown that enso affects both precipitation and temperature in different regions with significant linear correlations between nino34 and precipitation temperature wang and schimel 2003 yang and delsole 2012 zhu et al 2017 dittus et al 2018 to assess the enso impact on the combined condition of the low precipitation and high temperature or the compound dry hot event we first defined a binary response variable y to represent the occurrence of a compound event y 1 indicates occurrence and y 0 indicates nonoccurrence the logistic regression model is capable of modeling the binary variable and has been widely used in hydrology and climatology mahlstein et al 2012 ford and labosier 2014 gudmundsson et al 2014 stagge et al 2015 martius et al 2016 meng et al 2017 the relationship between the dichotomous dependent variable y with respect to the independent variable x i e nino34 can be expressed by the binary logistic regression model as agresti 2007 1 logit p x α β x where p x p y 1 x i e the probability of the occurrence of the compound dry and hot event or extreme given the nino34 or x values α and β are coefficients the left side of the equation is known as the logit transformation the logit is a link function and can be expressed as logit p x ln p x 1 p x the matric p x 1 p x is the odd which is defined as the probability of occurrence divided by the probability of non occurrence agresti 2007 one can then derive from eq 1 that the ratio of the odd for a one unit increase in x is exp β or the odd ratio notice that the odd ratio does not change according to different values of x since they cancelled out during calculation thus the odd ratio represents the constant effect of the independent variable on the likelihood that one outcome will occur an odd ratio higher than one or β 0 implies the higher odd of compound extreme occurrences associated with increased nino34 values and vice versa the odd ratio can then be used to assess the response of the dependent variable i e occurrence of dry and hot event to the independent variable i e nino34 the probability at specific values of the nino 34 can also be estimated from the logistic regression model specifically the probability of the occurrence of compound events can be expressed as 2 p y 1 x 1 1 exp α β x for positive negative values of β the probability p x increases decreases as x increases 3 data and results 3 1 data precipitation and temperature data at the global scale were obtained from the climatic research unit cru ts v 3 25 of the university of east anglia http www cru uea ac uk data harris et al 2014 this dataset is available at a 0 5 resolution for the period from 1901 to 2016 in this study only monthly precipitation and temperature data for the period 1951 2016 were used due to the relatively large number of gauge observations to generate this dataset the monthly nino34 based on the hadsst1 dataset for the period 1951 2016 was obtained from global climate observing system gcos working group on surface pressure wg sp https www esrl noaa gov psd gcos wgsp timeseries nino34 the focus of this study was the compound dry and hot events extremes thus following zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 we focused on the warm season defined as the hottest 3 month period based on the 3 month average temperature for each grid as shown in fig 1 the 50th percentile of the 3 month average precipitation and temperature was used as the threshold to obtain compound dry and hot events for the warm season i e the occurrence of a compound dry and hot event of each grid point is observed if the 3 month average precipitation temperature during the warm season of a specific year is lower higher than the corresponding 50th percentile this threshold was selected to obtain a relatively large number of compound events for statistical analysis i e trade off between extremeness and sample size in addition the compound extreme impact may result from the coincidence of several events that are not extremes themselves seneviratne et al 2012 thus the definition of the compound event extreme based on relatively moderate thresholds is expected to be useful and acceptable though certain simplifications do exist in this definition in total 66 years of binary series of compound events were extracted from the precipitation and temperature of the warm season accordingly we also computed the corresponding 3 month nino34 for the warm season for each grid point 3 2 impact of enso on precipitation and temperature since our focus was the compound dry and hot events we mainly focused on the negative positive correlation between precipitation temperature and nino34 the significant correlation at 0 05 significance level between precipitation and temperature and the corresponding nino34 for the warm season is shown in fig 2 for low precipitation the significant impact of enso based on the significant negative correlation is shown in northern south america southern africa southern and southeastern asia and a large region of australia for high temperature significant impacts of enso based on the significant positive correlation were observed in several regions including western coast of north america northern south america central and southern africa southern and southeastern asia and large regions in australia regions with both significant negative correlations between precipitation and nino34 and significant positive correlations between temperature and nino34 mainly include northern south america southern africa southern and southeastern asia and australia where the compound dry and hot event are expected to occur with high values of nino34 these results provided an approximate estimate of the significant enso impact on the compound dry and hot event during the warm season 3 3 enso impacts on compound events 3 3 1 illustration at one grid we first show the relationship between the occurrence of compound events and nino34 at the selected grid longitude 118 25 latitude 1 25 located in indonesia the reason to select this grid was that the occurrence of both hot and dry events in this region has been shown to be affected by enso king et al 2016 after extracting the occurrence of compound events for the hottest 3 month period for each year the time series of the occurrence of compound dry and hot events and the corresponding accumulated nino34 during the warm season is shown in fig 3 from this figure it can be seen that a large number of occurrences of the compound event were during the period with high nino34 values for example indonesia experienced a severe dry and heat season during 2015 with strong el niño events fig 3 a which led to wild fires across much of the country huijnen et al 2016 king et al 2016 the logistic regression model was then fitted to the occurrences of compound dry and hot events and nino34 for this grid point the regression coefficient for this grid was estimated as β 1 07 significant at 5 significance level a relative high value of the odd ratio exp β 2 92 1 implied a higher odd of the occurrence of a compound event associated with an increased nino34 value the estimated probabilities of the occurrence of compound events were shown in fig 3 b it can be seen that the probability of occurrence increased with the increase of the nino34 value the observed occurrence of the compound event 1 if occurs is also plotted in fig 3 b which showed the compound event tended to occur when the nino value was high for this grid point 3 3 2 enso impacts at global scale the logistic regression model was then estimated based on the occurrence of compound events and the corresponding accumulated nino34 during the warm season at each grid the separation error i e the response variable can be perfectly separated by a predictor or a combination of predictors may occur in the fitting process of the logistic regression heinze and schemper 2002 in this study we discarded the grid in regions where valid time series of the occurrence of the compound event cannot be extracted due to reasons such as lack of data after this data processing the separation error during the model fitting processes was only found in very limited grids which were then discarded in the following analysis we then show the odd ratio of compound event with respect to accumulated nino34 during the warm season over global land areas in fig 4 in this figure only those results with a significant regression coefficient at 0 05 significance level is shown from fig 4 there is a significant relationship between nino34 and the occurrence of compound dry and hot events in norther part of south america southern africa southeastern asia and australia in these regions the odd ratio of the compound event was higher than 1 indicating high odds of compound events with increased nino34 values studies have shown that el niño was usually associated with warm and dry conditions in several regions including southern and eastern inland areas of australia indonesia the philippines malaysia and central pacific islands wmo 2014 hirons and klingaman 2015 which are also shown in fig 4 for example it has been shown that an increased likelihood of warm and dry conditions occurs during el niño low occurrences of cool and wet conditions during la niña across much of australia min et al 2013 gallant et al 2014 as another example there is also a tendency of compound warm and dry conditions during el niño in the northern part of south america marcelo and nicolas 2011 thus results from the logistic model in fig 4 are consistent with previous studies we then estimated the relationship between the occurrence of compound events and nino34 based on empirical analysis from observations the empirical probabilities of compound dry and hot extremes given nino34 values exceeding one standard deviation are shown in fig 5 only shown for grids with significant relationship in fig 4 the empirical results showed that given the higher value of nino34 the probability of a compound event occurrence was higher in regions similar to those with significant and high odd ratio the empirical evidence generally confirms the findings from the logistic regression model 3 3 3 impact of lags and thresholds there may be a lagged effect on the occurrence of enso and the associated precipitation or temperature extremes davey et al 2014 thus certain lags may exist between the occurrence of compound dry and hot events and enso to incorporate the lag effect we define the compound dry and hot event as that occurring with a 0 to 2 month time lag of nino34 for example for nino34 during the hottest 3 month period of june july august jja the occurrence of compound events was defined to include all occurrences during jja july august september jas and august september october aso the logistic model was then fitted to the compound event and nino34 with the odd ratio shown in fig 6 a compared with fig 4 significant high odd ratio 1 also existed in similar regions overall these results confirmed the impact of enso on compound dry and hot events during the warm season over global land areas in the previous section the compound dry and hot event was defined based on the 50th 50th percentile of the average precipitation temperature during the warm season for all years from 1951 to 2016 to further show the results we defined the compound dry and hot event or extreme based on the 30th percentile of the average precipitation and 70th percentile of the average temperature during the warm season for all years from 1951 to 2016 the odd ratio in this regard is shown in fig 6 b comparing with fig 4 similar patterns of the odd ratio over global land areas are shown for example significant impact of enso on the compound event is shown in tropical regions including northern south america central and southern africa southeastern asia and australia these results imply that these regions are vulnerable to the compound dry and hot extreme event when the nino34 value is high 4 conclusion the relationship between compound dry and hot events and enso during the warm season at the global scale was quantified based on the logistic regression model results showed that the odd of compound dry and hot event tended to be high with the increase of nino34 in certain regions including northern part of south american southern africa southeastern asia and australia empirical studies from observations also showed consistent results by estimating the conditional probability of the compound event given nino34 exceeding one standard deviation the compound dry and hot event extreme in this study is defined based on the monthly precipitation and temperature however traditionally and practically the hot extreme such as heat wave is commonly estimated at daily time scale robinson 2001 perkins 2015 horton et al 2016 thus the daily temperature data of long term records are preferred in defining and estimating the compound dry and hot event such as the heat waves and droughts of 2003 in europe and 2010 in russia robinson 2001 schubert et al 2014 horton et al 2016 to quantifying its relationship with enso in this study only the impact of enso on the occurrence of compound dry and hot events was evaluated there are other climate drivers that may lead to precipitation and temperature extremes perkins sarah et al 2015 steptoe et al 2018 for example both the madden julian oscillation mjo and enso may affect precipitation and temperature extremes in the north of southern america marcelo and nicolas 2011 moreover except for the external forcing there are other mechanisms causing the occurrence of compound dry and hot extremes such as land atmosphere interactions especially in transitional climate regions seneviratne et al 2012 miralles et al 2018 for example the dominant climate pattern during summer in the u s is generally dry and warm which mainly results from the land atmosphere interaction madden and williams 1978 zhao and khalil 1993 koster et al 2009 further analysis and disentanglement of causative mechanisms of compound dry and hot events or extremes in different regions and seasons will be carried out in a future study findings from this study may provide useful information for modeling and early warning of compound dry and hot events extremes acknowledgments we thank the editors and anonymous

or a combination of predictors may occur in the fitting process of the logistic regression heinze and schemper 2002 in this study we discarded the grid in regions where valid time series of the occurrence of the compound event cannot be extracted due to reasons such as lack of data after this data processing the separation error during the model fitting processes was only found in very limited grids which were then discarded in the following analysis we then show the odd ratio of compound event with respect to accumulated nino34 during the warm season over global land areas in fig 4 in this figure only those results with a significant regression coefficient at 0 05 significance level is shown from fig 4 there is a significant relationship between nino34 and the occurrence of compound dry and hot events in norther part of south america southern africa southeastern asia and australia in these regions the odd ratio of the compound event was higher than 1 indicating high odds of compound events with increased nino34 values studies have shown that el niño was usually associated with warm and dry conditions in several regions including southern and eastern inland areas of australia indonesia the philippines malaysia and central pacific islands wmo 2014 hirons and klingaman 2015 which are also shown in fig 4 for example it has been shown that an increased likelihood of warm and dry conditions occurs during el niño low occurrences of cool and wet conditions during la niña across much of australia min et al 2013 gallant et al 2014 as another example there is also a tendency of compound warm and dry conditions during el niño in the northern part of south america marcelo and nicolas 2011 thus results from the logistic model in fig 4 are consistent with previous studies we then estimated the relationship between the occurrence of compound events and nino34 based on empirical analysis from observations the empirical probabilities of compound dry and hot extremes given nino34 values exceeding one standard deviation are shown in fig 5 only shown for grids with significant relationship in fig 4 the empirical results showed that given the higher value of nino34 the probability of a compound event occurrence was higher in regions similar to those with significant and high odd ratio the empirical evidence generally confirms the findings from the logistic regression model 3 3 3 impact of lags and thresholds there may be a lagged effect on the occurrence of enso and the associated precipitation or temperature extremes davey et al 2014 thus certain lags may exist between the occurrence of compound dry and hot events and enso to incorporate the lag effect we define the compound dry and hot event as that occurring with a 0 to 2 month time lag of nino34 for example for nino34 during the hottest 3 month period of june july august jja the occurrence of compound events was defined to include all occurrences during jja july august september jas and august september october aso the logistic model was then fitted to the compound event and nino34 with the odd ratio shown in fig 6 a compared with fig 4 significant high odd ratio 1 also existed in similar regions overall these results confirmed the impact of enso on compound dry and hot events during the warm season over global land areas in the previous section the compound dry and hot event was defined based on the 50th 50th percentile of the average precipitation temperature during the warm season for all years from 1951 to 2016 to further show the results we defined the compound dry and hot event or extreme based on the 30th percentile of the average precipitation and 70th percentile of the average temperature during the warm season for all years from 1951 to 2016 the odd ratio in this regard is shown in fig 6 b comparing with fig 4 similar patterns of the odd ratio over global land areas are shown for example significant impact of enso on the compound event is shown in tropical regions including northern south america central and southern africa southeastern asia and australia these results imply that these regions are vulnerable to the compound dry and hot extreme event when the nino34 value is high 4 conclusion the relationship between compound dry and hot events and enso during the warm season at the global scale was quantified based on the logistic regression model results showed that the odd of compound dry and hot event tended to be high with the increase of nino34 in certain regions including northern part of south american southern africa southeastern asia and australia empirical studies from observations also showed consistent results by estimating the conditional probability of the compound event given nino34 exceeding one standard deviation the compound dry and hot event extreme in this study is defined based on the monthly precipitation and temperature however traditionally and practically the hot extreme such as heat wave is commonly estimated at daily time scale robinson 2001 perkins 2015 horton et al 2016 thus the daily temperature data of long term records are preferred in defining and estimating the compound dry and hot event such as the heat waves and droughts of 2003 in europe and 2010 in russia robinson 2001 schubert et al 2014 horton et al 2016 to quantifying its relationship with enso in this study only the impact of enso on the occurrence of compound dry and hot events was evaluated there are other climate drivers that may lead to precipitation and temperature extremes perkins sarah et al 2015 steptoe et al 2018 for example both the madden julian oscillation mjo and enso may affect precipitation and temperature extremes in the north of southern america marcelo and nicolas 2011 moreover except for the external forcing there are other mechanisms causing the occurrence of compound dry and hot extremes such as land atmosphere interactions especially in transitional climate regions seneviratne et al 2012 miralles et al 2018 for example the dominant climate pattern during summer in the u s is generally dry and warm which mainly results from the land atmosphere interaction madden and williams 1978 zhao and khalil 1993 koster et al 2009 further analysis and disentanglement of causative mechanisms of compound dry and hot events or extremes in different regions and seasons will be carried out in a future study findings from this study may provide useful information for modeling and early warning of compound dry and hot events extremes acknowledgments we thank the editors and anonymous

6891,medium low temperature geothermal resources are abundant in southern china but their heat source and link to fault zones is poorly understood consequently geothermal energy is only used at small scale in order to broaden the footprint of geothermal energy use in southern china it is first necessary to understand and track the geothermal groundwater circulation pattern associated with fault zones the heyuan fault zone serves as a typical medium low temperature geothermal system of south china here we show that the geothermal groundwater circulation pattern can be traced by using stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes helium and neon isotopes carbon 13 and carbon 14 as well as hydrochemical parameters the results show that in the heyuan fault zone the main hydrochemical type of the hot springs is hco3 na k while the shallow cold groundwater is mainly enriched in hco3 ca the results of the helium isotope and neon isotope indicate that the geothermal groundwater of this area is derived from the crust thus excluding the possibility of extremely deep paths of groundwater tapping into mantle helium sources furthermore the characteristics of the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes imply that geothermal groundwater is of local meteoric origin and the recharge area located at the hilly area of the hanging wall of the heyuan main fault with the recharge elevations ranging from about 440 m to 670 m the hot spring geothermometer shows that the highest reservoir temperature is about 157 c and the deepest circulation depth is about 6500 m carbon 14 isotope age dating suggests that the geothermal groundwater ages are mostly from 9 9 kyr bp to 12 3 kyr bp according to the geological structural characteristics of the study area the main upward channel for geothermal groundwater is the heyuan main fault generally the hot springs in this area are mixed with shallow cold groundwater and surface water which raises the ratio of the ca2 in water and dilutes the heavy hydrogen and oxygen isotopes keywords geothermal springs isotopes geothermometer groundwater mixing heyuan fault 1 introduction china has invested significantly into developing future clean energy sources the interest in exploiting geothermal resources has recently grown substantially lin et al 2013 chen et al 2015a zhou et al 2015 south china is one of the most developed industrial precinct in china and has a particularly high demand in developing its abundant geothermal resources geothermal groundwater in south china mainly ranges from low to medium temperature 150 c along fault zones zhou et al 2008 yuan 2013 studying the circulation pattern of the geothermal groundwater in the fault zones of south china is crucial for understanding and exploiting geothermal and geothermal groundwater resources in this region there are abundant hot springs in the guangdong province of south china mainly distributed along with the ne striking faults the heyuan fault is one of the typical ne striking deep faults in south china and together with the nw striking faults dividing the guangdong province into many small tectonic basins chen et al 2014 although the hot springs in the heyuan fault zone have been used for hundreds of years since the qin dynasty 3rd century bce studies about this geothermal groundwater system has been still very limited only a few geothermal groundwater studies are available in this area discussing about the chemical and isotopic characteristics as well as recharge sources of the geothermal groundwater mao et al 2015 yuan 2013 zhou et al 2008 furthermore groundwater circulation in the heyuan fault zone has implications for hazard assessments because of the well known series of reservoir induced seismicity in the heyuan fault zone qiu and fenton 2015 the reduction in temperature of geothermally derived groundwater in the hydrothermal spring system of the fault zones can either be caused by slow ascent of geothermal groundwater to land surface or through mixing of deep geothermal groundwater with shallow infiltrated meteoric water white 1968 wang 1996 moeck 2014 afsin et al 2014 mixing with shallow infiltrated meteoric water can significantly alter the hydrochemistry and isotopic characteristics of geothermal groundwater and therefore results in uncertainty in the interpretation of hydro geochemical results of geothermal groundwater capaccioni et al 2011 afsin et al 2014 however the importance of the mixing processes has not been considered and is not well understood in hydrothermal spring studies of fault zones of south china this study aims to characterize the circulation processes of the hydrothermal spring system of the heyuan fault zone including the recharge source recharge elevation reservoir temperature circulation depth and age of geothermal groundwater etc the significances of the mixing of deep geothermal groundwater with shallow infiltrated meteoric water are identified and discussed multiple environmental isotopes including stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes δd and δ18o helium isotopes 3he 4he and neon isotope 4he 20ne carbon isotopes δ14c and δ13c as well as geothermometers are analyzed in this paper 2 geological and hydrological setting the heyuan fault zone is located in the northeast of the guangdong province south china fig 1 the study area is located between e114 14 and e115 36 and between n23 10 and n24 27 and belongs to the hilly area as a subtropical monsoon climate area it is hot and humid in summer with a lot of typhoons dry and relatively cold in winter the mean annual temperature is 20 7 c with the lowest mean monthly temperature of 11 6 c in january and the highest mean monthly temperature of 28 0 c in july the mean annual rainfall is about 1768 mm the main river of this region is the dongjiang river which flows through heyuan from northeast to southwest roughly parallel with the heyuan main fault fig 1 the xing fengjiang reservoir is located at the west side footwall of the main fault fig 1 it is the largest reservoir in guangdong province with the total water area of 370 km2 and the total capacity around 13 9 billion m3 the strata outcropping around the fault zone are mainly the middle and late jurassic yanshanian biotite granite and cretaceous paleogene red layer deposits ling and zhang 2002 the ne striking heyuan fault is the main fault in the study area with a length of about 400 km fig 1 the fault had been activated several times in the geological past mainly in the mesozoic yanshan tectonic period and it is interpreted as a normal fault from the neogene to the present this fault is still active appearing to be sinistral a strike slip normal fault in the plan the hanging wall of the fault consists of the cretaceous paleogene red layer and the footwall of the yanshanian biotite granite the footwall granite along the fault zone was obviously silicified with quartz reef belt thickness up to 30 m superimposing on mylonitized granite zou et al 2010 3 sampling and analysis methods to study the geothermal groundwater of the heyuan fault zone 43 water samples were collected during august to october in the year 2016 including 10 hot spring samples 17 ascending spring samples 10 descending spring samples 2 reservoir samples 2 river samples and 2 precipitation samples ascending springs also called artesian springs are those discharge under pressure due to confined conditions while descending springs also called gravity springs are the springs that emerge under unconfined conditions kresic 2010 in the field the springs that water flows upward at the point where it emerges were identified as ascending springs and the others were descending springs temperature ph electrical conductivity ec oxidation reduction potential orp total dissolved solid tds and alkalinity of water samples were measured in the field temperature ph and orp were measured using hanna hi98121 tester water temperature 60 c or hanna hi9125 tester water temperature 60 c ec and tds for all the water samples were measured by adopting the ysi ec300a meter alkalinity was measured using a digital titration technique hach 1690001 with 0 16 n sulfuric acid alkalinity 40 mg l or 1 6 n sulfuric acid alkalinity 40 mg l additionally the sio2 concentration of the water samples were also measured in the filed using a silica meter hanna hi96770 samples for major ion analyses were filtered using 0 22 μm membrane and then collected into 125 ml hdpe bottles samples for δd and δ18o analyses were collected directly into 250 ml glass bottles samples for 14c analysis were collected directly into 500 ml hdpe bottles gas samples for helium isotope analysis were collected into glass bottles when sampling gas the bottles were totally immersed into water and then corked underwater as soon as the collected gas volume was about 20 ml and kept upside down until analyzing after sampling major ions were determined using the ion chromatograph dionex ics 900 usa at the laboratory of school of earth sciences and engineering sun yat sen university sysu for analysis of the anions the eluent contained 4 5 mm na2co3 0 8 mm nahco3 for analysis of the cations the eluent was 20 mm methane sulphonic acid both of eluents were pumped at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 the standards of ions were used in calibrations to ensure the quality of analysis and the blank samples show concentrations below limit of detection for each ion analysis the goodness of fit r2 for linear regression of five point calibration data was over 0 999 and the relative standard deviation of major ions analysis are less than 2 the δd and δ18o of water samples were analyzed using δd δ18o ultra high precision isotopic water analyzer picarro l2130 i usa at school of environmental sciences and engineering of sysu and expressed as deviation relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow standard the applied calibration standards of the isotopes were range from 28 52 to 142 94 for δdv smow and from 4 42 to 18 86 for δ18ov smow with analytical precision of 0 2 and 2 respectively the radioactive carbon isotope 14c was determined using the standard accelerator mass spectrometry ams method in the laboratory of beta analytic inc miami usa and the measured uncertainty was less than 0 1 percent modern carbon pmc the helium isotope of the gas samples was determined adopting the method described by cao et al 2014 using noblesse multi collector noble gas mass spectrometer nu instruments uk in lanzhou institute of geology chinese academy of sciences and the relative standard deviation is less than 6 10 4 results 4 1 hydrogeochemical characteristics the temperature of the hot springs varied from 31 3 c to 76 6 c while the temperature of the ascending springs varied from 21 9 to 29 6 c the temperature of the descending springs varied from 19 6 to 26 9 c and temperature of the reservoir water is about 27 c table 1 the samples of hot springs are mostly alkalescent with the highest ph of 8 37 except for hy2 13 being alkalescent all the non thermal groundwater samples are neutral or weakly acid while the reservoir water is weakly alkaline the electrical conductivity ec of the hot springs ranges from 175 7 μs cm to 1483 μs cm while the ec of the non thermal groundwater is substantially less than 200 μs cm most of which is less than 100 μs cm the silica concentrations in the hot water samples are relatively high ranging from 67 to 133 mg l except that the hy3 10 2 is only 32 mg l the non thermal groundwater samples are generally low in silica concentrations varying from 10 to 43 mg l except that hy2 13 has 68 mg l reservoir water sample contains the lowest silica only 9 mg l most of the water samples contain relatively abundant hco 3 however some non thermal groundwater samples are different for samples hy2 01 hy 2 05 and hy2 25 their ph are so low 4 55 5 33 that the hco 3 concentrations are unable to be detected by titration for samples hy2 23 and hy3 02 2 a relatively low ph 5 51 and 5 7 and high no 3 42 3 and 14 6 mg l is measured for the relative high nitrate no 3 10 mg l samples hy2 01 hy2 08 hy2 21 hy2 23 hy3 02 2 all of them are non thermal groundwater samples and have high orp values from 229 mv to 339 mv which indicate oxidizing conditions the samples with elevated cl cl 8 mg l usually contain elevated so 4 2 so 4 2 10 mg l and those samples contain both hot spring samples hy 01 hy2 12 2 hy2 22 hy3 01 2 hy3 02 1 hy3 05 hy3 06 hy3 10 1 and non thermal groundwater samples hy2 01 hy2 08 hy2 13 hy2 21 hy2 23 hy2 24 and their orp values vary widely from 65 mv to 339 mv suggesting there is no obvious correlation between orp values and the concentrations of cl and so 4 2 in addition the distribution characteristics of no 3 suggest it mainly from the oxidizing environment near the ground surface and the distribution characteristics of elevated cl and so 4 2 may indicate multi sources for them the cations in the hot spring samples are mostly na and k less ca 2 and a few mg 2 at the same time the non thermal water samples have more ca 2 and mg 2 and cations of some samples are dominated by ca 2 such as the reservoir samples fig 2 based on the composition of the major ions the water chemistry types of the samples can be classified as follows hot springs are mainly hco3 na k type and a few are hco3 na k ca type the ascending springs and descending springs are mainly hco3 ca type with some are hco3 na k ca type and a few are cl no3 ca type the reservoir samples are hco3 ca type 4 2 hydrogen and oxygen isotopes results of δ18o and δd of the hot spring samples range from 6 6 to 7 4 and from 41 0 to 45 9 respectively values of δ18o and δd in the non thermal groundwater samples including samples from ascending descending springs range from 5 7 to 7 4 and from 35 2 to 46 3 respectively table 1 the average δ18o and δd values of the reservoir water samples are 5 7 and 35 7 respectively compared to that of the river samples which range from 6 8 to 7 0 and from 41 6 to 44 1 for δ18o and δd respectively the reservoir water samples are relatively enriched in heavy hydrogen and oxygen isotopes this difference may be because of the evaporation effect however considering that the enrichment is no larger than 2 of δ18o and 10 of δd the evaporation effect is quite small clark 2015 the lowest δ18o and δd isotope values were found in rainwater for example 7 7 and 53 0 hy2 19 2 13 6 and 94 2 hy 11 the isotopic differences between the two precipitation events were significant and this kind of differences are common for single precipitation events event at the same place besides one of them was collected in the dry season and the other one was collected during a typhoon in the wet season 4 3 carbon isotopes of hot springs the results of 14c for dissolved inorganic carbon dic in hot groundwater samples are shown in table 2 according to the half life formula 1 of radioactive carbon 14 the apparent groundwater ages range from 7560 yr bp to 20 950 yr bp table 2 however considering the carbon exchange between dic of the groundwater and the dead carbon the dead carbon refers to the inactive carbon that has been buried for long time and the 14c content has decayed to zero fontes and garnier 1979 of the surrounding rock a correction analysis was necessary and the geothermal age should be estimated by 1 t τ log 2 l o g a 0 a t where τ is the half life of 14c taken 5730 years godwin 1962 a0 is the initial 14c concentration of dic in groundwater taken 102 3 pmc at is the 14c residual concentration of the dic in groundwater samples obtained from the test data 4 4 helium and neon isotopes of hot springs the r ra ratio is commonly used to represent the composition of helium isotopes where the r represents 3he 4he value of the sample and the ra represents the 3he 4he value of atmosphere which is 1 4 10 6 sun et al 2016 the tested data of the helium and neon isotopes are shown in table 3 5 discussions 5 1 identification of the relationship between thermal groundwater and mantle source as a deep fault zone the heyuan fault zone may provide an access to deep circulation of the geothermal groundwater groundwater is likely to take the deep fault zone as a channel to achieve migration over hundreds of kilometers or even thousands of kilometers and this kind of water is often enriched with mantle derived volatiles such as mantle helium chen et al 2012 chen and jiang 2015b to constrain the sources of the geothermal groundwater in the heyuan fault zone analyses of the helium isotopes were conducted the 3he 4he ratios are commonly higher 8 1 ra in mantle gas and lower 0 01 ra in the crust due to the enrichment of uranium and thorium in the crust which can produce 4he by radiation decay kurz et al 1982 in addition helium is a noble gas and inert for chemical reactions therefore helium isotopes are often used as tracers to determine the sources and evolution of subsurface fluids hoke et al 2000 it is generally assumed that when r ra 1 the source of helium in the sample is mainly from the mantle when r ra 1 helium in the sample is mainly from the crust source andrews 1985 zhao et al 2012 ratios of r ra for hot spring samples of the heyuan fault zone range from 0 35 to 0 48 and can generally be considered as dominated by a crustal source combining neon isotope data the helium source ratios of the hot spring gas can be further calculated using the equations proposed by sano and wakita 1985 2 3 he 4 he s 3 he 4 he a a 3 he 4 he m m 3 he 4 he c c 3 1 4 he 20 ne s a 4 he 20 ne a m 4 he 20 ne m c 4 he 20 ne c 4 a m c 1 where a m and c respectively represent source ratio of the atmosphere mantle and crust the 3he 4he s and 4he 20ne s represent the isotopes ratios of samples and the other values of parameters are as follows zhao et al 2012 3 he 4 he a 1 4 10 6 4 he 20 ne a 0 318 3 he 4 he m 1 1 10 5 4 he 20 ne m 1000 3 he 4 he c 1 5 10 8 4 he 20 ne c 1000 substituting them into the equations one obtains 5 a 0 318 4 he 20 ne s 0 318 1000 0 318 6 m 1 1 0 96 a 3 he 4 he s 10 5 1 0985 7 c 1 a m the calculated proportions of helium sources table 3 show that more than 92 of the hot spring helium is from crustal sources which suggests that the geothermal groundwater is unrelated to mantle materials and the recharge area should not be far away 5 2 recharge sources of geothermal groundwater in the geothermal groundwater circulation system stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes are commonly used as tracers to identify the sources and water rock reactions of geothermal water caprarelli et al 1997 palmer et al 2007 gu et al 2011 tan et al 2014 the relationship between δd and δ18o of collected samples is shown in fig 3 the hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes of all analyzed water samples are parallel with the global meteoric water line proposed by craig 1961 indicating that the recharge source of groundwater is mainly meteoric precipitation further the range of hydrogen and oxygen isotope of the hot springs δd ranges from 45 9 to 41 0 and δ18o ranges from 7 4 to 6 6 are covered by the range of the descending springs and surface water samples δd ranges from 53 0 to 35 2 and δ18o ranges from 7 7 to 5 7 suggesting that geothermal groundwater is recharged by local precipitation the results are consistent with that of the helium isotopes analysis implying that the geothermal groundwater is predominantly local rainfall origin 5 3 recharge elevation of geothermal groundwater in the process of atmospheric water vapor migration influenced by the temperature and distance the fractionation of hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes can produce some distribution characteristics such as latitude effect elevation effect etc clark and fritz 1997 fricke and o neil 1999 in order to study the recharge elevation of geothermal groundwater along the heyuan fault zone the recharge elevation equation han et al 2010 is established using the data of descending spring samples the precipitation data were not used because the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic characteristics changed with the water vapor sources of the precipitation rozanski et al 1993 hu et al 2014 especially in the tropical monsoon climate for example the typhoon rainfall sample hy 11 presents δd of 94 2 while non typhoon rainfall sample hy2 19 2 is 53 table 1 indicating that typhoon rainfall is significantly depleted in heavy isotopes in addition studies on the latitude effect of atmospheric precipitation in eastern china demonstrates that when latitude increases by 1 δd decreases by 1 84 yu et al 1987 statistical data also shows that between 20 n and 46 n each increase in degree of latitude results in a reduction of δd to reduce by 1 7 gu et al 2011 therefore a latitude effect correction is needed before analyzing the elevation effect taking 23 n as a reference the latitude effect correction equation is 8 δ d c 1 7 l 23 δ d where δ d c is the corrected value l is the latitude of sample the point of hy2 20 elevation of 733 m δd of 39 3 green hollow point is seriously deviated from the fitting line of other descending spring samples fig 5 that point is situated on a cloudy mountain peak where repeated evaporation and condensation resulting in heavy isotope enrichment locally this data point is not representative for the heyuan fault areas and it was discard when fitting the recharge elevation the latitude effect is not apparent in the heyuan fault area with a correlation coefficient of 0 48 fig 4 which is consistent with the findings of liu et al 2008 suggesting that the hydrogen isotopic fractionation in southern china is only mildly influenced by latitude however after the latitude correction the closer relationship between δd and elevation fig 5 implies that the latitude correction is still valid according to the fitting result the groundwater recharge elevation equation of the heyuan fault zone can be established as follows 9 alt 45 854 δ d 1438 4 where alt is the recharge elevation according to the equation each increase of 100 m in elevation will cause δd to reduce by about 2 18 this is consistent with the results of previous study about 2 100 m δd gradient in the low latitude areas of southern china gu et al 2011 using this equation the recharge elevation was estimated to be between 441 and 667 m table 4 considering the topography of the local area the main recharge area should be the hilly areas around the main fault and they are the granite areas furthermore considering the age of the geothermal waters discussed in section 5 4 they were recharged around 11 6 kyr bp the average of 9 9 kyr and 13 2 kyr and the isotopic values of precipitation are more depleted at that time comparing with that of present wang et al 2009 the isotopic values of the geothermal water suggest that the recharge elevations vary between 150 and 380 m under the paleo climate conditions which is consistent with the average elevation 290 m of granite zone along the heyuan main fault 5 4 hydrogeochemical thermometry and circulation depth the geothermometer in hydrogeology can be used to estimate reservoir temperatures of the geothermal groundwater muffler 1979 it is based on the chemical or isotopic composition of the hot groundwater and is controlled by temperature dependent water rock reactions muffler 1979 the na k geothermometer is suitable for the estimation of hot water above 180 c arnórsson 1985 the na k ca geothermometer is suitable for calcium rich groundwater fournier 1977 fournier and potter 1979 and na k ca mg geothermometer can be used for the estimation of low temperature 100 c groundwater giggenbach 1988 the condition for using the cation geothermometer requires that the water rock reaction is balanced giggenbach 1988 chandrajith et al 2013 according to the ternary diagram proposed by giggenbach fig 6 the hot spring water samples are all located in the immature zone meaning that it is not appropriate to use cation geothermometers to estimate the reservoir temperature of the heyuan fault zone besides cation geothermometers sio2 is another commonly used geothermometer the most four commonly used empirical formulas fournier 1977 verma and santoyo 1997 are conductive cooling without steam loss of quartz geothermometer 10 t 1 1309 5 19 logs 273 15 complete steam loss of quartz geothermometer 11 t 2 1522 5 75 logs 273 15 chalcedony geothermometer 12 t 3 1000 4 78 logs 273 15 improved silica geothermometer suitable for sio2 less than 295 mg l 13 t 4 44 119 0 24469 s 1 7414 10 4 79 305 logs in formula 10 13 the symbol s is the aqueous sio2 in mg l the chalcedony geothermometer is more suitable for low temperature geothermal water however when using the chalcedony geothermometer we obtain calculated results that are even lower than the sampling temperature e g hy3 10 2 table 5 the chalcedony geothermometer is therefore considered to be inappropriate for this study t4 is basically between t1 and t2 which is consistent with the fact that there is a partial steam loss during sampling t4 is also suitable for geothermal groundwater with silica concentration less than 295 mg l therefore t4 was chosen as the hot spring reservoir temperature in this study generally the higher the reservoir temperature the deeper the circulation depth of the geothermal groundwater the conventional formula for estimating the circulation depth of geothermal groundwater is as follows yang et al 2017 luo et al 2017 14 h t m t c k h where h is the groundwater circulation depth m k is the local geothermal gradient c m tm is the reservoir temperature c tc is the temperature of the normal temperature zone and local annual mean air temperature of 20 7 c was used h is the thickness of the constant zone of subsurface temperature and 15 m was used according to previous studies hu et al 2001 the geothermal heat flow data near the heyuan area is 61 6 mw m2 wengyuan county guangdong and 67 6 mw m2 lufeng county guangdong and the corresponding geothermal gradient is 19 2 c km and 23 0 c km respectively with an average value of 21 1 c km on the basis of this estimation the circulation depth of the geothermal groundwater of the heyuan fault zone ranges from 2971 m to 6468 m table 5 and the hot spring hy2 12 2 has the deepest circulation depth 5 5 groundwater age groundwater age was estimated using radio active carbon 14 dating technique the dissolution of inactive carbon dead carbon in geothermal groundwater is inevitable and this may significantly increase the calculated groundwater ages therefore dead carbon correction is necessary for a more accurate geothermal groundwater age estimation fontes and garnier 1979 there are many models available for dead carbon correction in carbon 14 dating technique and the improved tamers geochemical model and pearson isotope hybrid model are applied in this study the tamers model can make correction of the dead carbon which enters groundwater when co2 in groundwater exchanges with caco3 in closed systems tamers 1975 however because this model ignores other aggressive sources such as organic acids and sulfuric acid etc therefore if the system is not sealing well the error can be large gu et al 2011 as the tamers model is consistent with the first half of the fontes garnier model and the latter can well consider other sources of erosion fontes and garnier 1979 so the two models are combined together to carry out dead carbon correction in this study 15 a 0 1 c s c t a g c s c t a s 16 c s m c a 2 m m g 2 m s o 4 2 1 2 mn a m k m c l m n o 3 17 c t m c o 3 2 m c o 2 m h c o 3 where a 0 is the initial concentration of 14c in groundwater dic cs is the concentration of solid derived carbon such as carbonate in groundwater ct is the concentration of total carbon in groundwater ag is the concentration of 14c in soil co2 and is generally 100 5 pmc clark and fritz 1997 as is the 14c concentration of the old solid carbonate i e dead carbon in the surrounding rock and since its age is much greater than that of the carbon 14 dating it can be regarded as 14c had completely decayed and 0 pmc is used since δ13c values of inorganic carbon between soil co2 and carbonate source are significantly different δ13c data can be used to trace the mixture of 14c and explain the evolution of groundwater mook et al 1974 accordingly pearson 1965 proposed a correction equation based on the δ13c 18 a 0 δ t δ s δ g δ s a g a s a s where a 0 is the initial 14c concentration of groundwater dic δt represents the total amount of 13c in groundwater dic δs represents the amount of 13c from

carbonate i e dead carbon in the surrounding rock and generally taking to be 0 comparing the results of dates of the two models table 2 the ages are similar and the dating results are reasonable if we take the average age as the groundwater age the ages are generally from 9 9 to 12 3 kyr bp except for the hot spring hy2 22 with the much younger age of 3 7 kyr this spring is located in the granite body cracks and exposes naturally and this can cause the mixing of geothermal groundwater with significant amount of modern groundwater leading to the much younger age 5 6 mixing of geothermal groundwater with cold groundwater the estimated reservoir temperature of hot springs along the heyuan fault zone are quite different ranging from 83 to 157 c that may be caused by different mixing ratio of cold non geothermal water moreover there are many fractures in the fault zone and hence mixing with cold groundwater is almost unavoidable when the geothermal groundwater comes to the surface this could be one of the most important mechanisms for the formation of low to medium temperature geothermal springs along this fault zone groundwater with the highest temperature was taken as the geothermal groundwater end member and the shallow groundwater was taken as cold groundwater end member the two end members have distinct characteristics in composition the geothermal groundwater end member contains high sio2 concentration while the shallow cold groundwater end member generally contains low sio2 concentration the geothermal groundwater end member is depleted in heavy isotope deuterium while the shallow cold groundwater end member is enriched in heavy isotope deuterium obvious correlations between the exposed temperature and sio2 concentration as well as between the exposed temperature and deuterium were identified for hot springs in the heyuan fault zone fig 7 this suggests that the mixing of cold water with the geothermal groundwater is the major factor this is consistent with the major ions types of the groundwater in the heyuan fault zone there is an obvious difference between the chemical types of the hot springs and the shallow cold groundwater the former is mainly hco3 na k type while the latter are mostly hco3 ca type moreover for most of the hot springs in the heyuan fault zone the more percentage of ca2 it contains the lower temperature it has figs 2 8 the enriched na and k in hot groundwater is most likely from the decomposition of albite and k feldspar in granite and the reactions processes are as follows appelo and postma 2005 2 na alsi 3 o 8 2 h 9 h 2 o 2 na al 2 si 2 o 5 oh 4 4 h 4 sio 4 2 k alsi 3 o 8 2 h 9 h 2 o 2 k al 2 si 2 o 5 oh 4 4 h 4 sio 4 however in the near surface there are abundant calcium rich biological remains and their decomposition as well as cation exchange processes between na k and ca could cause the significant enrichment of ca in the shallow non hot groundwater however the hot spring hy01 is an exception which has the lowest proportion of ca2 but not the highest temperature at the same time since this spring is located far away from the heyuan fault the circulation path could be different from the other hot springs near the main fault this spring probably experienced relatively slow ascent processes and may be affected more by other processes than the mixing with shallow infiltrated meteoric water the well hy2 12 2 has the highest temperature and the highest sio2 concentration and is considered to be the thermal groundwater end member the xinfengjiang reservoir is the largest reservoir of the guangdong province emergence of seismic activity shortly after construction of the reservoir has proven water pressure and surface water infiltration go hand in hand the reservoir water is here considered as the cold water end member for the mixing process on the basis of the binary water source hybrid formula gu et al 2011 the mixing ration of cold water can be estimated as follows 19 f d δ d w δ d t δ d c δ d t where f d is the cold water mixing fraction calculated from the deuterium isotope δ d w is the measured deuterium isotope of each hot spring sample δ d t is the deuterium isotope of thermal groundwater end member resulting in 45 9 and δ d c is the deuterium isotope of cold water end member resulting in 35 7 the calculation results are shown in table 6 the cold water mixing fractions range from 17 to 48 the result of the mixing fractions calculation suggests that the previously calculated recharge elevation and reservoir temperature of most of the hot springs in the heyuan fault zone are underestimated because mixing with cold shallow groundwater was not considered and even for the hot spring end member hy2 12 2 it is just the closest to the real reservoir conditions 5 7 conceptual model of the geothermal groundwater circulation path this study has shown that the geothermal water recharge area of the heyuan fault zone is local and the recharge elevation ranges from 440 m to 670 m the heyuan fault is a normal fault with gentle dip which can be used as a fast migration channel for geothermal water however at the later period of the fault formation silicification occurred at the top of the foot wall of the fault forming silicified rocks in excess of 30 m thickness this would block the migration of thermal water to the surface therefore the geothermal groundwater of the foot wall often cannot reach into the fast migration channel and it loses heat gradually during the process of slow upwards migration before it arrives up to the surface the thermal groundwater may have cooled down to ambient temperature and this could be the main reason for the lower occurrence of hot spring activity in the foot wall area of the heyuan fault zone on the other hand the geothermal groundwater in the hanging wall can quickly rise along the fault and finally flow out of the land surface fig 9 therefore the circulation path of the geothermal water in the heyuan fault zone is proposed to be locked to the hanging wall of the fault zone which is subject to precipitation recharge geothermal waters from a crustal source are proposed to ascend along the main fault finally appearing at the surface as hot springs in favorable positions such as tectonic fracture zone secondary fault crossing artificial drilling etc 6 conclusion the hot springs of the heyuan fault zone are low to medium temperature 150 c most of the hot spring water is slightly alkaline the water chemistry type of hot springs is mainly hco3 na k type while the lower temperature hot spring contains relatively higher ca2 the shallow groundwater and the surface water are mostly hco3 ca type and only several water samples are hco3 na k ca type the helium isotope data indicates crustal source characteristics and eliminates the possibility of inter basin migration of the hydrothermal groundwater flows combined with stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes the main recharge source of thermal groundwater is constrained to local meteoric water with a recharge elevation of 440 670 m and covering the hilly areas in the hanging wall of the heyuan main fault in consideration of the thermal groundwater age and the palaeo climate the recharge elevations are estimated to range from 150 to 380 m which suggest that the granite zone is the main recharge area of thermal groundwater in heyuan fault zone the highest reservoir temperature of hot spring water in the heyuan fault zone is up to 157 c calculated using sio2 geothermometer the corresponding circulation depth is estimated to be about 6500 m however because of the possibility of mixing with cold water those results might be underestimated according to the 14c dating the circulation times of the thermal groundwater are mostly between 9 9 kyr and 12 3 kyr bp which can be linked to the late last glacial maximum and the early post glacial period due to the silicified layer in the fault planes the main hot water is from the hanging wall where the thermal groundwater can ascend along the main fault quickly and forms hot springs acknowledgements this study is supported financially by

6891,medium low temperature geothermal resources are abundant in southern china but their heat source and link to fault zones is poorly understood consequently geothermal energy is only used at small scale in order to broaden the footprint of geothermal energy use in southern china it is first necessary to understand and track the geothermal groundwater circulation pattern associated with fault zones the heyuan fault zone serves as a typical medium low temperature geothermal system of south china here we show that the geothermal groundwater circulation pattern can be traced by using stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes helium and neon isotopes carbon 13 and carbon 14 as well as hydrochemical parameters the results show that in the heyuan fault zone the main hydrochemical type of the hot springs is hco3 na k while the shallow cold groundwater is mainly enriched in hco3 ca the results of the helium isotope and neon isotope indicate that the geothermal groundwater of this area is derived from the crust thus excluding the possibility of extremely deep paths of groundwater tapping into mantle helium sources furthermore the characteristics of the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes imply that geothermal groundwater is of local meteoric origin and the recharge area located at the hilly area of the hanging wall of the heyuan main fault with the recharge elevations ranging from about 440 m to 670 m the hot spring geothermometer shows that the highest reservoir temperature is about 157 c and the deepest circulation depth is about 6500 m carbon 14 isotope age dating suggests that the geothermal groundwater ages are mostly from 9 9 kyr bp to 12 3 kyr bp according to the geological structural characteristics of the study area the main upward channel for geothermal groundwater is the heyuan main fault generally the hot springs in this area are mixed with shallow cold groundwater and surface water which raises the ratio of the ca2 in water and dilutes the heavy hydrogen and oxygen isotopes keywords geothermal springs isotopes geothermometer groundwater mixing heyuan fault 1 introduction china has invested significantly into developing future clean energy sources the interest in exploiting geothermal resources has recently grown substantially lin et al 2013 chen et al 2015a zhou et al 2015 south china is one of the most developed industrial precinct in china and has a particularly high demand in developing its abundant geothermal resources geothermal groundwater in south china mainly ranges from low to medium temperature 150 c along fault zones zhou et al 2008 yuan 2013 studying the circulation pattern of the geothermal groundwater in the fault zones of south china is crucial for understanding and exploiting geothermal and geothermal groundwater resources in this region there are abundant hot springs in the guangdong province of south china mainly distributed along with the ne striking faults the heyuan fault is one of the typical ne striking deep faults in south china and together with the nw striking faults dividing the guangdong province into many small tectonic basins chen et al 2014 although the hot springs in the heyuan fault zone have been used for hundreds of years since the qin dynasty 3rd century bce studies about this geothermal groundwater system has been still very limited only a few geothermal groundwater studies are available in this area discussing about the chemical and isotopic characteristics as well as recharge sources of the geothermal groundwater mao et al 2015 yuan 2013 zhou et al 2008 furthermore groundwater circulation in the heyuan fault zone has implications for hazard assessments because of the well known series of reservoir induced seismicity in the heyuan fault zone qiu and fenton 2015 the reduction in temperature of geothermally derived groundwater in the hydrothermal spring system of the fault zones can either be caused by slow ascent of geothermal groundwater to land surface or through mixing of deep geothermal groundwater with shallow infiltrated meteoric water white 1968 wang 1996 moeck 2014 afsin et al 2014 mixing with shallow infiltrated meteoric water can significantly alter the hydrochemistry and isotopic characteristics of geothermal groundwater and therefore results in uncertainty in the interpretation of hydro geochemical results of geothermal groundwater capaccioni et al 2011 afsin et al 2014 however the importance of the mixing processes has not been considered and is not well understood in hydrothermal spring studies of fault zones of south china this study aims to characterize the circulation processes of the hydrothermal spring system of the heyuan fault zone including the recharge source recharge elevation reservoir temperature circulation depth and age of geothermal groundwater etc the significances of the mixing of deep geothermal groundwater with shallow infiltrated meteoric water are identified and discussed multiple environmental isotopes including stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes δd and δ18o helium isotopes 3he 4he and neon isotope 4he 20ne carbon isotopes δ14c and δ13c as well as geothermometers are analyzed in this paper 2 geological and hydrological setting the heyuan fault zone is located in the northeast of the guangdong province south china fig 1 the study area is located between e114 14 and e115 36 and between n23 10 and n24 27 and belongs to the hilly area as a subtropical monsoon climate area it is hot and humid in summer with a lot of typhoons dry and relatively cold in winter the mean annual temperature is 20 7 c with the lowest mean monthly temperature of 11 6 c in january and the highest mean monthly temperature of 28 0 c in july the mean annual rainfall is about 1768 mm the main river of this region is the dongjiang river which flows through heyuan from northeast to southwest roughly parallel with the heyuan main fault fig 1 the xing fengjiang reservoir is located at the west side footwall of the main fault fig 1 it is the largest reservoir in guangdong province with the total water area of 370 km2 and the total capacity around 13 9 billion m3 the strata outcropping around the fault zone are mainly the middle and late jurassic yanshanian biotite granite and cretaceous paleogene red layer deposits ling and zhang 2002 the ne striking heyuan fault is the main fault in the study area with a length of about 400 km fig 1 the fault had been activated several times in the geological past mainly in the mesozoic yanshan tectonic period and it is interpreted as a normal fault from the neogene to the present this fault is still active appearing to be sinistral a strike slip normal fault in the plan the hanging wall of the fault consists of the cretaceous paleogene red layer and the footwall of the yanshanian biotite granite the footwall granite along the fault zone was obviously silicified with quartz reef belt thickness up to 30 m superimposing on mylonitized granite zou et al 2010 3 sampling and analysis methods to study the geothermal groundwater of the heyuan fault zone 43 water samples were collected during august to october in the year 2016 including 10 hot spring samples 17 ascending spring samples 10 descending spring samples 2 reservoir samples 2 river samples and 2 precipitation samples ascending springs also called artesian springs are those discharge under pressure due to confined conditions while descending springs also called gravity springs are the springs that emerge under unconfined conditions kresic 2010 in the field the springs that water flows upward at the point where it emerges were identified as ascending springs and the others were descending springs temperature ph electrical conductivity ec oxidation reduction potential orp total

alkalinity 40 mg l or 1 6 n sulfuric acid alkalinity 40 mg l additionally the sio2 concentration of the water samples were also measured in the filed using a silica meter hanna hi96770 samples for major ion analyses were filtered using 0 22 μm membrane and then collected into 125 ml hdpe bottles samples for δd and δ18o analyses were collected directly into 250 ml glass bottles samples for 14c analysis were collected directly into 500 ml hdpe bottles gas samples for helium isotope analysis were collected into glass bottles when sampling gas the bottles were totally immersed into water and then corked underwater as soon as the collected gas volume was about 20 ml and kept upside down until analyzing after sampling major ions were determined using the ion chromatograph dionex ics 900 usa at the laboratory of school of earth sciences and engineering sun yat sen university sysu for analysis of the anions the eluent contained 4 5 mm na2co3 0 8 mm nahco3 for analysis of the cations the eluent was 20 mm methane sulphonic acid both of eluents were pumped at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 the standards of ions were used in calibrations to ensure the quality of analysis and the blank samples show concentrations below limit of detection for each ion analysis the goodness of fit r2 for linear regression of five point calibration data was over 0 999 and the relative standard deviation of major ions analysis are less than 2 the δd and δ18o of water samples were analyzed using δd δ18o ultra high precision isotopic water analyzer picarro l2130 i usa at school of environmental sciences and engineering of sysu and expressed as deviation relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow standard the applied calibration standards of the isotopes were range from 28 52 to 142 94 for δdv smow and from 4 42 to 18 86 for δ18ov smow with analytical precision of 0 2 and 2 respectively the radioactive carbon isotope 14c was determined using the standard accelerator mass spectrometry ams method in the laboratory of beta analytic inc miami usa and the measured uncertainty was less than 0 1 percent modern carbon pmc the helium isotope of the gas samples was determined adopting the method described by cao et al 2014 using noblesse multi collector noble gas mass spectrometer nu instruments uk in lanzhou institute of geology chinese academy of sciences and the relative standard deviation is less than 6 10 4 results 4 1 hydrogeochemical characteristics the temperature of the hot springs varied from 31 3 c to 76 6 c while the temperature of the ascending springs varied from 21 9 to 29 6 c the temperature of the descending springs varied from 19 6 to 26 9 c and temperature of the reservoir water is about 27 c table 1 the samples of hot springs are mostly alkalescent with the highest ph of 8 37 except for hy2 13 being alkalescent all the non thermal groundwater samples are neutral or weakly acid while the reservoir water is weakly alkaline the electrical conductivity ec of the hot springs ranges from 175 7 μs cm to 1483 μs cm while the ec of the non thermal groundwater is substantially less than 200 μs cm most of which is less than 100 μs cm the silica concentrations in the hot water samples are relatively high ranging from 67 to 133 mg l except that the hy3 10 2 is only 32 mg l the non thermal groundwater samples are generally low in silica concentrations varying from 10 to 43 mg l except that hy2 13 has 68 mg l reservoir water sample contains the lowest silica only 9 mg l most of the water samples contain relatively abundant hco 3 however some non thermal groundwater samples are different for samples hy2 01 hy 2 05 and hy2 25 their ph are so low 4 55 5 33 that the hco 3 concentrations are unable to be detected by titration for samples hy2 23 and hy3 02 2 a relatively low ph 5 51 and 5 7 and high no 3 42 3 and 14 6 mg l is measured for the relative high nitrate no 3 10 mg l samples hy2 01 hy2 08 hy2 21 hy2 23 hy3 02 2 all of them are non thermal groundwater samples and have high orp values from 229 mv to 339 mv which indicate oxidizing conditions the samples with elevated cl cl 8 mg l usually contain elevated so 4 2 so 4 2 10 mg l and those samples contain both hot spring samples hy 01 hy2 12 2 hy2 22 hy3 01 2 hy3 02 1 hy3 05 hy3 06 hy3 10 1 and non thermal groundwater samples hy2 01 hy2 08 hy2 13 hy2 21 hy2 23 hy2 24 and their orp values vary widely from 65 mv to 339 mv suggesting there is no obvious correlation between orp values and the concentrations of cl and so 4 2 in addition the distribution characteristics of no 3 suggest it mainly from the oxidizing environment near the ground surface and the distribution characteristics of elevated cl and so 4 2 may indicate multi sources for them the cations in the hot spring samples are mostly na and k less ca 2 and a few mg 2 at the same time the non thermal water samples have more ca 2 and mg 2 and cations of some samples are dominated by ca 2 such as the reservoir samples fig 2 based on the composition of the major ions the water chemistry types of the samples can be classified as follows hot springs are mainly hco3 na k type and a few are hco3 na k ca type the ascending springs and descending springs are mainly hco3 ca type with some are hco3 na k ca type and a few are cl no3 ca type the reservoir samples are hco3 ca type 4 2 hydrogen and oxygen isotopes results of δ18o and δd of the hot spring samples range from 6 6 to 7 4 and from 41 0 to 45 9 respectively values of δ18o and δd in the non thermal groundwater samples including samples from ascending descending springs range from 5 7 to 7 4 and from 35 2 to 46 3 respectively table 1 the average δ18o and δd values of the reservoir water samples are 5 7 and 35 7 respectively compared to that of the river samples which range from 6 8 to 7 0 and from 41 6 to 44 1 for δ18o and δd respectively the reservoir water samples are relatively enriched in heavy hydrogen and oxygen isotopes this difference may be because of the evaporation effect however considering that the enrichment is no larger than 2 of δ18o and 10 of δd the evaporation effect is quite small clark 2015 the lowest δ18o and δd isotope values were found in rainwater for example 7 7 and 53 0 hy2 19 2 13 6 and 94 2 hy 11 the isotopic differences between the two precipitation events were significant and this kind of differences are common for single precipitation events event at the same place besides one of them was collected in the dry season and the other one was collected during a typhoon in the wet season 4 3 carbon isotopes of hot springs the results of 14c for dissolved inorganic carbon dic in hot groundwater samples are shown in table 2 according to the half life formula 1 of radioactive carbon 14 the apparent groundwater ages range from 7560 yr bp to 20 950 yr bp table 2 however considering the carbon exchange between dic of the groundwater and the dead carbon the dead carbon refers to the inactive carbon that has been buried for long time and the 14c content has decayed to zero fontes and garnier 1979 of the surrounding rock a correction analysis was necessary and the geothermal age should be estimated by 1 t τ log 2 l o g a 0 a t where τ is the half life of 14c taken 5730 years godwin 1962 a0 is the initial 14c concentration of dic in groundwater taken 102 3 pmc at is the 14c residual concentration of the dic in groundwater samples obtained from the test data 4 4 helium and neon isotopes of hot springs the r ra ratio is commonly used to represent the composition of helium isotopes where the r represents 3he 4he value of the sample and the ra represents the 3he 4he value of atmosphere which is 1 4 10 6 sun et al 2016 the tested data of the helium and neon isotopes are shown in table 3 5 discussions 5 1 identification of the relationship between thermal groundwater and mantle source as a deep fault zone the heyuan fault zone may provide an access to deep circulation of the geothermal groundwater groundwater is likely to take the deep fault zone as a channel to achieve migration over hundreds of kilometers or even thousands of kilometers and this kind of water is often enriched with mantle derived volatiles such as mantle helium chen et al 2012 chen and jiang 2015b to constrain the sources of the geothermal groundwater in the heyuan fault zone analyses of the helium isotopes were conducted the 3he 4he ratios are commonly higher 8 1 ra in mantle gas and lower 0 01 ra in the crust due to the enrichment of uranium and thorium in the crust which can produce 4he by radiation decay kurz et al 1982 in addition helium is a noble gas and inert for chemical reactions therefore helium isotopes are often used as tracers to determine the sources and evolution of subsurface fluids hoke et al 2000 it is generally assumed that when r ra 1 the source of helium in the sample is mainly from the mantle when r ra 1 helium in the sample is mainly from the crust source andrews 1985 zhao et al 2012 ratios of r ra for hot spring samples of the heyuan fault zone range from 0 35 to 0 48 and can generally be considered as dominated by a crustal source combining neon isotope data the helium source ratios of the hot spring gas can be further calculated using the equations proposed by sano and wakita 1985 2 3 he 4 he s 3 he 4 he a a 3 he 4 he m m 3 he 4 he c c 3 1 4 he 20 ne s a 4 he 20 ne a m 4 he 20 ne m c 4 he 20 ne c 4 a m c 1 where a m and c respectively represent source ratio of the atmosphere mantle and crust the 3he 4he s and 4he 20ne s represent the isotopes ratios of samples and the other values of parameters are as follows zhao et al 2012 3 he 4 he a 1 4 10 6 4 he 20 ne a 0 318 3 he 4 he m 1 1 10 5 4 he 20 ne m 1000 3 he 4 he c 1 5 10 8 4 he 20 ne c 1000 substituting them into the equations one obtains 5 a 0 318 4 he 20 ne s 0 318 1000 0 318 6 m 1 1 0 96 a 3 he 4 he s 10 5 1 0985 7 c 1 a m the calculated proportions of helium sources table 3 show that more than 92 of the hot spring helium is from crustal sources which suggests that the geothermal groundwater is unrelated to mantle materials and the recharge area should not be far away 5 2 recharge sources of geothermal groundwater in the geothermal groundwater circulation system stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes are commonly used as tracers to identify the sources and water rock reactions of geothermal water caprarelli et al 1997 palmer et al 2007 gu et al 2011 tan et al 2014 the relationship between δd and δ18o of collected samples is shown in fig 3 the hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes of all analyzed water samples are parallel with the global meteoric water line proposed by craig 1961 indicating that the recharge source of groundwater is mainly meteoric precipitation further the range of hydrogen and oxygen isotope of the hot springs δd ranges from 45 9 to 41 0 and δ18o ranges from 7 4 to 6 6 are covered by the range of the descending springs and surface water samples δd ranges from 53 0 to 35 2 and δ18o ranges from 7 7 to 5 7 suggesting that geothermal groundwater is recharged by local precipitation the results are consistent with that of the helium isotopes analysis implying that the geothermal groundwater is predominantly local rainfall origin 5 3 recharge elevation of geothermal groundwater in the process of atmospheric water vapor migration influenced by the temperature and distance the fractionation of hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes can produce some distribution characteristics such as latitude effect elevation effect etc clark and fritz 1997 fricke and o neil 1999 in order to study the recharge elevation of geothermal groundwater along the heyuan fault zone the recharge elevation equation han et al 2010 is established using the data of descending spring samples the precipitation data were not used because the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic characteristics changed with the water vapor sources of the precipitation rozanski et al 1993 hu et al 2014 especially in the tropical monsoon climate for example the typhoon rainfall sample hy 11 presents δd of 94 2 while non typhoon rainfall sample hy2 19 2 is 53 table 1 indicating that typhoon rainfall is significantly depleted in heavy isotopes in addition studies on the latitude effect of atmospheric precipitation in eastern china demonstrates that when latitude increases by 1 δd decreases by 1 84 yu et al 1987 statistical data also shows that between 20 n and 46 n each increase in degree of latitude results in a reduction of δd to reduce by 1 7 gu et al 2011 therefore a latitude effect correction is needed before analyzing the elevation effect taking 23 n as a reference the latitude effect correction equation is 8 δ d c 1 7 l 23 δ d where δ d c is the corrected value l is the latitude of sample the point of hy2 20 elevation of 733 m δd of 39 3 green hollow point is seriously deviated from the fitting line of other descending spring samples fig 5 that point is situated on a cloudy mountain peak where repeated evaporation and condensation resulting in heavy isotope enrichment locally this data point is not representative for the heyuan fault areas and it was discard when fitting the recharge elevation the latitude effect is not apparent in the heyuan fault area with a correlation coefficient of 0 48 fig 4 which is consistent with the findings of liu et al 2008 suggesting that the hydrogen isotopic fractionation in southern china is only mildly influenced by latitude however after the latitude correction the closer relationship between δd and elevation fig 5 implies that the latitude correction is still valid according to the fitting result the groundwater recharge elevation equation of the heyuan fault zone can be established as follows 9 alt 45 854 δ d 1438 4 where alt is the recharge elevation according to the equation each increase of 100 m in elevation will cause δd to reduce by about 2 18 this is consistent with the results of previous study about 2 100 m δd gradient in the low latitude areas of southern china gu et al 2011 using this equation the recharge elevation was estimated to be between 441 and 667 m table 4 considering the topography of the local area the main recharge area should be the hilly areas around the main fault and they are the granite areas furthermore considering the age of the geothermal waters discussed in section 5 4 they were recharged around 11 6 kyr bp the average of 9 9 kyr and 13 2 kyr and the isotopic values of precipitation are more depleted at that time comparing with that of present wang et al 2009 the isotopic values of the geothermal water suggest that the recharge elevations vary between 150 and 380 m under the paleo climate conditions which is consistent with the average elevation 290 m of granite zone along the heyuan main fault 5 4 hydrogeochemical thermometry and circulation depth the geothermometer in hydrogeology can be used to estimate reservoir temperatures of the geothermal groundwater muffler 1979 it is based on the chemical or isotopic composition of the hot groundwater and is controlled by temperature dependent water rock reactions muffler 1979 the na k geothermometer is suitable for the estimation of hot water above 180 c arnórsson 1985 the na k ca geothermometer is suitable for calcium rich groundwater fournier 1977 fournier and potter 1979 and na k ca mg geothermometer can be used for the estimation of low temperature 100 c groundwater giggenbach 1988 the condition for using the cation geothermometer requires that the water rock reaction is balanced giggenbach 1988 chandrajith et al 2013 according to the ternary diagram proposed by giggenbach fig 6 the hot spring water samples are all located in the immature zone meaning that it is not appropriate to use cation geothermometers to estimate the reservoir temperature of the heyuan fault zone besides cation geothermometers sio2 is another commonly used geothermometer the most four commonly used empirical formulas fournier 1977 verma and santoyo 1997 are conductive cooling

geothermometer is more suitable for low temperature geothermal water however when using the chalcedony geothermometer we obtain calculated results that are even lower than the sampling temperature e g hy3 10 2 table 5 the chalcedony geothermometer is therefore considered to be inappropriate for this study t4 is basically between t1 and t2 which is consistent with the fact that there is a partial steam loss during sampling t4 is also suitable for geothermal groundwater with silica concentration less than 295 mg l therefore t4 was chosen as the hot spring reservoir temperature in this study generally the higher the reservoir temperature the deeper the circulation depth of the geothermal groundwater the conventional formula for estimating the circulation depth of geothermal groundwater is as follows yang et al 2017 luo et al 2017 14 h t m t c k h where h is the groundwater circulation depth m k is the local geothermal gradient c m tm is the reservoir temperature c tc is the temperature of the normal temperature zone and local annual mean air temperature of 20 7 c was used h is the thickness of the constant zone of subsurface temperature and 15 m was used according to previous studies hu et al 2001 the geothermal heat flow data near the heyuan area is 61 6 mw m2 wengyuan county guangdong and 67 6 mw m2 lufeng county guangdong and the corresponding geothermal gradient is 19 2 c km and 23 0 c km respectively with an average value of 21 1 c km on the basis of this estimation the circulation depth of the geothermal groundwater of the heyuan fault zone ranges from 2971 m to 6468 m table 5 and the hot spring hy2 12 2 has the deepest circulation depth 5 5 groundwater age groundwater age was estimated using radio active carbon 14 dating technique the dissolution of inactive carbon dead carbon in geothermal groundwater is inevitable and this may significantly increase the calculated groundwater ages therefore dead carbon correction is necessary for a more accurate geothermal groundwater age estimation fontes and garnier 1979 there are many models available for dead carbon correction in carbon 14 dating technique and the improved tamers geochemical model and pearson isotope hybrid model are applied in this study the tamers model can make correction of the dead carbon which enters groundwater when co2 in groundwater exchanges with caco3 in closed systems tamers 1975 however because this model ignores other aggressive sources such as organic acids and sulfuric acid etc therefore if the system is not sealing well the error can be large gu et al 2011 as the tamers model is consistent with the first half of the fontes garnier model and the latter can well consider other sources of erosion fontes and garnier 1979 so the two models are combined together to carry out dead carbon correction in this study 15 a 0 1 c s c t a g c s c t a s 16 c s m c a 2 m m g 2 m s o 4 2 1 2 mn a m k m c l m n o 3 17 c t m c o 3 2 m c o 2 m h c o 3 where a 0 is the initial concentration of 14c in groundwater dic cs is the concentration of solid derived carbon such as carbonate in groundwater ct is the concentration of total carbon in groundwater ag is the concentration of 14c in soil co2 and is generally 100 5 pmc clark and fritz 1997 as is the 14c concentration of the old solid carbonate i e dead carbon in the surrounding rock and since its age is much greater than that of the carbon 14 dating it can be regarded as 14c had completely decayed and 0 pmc is used since δ13c values of inorganic carbon between soil co2 and carbonate source are significantly different δ13c data can be used to trace the mixture of 14c and explain the evolution of groundwater mook et al 1974 accordingly pearson 1965 proposed a correction equation based on the

carbonate i e dead carbon in the surrounding rock and generally taking to be 0 comparing the results of dates of the two models table 2 the ages are similar and the dating results are reasonable if we take the average age as the groundwater age the ages are generally from 9 9 to 12 3 kyr bp except for the hot spring hy2 22 with the much younger age of 3 7 kyr this spring is located in the granite body cracks and exposes naturally and this can cause the mixing of geothermal groundwater with significant amount of modern groundwater leading to the much younger age 5 6 mixing of geothermal groundwater with cold groundwater the estimated reservoir temperature of hot springs along the heyuan fault zone are quite different ranging from 83 to 157 c that may be caused by different mixing ratio of cold non geothermal water moreover there are many fractures in the fault zone and hence mixing with cold groundwater is almost unavoidable when the geothermal groundwater comes to the surface this could be one of the most important mechanisms for the formation of low to medium temperature geothermal springs along this fault zone groundwater with the highest temperature was taken as the geothermal groundwater end member and the shallow groundwater was taken as cold groundwater end member the two end members have distinct characteristics in composition the geothermal groundwater end member contains high sio2 concentration while the shallow cold groundwater end member generally contains low sio2 concentration the geothermal groundwater end member is depleted in heavy isotope deuterium while the shallow cold groundwater end member is enriched in heavy isotope deuterium obvious correlations between the exposed temperature and sio2 concentration as well as between the exposed temperature and deuterium were identified for hot springs in the heyuan fault zone fig 7 this suggests that the mixing of cold water with the geothermal groundwater is the major factor this is consistent with the major ions types of the groundwater in the heyuan fault zone there is an obvious difference between the chemical types of the hot springs and the shallow cold groundwater the former is mainly hco3 na k type while the latter are mostly hco3 ca type moreover for most of the hot springs in the heyuan fault zone the more percentage of ca2 it contains the lower temperature it has figs 2 8 the enriched na and k in hot groundwater is most likely from the decomposition of albite and k feldspar in granite and the reactions processes are as follows appelo and postma 2005 2 na alsi 3 o 8 2 h 9 h 2 o 2 na al 2 si 2 o 5 oh 4 4 h 4 sio 4 2 k alsi 3 o 8 2 h 9 h 2 o 2 k al 2 si 2 o 5 oh 4 4 h 4 sio 4 however in the near surface there are abundant calcium rich biological remains and their decomposition as well as cation exchange processes between na k and ca could cause the significant enrichment of ca in the shallow non hot groundwater however the hot spring hy01 is an exception which has the lowest proportion of ca2 but not the highest temperature at the same time since this spring is located far away from the heyuan fault the circulation path could be different from the other hot springs near the main fault this spring probably experienced relatively slow ascent processes and may be affected more by other processes than the mixing with shallow infiltrated meteoric water the well hy2 12 2 has the highest temperature and the highest sio2 concentration and is considered to be the thermal groundwater end member the xinfengjiang reservoir is the largest reservoir of the guangdong province emergence of seismic activity shortly after construction of the reservoir has proven water pressure and surface water infiltration go hand in hand the reservoir water is here considered as the cold water end member for the mixing process on the basis of the binary water source hybrid formula gu et al 2011 the mixing ration of cold water can be estimated as follows 19 f d δ d w δ d t δ d c δ d t where f d is the cold water mixing fraction calculated from the deuterium isotope δ d w is the measured deuterium isotope of each hot spring sample δ d t is the deuterium isotope of thermal groundwater end member resulting in 45 9 and δ d c is the deuterium isotope of cold water end member resulting in 35 7 the calculation results are shown in table 6 the cold water mixing fractions range from 17 to 48 the result of the mixing fractions calculation suggests that the previously calculated recharge elevation and reservoir temperature of most of the hot springs in the heyuan fault zone are underestimated because mixing with cold shallow groundwater was not considered and even for the hot spring end member hy2 12 2 it is just the closest to the real reservoir conditions 5 7 conceptual model of the geothermal groundwater circulation path this study has shown that the geothermal water recharge area of the heyuan fault zone is local and the recharge elevation ranges from 440 m to 670 m the heyuan fault is a normal fault with gentle dip which can be used as a fast migration channel for geothermal water however at the later period of the fault formation silicification occurred at the top of the foot wall of the fault forming silicified rocks in excess of 30 m thickness this would block the migration of thermal water to the surface therefore the geothermal groundwater of the foot wall often cannot reach into the fast migration channel and it loses heat gradually during the process of slow upwards migration before it arrives up to the surface the thermal groundwater may have cooled down to ambient temperature and this could be the main reason for the lower occurrence of hot spring activity in the foot wall area of the heyuan fault zone on the other hand the geothermal groundwater in the hanging wall can quickly rise along the fault and finally flow out of the land surface fig 9 therefore the circulation path of the geothermal water in the heyuan fault zone is proposed to be locked to the hanging wall of the fault zone which is subject to precipitation recharge geothermal waters from a crustal source are proposed to ascend along the main fault finally appearing at the surface as hot springs in favorable positions such as tectonic fracture zone secondary fault crossing artificial drilling etc 6 conclusion the hot springs of the heyuan fault zone are low to medium temperature 150 c most of the hot spring water is slightly alkaline the water chemistry type of hot springs is mainly hco3 na k type while the lower temperature hot spring contains relatively higher ca2 the shallow groundwater and the surface water are mostly hco3 ca type and only several water samples are hco3 na k ca type the helium isotope data indicates crustal source characteristics and eliminates the possibility of inter basin migration of the hydrothermal groundwater flows combined with stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes the main recharge source of thermal groundwater is constrained to local meteoric water with a recharge elevation of 440 670 m and covering the hilly areas in the hanging wall of the heyuan main fault in consideration of the thermal groundwater age and the palaeo climate the recharge elevations are estimated to range from 150 to 380 m which suggest that the granite zone is the main recharge area of thermal groundwater in heyuan fault zone the highest reservoir temperature of hot spring water in the heyuan fault zone is up to 157 c calculated using sio2 geothermometer the corresponding circulation depth is estimated to be about 6500 m however because of the possibility of mixing with cold water those results might be underestimated according to the 14c dating the circulation times of the thermal groundwater are mostly between 9 9 kyr and 12 3 kyr bp which can be linked to the late last glacial maximum and the early post glacial period due to the silicified layer in the fault planes the main hot water is from the hanging wall where the thermal groundwater can ascend along the main fault quickly and forms hot springs acknowledgements this study is supported financially by

6892,intertidal environments including bare mudflats tidal creeks and vegetated salt marshes are of significant physical and ecological importance in estuaries their morphodynamics are closely linked by mudflats and creek networks understanding water motion and sediment transport in mudflats and tidal creeks is fundamental to understand intertidal morphodynamics in intertidal environments to explore dynamic interactions between tidal creeks and mudflats we conducted field campaigns monitoring water depths tidal currents waves suspended sediments and bed level changes at sites in both mudflats and tidal creeks in the eastern chongming tidal wetland in the yangtze delta for a full spring neap tidal cycle we saw that under fair weather conditions the bed level changes of the tidal creek site displayed a contrary trend compared with those of the mudflat site indicating the source sink relationship between tidal creek and mudflat during over marsh tides the tidal creek site with relatively high bed shear stresses averagely 0 37 n m2 was eroded by 35 mm whereas the mudflat site was accreted by 29 mm under low bed shear stresses averagely 0 18 n m2 to the contrast during creek restricted tides deposition occurred in the tidal creek site by 20 mm under low bed shear stresses averagely 0 09 n m2 whereas erosion occurred in the mudflat site by 25 mm under relatively high bed shear stresses averagely 0 21 n m2 over a spring neap tidal cycle the net bed level changes were 15 mm erosion and 4 mm deposition in tidal creeks and mudflats respectively these results suggested that there were alternated erosion deposition patterns in spring and neap tides and a sediment source and sink shift between mudflats and creeks we found that the eroded sediments in mudflats were transported landward into tidal creeks and deposited therein in neap tides and these newly deposited sediments would be resuspended and transported to surrounding marshes over marsh deposition at spring tides the coherent sediment transport and associated erosion deposition pattern within the mudflat creek system at spring neap tidal time scales thus played a fundamental role in intertidal morphodynamic development these findings suggest that management and restoration of intertidal ecosystem need to take the entire mudflat creek marsh system as a unit into consideration rather than focusing on single elements keywords intertidal environment mudflat creek system hydrodynamics sedimentary process bed shear stress yangtze estuary 1 introduction intertidal environments are important elements in estuarine and coastal systems supporting the exchange of materials like sediments and nutrients between the land and the ocean eisma 1998 nyman et al 2009 kirwan and megonigal 2013 different types of ecosystems like mudflats salt marshes and tidal creeks can be found within the intertidal fringe many previous studies have focused on the recognition of the valuable functions of these ecosystems like providing coastal protection by dissipating waves and defending from storm surges moller et al 1999 gedan et al 2011 temmerman et al 2013 and providing ecological services by hosting migratory birds and feeding coastal benthos ysebaert et al 2003 tian et al 2008 however different coastal settings throughout the world such as the scheldt estuary the chesapeake bay the venice lagoon the bay of fundy and the yangtze estuary are presently facing the loss of intertidal habitats as a result of combined effects of land reclamation sea level rise and sediment supply reduction etc temmerman et al 2003 yang et al 2005 van proosdij et al 2006 d alpaos et al 2007 mariotti et al 2010 tian et al 2015 in response remarkable changes would occur in terms of hydrodynamics and sedimentary processes within intertidal systems knowledge regarding the distribution and dynamics of flows and sediments is essential to advance understanding of morphological and ecological changes in intertidal environments many researchers have monitored flow and sediment transported processes over intertidal environments and found that there were great differences in hydrodynamics and sedimentary processes between mudflats tidal creeks and salt marshes eisma 1998 dyer et al 2000 yang et al 2003 friedrichs 2011 o laughlin and van proosdij 2013 bouma et al 2016 eaton 2016 unvegetated mudflats with lower elevations compared to salt marshes can be submerged more frequently for longer time a few theories highlight the dominance of tidal asymmetry and scour and settling lag in controlling tide averaged sediment transport and consequent morphological changes in mudflats postma 1961 dronkers 1986 wang et al 2002 based on those results previous studies conclude that mudflat profiles can reach approximate dynamic equilibria with their local climate of waves tides and sediment sources when considered as an average over annual and longer timescales friedrichs 2011 hu et al 2015 van der wegen et al 2017 moreover recent studies propose that erosion deposition patterns of mudflats are actually governed by non linear interactions between both tidal currents and wind waves janssen stelder 2000 widdows et al 2008 shi et al 2012 hunt et al 2015 sedimentary processes in the mudflats can be effectively predicted based on two parameters bed shear stress derived from combined wave current action τcw and critical bed shear stress for erosion τce shi et al 2012 2017 zhu et al 2014 compared to the mudflats sedimentary processes in the vegetated salt marshes are more complex and are determined by water motion sediment transport vegetation and elevation vegetation over the marshes could attenuate waves and stabilize sediment bed which greatly reduces the combined wave current shear stress τcw while enhances critical bed shear stress for erosion τce respectively stumpf 1983 bouma et al 2009 howes et al 2010 vandenbruwaene et al 2015 as a result sediment deposition is more likely to occur than erosion in the salt marshes except for extremely high storm surges along with severe wave activities temmerman et al 2005b d alpaos et al 2007 fagherazzi and wiberg 2009 howes et al 2010 leonardi et al 2016 the elevation of marsh surface also plays an important role in sedimentary processes in the salt marshes except low marshes most of salt marshes with a higher elevation are only submerged during high tides thus only over marsh tides are effective in controlling the sedimentary processes temmerman et al 2003 also concludes that sedimentation rate of the salt marsh generally decreases with increasing surface elevation and distance from the nearest creek or marsh edge tidal creeks are ubiquitous components of intertidal environments flooding and draining the marsh platform and providing conduits for sediments and nutrients to the marsh system voulgaris and meyers 2004 fagherazzi et al 2012 xin et al 2012 previous studies have acknowledged that the tidal creek is the dominant supplier of sediment to the marsh surface particularly for meso tidal and micro tidal regions allen 2000 friedrichs 2011 o laughlin and van proosdij 2013 the tidal current and topography govern the flow magnitude which influences the sedimentary processes in tidal creeks d alpaos et al 2007 o laughlin and van proosdij 2013 numerical models and field measurements suggest that mudflats salt marshes and tidal creeks can significantly affect each other friedrichs 2011 fagherazzi et al 2012 schuerch et al 2014 for instance short term mudflat dynamics can initiate adjacent lateral marsh erosion bouma et al 2016 hence a combined study of the hydrodynamics and sediment transport in the three components is fundamental to understand the sedimentary processes when taking an intertidal environment as a whole into account recent studies focus on the interactions between tidal creeks and salt marshes temmerman et al 2007 mariotti and fagherazzi 2013 and interactions between salt marshes and mudflats bouma et al 2016 however there is insufficient knowledge of the interchanges between tidal creeks and mudflats specifically it is poorly known 1 how mudflats and tidal creeks influence each other through water motion and sediment transport and 2 the role of the mudflat creek system in the sedimentary processes for the entire intertidal environment this study is devoted to understanding sedimentary processes in a mudflat creek system based on an integrated observation of currents waves sediments and bed level changes in an intertidal habitat in the yangtze estuary we aim to figure out intertidal morphodynamic behaviors between tidal creeks and mudflats and the role of the mudflat creek system in the morphodynamics of intertidal environments 2 methods 2 1 study area field observations were conducted in the intertidal area of the eastern chongming island a 170 km2 tidal wetland in the yangtze estuary fig 1 li et al 2014 salt marshes mudflats and tidal creeks dominate a large portion of the intertidal zone the tides in the yangtze estuary are dominantly semi diurnal and the local mean tidal range is 2 5 m with maximum spring tidal range up to 5 m yang et al 2008 shi et al 2012 zhu et al 2016 monthly averaged wind velocity varies between 3 5 and 4 5 m s and wave height in the intertidal environments normally ranges from 0 1 to 0 3 m and seldom exceeds 1 0 m even under severe stormy weather yang et al 2008 the eastern chongming tidal wetland used to prograde seaward at an average rate of 10 m year and the maximum rate was up to 226 m year yang et al 2001 deposition of river supplied sediment and extensive reclamation stimulate the growth of the tidal wetland however the accretion rate has strongly reduced in recent years due to the decrease of the yangtze river supplied sediment i e from 455 million tons per year in 1950 2000 to 150 million tons in 2001 2012 van maren et al 2013 luan et al 2016 wang et al 2016 facing the east china sea the study site was located at the southern part of the eastern chongming tidal wetland including mudflats salt marshes and a tidal creek fig 1b the width of the tidal creek ranged from 30 m at the creek mouth to 2 m at the creek head and the creek depth ranged from 2 5 to 0 5 m the axial bed slope of the mudflat and tidal creek is 3 and 1 8 respectively the surficial sediments are composed of clay and silt with median diameters smaller than 60 μm in the study area the salt marsh surface and the upper creek banks were mainly vegetated by carex scabrifolia 2 2 field measurements two hydrodynamic measurements were performed in the mudflat 100 m seaward from the marsh edge and in the tidal creek 120 m landward from the creek mouth respectively figs 1b and 2a observations were conducted from 20

every 5 min at 4 hz were deployed to measure the wave activity and water depth the optical backscatter signal of the asm was used to estimate the ssc sampling 25 bursts every 5 min calibration of the optical backscatter signal into ssc was shown in fig 2b the bed elevation of the study area was collected by terrestrial laser scanner riegl vz4000 riegl austria xie et al 2017 relative to the theoretical low tide datum at wusong fig 1c the elevations of the tidal creek site and the mudflat site were 2 2 and 2 1 m above the datum respectively fig 2c and d bankfull elevations varied from 4 5 m in the high marsh to 4 2 m in the low marsh fig 2c 2 3 estimation of bed shear stress at the tidal creek site the bed shear stress due to the current τc was dominant because of very small waves detected therein fig 3 while at the mudflat site the wave activities appeared stronger and more frequent the bed shear stress derived from combined wave current action τcw was essential for studying the mudflat morphodynamics shi et al 2012 zhu et al 2014 the 3d velocity derived from the adv u v w can be decomposed into two terms the mean u v w and turbulent components u v w the turbulent kinetic

data sets of 19 semi diurnal tides were recorded and were divided into two groups table 1 the first group was characterized by relatively high tides when tidal elevations in the tidal creek were higher than salt marsh elevation i e 4 2 m named over marsh tides including t1 t3 t5 t7 and t9 during spring tide the second group included the remaining tides when tidal elevations were lower than the salt marsh thus water motions were constrained within the tidal creeks named creek restricted tides 3 1 wind and waves during the entire study period the wind speed varied from 0 to 9 7 m s with an average value of 3 76 m s indicating that the observations were conducted under fair weather conditions the winds were in onshore directions 120 180 during most of the tides t6 to t19 except for t1to t5 when the wind directions were alongshore fig 3a at the mudflat site the significant wave height hs ranged from 0 02 to 0 83 m fig 3b the tidally averaged hs of each tide ranged from 0 07 t4 to 0 41 m t1 and showed a positive correlation with wind speeds fig 3 the averaged wave heights during neap tides from t13 to t19 were generally greater than those during spring tides from t1 to t7 due to the persistent landward winds during the field campain however there was no significant correlation between wave heights and water depth at the tidal creek site the rbr logger measured no wave activity during the deployment wave height 5 cm fig 3b 3 2 currents the instantaneous current velocity ranged from 0 01 to 0 83 m s at the tidal creek site and from 0 01 to 0 41 m s at the mudflat site fig 4 b velocity measurements demonstrated that high tides 4 2 m over marsh tides typically generated higher current velocities in the tidal creek fig 5 and table 2 during t1 t3 t5 t7 and t9 the tidal mean current velocities 0 32 0 51 m s averagely 0 44 m s were much higher than those during creek restricted tides 0 08 0 20 m s averagely 0 15 m s while at the mudflat site the higher mean current velocities still occurred during the over marsh tides however the difference between over marsh tides 0 22 0 27 m s averagely 0 24 m s and creek restricted tides 0 05 0 19 m s averagely 0 14 m s was less significant table 2 within tidal cycles at the mudflat site the current typically reached peak velocities during early flood and late ebb both during over marsh and creek restricted tides the time series of velocity displayed a strong similarity between the tidal creek site and the mudflat site during creek restricted tides fig 4b by contrast during over marsh tides besides early flood and late ebb peak current velocities at the tidal creek site also occurred during late flood when the creek was full and before flow flooded over the adjacent marsh fig 4b 3 3 bed shear stress 3 3 1 bed shear stress at the tidal creek site the wave activities were weak at the tidal creek site and the bed shear stress was mainly controlled by currents τc the time series of τc are shown in fig 4d and the tidal mean τc ranged from 0 01 to 0 76 n m2 table 2 on average τc was greater during over marsh tides average 0 37 n m2 than that during creek restricted tides average 0 09 n m2 within tidal cycles peak τc occurred during late flood during high tides but no similar peak τc appeared during creek restricted tides fig 6 3 3 2 bed shear stress at the mudflat site at the mudflat site the bed shear stress was induced by both currents τc and waves τw the tidal mean τc ranged from 0 06 to 0 21 n m2 and τw ranged from 0 14 to 0 99 n m2 fig 4c the bed shear stress due to waves τw displayed a strong relationship with significant wave heights figs 3b and 4c the bed shear stress due to combined current wave action τcw was calculated using a hydrodynamic model soulsby 1995 and the results are shown in fig 4d and table 2 the tidal mean τcw ranged from 0 09 to 0 31 n m2 and τcw were significantly greater than τc figs 4 and 6 on average τcw during over marsh tides average 0 18 n m2 was close to that during creek restricted tides average 0 21 n m2 3 4 suspended sediment concentration at the tidal creek site the tidal mean suspended sediment concentration ssc ranged from 0 26 to 1 70 g l and the peak sscs occurred during early flood table 2 the mean sscs during over marsh tides and creek restricted tides were 0 90 and 1 13 g l respectively while during over marsh tides besides early flood period high values of ssc also were observed before the creek was filled then the ssc decreased after the tidal elevation exceeded the salt marsh elevation figs 4e and 6 at the mudflat site the tidal mean ssc ranged from 0 22 to 1 55 g l table 2 the mean sscs during over marsh tides and creek restricted tides were 0 99 and 0 97 g l respectively during creek restricted tides similar to the tidal creek site the peak sscs occurred during early flood fig 6 however during over marsh tides the ssc increased with the water depth and reached peak values before the slack water periods after that the ssc reduced markedly as the water depth decreased fig 6 3 5 bed level changes at the tidal creek site bed level changes showed a significant trend towards erosion during over marsh tides fig 4f the tidal creek was eroded by 35 mm between t1 and t9 however during creek restricted tides the tidal creek switched to deposition and the elevation increased by 20 mm from t10 to t19 fig 4f while at the mudflat site the bed level changes were somewhat contrary compared to the tidal creek site i e the mudflat was deposited by about 29 mm between t1 and t9 and eroded by 25 mm from t10 to t19 fig 4f 3 6 sedimentary processes in the mudflat creek system during creek restricted tides t10 t19 low water depths combining with relatively high wind induced wave activities resulted in greater bed shear stresses and erosion at the mudflat site fig 7 the resuspended sediments were transported landward to the salt marshes and the tidal creeks along with the flooding currents leading to relatively high sscs in these zones fig 6d on the other hand the creek restricted currents led to low velocities and low bed shear stresses in the tidal creeks providing beneficial conditions for sediment settling and deposition therein figs 4 and 6d during over marsh tides t1 t3 t5 t7 and t9 fine grained sediments in the adjacent estuarine area were resuspended and transported to the mudflats larger water depths in combination with smaller bed shear stresses figs 6e and 7 were favorable for deposition in the mudflats in the meantime over marsh currents occurred in the tidal creek and led to lateral water and sediment spread to surrounding salt marshes fig 5 the relatively large bed shear stress could lead to increase in the sscs the high sscs particularly when the currents were bankfull and flooded over the salt marshes would lead to the deposition in the salt marshes due to vegetation trapping and velocity decreasing fig 6c we provided an integrated concept model described the sedimentary processes in intertidal environments based on the mudflat creek system fig 8 in this way sedimentary processes in the study area could be inferred as in a spring neap tidal cycle the sediments from the estuarine waters were transported to the mudflats and deposited during spring tides afterwards the sediments were resuspended from the mudflats and transported to tidal creeks during neap tides when next spring tides came the sediments in the tidal creeks are picked again and transported to the salt marshes and deposited therein through over marsh currents 4 discussion 4 1 role of mudflat creek systems tide creeks and mudflats are both fundamental components in estuarine and coastal intertidal environments a considerate amount of incoming suspended sediment from the adjacent riverine zone could be expected to deposit on the unvegetated mudflats whitehouse et al 2000 yang et al 2005 some of these sediments would be resuspended and directly transported to the salt marshes while some would be firstly delivered to the tidal creeks then were spread and deposited over the salt marshes during over marsh tides reed 1989 fagherazzi et al 2012 the measurements of simultaneous sedimentary processes on the salt marsh surface were lacking because we only conducted field measurements in the tidal creek and the mudflat therefore we could not quantify the contributions of various sediment sources to deposition over salt marshes however the sediments on the mudflats and in the tidal creeks have been considered as supply sources for the accretion of the intertidal environments particularly for salt marshes stumpf 1983 temmerman et al 2005b bouma et al 2009 mariotti et al 2010 o laughlin and van proosdij 2013 vandenbruwaene et al 2015 recent studies also indicated that short term mudflat dynamics could drive long term cyclic salt marsh dynamics bouma et al 2016 based on the sedimentary processes observed in the mudflat and in the creek it is reasonable to infer the corresponding sedimentary processes on the marsh surface the results in this study indicated that there were spring neap variations of erosion deposition patterns and sediment resource sink shifts of mudflat creek system at neap tides the eroded sediment at mudflats was transported towards tidal creeks and deposited therein supplying sediment source for over marsh deposition at spring tides the accumulative effects of the spring neap tidal variations of erosion deposition within the mudflat creek system were therefore responsible for sedimentary processes on the entire intertidal environment 4 2 controls of intertidal sedimentary processes under the combined effects of flat elevations tidal currents wind waves and sediment supplies etc an intertidal environment would reach a stable dynamic equilibrium forming a mudflat creek morphology temmerman et al 2003 friedrichs 2011 mariotti and fagherazzi 2013 those equilibria are achieved through sediment exchange dynamic balances between current dominated creeks and combined wave current dominated mudflats shi et al 2012 mariotti and fagherazzi 2013 the elevation of intertidal environment is important in intertidal sedimentary processes and dynamic equilibria since the elevation exhibits a close relationship with the submerged time fagherazzi et al 2012 in this study during the studied spring neap tidal cycle the net changes in the elevation of the tidal creek site and the mudflat site are 15 mm and 4 mm respectively erosions in the tidal creek would result in local lower water levels and relatively shorter over marsh periods in the next tidal cycle thus more sediment tends to deposit in the tidal creek rather than over the salt marsh leading to a recovery increase in the elevation of the tidal creek and a longer over marsh period in general long over marsh time is positively related to salt marsh depositions temmerman et al 2003 the creek elevation is primarily controlled by tidal currents including creek hydrodynamics and sediment transport the tidal creek is eroded due to high bed shear stresses derived from currents average 0 37 n m2 during over marsh tides whereas is deposited under low bed shear stresses average 0 09 n m2 at creek restricted tides besides tidal currents the mudflat elevation is also directly influenced by wave activities which always results in high bed shear stresses and erosions in mudflats even at neap tides shi et al 2017 the eroded sediments stemming from the combined effect of currents and waves in mudflats have significant influences on salt marsh depositions through an intermediate bridge tidal creek field surveys based on terrestrial laser scanning data showed that the studied intertidal habitat accreted remarkably with abundant sediment supply during the study period xie et al 2018 previous studies have acknowledged the important role of sediment supply in intertidal sedimentary processes as well yang et al 2005 kirwan and megonigal 2013 schuerch et al 2014 rich sediment supplies are positively linked to intertidal depositions particularly for mudflats this study emphasizes the significance of mudflat depositions as a sediment source for the mudflat creek marsh evolutions in particular the sediment in mudflats is eroded transported and deposited within the mudflat creek marsh system leading to a redistribution of sediment within the entire intertidal environment the high sediment loaded environment in the yangtze estuary provides enough sediment to maintain dynamic equilibria and accretions in intertidal environments yang et al 2001 while in low sediment loaded environments e g barnegat bay previous studies have reported that coastal intertidal environments generally experienced erosions leonardi et al 2016 4 3 implications and limitations previous studies indicated that coastal management required a good understanding of sedimentary processes in intertidal environments including mudflat dynamics creek dynamics and salt marsh dynamics friedrichs 2011 zhu et al 2012 schuerch et al 2014 bouma et al 2016 these physical processes were interactional rather than independent the current study suggested that physical processes over salt marshes were linked to those in mudflats by tidal creeks the mudflats served as a provisional sediment sink with respect to much large scale estuarine and coastal waters while on the other hand as a sediment source of tidal creeks tidal creeks formed as blood tubes received sediment from seaward mudflats and then transported them to adjacent salt marshes thus could be seen as a sink of mudflat sediment and a sediment source of salt marsh deposition the mudflat creek systems establish coherent links in sediment exchanges between intertidal environments and oceans moreover it should be noted that the above sedimentary patterns of the mudflat creek system were valid under fair weather conditions the erosion deposition patterns might be quite different under storms regarding more elevated water level and much stronger wave influences leonardi and fagherazzi 2015 severe erosion was highly likely to occur in the mudflat during storms because of much larger great τcw yang et al 2003 mariotti et al 2010 these eroded sediments would end in mudflat creek systems and finally deposited in salt marshes yang et al 2003 xie et al 2017 it remains unknown it is the small but persisting evolution driven by tides under fair weather or the episodic but strong changes induced by waves play a more important role on longer term intertidal morphodynamics although the tidal creeks were important for the sedimentary processes in the salt marshes particularly for the high elevation zonation allen 2000 christiansen et al 2000 friedrichs 2011 fagherazzi et al 2012 marsh edge erosion and retreat and subsequent landward sediment transport would also stimulate salt marsh accretion temmerman et al 2013 bouma et al 2016 previous studies showed that in macro tidal estuaries and coasts a considerate portion of the total marsh sedimentation was attributed to landward sediment transport from mudflat directly crossing marsh edges davidson arnott et al 2002 van proosdij et al 2006 the proportion of total sediment input from marsh edges displayed a positive relationship with the tidal elevation or water depth temmerman et al 2005a there were evidences that the salt marsh edges were eroded apparently during storms and the sediments would deposit near mudflats in the yangtze estuary xie et al 2018 these freshly deposited sediments thus could provide extra sources to be transported into tidal creeks and salt marshes further work is needed to consider the sediment transport linking mudflat marsh and mudflat creek marsh 5 conclusions this paper investigated the role of mudflat creek exchanges in sedimentary processes over an intertidal habitat in the yangtze estuary we conducted field measurements of water levels waves velocities sscs and bed level changes in a tidal creek and its adjacent mudflat during high tides the bed shear stress average 0 18 n m2 was low in the mudflats meanwhile ssc average 0 99 g l was high due to large amounts of sediment input from large scale estuarine waters leading to deposition and an elevation increase of 29 mm in the mudflats in the meantime sediment in the tidal creek was resuspended by the relatively high bed shear stress average 0 37 n m2 and deposited over the salt marsh during over marsh periods the elevation of the tidal creek decreased by 35 mm by contrary during low tides the water depth was low and the bed shear stress average 0 21 n m2 was relatively high in the mudflats which resulted in sediment resuspension average ssc 0 97 g l and an elevation decrease of 25 mm the resuspended sediment was delivered to the tidal creek and deposited due to the low bed shear stress average 0 09 n m2 the elevation of the tidal creek increased by 20 mm this study generalizes a unified concept model to describe the sedimentary processes in intertidal environments based on a sediment transport conduit in the mudflat creek systems the sediments from the estuarine waters are transported to the mudflats and deposited during flood tides afterwards the sediments are resuspended from the mudflats and transported to tidal creeks during neap tides when next over marsh tides come the sediments in the tidal creeks are flushed over the salt marshes and deposit through over marsh currents the results indicate that there is an erosion deposition cycle in the mudflat creek system during a spring neap tidal cycle under fair weather conditions which further influences the morphodynamics over the salt marsh and sedimentary processes in intertidal environments these findings likely represent the morphological configuration of most intertidal environments further studies are required to better understand the effect of sediment fluxes across marsh edges on intertidal evolutions additional impact factors may also worth further investigation 6 declarations of interest none acknowledgments this study was supported by the national natural science foundation

6892,intertidal environments including bare mudflats tidal creeks and vegetated salt marshes are of significant physical and ecological importance in estuaries their morphodynamics are closely linked by mudflats and creek networks understanding water motion and sediment transport in mudflats and tidal creeks is fundamental to understand intertidal morphodynamics in intertidal environments to explore dynamic interactions between tidal creeks and mudflats we conducted field campaigns monitoring water depths tidal currents waves suspended sediments and bed level changes at sites in both mudflats and tidal creeks in the eastern chongming tidal wetland in the yangtze delta for a full spring neap tidal cycle we saw that under fair weather conditions the bed level changes of the tidal creek site displayed a contrary trend compared with those of the mudflat site indicating the source sink relationship between tidal creek and mudflat during over marsh tides the tidal creek site with relatively high bed shear stresses averagely 0 37 n m2 was eroded by 35 mm whereas the mudflat site was accreted by 29 mm under low bed shear stresses averagely 0 18 n m2 to the contrast during creek restricted tides deposition occurred in the tidal creek site by 20 mm under low bed shear stresses averagely 0 09 n m2 whereas erosion occurred in the mudflat site by 25 mm under relatively high bed shear stresses averagely 0 21 n m2 over a spring neap tidal cycle the net bed level changes were 15 mm erosion and 4 mm deposition in tidal creeks and mudflats respectively these results suggested that there were alternated erosion deposition patterns in spring and neap tides and a sediment source and sink shift between mudflats and creeks we found that the eroded sediments in mudflats were transported landward into tidal creeks and deposited therein in neap tides and these newly deposited sediments would be resuspended and transported to surrounding marshes over marsh deposition at spring tides the coherent sediment transport and associated erosion deposition pattern within the mudflat creek system at spring neap tidal time scales thus played a fundamental role in intertidal morphodynamic development these findings suggest that management and restoration of intertidal ecosystem need to take the entire mudflat creek marsh system as a unit into consideration rather than focusing on single elements keywords intertidal environment mudflat creek system hydrodynamics sedimentary process bed shear stress yangtze estuary 1 introduction intertidal environments are important elements in estuarine and coastal systems supporting the exchange of materials like sediments and nutrients between the land and the ocean eisma 1998 nyman et al 2009 kirwan and megonigal 2013 different types of ecosystems like mudflats salt marshes and tidal creeks can be found within the intertidal fringe many previous studies have focused on the recognition of the valuable functions of these ecosystems like providing coastal protection by dissipating waves and defending from storm surges moller et al 1999 gedan et al 2011 temmerman et al 2013 and providing ecological services by hosting migratory birds and feeding coastal benthos ysebaert et al 2003 tian et al 2008 however different coastal settings throughout the world such as the scheldt estuary the chesapeake bay the venice lagoon the bay of fundy and the yangtze estuary are presently facing the loss of intertidal habitats as a result of combined effects of land reclamation sea level rise and sediment supply reduction etc temmerman et al 2003 yang et al 2005 van proosdij et al 2006 d alpaos et al 2007 mariotti et al 2010 tian et al 2015 in response remarkable changes would occur in terms of hydrodynamics and sedimentary processes within intertidal systems knowledge regarding the distribution and dynamics of flows and sediments is essential to advance understanding of morphological and ecological changes in intertidal environments many researchers have monitored flow and sediment transported processes over intertidal environments and found that there were great differences in hydrodynamics and sedimentary processes between mudflats tidal creeks and salt marshes eisma 1998 dyer et al 2000 yang et al 2003 friedrichs 2011 o laughlin and van proosdij 2013 bouma et al 2016 eaton 2016 unvegetated mudflats with lower elevations compared to salt marshes can be submerged more frequently for longer time a few theories highlight the dominance of tidal asymmetry and scour and settling lag in controlling tide averaged sediment transport and consequent morphological changes in mudflats postma 1961 dronkers 1986 wang et al 2002 based on those results previous studies conclude that mudflat profiles can reach approximate dynamic equilibria with their local climate of waves tides and sediment sources when considered as an average over annual and longer timescales friedrichs 2011 hu et al 2015 van der wegen et al 2017 moreover recent studies propose that erosion deposition patterns of mudflats are actually governed by non linear interactions between both tidal currents and wind waves janssen stelder 2000 widdows et al 2008 shi et al 2012 hunt et al 2015 sedimentary processes in the mudflats can be effectively predicted based on two parameters bed shear stress derived from combined wave current action τcw and critical bed shear stress for erosion τce shi et al 2012 2017 zhu et al 2014 compared to the mudflats sedimentary processes in the vegetated salt marshes are more complex and are determined by water motion sediment transport vegetation and elevation vegetation over the marshes could attenuate waves and stabilize sediment bed which greatly reduces the combined wave current shear stress τcw while enhances critical bed shear stress for erosion τce respectively stumpf 1983 bouma et al 2009 howes et al 2010 vandenbruwaene et al 2015 as a result sediment deposition is more likely to occur than erosion in the salt marshes except for extremely high storm surges along with severe wave activities temmerman et al 2005b d alpaos et al 2007 fagherazzi and wiberg 2009 howes et al 2010 leonardi et al 2016 the elevation of marsh surface also plays an important role in sedimentary processes in the salt marshes except low marshes most of salt marshes with a higher elevation are only submerged during high tides thus only over marsh tides are effective in controlling the sedimentary processes temmerman et al 2003 also concludes that sedimentation rate of the salt marsh generally decreases with increasing surface elevation and distance from the nearest creek or marsh edge tidal creeks are ubiquitous components of intertidal environments flooding and draining the marsh platform and providing conduits for sediments and nutrients to the marsh system voulgaris and meyers 2004 fagherazzi et al 2012 xin et al 2012 previous studies have acknowledged that the tidal creek is the dominant supplier of sediment to the marsh surface particularly for meso tidal and micro tidal regions allen 2000 friedrichs 2011 o laughlin and van proosdij 2013 the tidal current and topography govern the flow magnitude which influences the sedimentary processes in tidal creeks d alpaos et al 2007 o laughlin and van proosdij 2013 numerical models and field measurements suggest that mudflats salt marshes and tidal creeks can significantly affect each other friedrichs 2011 fagherazzi et al 2012 schuerch et al 2014 for instance short term mudflat dynamics can initiate adjacent lateral marsh erosion bouma et al 2016 hence a combined study of the hydrodynamics and sediment transport in the three components is fundamental to understand the sedimentary processes when taking an intertidal environment as a whole into account recent studies focus on the interactions between tidal creeks and salt marshes temmerman et al 2007 mariotti and fagherazzi 2013 and interactions between salt marshes and mudflats bouma et al 2016 however there is insufficient knowledge of the interchanges between tidal creeks and mudflats specifically it is poorly known 1 how mudflats and tidal creeks influence each other through water motion and sediment transport and 2 the role of the mudflat creek system in the sedimentary processes for the entire intertidal environment this study is devoted to understanding sedimentary processes in a mudflat creek system based on an integrated observation of currents waves sediments and bed level changes in an intertidal habitat in the yangtze estuary we aim to figure out intertidal morphodynamic behaviors between tidal creeks and mudflats and the role of the mudflat creek system in the morphodynamics of intertidal environments 2 methods 2 1 study area field observations were conducted in the intertidal area of the eastern chongming island a 170 km2 tidal wetland in the yangtze estuary fig 1 li et al 2014 salt marshes mudflats and tidal creeks dominate a large portion of the intertidal zone the tides in the yangtze estuary are dominantly semi diurnal and the local mean tidal range is 2 5 m with maximum spring tidal range up to 5 m yang et al 2008 shi et al 2012 zhu et al 2016 monthly averaged wind velocity varies between 3 5 and 4 5 m s and wave height in the intertidal environments normally ranges from 0 1 to 0 3 m and seldom exceeds 1 0 m even under severe stormy weather yang et al 2008 the eastern chongming tidal wetland used to prograde seaward at an average rate of 10 m year and the maximum rate was up to 226 m year yang et al 2001 deposition of river supplied sediment and extensive reclamation stimulate the growth of the tidal wetland however the accretion rate has strongly reduced in recent years due to the decrease of the yangtze river supplied sediment i e from 455 million tons per year in 1950 2000 to 150 million tons in 2001 2012 van maren et al 2013 luan et al 2016 wang et al 2016 facing the east china sea the study site was located at the southern part of the eastern chongming tidal wetland including mudflats salt marshes and a tidal creek fig 1b the width of the tidal creek ranged from 30 m at the creek mouth to 2 m at the creek head and the creek depth ranged from 2 5 to 0 5 m the axial bed slope of the mudflat and tidal creek is 3 and 1 8 respectively the surficial sediments are composed of clay and silt with median diameters smaller than 60 μm in the study area the salt marsh surface and the upper creek banks were mainly vegetated by carex scabrifolia 2 2 field measurements two hydrodynamic measurements were performed in the mudflat 100 m seaward from the marsh edge and in the tidal creek 120 m landward from the creek mouth respectively figs 1b and 2a observations were conducted from 20 00 on august 2 to 10 00 on august 12 2016 during a spring neap tidal cycle covering 19 semi diurnal tides hourly wind speeds and directions were recorded by the eastern chongming weather station 4 km

mudflat site fig 2 the tripod was equipped with an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv nortek as norway argus surface meter asm argus germany and rbr tide wave loggers rbr rbr limited canada at the tidal creek site the adv asm and rbr were placed 25 25 and 7 cm above the bed surface respectively while they were placed 35 35 and 5 cm respectively above the bed surface at the mudflat site the adv which was set up in the 64 hz mode with a burst interval of 10 min recorded the near bed 3d velocity and bed level change andersen et al 2007 salehi and strom 2012 zhu et al 2016 the rbr sampling 512 bursts every 5 min at 4 hz were deployed to measure the wave activity and water depth the optical backscatter signal of the asm was used to estimate the ssc sampling 25 bursts every 5 min calibration of the optical backscatter signal into ssc was shown in fig 2b the bed elevation of the study area was collected by terrestrial laser scanner riegl vz4000 riegl austria xie et al 2017 relative to the theoretical low tide datum at wusong fig 1c the elevations of the tidal creek site and the mudflat site were 2 2 and 2 1 m above the datum respectively fig 2c and d bankfull elevations varied from 4 5 m in the high marsh to 4 2 m in the low marsh fig 2c 2 3 estimation of bed shear stress at the tidal creek site the bed shear stress due to the current τc was dominant because of very small waves detected therein fig 3 while at the mudflat site the wave activities appeared stronger and more frequent the bed shear stress derived from combined wave current action τcw was essential for studying the mudflat morphodynamics shi et al 2012 zhu et al 2014 the 3d velocity derived from the adv u v w can be decomposed into two terms the mean u v w and turbulent components u v w the turbulent kinetic

data sets of 19 semi diurnal tides were recorded and were divided into two groups table 1 the first group was characterized by relatively high tides when tidal elevations in the tidal creek were higher than salt marsh elevation i e 4 2 m named over marsh tides including t1 t3 t5 t7 and t9 during spring tide the second group included the remaining tides when tidal elevations were lower than the salt marsh thus water motions were constrained within the tidal creeks named creek restricted tides 3 1 wind and waves during the entire study period the wind speed varied from 0 to 9 7 m s with an average value of 3 76 m s indicating that the observations were conducted under fair weather conditions the winds were in onshore directions 120 180 during most of the tides t6 to t19 except for t1to t5 when the wind directions were alongshore fig 3a at the mudflat site the significant wave height hs ranged from 0 02 to 0 83 m fig 3b the tidally averaged hs of each tide ranged from 0 07 t4 to 0 41 m t1 and showed a positive correlation with wind speeds fig 3 the averaged wave heights during neap tides from t13 to t19 were generally greater than those during spring tides from t1 to t7 due to the persistent landward winds during the field campain however there was no significant correlation between wave heights and water depth at the tidal creek site the rbr logger measured no wave activity during the deployment wave height 5 cm fig 3b 3 2 currents the instantaneous current velocity ranged from 0 01 to 0 83 m s at the tidal creek site and from 0 01 to 0 41 m s at the mudflat site fig 4 b velocity measurements demonstrated that high tides 4 2 m over marsh tides typically generated higher current velocities in the tidal creek fig 5 and table 2 during t1 t3 t5 t7 and t9 the tidal mean current velocities 0 32 0 51 m s averagely 0 44 m s were much higher than those during creek restricted tides 0 08 0 20 m s averagely 0 15 m s while at the mudflat site the higher mean current velocities still occurred during the over marsh tides however the difference between over marsh tides 0 22 0 27 m s averagely 0 24 m s and creek restricted tides 0 05 0 19 m s averagely 0 14 m s was less significant table 2 within tidal cycles at the mudflat site the current typically reached peak velocities during early flood and late ebb both during over marsh and creek restricted tides the time series of velocity displayed a strong similarity between the tidal creek site and the mudflat site during creek restricted tides fig 4b by contrast during over marsh tides besides early flood and late ebb peak current velocities at the tidal creek site also occurred during late flood when the creek was full and before flow flooded over the adjacent marsh fig 4b 3 3 bed shear stress 3 3 1 bed shear stress at the tidal creek site the wave activities were weak at the tidal creek site and the bed shear stress was mainly controlled by currents τc the time series of τc are shown in fig 4d and the tidal mean τc ranged from 0 01 to 0 76 n m2 table 2 on average τc was greater during over marsh tides average 0 37 n m2 than that during creek restricted tides average 0 09 n m2 within tidal cycles peak τc occurred during late flood during high tides but no similar peak τc appeared during creek restricted tides fig 6 3 3 2 bed shear stress at the mudflat site at the mudflat site the bed shear stress was induced by both currents τc and waves τw the tidal mean τc ranged from 0 06 to 0 21 n m2 and τw ranged from 0 14 to 0 99 n m2 fig 4c the bed shear stress due to waves τw displayed a strong relationship with significant wave heights figs 3b and 4c the bed shear stress due to combined current wave action τcw was calculated using a hydrodynamic model soulsby 1995 and the results are shown in fig 4d and table 2 the tidal mean τcw ranged from 0 09 to 0 31 n m2 and τcw were significantly greater than τc figs 4 and 6 on average τcw during over marsh tides average 0 18 n m2 was close to that during creek restricted tides average 0 21 n m2 3 4 suspended sediment concentration at the tidal creek site the tidal mean suspended sediment concentration ssc ranged from 0 26 to 1 70 g l and the peak sscs occurred during early flood table 2 the mean sscs during over marsh tides and creek restricted tides were 0 90 and 1 13 g l respectively while during over marsh tides besides early flood period high values of ssc also were observed before the creek was filled then the ssc decreased after the tidal elevation exceeded the salt marsh elevation figs 4e and 6 at the mudflat site the tidal mean ssc ranged from 0 22 to 1 55 g l table 2 the mean sscs during over marsh tides and creek restricted tides were 0 99 and 0 97 g l respectively during creek restricted tides similar to the tidal creek site the peak sscs occurred during early flood fig 6 however during over marsh tides the ssc increased with the water depth and reached peak values before the slack water periods after that the ssc reduced markedly as the water depth decreased fig 6 3 5 bed level changes at the tidal creek site bed level changes showed a significant trend towards erosion during over marsh tides fig 4f the tidal creek was eroded by 35 mm between t1 and t9 however during creek restricted tides the tidal creek switched to deposition and the elevation increased by 20 mm from t10 to t19 fig 4f while at the mudflat site the bed level changes were somewhat contrary compared to the tidal creek site i e the mudflat was deposited by about 29 mm between t1 and t9 and eroded by 25 mm from t10 to t19 fig 4f 3 6 sedimentary processes in the mudflat creek system during creek restricted tides t10 t19 low water depths combining with relatively high wind induced wave activities resulted in greater bed shear stresses and erosion at the mudflat site fig 7 the resuspended sediments were transported landward to the salt marshes and the tidal creeks along with the flooding currents leading to relatively high sscs in these zones fig 6d on the other hand the creek restricted currents led to low velocities and low bed shear stresses in the tidal creeks providing beneficial conditions for sediment settling and deposition therein figs 4 and 6d during over marsh tides t1 t3 t5 t7 and t9 fine grained sediments in the adjacent estuarine area were resuspended and transported to the mudflats larger water depths in combination with smaller bed shear stresses figs 6e and 7 were favorable for deposition in the mudflats in the meantime over marsh currents occurred in the tidal creek and led to lateral water and sediment spread to surrounding salt marshes fig 5 the relatively large bed shear stress could lead to increase in the sscs the high sscs particularly when the currents were bankfull and flooded over the salt marshes would lead to the deposition in the salt marshes due to vegetation trapping and velocity decreasing fig 6c we provided an integrated concept model described the sedimentary processes in intertidal environments based on the mudflat creek system fig 8 in this way sedimentary processes in the study area could be inferred as in a spring neap tidal cycle the sediments from the estuarine waters were transported to the mudflats and deposited during spring tides afterwards the sediments were resuspended from the mudflats and transported to tidal creeks during neap tides when next spring tides came the sediments in the tidal creeks are picked again and transported to the salt marshes and deposited therein through over marsh currents 4 discussion 4 1 role of mudflat creek systems tide creeks and mudflats are both fundamental components in estuarine and coastal intertidal environments a considerate amount of incoming suspended sediment from the adjacent riverine zone could be expected to deposit on the unvegetated mudflats whitehouse et al 2000 yang et al 2005 some of these sediments would be resuspended and directly transported to the salt marshes while some would be firstly delivered to the tidal creeks then were spread and deposited over the salt marshes during over marsh tides reed 1989 fagherazzi et al 2012 the measurements of simultaneous sedimentary processes on the salt marsh surface were lacking because we only conducted field measurements in the tidal creek and the mudflat therefore we could not quantify the contributions of various sediment sources to deposition over salt marshes however the sediments on the mudflats and in the tidal creeks have been considered as supply sources for the accretion of the intertidal environments particularly for salt marshes stumpf 1983 temmerman et al 2005b bouma et al 2009 mariotti et al 2010 o laughlin and van proosdij 2013 vandenbruwaene et al 2015 recent studies also indicated that short term mudflat dynamics could drive long term cyclic salt marsh dynamics bouma et al 2016 based on the sedimentary processes observed in the mudflat and in the creek it is reasonable to infer the corresponding sedimentary processes on the marsh surface the results in this study indicated that there were spring neap variations of erosion deposition patterns and sediment resource sink shifts of mudflat creek system at neap tides the eroded sediment at mudflats was transported towards tidal creeks and deposited therein supplying sediment source for over marsh deposition at spring tides the accumulative effects of the spring neap tidal variations of erosion deposition within the mudflat creek system were therefore responsible for sedimentary processes on the entire intertidal environment 4 2 controls of intertidal sedimentary processes under the combined effects of flat elevations tidal currents wind waves and sediment supplies etc an intertidal environment would reach a stable dynamic equilibrium forming a mudflat creek morphology temmerman et al 2003 friedrichs 2011 mariotti and fagherazzi 2013 those equilibria are achieved through sediment exchange dynamic balances between current dominated creeks and combined wave current dominated mudflats shi et al 2012 mariotti and fagherazzi 2013 the elevation of intertidal environment is important in intertidal sedimentary processes and dynamic equilibria since the elevation exhibits a close relationship with the submerged time fagherazzi et al 2012 in this study during the studied spring neap tidal cycle the net changes in the elevation of the tidal creek site and the mudflat site are 15 mm and 4 mm respectively erosions in the tidal creek would result in local lower water levels and relatively shorter over marsh periods in the next tidal cycle thus more sediment tends to deposit in the tidal creek rather than over the salt marsh leading to a recovery increase in the elevation of the tidal creek and a longer over marsh period in general long over marsh time is positively related to salt marsh depositions temmerman et al 2003 the creek elevation is primarily controlled by tidal currents including creek hydrodynamics and sediment transport the tidal creek is eroded due to high bed shear stresses derived from currents average 0 37 n m2 during over marsh tides whereas is deposited under low bed shear stresses average 0 09 n m2 at creek restricted tides besides tidal currents the mudflat elevation is also directly influenced by wave activities which always results in high bed shear stresses and erosions in mudflats even at neap tides shi et al 2017 the eroded sediments stemming from the combined effect of currents and waves in mudflats have significant influences on salt marsh depositions through an intermediate bridge tidal creek field surveys based on terrestrial laser scanning data showed that the studied intertidal habitat accreted remarkably with abundant sediment supply during the study period xie et al 2018 previous studies have acknowledged the important role of sediment supply in intertidal sedimentary processes as well yang et al 2005 kirwan and megonigal 2013 schuerch et al 2014 rich sediment supplies are positively linked to intertidal depositions particularly for mudflats this study emphasizes the significance of mudflat depositions as a sediment source for the mudflat creek marsh evolutions in particular the sediment in mudflats is eroded transported and deposited within the mudflat creek marsh system leading to a redistribution of sediment within the entire intertidal environment the high sediment loaded environment in the yangtze estuary provides enough sediment to maintain dynamic equilibria and accretions in intertidal environments yang et al 2001 while in low sediment loaded environments e g barnegat bay previous studies have reported that coastal intertidal environments generally experienced erosions leonardi et al 2016 4 3 implications and limitations previous studies indicated that coastal management required a good understanding of sedimentary processes in intertidal environments including mudflat dynamics creek dynamics and salt marsh dynamics friedrichs 2011 zhu et al 2012 schuerch et al 2014 bouma et al 2016 these physical processes were interactional rather than independent the current study suggested that physical processes over salt marshes were linked to those in mudflats by tidal creeks the mudflats served as a provisional sediment sink with respect to much large scale estuarine and coastal waters while on the other hand as a sediment source of tidal creeks tidal creeks formed as blood tubes received sediment from seaward mudflats and then transported them to adjacent salt marshes thus could be seen as a sink of mudflat sediment and a sediment source of salt marsh deposition the mudflat creek systems establish coherent links in sediment exchanges between intertidal environments and oceans moreover it should be noted that the above sedimentary patterns of the mudflat creek system were valid under fair weather conditions the erosion deposition patterns might be quite different under storms regarding more elevated water level and much stronger wave influences leonardi and fagherazzi 2015 severe erosion was highly likely to occur in the mudflat during storms because of much larger great τcw yang et al 2003 mariotti et al 2010 these eroded sediments would end in mudflat creek systems and finally deposited in salt marshes yang et al 2003 xie et al 2017 it remains unknown it is the small but persisting evolution driven by tides under fair weather or the episodic but strong changes induced by waves play a more important role on longer term intertidal morphodynamics although the tidal creeks were important for the sedimentary processes in the salt marshes particularly for the high elevation zonation allen 2000 christiansen et al 2000 friedrichs 2011 fagherazzi et al 2012 marsh edge erosion and retreat and subsequent landward sediment transport would also stimulate salt marsh accretion temmerman et al 2013 bouma et al 2016 previous studies showed that in macro tidal estuaries and coasts a considerate portion of the total marsh sedimentation was attributed to landward sediment transport from mudflat directly crossing marsh edges davidson arnott et al 2002 van proosdij et al 2006 the proportion of total sediment input from marsh edges displayed a positive relationship with the tidal elevation or water depth temmerman et al 2005a there were evidences that the salt marsh edges were eroded apparently during storms and the sediments would deposit near mudflats in the yangtze estuary xie et al 2018 these freshly deposited sediments thus could provide extra sources to be transported into tidal creeks and salt marshes further work is needed to consider the sediment transport linking mudflat marsh and mudflat creek marsh 5 conclusions this paper investigated the role of mudflat creek exchanges in sedimentary processes over an intertidal habitat in the yangtze estuary we conducted field measurements of water levels waves velocities sscs and bed level changes in a tidal creek and its adjacent mudflat during high tides the bed shear stress average 0 18 n m2 was low in the mudflats meanwhile ssc average 0 99 g l was high due to large amounts of sediment input from large scale estuarine waters leading to deposition and an elevation increase of 29 mm in the mudflats in the meantime sediment in the tidal creek was resuspended by the relatively high bed shear stress average 0 37 n m2 and deposited over the salt marsh during over marsh periods the elevation of the tidal creek decreased by 35 mm by contrary during low tides the water depth was low and the bed shear stress average 0 21 n m2 was relatively high in the mudflats which resulted in sediment resuspension average ssc 0 97 g l and an elevation decrease of 25 mm the resuspended sediment was delivered to the tidal creek and deposited due to the low bed shear stress average 0 09 n m2 the elevation of the tidal creek increased by 20 mm this study generalizes a unified concept model to describe the sedimentary processes in intertidal environments based on a sediment transport conduit in the mudflat creek systems the sediments from the estuarine waters are transported to the mudflats and deposited during flood tides afterwards the sediments are resuspended from the mudflats and transported to tidal creeks during neap tides when next over marsh tides come the sediments in the tidal creeks are flushed over the salt marshes and deposit through over marsh currents the results indicate that there is an erosion deposition cycle in the mudflat creek system during a spring neap tidal cycle under fair weather conditions which further influences the morphodynamics over the salt marsh and sedimentary processes in intertidal environments these findings likely represent the morphological configuration of most intertidal environments further studies are required to better understand the effect of sediment fluxes across marsh edges on intertidal evolutions additional impact factors may also worth further investigation 6 declarations of interest none acknowledgments this study was supported by the national natural science foundation

6893,diurnal heat signal has been widely used to infer the seepage flux and thermal diffusivity in streambeds the theoretical basis is the one dimensional 1 d analytical solution of heat advection dispersion equation with sinusoidal boundary condition and homogeneous initial condition stallman 1965 however the assumption of homogeneous initial condition made in stallman 1965 is physically unrealistic and the assumption of steady flow is often violated when water level changes rapidly e g flooding to incorporate the realistic initial condition an innovative solution for 1 d heat transport with sinusoidal boundary condition and arbitrary initial condition is proposed this solution makes it possible to accurately simulate heat transport with transient flux by sequentially applying the new solution at small time interval synthetic temperature signals at different depth of streambeds are generated to study the impact of transient flux to the estimation of water flux and thermal diffusivity here are some major findings firstly the calculated flux is sensitive to the flux dynamics the faster the flux increases or decreases the less accurate the calculated flux is secondly using temperature time series from deep sensor pair is more likely to cause erroneous estimation of flux because heat signal damps fast with depth thirdly the heat tracer method for estimating water flux is sensitive to the thermal properties of saturated sediments large thermal diffusivity leads to high uncertainty for flux estimation keywords seepage flux thermal diffusivity surface water groundwater exchange transient condition 1 introduction the technique of using heat as a tracer to estimate the seepage flux between surface water and groundwater is widely used in recent decade anderson 2005 goto et al 2005 hatch et al 2006 keery et al 2007 rau et al 2010 mccallum et al 2012 luce et al 2013 rau et al 2017 the key idea behind this technique is that the transport of a diurnal heat signal in the streambed is strongly related to the advective velocity and the direction of seepage flux thus the recorded temperature time series below the surface of streambeds could be used to infer the flux the theoretical basis of this method is the analytical solution of one dimensional 1 d heat advection dispersion equation with a sinusoidal boundary condition and a homogeneous initial condition representing the diurnal heat transport in streambeds stallman 1965 several methods have been developed to calculate seepage flux and thermal diffusivity based on the solution of stallman 1965 hatch et al 2006 and keery et al 2007 proposed two different formulas respectively to calculate seepage flux based on the amplitude ratio or the phase shift these two expressions generate identical results and have been verified by field tests rau et al 2010 however one disadvantage of these two methods is that they require the prior information of thermal conductivity of the saturated streambed which is usually unknown mccallum et al 2012 and luce et al 2013 gave two other formulas to estimate seepage flux and thermal diffusivity and they do not require the prior information of thermal conductivity of the saturated streambed these four methods combined with a data filtering technique were implemented in vflux 2 a widely used open source code to calculate seepage flux and thermal diffusivity by analyzing the time series temperature data irvine et al 2015 the imposed assumptions in stallman 1965 such as a homogeneous initial condition and a steady flow field cause concerns while using a heat tracer to estimate seepage flux of a streambed or vertical flux of a deep zone lautz 2012 conducted laboratory experiments with a controlled temporally dependent flux to verify vflux gordon et al 2012 an earlier version of vflux 2 which only included the hatch et al 2006 and keery et al 2007 methods rau et al 2015 investigated the influence of different filtering techniques on the estimation of seepage flux and thermal diffusivity under step and linear decreasing fluxes schemes irvine et al 2016 studied the influence of heterogeneity multidimensional flow and surface temperature variation on the estimation of vertical flux using the steady state solution developed by bredehoeft and papadopulos 1965 luce et al 2017 demonstrated that the sinusoidal boundary condition of single frequency used in stallman 1965 is equivalent to an arbitrary surface temperature forcing thus asymmetrical diurnal shift of temperature is not a concern however the impact of the homogeneous initial condition assumption used in stallman 1965 has been largely overlooked possibly due to the lack of a physically based mathematical model that considers an inhomogeneous initial condition another point to note is that the analytical solution of stallman 1965 is borrowed from suzuki 1960 which emphasized that the solution was a first order approximation to v 2 k where v is the vertical flow velocity and k is the thermal conductivity the influence of such an approximation has never been carefully checked as well the objective of this work is twofold the first is to investigate the impact of the assumption of a homogenous initial condition on the calculated temperature profile constrained by the sinusoidal boundary condition the second is to check the reliability of using vflux 2 to estimate seepage flux and thermal diffusivity under transient flow condition to accomplish these objectives two steps are taken the first step is to establish a physically based new mathematical model and then propose an exact analytical solution that considers an inhomogeneous initial condition note that such an analytical solution makes it possible to accurately simulate the heat transport in transient flux condition by sequentially applying the solution at small time interval and setting the initial condition to be the final temperature distribution of the previous time step the second step is using vflux 2 on synthetic temperature signals generated in streambeds with different predefined thermal diffusivities and transient fluxes the calculated results are compared with the predefined values to diagnose the impact of the violation of assumptions on the calculated results we will use two examples downwelling flux under linearly increasing and decreasing conditions to illustrate the method 2 method the schematic diagram for monitoring temperature in streambeds using heat sensors is shown in fig 1 the thermal property of streambeds is assumed to be homogeneous diurnal heat transport in streambeds is assumed to be in vertical direction only thus the problem is 1 d in nature the origin of a 1 d coordinate system is located at the interface of stream streambed with the z axis downward the installed sensors are usually within 0 5 m below the surface of the streambed and the distance between each pair of consecutive sensors is in the range of a few centimeters to tens of centimeters the amplitude of temperature profile damps with increasing depth the governing equation of 1 d heat

boundary condition at the stream streambed interface t 0 is the subsurface temperature that is not affected by the surface temperature variation and ti z is the initial temperature distribution θ

κ p i v 2 2 the advantage of the approximate solution 3a is its compact form that decouples the exponential decay term and the periodic term however the accuracy of the approximate solution has never been thoroughly checked up to present to evaluate stallman 1965 solution an exact solution needs to be developed first following is the development of the exact solution firstly in order to remove the advection term in eq 1a one can use the following transform 4 t t exp v v t 2 z 4 κ substituting eq 4 into eqs 1a 1d one gets 5a t t κ 2 t z 2 5b t z 0 t exp v 2 t 4 κ i a i cos 2 π t p i θ i 5c t z t

gfm gfm is an alternative to the analytical approach such as laplace transform and fourier transform one advantage of gfm over other methods is that it can handle different initial conditions in the same manner following is the derivation of the gfm solution use operator l to represent the storage term and conduction term of eq 5a 6 l t κ 2 z 2 gfm can be expressed as leij and van genuchten 2000a leij et al 2000b chen and zhan 2018 7 g t l t d z d t t l g t d z d t b o u n d a r y t e r m s i n i t i a l t e r m s where gt is the green s function for heat conduction in a semi infinite domain whose form is equivalent to the solution of an instantaneous heat source that is released at location z in time t constrained by the same boundary condition as the original ade z and t are dummy variables representing arbitrary location and time point respectively l is the adjoint operator of l 8 l t κ 2 z 2 note that the sign of the storage term in l is opposite to that of l gt is unknown and needs to be obtained first by solving 9 l g t δ z z t t where δ z z t t is the dirac delta function some green s functions for common heat conduction problems are given in carslaw and jaeger 1986 once the green s function is known the solution to eqs 5a 5d could be represented as carslaw and jaeger 1986 10 t 0 g t t 0 t i z exp v z 2 κ d z κ 0 t g t z z 0 i a i cos 2 π p i t θ i exp v 2 t 4 κ

κ d t t is thus obtained according to eq 4 13 t t exp v 2 z v t 4 κ three points are notable regarding the applicability of eqs 12 and 13 firstly the new solution considers an arbitrary initial condition in other words the initial temperature could be an arbitrary function of depth below the land surface thus an accurate description of the damping effect of a diurnal heat signal with depth is possible the first integral term in eq 12 can be removed at late time when the influence of initial condition is negligible secondly the new solution is an exact solution to eq 1 while stallman 1965 solution is only a first order approximation the difference between these two solutions will be discussed shortly thirdly numerical integral solver such as integral function in matlab is used to calculate t in eq 12 no compact expression similar to eq 3 is found yet for simplifying eq 12 because the arbitrary initial condition could be in any form eqs 12 and 13 are denoted as the proposed solution while the approximate solution of stallman 1965 is called the stallman solution hereinafter for abbreviation 3 results and discussion 3 1 test of the new solution before discussing the difference between the proposed solution and the stallman solution the proposed solution must be checked for its accuracy and robustness since the proposed solution is novel and there is no other closed form solution available to compare it is thus compared with a finite element numerical solution obtained by comsol multiphysics the accuracy of numerical solutions of comsol has been demonstrated in numerous studies for fluid flow and solute transport in porous media zhu et al 2016 chen et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 liang et al 2017 comsol can handle the 1 d heat advection dispersion problem with a periodic boundary condition by directly assigning an algebraic expression e g a cosine function to the boundary the model setting is as follows v 1 10 6 m s p 1 day κ 2 3 10 7 m2 s ti z 0 these parameter values are quite typical in real setting and more detailed discussion about the choice of parameter values will be given in section 3 3 note that only the diurnal component is considered in this study for simplification other components such as seasonal and weekly components need to be removed first in real application using signal processing technique such as dynamic harmonic regression fig 2 shows the distribution curves generated by the analytical and numerical methods at 0 1 day and 1 1 day and the stallman solution is displayed for comparison as one can see the proposed solution matches the numerical solution very well however the distribution curves predicted by the stallman solution at different time are the same as long as the time difference between the snapshots of distribution curves is multiples of the period this observation indicates that the first order approximate solution of stallman neglects the transient behavior at early time 3 2 difference between the stallman solution and the proposed solution neglecting the transient behavior at early time implies that the heat transport is only impacted by the boundary condition now the question is how long after the initial condition is imposed so that the stallman solution can be safely applied to answer this question the distribution curves using the stallman solution dashed line and the proposed solution solid line at two different velocity values of 5 10 6 m s blue and 1 10 5 m s red after 2 days are plotted for comparison in fig 3 a the distribution curves of an instantaneous source i s following eq 1a and the advective front a f are also plotted in fig 3a to illustrate the influence range of dispersion and advection respectively as one can see the stallman solution and the proposed solution overlap at shallow depths which are well behind the advective front the difference between these two solutions is significant near the advective front meaning that the impact of initial condition cannot be neglected at the depth close to the advective front this finding implies that the advective front is a good indicator to show when the influence of initial condition can be neglected the distribution of an instantaneous source follows the gaussian distribution with a mean μ vt and a standard deviation σ 2 κ t the ratio of the area within the ranges of μ σ μ 2σ and μ 3σ over the entire area under the instantaneous distribution curve are 68 27 95 45 and 99 73 respectively according to the property of the gaussian distribution in other words once the advective front is known the depth shallower than μ 3σ can be safely assumed to be not affected by the initial condition thus the stallman solution can be applied fig 3b shows the comparison of these two solutions in terms of breakthrough curves btcs at depths of 0 05 m 0 15 m and 0 25 m as one can see the influence of the initial condition can be neglected in less than one period after new initial condition is imposed because the monitored points are usually shallow less than 1 m below riverbed and the advective front with a seepage velocity about 1 10 6 m s passes the monitored point quickly 3 3 impact of transient flux to the estimation of v and κ the methods developed based on the stallman solution to estimate the flux and thermal diffusivity are not suitable for the situation with highly dynamic flux because the stallman solution assumes the flow field is in steady state lautz 2010 rau et al 2015 irvine et al 2016 the following is to investigate the performance of using heat tracer method to estimate the seepage flux and thermal conductivity under transient condition note that using a single function to approximate the transient flux caused by the variation of water level is difficult the discharge curve during flooding or dam release may exhibit a typical shape such as exponential recession however the water level is not linearly related to the discharge because the width of river channel is not constant with depth a simple scheme linearly increasing or decreasing flux is adopted in this study to approximate the transient condition for demonstration purpose despite that any type of flux change can be approximated using the proposed approach as long as the flux change is given the linear flux variation is approximated as step change of velocity at a sufficiently small time interval in this study since the proposed solution considers an arbitrary initial condition an accurate simulation of heat transport in the streambed with a varying flux can be achieved by a forward marching procedure the basic idea is dividing the time of interest into many small time intervals and then solving the problem step by step from beginning t 0 when solving the problem at the n 1 th time step where n 1 2 3 one can set the final temperature distribution obtained from the n th time step as the initial condition of the n 1 th time step this approach to model the 1 d heat transport under transient condition does not run into numerical issue which might be encountered using numerical model by setting the flow boundary condition change quickly although the computational cost will increase with fine time step the schemes to model the heat transport in streambeds under transient condition are listed in table 1 three monitor points are located at 0 05 m 0 15 m and 0 25 m below the surface of streambed respectively two values of thermal diffusivity 2 3 10 7 m2 s and 1 5 10 6 m2 s are used the large value 1 5 10 6 m2 s represents the maximum thermal diffusivity observed in hydrothermal deposit and the small value 2 3 10 7 m2 s represents the minimum thermal diffusivity observed in marine sediment goto et al 2005 the initial temperature of the streambed is set to be homogeneous as 10 c and the amplitude of diurnal signal is 1 c the initial flux is assumed to be downwelling at 1 10 6 m s for the first day at the end of day 1 the downwelling flux starts to increase at the time intervals of 0 05 day 0 1 day and 0 25 day respectively with a constant rate of 1 10 7 m s per time step cases 1 6 in table 1 such a setting could represent a flooding event that leads to the increase of seepage flux with rising water level and a smaller time interval corresponds to faster rising of water level fig 4 shows btcs of temperature at monitor points with downwelling flux increasing linearly for the minimum thermal diffusivity case fig 4a c the peak value increases as flux increasing fig 4a note that the peaks during the first day are strongly impacted by the initial condition as shown in fig 3 so only the second and later peaks are used for the calculation of seepage flux and thermal diffusivity for the maximum thermal diffusivity case fig 4d f the damping of the heat signal is less than that of the minimum thermal diffusivity case the formula to calculate the flux and thermal diffusivity in mccallum et al 2012 are 14 v c s c w δ z p 2 ln 2 a r 4 π 2 δ ϕ 2 δ ϕ 16 π 4 δ ϕ 4 8 p 2 π 2 δ ϕ 2 ln 2 a r p 4 ln 4 a r and 15 κ δ z 2 p 2 ln a r 4 π 2 δ ϕ 2 p 2 ln 2 a r δ ϕ p 2 ln 2 a r 4 π 2 δ ϕ 2 p 2 ln 2 a r 4 π 2 δ ϕ 2 where δz is the distance between two monitor points ar and δϕ are the amplitude ratio and phase shift between a deeper point and a shallower point respectively note that the calculated flux is considered to be the flux at the center of the sensor pair gordon et al 2012 fig 5 shows the calculated flux at different transient conditions for the cases with minimum thermal diffusivity cases 1 3 fig 5a c the calculated fluxes exhibit trends similar to the pre defined true flux except the curve at the deepest location z 0 2 m in case 1 a greater discrepancy near t 1 day is observed when the flux starts to change for the cases with the maximum thermal diffusivity cases 4 6 fig 5d f the calculated flux obviously deviates from the pre defined true value when the flux changes rapidly fig 5d e two pointes are worth to be pointed out firstly although the shallow sensor pair has better performance compared with the deep sensor pair due to the fast damping of diurnal signal installing multiple heat sensors at different depth is still a common setting in field monitoring of streambed temperature one reason is deep sensor has the capability to detect the upwelling of groundwater because groundwater temperature is usually different from the river temperature secondly signal processing methods will also introduce error while the flux is under transient condition rau et al 2015 this error is inevitable and may be magnified at large thermal diffusivity which limits the practical use of heat method to estimate the dynamic flux fig 6 shows the calculated thermal diffusivities when the true value is small a faster increasing flux leads to a greater deviation of the calculated thermal diffusivity from its true value cases 1 3 fig 6a c on the contrary the impact of flux variation to the calculated thermal diffusivity is relatively small at the maximum thermal diffusivity setting cases 4 6 fig 6d f gordon et al 2012 pointed out that the estimated flux is sensitive to the thermal properties of saturated sediments using the hatch et al 2006 method and the sensitivity increases with flux for the mccallum et al 2012 method our study shows similar observation the thermal property is the major source of uncertainty as all those temperature based methods are developed from the analytical solution of 1 d heat conduction and advection when the stream water drops to a level lower than the water table in the stream bank the downwelling flux will gradually decrease to zero and then reverse to upwelling flux fig 7 shows the temperature time series when the downwelling flux decreases at different rates from an initial value of 1 10 6 m s three different rates including 1 10 7 m s per 0 05 day 0 1 day and 0 25 day are considered in fig 7 comparing figs 4 and 7 one can see that the peaks decrease over time in fig 7 while the peaks increase over time when flux increases fig 8 displays the calculated fluxes with the minimum thermal diffusivity cases 7 9 fig 8a c and the maximum thermal diffusivity cases 10 12 fig 8d f as one can see the mccallum s et al 2012 approach can accurately capture the decreasing flux trend for all cases except for case 7 in which the thermal diffusivity is the minimum and the flux decreases the fastest another notable point is that the flux curves at the minimum thermal diffusivity setting are smoother than those at the maximum thermal diffusivity setting furthermore a smaller rate of flux variation with time will lead to a better match of the calculated results with their true values fig 9 displays the calculated thermal diffusivities with the minimum thermal diffusivity cases 7 9 fig 9a c and the maximum thermal diffusivity cases 10 12 fig 9d f the highly transient flux cause erroneous estimation of thermal diffusivity especially for deep sensor pair 4 concerns in practical application the accuracy of using eqs 14 and 15 to estimate seepage flux and thermal diffusivity are impacted by the transient condition and sensor location rapid flux change may lead to erroneous estimation of flux especially when the temperature signals from deep sensors are used these findings imply that it should be cautious when interpreting the seepage flux and thermal diffusivity during rapid flux variation e g dam release flood event mccallum et al 2012 calculated the seepage flux and thermal diffusivity using 8 month monitoring data from the namoi river murray darling basin australia as shown in fig 10 two temperature sensors are at the depths of 5 cm and 23 cm respectively and two major events are encountered over the eight months the first event is dam release occurred in early dec 2009 and the second event is flooding occurred in early jan 2010 these two events result in 1 meter rise and 6 meter rise of river level respectively the river is in a slightly gaining condition before the dam release and the condition is supposed to be changed from gaining to loosing after the rise of river level however the calculated seepage flux oscillates between downwelling and upwelling after dam release even with positive hydraulic gradient between the river and aquifer the unreasonable oscillation is attributed to the violation of steady flux assumption using eq 14 and such oscillation would be amplified when the thermal diffusivity is relatively large above the value 8 5 10 7 m2 s which is the average between the maximum and minimum thermal conductivity see fig 6d f for the flooding event the calculated downwelling flux exceeds 4 10 6 m s although the calculated flux captures the sudden rise of river level one cannot be completely sure that this value is accurate enough because unrealistic results may be obtained when seepage flux changes rapidly figs 5a and 8a for thermal diffusivity fig 10b the value after these two events dam release and flooding is lower than that before these two events due to the scouring and sedimentation colmation process mccallum et al 2012 the unrealistic thermal diffusivity during these two events results from the violation of the assumptions in mccallum et al 2012 method see eq 15 5 conclusions the proposed gfm could be adapted to other 1 d heat flow problems with different kinds of boundary condition as long as 1 d heat flow assumption is reasonable centimeter scale transport of diurnal heat signal in riverbeds and hundred meter scale transport of air temperature in subsurface caused by climate change are two typical cases where 1 d assumption is considered to be reasonable the limitation of the 1 d model primarily comes from the assumption of steady flow it should be noted that using heat as a tracer to estimate the seepage flux is currently preferable despite of the limitations mentioned above this is partially because the heat signal which is strongly impacted by flux is easily to be captured and less affected by the streambed heterogeneity rau et al 2014 in summary the following are the main findings of this study 1 the stallman solution neglects the impact of initial condition and such simplification is valid when the advective front is much beyond the observation point 2 the accuracy of mccallum et al 2012 method relies on flux dynamics and sensor location highly dynamic flux especially when the seepage flux reverses and using temperature time series from deep sensor pair often result in erroneous estimation of flux 3 the heat tracer method for estimating flux is sensitive to the thermal properties of saturated sediments large thermal diffusivity leads to high uncertainty of flux estimation 
6893,diurnal heat signal has been widely used to infer the seepage flux and thermal diffusivity in streambeds the theoretical basis is the one dimensional 1 d analytical solution of heat advection dispersion equation with sinusoidal boundary condition and homogeneous initial condition stallman 1965 however the assumption of homogeneous initial condition made in stallman 1965 is physically unrealistic and the assumption of steady flow is often violated when water level changes rapidly e g flooding to incorporate the realistic initial condition an innovative solution for 1 d heat transport with sinusoidal boundary condition and arbitrary initial condition is proposed this solution makes it possible to accurately simulate heat transport with transient flux by sequentially applying the new solution at small time interval synthetic temperature signals at different depth of streambeds are generated to study the impact of transient flux to the estimation of water flux and thermal diffusivity here are some major findings firstly the calculated flux is sensitive to the flux dynamics the faster the flux increases or decreases the less accurate the calculated flux is secondly using temperature time series from deep sensor pair is more likely to cause erroneous estimation of flux because heat signal damps fast with depth thirdly the heat tracer method for estimating water flux is sensitive to the thermal properties of saturated sediments large thermal diffusivity leads to high uncertainty for flux estimation keywords seepage flux thermal diffusivity surface water groundwater exchange transient condition 1 introduction the technique of using heat as a tracer to estimate the seepage flux between surface water and groundwater is widely used in recent decade anderson 2005 goto et al 2005 hatch et al 2006 keery et al 2007 rau et al 2010 mccallum et al 2012 luce et al 2013 rau et al 2017 the key idea behind this technique is that the transport of a diurnal heat signal in the streambed is strongly related to the advective velocity and the direction of seepage flux thus the recorded temperature time series below the surface of streambeds could be used to infer the flux the theoretical basis of this method is the analytical solution of one dimensional 1 d heat advection dispersion equation with a sinusoidal boundary condition and a homogeneous initial condition representing the diurnal heat transport in streambeds stallman 1965 several methods have been developed to calculate seepage flux and thermal diffusivity based on the solution of stallman 1965 hatch et al 2006 and keery et al 2007 proposed two different formulas respectively to calculate seepage flux based on the amplitude ratio or the phase shift these two expressions generate identical results and have been verified by field tests rau et al 2010 however one disadvantage of these two methods is that they require the prior information of thermal conductivity of the saturated streambed which is usually unknown mccallum et al 2012 and luce et al 2013 gave two other formulas to estimate seepage flux and thermal diffusivity and they do not require the prior information of thermal conductivity of the saturated streambed these four methods combined with a data filtering technique were implemented in vflux 2 a widely used open source code to calculate seepage flux and thermal diffusivity by analyzing the time series temperature data irvine et al 2015 the imposed assumptions in stallman 1965 such as a homogeneous initial condition and a steady flow field cause concerns while using a heat tracer to estimate seepage flux of a streambed or vertical flux of a deep zone lautz 2012 conducted laboratory experiments with a controlled temporally dependent flux to verify vflux gordon et al 2012 an earlier version of vflux 2 which only included the hatch et al 2006 and keery et al 2007 methods rau et al 2015 investigated the influence of different filtering techniques on the estimation of seepage flux and thermal diffusivity under step and linear decreasing fluxes schemes irvine et al 2016 studied the influence of heterogeneity multidimensional flow and surface temperature variation on the estimation of vertical flux using the steady state solution developed by bredehoeft and papadopulos 1965 luce et al 2017 demonstrated that the sinusoidal boundary condition of single frequency used in stallman 1965 is equivalent to an arbitrary surface temperature forcing thus asymmetrical diurnal shift of temperature is not a concern however the impact of the homogeneous initial condition assumption used in stallman 1965 has been largely overlooked possibly due to the lack of a physically based mathematical model that considers an inhomogeneous initial condition another point to note is that the analytical solution of stallman 1965 is borrowed from suzuki 1960 which emphasized that the solution was a first order approximation to v 2 k where v is the vertical flow velocity and k is the thermal conductivity the influence of such an approximation has never been carefully checked as well the objective of this work is twofold the first is to investigate the impact of the assumption of a homogenous initial condition on the calculated temperature profile constrained by the sinusoidal boundary condition the second is to check the reliability of using vflux 2 to estimate seepage flux and thermal diffusivity under transient flow condition to accomplish these objectives two steps are taken the first step is to establish a physically based new mathematical model and then propose an exact analytical solution that considers an inhomogeneous initial condition note that such an analytical solution makes it possible to accurately simulate the heat transport in transient flux condition by sequentially applying the solution at small time interval and setting the initial condition to be the final temperature distribution of the previous time step the second step is using vflux 2 on synthetic temperature signals generated in streambeds with different predefined thermal diffusivities and transient fluxes the calculated results are compared with the predefined values to diagnose the impact of the violation of assumptions on the calculated results we will use two examples downwelling flux under linearly increasing and decreasing conditions to illustrate the method 2 method the schematic diagram for monitoring temperature in streambeds using heat sensors is shown in fig 1 the thermal property of streambeds is assumed to be homogeneous diurnal heat transport in streambeds is assumed to be in vertical direction only thus the problem is 1 d in nature the origin of a 1 d coordinate system is located at the interface of stream streambed with the z axis downward the installed sensors are usually within 0 5 m below the surface of the streambed and the distance between each pair of consecutive sensors is in the range of a few centimeters to tens of centimeters the amplitude of temperature profile damps with increasing depth the governing equation of 1 d heat

been thoroughly checked up to present to evaluate stallman 1965 solution an exact solution needs to be developed first following is the development of the exact solution firstly in order to remove the advection term in eq 1a one can use the following transform 4 t t exp v v t 2 z 4 κ substituting eq 4 into eqs 1a 1d one gets 5a t t κ 2 t z 2 5b t z 0 t exp v 2 t 4 κ i a i cos 2 π t p i θ i 5c t z t

gfm gfm is an alternative to the analytical approach such as laplace transform and fourier transform one advantage of gfm over other methods is that it can handle different initial conditions in the same manner following is the derivation of the gfm solution use operator l to represent the storage term and conduction term of eq 5a 6 l t κ 2 z 2 gfm can be expressed as leij and van genuchten 2000a leij et al 2000b chen and zhan 2018 7 g t l t d z d t t l g t d z d t b o u n d a r y t e r m s i n i t i a l t e r m s where gt is the green s function for heat conduction in a semi infinite domain whose form is equivalent to the solution of an instantaneous heat source that is released at location z in time t constrained by the same boundary condition as the original ade z and t are dummy variables representing arbitrary location and time point respectively l is the adjoint operator of l 8 l t κ 2 z 2 note that the sign of the storage term in l is opposite to that of l gt is unknown and needs to be obtained first by solving 9 l g t δ z z t t where δ z z t t is the dirac delta function some green s functions for common heat conduction problems are given in carslaw and jaeger 1986 once the green s function is known the solution to eqs 5a 5d could be represented as carslaw and jaeger 1986 10 t 0 g t t 0 t i z exp v z 2 κ d z κ 0 t g t z z 0 i a i cos 2 π p i t θ i exp v 2 t 4 κ

κ d t t is thus obtained according to eq 4 13 t t exp v 2 z v t 4 κ three points are notable regarding the applicability of eqs 12 and 13 firstly the new solution considers an arbitrary initial condition in other words the initial temperature could be an arbitrary function of depth below the land surface thus an accurate description of the damping effect of a diurnal heat signal with depth is possible the first integral term in eq 12 can be removed at late time when the influence of initial condition is negligible secondly the new solution is an exact solution to eq 1 while stallman 1965 solution is only a first order approximation the difference between these two solutions will be discussed shortly thirdly numerical integral solver such as integral function in matlab is used to calculate t in eq 12 no compact expression similar to eq 3 is found yet for simplifying eq 12 because the arbitrary initial condition could be in any form eqs 12 and 13 are denoted as the proposed solution while the approximate solution of stallman 1965 is called the stallman solution hereinafter for abbreviation 3 results and discussion 3 1 test of the new solution before discussing the difference between the proposed solution and the stallman solution the proposed solution must be checked for its accuracy and robustness since the proposed solution is novel and there is no other closed form solution available to compare it is thus compared with a finite element numerical solution obtained by comsol multiphysics the accuracy of numerical solutions of comsol has been demonstrated in numerous studies for fluid flow and solute transport in porous media zhu et al 2016 chen et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 liang et al 2017 comsol can handle the 1 d heat advection dispersion problem with a periodic boundary condition by directly assigning an algebraic expression e g a cosine function to the boundary the model setting is as follows v 1 10 6 m s p 1 day κ 2 3 10 7 m2 s ti z 0 these parameter values are quite typical in real setting and more detailed discussion about the choice of parameter values will be given in section 3 3 note that only the diurnal component is considered in this study for simplification other components such as seasonal and weekly components need to be removed first in real application using signal processing technique such as dynamic harmonic regression fig 2 shows the distribution curves generated by the analytical and numerical methods at 0 1 day and 1 1 day and the stallman solution is displayed for comparison as one can see the proposed solution matches the numerical solution very well however the distribution curves predicted by the stallman solution at different time are the same as long as the time difference between the snapshots of distribution curves is multiples of the period this observation indicates that the first order approximate solution of stallman neglects the transient behavior at early time 3 2 difference between the stallman solution and the proposed solution neglecting the transient behavior at early time implies that the heat transport is only impacted by the boundary condition now the question is how long after the initial condition is imposed so that the stallman solution can be safely applied to answer this question the distribution curves using the stallman solution dashed line and the proposed solution solid line at two different velocity values of 5 10 6 m s blue and 1 10 5 m s red after 2 days are plotted for comparison in fig 3 a the distribution curves of an instantaneous source i s following eq 1a and the advective front a f are also plotted in fig 3a to illustrate the influence range of dispersion and advection respectively as one can see the stallman solution and the proposed solution overlap at shallow depths which are well behind the advective front the difference between these two solutions is significant near the advective front meaning that the impact of initial condition cannot be neglected at the depth close to the advective front this finding implies that the advective front is a good indicator to show when the influence of initial condition can be neglected the distribution of an instantaneous source follows the gaussian distribution with a mean μ vt and a standard deviation σ 2 κ t the ratio of the area within the ranges of μ σ μ 2σ and μ 3σ over the entire area under the instantaneous distribution curve are 68 27 95 45 and 99 73 respectively according to the property of the gaussian distribution in other words once the advective front is known the depth shallower than μ 3σ can be safely assumed to be not affected by the initial condition thus the stallman solution can be applied fig 3b shows the comparison of these two solutions in terms of breakthrough curves btcs at depths of 0 05 m 0 15 m and 0 25 m as one can see the influence of the initial condition can be neglected in less than one period after new initial condition is imposed because the monitored points are usually shallow less than 1 m below riverbed and the advective front with a seepage velocity about 1 10 6 m s passes the monitored point quickly 3 3 impact of transient flux to the estimation of v and κ the methods developed based on the stallman solution to estimate the flux and thermal diffusivity are not suitable for the situation with highly dynamic flux because the stallman solution assumes the flow field is in steady state lautz 2010 rau et al 2015 irvine et al 2016 the following is to investigate the performance of using heat tracer method to estimate the seepage flux and thermal conductivity under transient condition note that using a single function to approximate the transient flux caused by the variation of water level is difficult the discharge curve during flooding or dam release may exhibit a typical shape such as exponential recession however the water level is not linearly related to the discharge because the width of river channel is not constant with depth a simple scheme linearly increasing or decreasing flux is adopted in this study to approximate the transient condition for demonstration purpose despite that any type of flux change can be approximated using the proposed approach as long as the flux change is given the linear flux variation is approximated as step change of velocity at a sufficiently small time interval in this study since the proposed solution considers an arbitrary initial condition an accurate simulation of heat transport in the streambed with a varying flux can be achieved by a forward marching procedure the basic idea is dividing the time of interest into many small time intervals and then solving the problem step by step from beginning t 0 when solving the problem at the n 1 th time step where n 1 2 3 one can set the final temperature distribution obtained from the n th time step as the initial condition of the n 1 th time step this approach to model the 1 d heat transport under transient condition does not run into numerical issue which might be encountered using numerical model by setting the flow boundary condition change quickly although the computational cost will increase with fine time step the schemes to model the heat transport in streambeds under transient condition are listed in table 1 three monitor points are located at 0 05 m 0 15 m and 0 25 m below the surface of streambed respectively two values of thermal diffusivity 2 3 10 7 m2 s and 1 5 10 6 m2 s are used the large value 1 5 10 6 m2 s represents the maximum thermal diffusivity observed in hydrothermal deposit and the small value 2 3 10 7 m2 s represents the minimum thermal diffusivity observed in marine sediment goto et al 2005 the initial temperature of the streambed is set to be homogeneous as 10 c and the amplitude of diurnal signal is 1 c the initial flux is assumed to be downwelling at 1 10 6 m s for the first day at the end of day 1 the downwelling flux starts to increase at the time intervals of 0 05 day 0 1 day and 0 25 day respectively with a constant rate of 1 10 7 m s per time step cases 1 6 in table 1 such a setting could represent a flooding event that leads to the increase of seepage flux with rising water level and a smaller time interval corresponds to faster rising of water level fig 4 shows btcs of temperature at monitor points with downwelling flux increasing linearly for the minimum thermal diffusivity case fig 4a c the peak value increases as flux increasing fig 4a note that the peaks during the first day are strongly impacted by the initial condition as shown in fig 3 so only the second and later peaks are used for the calculation of seepage flux and thermal diffusivity for the maximum thermal diffusivity case fig 4d f the damping of the heat signal is less than that of the minimum thermal diffusivity case the formula to calculate the flux and thermal diffusivity in mccallum et al 2012 are 14 v c s c w δ z p 2 ln 2 a r 4 π 2 δ ϕ 2 δ ϕ 16 π 4 δ ϕ 4 8 p 2 π 2 δ ϕ 2 ln 2 a r p 4 ln 4 a r and 15 κ δ z 2 p 2 ln a r 4 π 2 δ ϕ 2 p 2 ln 2 a r δ ϕ p 2 ln 2 a r 4 π 2 δ ϕ 2 p 2 ln 2 a r 4 π 2 δ ϕ 2 where δz is the distance between two monitor points ar and δϕ are the amplitude ratio and phase shift between a deeper point and a shallower point respectively note that the calculated flux is considered to be the flux at the center of the sensor pair gordon et al 2012 fig 5 shows the calculated flux at different transient conditions for the cases with minimum thermal diffusivity cases 1 3 fig 5a c the calculated fluxes exhibit trends similar to the pre defined true flux except the curve at the deepest location z 0 2 m in case 1 a greater discrepancy near t 1 day is observed when the flux starts to change for the cases with the maximum thermal diffusivity cases 4 6 fig 5d f the calculated flux obviously deviates from the pre defined true value when the flux changes rapidly fig 5d e two pointes are worth to be pointed out firstly although the shallow sensor pair has better performance compared with the deep sensor pair due to the fast damping of diurnal signal installing multiple heat sensors at different depth is still a common setting in field monitoring of streambed temperature one reason is deep sensor has the capability to detect the upwelling of groundwater because groundwater temperature is usually different from the river temperature secondly signal processing methods will also introduce error while the flux is under transient condition rau et al 2015 this error is inevitable and may be magnified at large thermal diffusivity which limits the practical use of heat method to estimate the dynamic flux fig 6 shows the calculated thermal diffusivities when the true value is small a faster increasing flux leads to a greater deviation of the calculated thermal diffusivity from its true value cases 1 3 fig 6a c on the contrary the impact of flux variation to the calculated thermal diffusivity is relatively small at the maximum thermal diffusivity setting cases 4 6 fig 6d f gordon et al 2012 pointed out that the estimated flux is sensitive to the thermal properties of saturated sediments using the hatch et al 2006 method and the sensitivity increases with flux for the mccallum et al 2012 method our study shows similar observation the thermal property is the major source of uncertainty as all those temperature based methods are developed from the analytical solution of 1 d heat conduction and advection when the stream water drops to a level lower than the water table in the stream bank the downwelling flux will gradually decrease to zero and then reverse to upwelling flux fig 7 shows the temperature time series when the downwelling flux decreases at different rates from an initial value of 1 10 6 m s three different rates including 1 10 7 m s per 0 05 day 0 1 day and 0 25 day are considered in fig 7 comparing figs 4 and 7 one can see that the peaks decrease over time in fig 7 while the peaks increase over time when flux increases fig 8 displays the calculated fluxes with the minimum thermal diffusivity cases 7 9 fig 8a c and the maximum thermal diffusivity cases 10 12 fig 8d f as one can see the mccallum s et al 2012 approach can accurately capture the decreasing flux trend for all cases except for case 7 in which the thermal diffusivity is the minimum and the flux decreases the fastest another notable point is that the flux curves at the minimum thermal diffusivity setting are smoother than those at the maximum thermal diffusivity setting furthermore a smaller rate of flux variation with time will lead to a better match of the calculated results with their true values fig 9 displays the calculated thermal diffusivities with the minimum thermal diffusivity cases 7 9 fig 9a c and the maximum thermal diffusivity cases 10 12 fig 9d f the highly transient flux cause erroneous estimation of thermal diffusivity especially for deep sensor pair 4 concerns in practical application the accuracy of using eqs 14 and 15 to estimate seepage flux and thermal diffusivity are impacted by the transient condition and sensor location rapid flux change may lead to erroneous estimation of flux especially when the temperature signals from deep sensors are used these findings imply that it should be cautious when interpreting the seepage flux and thermal diffusivity during rapid flux variation e g dam release flood event mccallum et al 2012 calculated the seepage flux and thermal diffusivity using 8 month monitoring data from the namoi river murray darling basin australia as shown in fig 10 two temperature sensors are at the depths of 5 cm and 23 cm respectively and two major events are encountered over the eight months the first event is dam release occurred in early dec 2009 and the second event is flooding occurred in early jan 2010 these two events result in 1 meter rise and 6 meter rise of river level respectively the river is in a slightly gaining condition before the dam release and the condition is supposed to be changed from gaining to loosing after the rise of river level however the calculated seepage flux oscillates between downwelling and upwelling after dam release even with positive hydraulic gradient between the river and aquifer the unreasonable oscillation is attributed to the violation of steady flux assumption using eq 14 and such oscillation would be amplified when the thermal diffusivity is relatively large above the value 8 5 10 7 m2 s which is the average between the maximum and minimum thermal conductivity see fig 6d f for the flooding event the calculated downwelling flux exceeds 4 10 6 m s although the calculated flux captures the sudden rise of river level one cannot be completely sure that this value is accurate enough because unrealistic results may be obtained when seepage flux changes rapidly figs 5a and 8a for thermal diffusivity fig 10b the value after these two events dam release and flooding is lower than that before these two events due to the scouring and sedimentation colmation process mccallum et al 2012 the unrealistic thermal diffusivity during these two events results from the violation of the assumptions in mccallum et al 2012 method see eq 15 5 conclusions the proposed gfm could be adapted to other 1 d heat flow problems with different kinds of boundary condition as long as 1 d heat flow assumption is reasonable centimeter scale transport of diurnal heat signal in riverbeds and hundred meter scale transport of air temperature in subsurface caused by climate change are two typical cases where 1 d assumption is considered to be reasonable the limitation of the 1 d model primarily comes from the assumption of steady flow it should be noted that using heat as a tracer to estimate the seepage flux is currently preferable despite of the limitations mentioned above this is partially because the heat signal which is strongly impacted by flux is easily to be captured and less affected by the streambed heterogeneity rau et al 2014 in summary the following are the main findings of this study 1 the stallman solution neglects the impact of initial condition and such simplification is valid when the advective front is much beyond the observation point 2 the accuracy of mccallum et al 2012 method relies on flux dynamics and sensor location highly dynamic flux especially when the seepage flux reverses and using temperature time series from deep sensor pair often result in erroneous

6894,identification of subregions that share similar historical drought variability provides useful information for drought monitoring mitigation planning and resource allocation this study examined space time historical drought variability for the great plains spanning from 1901 to 2015 by using rotated empirical orthogonal functions reofs the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei on a three month timescale was utilized to examine spatial and temporal changes in agricultural drought we propose a new procedure for identifying the number of reofs to be selected for reconstructing subregions drought event intensities of moderate severe and extreme categories increased in recent years although the number of drought events decreased seasonal reofs demonstrated that 9 12 subregions were adequate to explain a significant proportion of the original variability in the great plains the time series for each subregion was highly correlated to the original spei data and reflected the seasonal meteorological processes that drive drought variability several significant wetting trends were found and there was statistical evidence that drought and wetting event severities had increased for a few subregions summer drought has become more variable across space and time indicating that a more diverse set of resources and strategies might be needed to mitigate impacts of spatially variable drought and wetting events in coming decades winter season drought has become less variable indicating that perhaps resources could be consolidated when dealing with

agricultural impacts during the 1950s wiener et al 2016 rising temperatures would intensify droughts due to increases in evaporation from the soil and transpiration from vegetation leading to more frequent withdrawals of underground water resources ipcc 2014 across the great plains such a change would increase the number of climate related challenges and might include 1 resolving increasing competition among land water and energy resources 2 developing sustainable agricultural systems 3 conserving diverse ecological systems and 4 enhancing the resilience of communities to the impacts of

area between northern mexico and the prairie provinces of canada and experiencing an elevation gain of more than a thousand meters from texas to the base of the rocky mountains although its

utilized to study the mechanisms that drive soil moisture deficits in the great plains showing that antecedent moisture conditions can have an impact on drought severity during the summer growing season livneh and hoerling 2016 broader studies of drought trends over the contiguous united states show a decrease in the percentage of dry areas from the 1950s to 1990s and an increase in the percentage of dry areas since the 1990s dai 2011 these studies demonstrate that regional variations in drought exist and characterizing large areas such as the great plains as a single region can produce misleading drought metrics that are not representative of the unique subregions that may exist emerging techniques provide an opportunity to more accurately identify and characterize the spatio temporal structures of regional historical drought variability empirical orthogonal function eof analysis a multivariate statistical method first used for climatological applications in the 1950s lorenz 1956 has been utilized in diverse applications to analyze the spatial and temporal variability of geophysical datasets bjornsson and venegas 1997 the eof procedure constructs orthogonal linear combinations that explain the maximum amount of variance in both space and time through various rotations of these linear combinations geographic regions of similar variability can be identified karl and koscielny 1982 used eof analysis to regionalize drought across the united states from long term records of pdsi nine broad regions were identified and spectral analysis revealed that regions in the interior u s experienced longer duration droughts other large and small scale studies of drought eofs have been conducted across the globe in regions including china cai et al 2015 romania bojariu et al 2012 cheval et al 2014 portugal martins et al 2012 santos et al 2010 the iberian peninsula vicente serrano 2006 turkey tatli and türkeş 2011 and sicily bonaccorso et al 2003 for example raziei et al 2010 regionalized drought across iran into four subregions based on the variability of the spi at a time scale of 24 months in these studies applications of eof analysis included but were not limited to 1 assessment of the similarities and differences amongst drought indices 2 identification of strong and weak temporal signals in the drought time series and 3 the separation of a region into sub climate regimes while many of these studies did not explore the drought metrics of these eof indices such as duration severity or intensity analysis of these metrics would enhance our understanding of the space time variability of these intrinsic drought characteristics identifying regions that share similar drought variability is important for drought monitoring drought mitigation planning and drought emergency management given that sub climates can span administrative regions interagency cooperation could help improve drought preparedness these insights are crucial for drought management agencies that require detailed but concise information on changes in historical climate for their areas the objective of this study was to investigate the spatial and temporal variability structures of seasonal and full record monthly drought and wetting episodes in the great plains from 1901 to 2015 by identification of subregions from eof analysis we proposed a new eof selection rule to identify significant subregions of variability the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei a recently developed multi scalar drought index that includes the effects of temperature variability was chosen for this analysis as it can identify an increase in drought severity due to higher water demand as a result of evapotranspiration vicente serrano et al 2010 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and data source for this study the domain extended between latitudes 32 and 48 and longitudes 93 and 106 covering over 2 100 000 km2 of the central united states fig 1 monthly precipitation temperature maximum and minimum and potential evapotranspiration coverage 0 5 0 5 grid were obtained from the climatic research unit ts v 3 24 01 cru at the university of east anglia uk harris et al 2014 for years between 1901 and 2015 a total of 891 cru grid points were used for the study cru was chosen for this analysis because its resolution allows for a reasonable number of grid points in the great plains to perform an eof analysis the inclusion of areas surrounding the great plains helps to avoid loss of variability and to isolate important drought features potentially hidden in a larger scale analysis richman 1986 2 2 standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index potential evapotranspiration pe provided by cru was estimated using a variant of the penman monteith procedure and the difference between precipitation and pe is calculated for each month these differences are summed based on the time scale chosen following the procedure in vicente serrano et al 2010 these summed differences are fitted to a three parameter log logistic cumulative probability distribution function and this procedure is performed separately for each month and grid point these probabilities are standardized using the approximation found in zelan and norman 1964 to obtain the spei this index ranges in value from approximately 3 to approximately 3 with negative values indicating drier than normal conditions and positive values indicating conditions wetter than normal spei values less than 2 0 or greater than 2 0 are considered extreme time series of spei values were calculated using tools developed at kansas state university the index was calibrated using data from the period 1931 1990 a time scale of three months was used to represent short term drought which is more closely related to agricultural drought vicente serrano et al 2011 the earliest available 3 month spei was march 1901 the model fit between observed summed differences of precipitation and pe and the expected values from the fitted log logistic distribution was evaluated for each month using the kolmogorov smirnov test at each grid point no test resulted in rejection of the null hypothesis that the data come from the log logistic distribution indicating that the statistical assumptions behind the spei are valid for this region 2 3 drought metrics duration severity and intensity were used to characterize drought and wetting events in each time series of spei values the duration of a drought event is the length of time in months that the drought index is consecutively at or below a given truncation threshold similarly the duration of a wetting event is the length of time in months that the drought index is at or above a given threshold the severity of each event is the cumulative sum of the index over the duration of the event the intensity of a drought or wetting event is its severity divided by its duration and is considered the average index or rating of that event to robustly investigate the significance of drought trends a modified mann kendall test was employed mann 1945 wilks 2011 to avoid inflated p values due to the underestimation of the test statistic variance hamed and ramachandra rao 1998 then the theil sen slope estimate was used to identify the magnitude of the trend theil 1950 the two sample kolmogorov smirnov test was implemented to test the hypothesis that the distributions of a metric calculated from drought or wetting events during different time periods come from the same continuous distribution massey 1951 statistical significance was assessed at a level of 5 for these tests 2 4 empirical orthogonal function analysis for this study grid point location and spei values were the variables and observations respectively for the eof analysis the resulting orthogonal eigenvectors also referred to as eofs point in the direction in which the data vectors exhibit the most variability the principal components pcs which represent how eofs evolve through time are obtained by projecting the eofs onto the original spei data eofs often exhibit characteristics that hamper their utility to isolate individual patterns of variation such as domain shape or size dependence richman 1986 because weather in the great plains is generally dominated by large regional atmospheric processes the orthogonality constraint on the eigenvectors can lead to problems with interpretation especially for the second and subsequent pcs wilks 2011 because of the limitations of eof analysis in the great plains a retained number of eof loadings each retained eof scaled by the square root of its eigenvalue were rotated using varimax rotation kaiser 1958 preisendorfer and mobley 1988 varimax rotation redistributes the variance among rotated eofs reofs and pcs rpcs and attempts to simplify the reofs by pushing loading coefficients toward 0 or 1 the loadings used for this rotation result in nonorthogonal reofs and rpcs wilks 2011 that are more regionally localized and highly correlated to the original spei data than the unrotated eofs and pcs several selection methods are available to determine the number of eofs that capture most of the variability without significant loss of information these methods can be divided into three classes rules based on the size of the last retained eigenvalue hannachi et al 2007 hypothesis testing preisendorfer and mobley 1988 and the structure of the retained principal components wilks 2011 one commonly used selection rule is north s rule of thumb north et al 1982 which uses the sampling error of each eigenvalue to determine non degenerate eofs however north s rule of thumb and other selection methods such as kaiser s rule or rule n overland and preisendorfer 1982 use the size or sampling properties of the eigenvalues and do not adequately fit the objective of this study because they do not use properties of the eofs after rotation we argue that the primary utility of reofs in drought analysis is their ability to identify subregions of similar variability through time without the constraint of orthogonality and propose that a more useful criterion is the correlation of the rpcs with the original data when subregions are identified with rpcs that are highly correlated to the original data drought characteristics can be generalized across large land areas as the number of eofs rotated increases the number of subregions identified increases and correlation coefficients increase at some rotation there is no significant improvement in the correlation coefficients based on this observation we propose a new rule to identify the rotation at which this occurs 2 5 selection rule for determining the number of rotated eofs the selection rule begins when a selected number of leading eofs n are rotated usually two at each of the 891 grid points the original standardized drought dataset is correlated with all n rpc time series using the absolute value of the correlation coefficients for each grid point the rpc time series with the highest correlation is reported as i which is designated as an integer between 1 and n after all grid points have been matched with a single rpc subregions can be identified by grouping together grid points with the same i forming a subregion mask next n 1 leading eofs are independently rotated and the same procedure is applied when n were rotated the subregion mask created using n 1 leading rpcs is projected onto the grid of correlation coefficients that was calculated during the rotation of n eofs this projection creates two samples of paired correlation coefficients corresponding to the subregions in the current and previous rotation for each subregion j identified in the rotation of n 1 eofs the difference between the current and previous correlation coefficients from each rotation at each point in the subregion is calculated and a sign test is performed to test the null hypothesis that the distribution of differences dj has zero median against the alternative that the median is not equal to zero at a significance level of 1 if the result of the sign test is statistically significant h j is recorded as h j 1 m e d i a n d j 0 1 m e d i a n d j 0 if the test is not significant h j is recorded as zero when j 1 n 1 h j 0 there was at least one subregion that had an improvement in the median correlation when an additional eof was rotated n is incremented by one and the procedure is repeated until the first occurrence when the criteria j 1 n 1 h j 0 is met indicative that the inclusion of an additional reof weakened the overall relationship between subregion rpcs and the original spei data the number of desirable reofs is given as n and the procedure concludes no statistically significant gains in information were made in the subregions identified using n 1 reofs and the subregions have become relatively stable it is important to note that there are cases when j 1 n 1 h j 0 at a rotation followed by j 1 n 1 h j 0 when additional reofs are included which is the rational for using the criteria j 1 n 1 h j 0 also if there were n reofs there might be fewer subregions identified based on this correlation procedure after the final number of reofs to rotate has been decided smooth boundaries between subregions can be drawn by interpolating the maximum correlations correlations should be presented with subregion boundaries to illustrate the strength of the relationship of these rpcs with the original spei data in some heterogeneous cases non continuous subregions can be identified due to similarities in drought dynamics separated at distance and these cases should be carefully examined when constructing a subregion mask the numerical magnitude and sign of the standardized rpc of each subregion can be interpreted as a drought index that possesses statistical properties similar to the input dataset i e the spei data thus the same seasonal and full record drought characteristics that were calculated for the spei can also be calculated for the rpc allowing for drought and wetting event detection and statistical analysis across spatial scales larger than a single grid point full record rpcs were used to calculate drought and wetting event durations severities and intensities for events occurring in two periods 1901 1957 and 1958 2015 to assess changes in the distributions of drought metrics to assess whether seasonal drought variability has remained stationary over time an reof analysis was conducted using a fixed number of reofs on a 50 year moving window starting 1901 1950 1902 1951 and continuing until 1966 2015 if the total variance explained by the reofs for each individual analysis stays approximately the same then climatic features that influence drought across the great plains have remained relatively stable through time 3 results 3 1 climate trends and drought statistics cru winter and summer growing season maximum temperature significantly increased between 1901 and 2015 across a majority of the northern and western high plains fig 2 a i and a ii the strongest rates of warming 0 2 0 3 c decade 1 occurred across the foothills of the rocky mountains in new mexico colorado and wyoming in the summer fig 2a ii spatial distribution of trends during the summer and winter growing seasons were relatively similar but across north dakota and minnesota trends were larger during the winter than during the summer during the summer season there were also several notable areas in the eastern great plains that experienced significant decreases in maximum temperature minimum temperature during the winter increased at a faster rate than during the summer fig 2b i and b ii and the proportion of grid points showing a statistically significant increasing trend was greater for minimum temperature than for maximum temperature fig 2a and b the largest differences between winter and summer minimum temperature trends occurred in eastern south dakota north dakota minnesota and new mexico there was also more significant warming in the southeast plains over arkansas during the summer than the winter these warming trends during the summer in the southeast are in direct contrast to the cooling trends displayed by maximum temperatures spatial distributions of growing season precipitation trends for both seasons were more variable and isolated fig 2c i and c ii of the grids with a statistically significant trend in precipitation most exhibited a positive trend fig 2c i and c ii isolated areas east of the 100 meridian during the summer increased at the highest rates and the rate of increase exceeded 2 mm decade 1 across northwest louisiana fig 2c ii during the winter growing season a small number of grids west of the 100 meridian had a modest decrease in precipitation 0 2 to 0 5 mm decade 1 in fig 2c i when evaluated using a threshold of 0 5 the 3 month spei data revealed that there were on average 143 droughts per grid point approximately 1 2 times per year in the great plains with a standard deviation of 8 8 in the great plains between 1901 and 2015 when the period was divided into three time intervals of equal duration excluding 1901 1902 1939 1940 1977 and 1978 2015 the average number of drought events per grid point was approximately 48 49 and 41 respectively notably the last 38 years had significantly fewer drought events than the previous two periods which was offset by an increase in the number of wet events using a threshold of 0 5 53 wet events for 1978 2015 vs 48 for 1902 1939 empirical cumulative frequency distributions ecfd of spei drought event intensities for these three time intervals are shown in fig 3 a the two sample kolmogorov smirnov test was statistically significant for all pairwise comparisons p values 10 5 these distributions demonstrate that of the drought events that occurred between 1978 and 2015 moderate severe and extreme drought events occurred at a higher frequency than in previous periods while the number of drought events decreased in recent years the intensity of those events increased divergence between time interval ecfds is evident beginning at intensities of around 1 75 reaching maximum separation around the transition between severe and moderate drought categories all three time intervals had less than 10 of all droughts rated severe or extreme and 35 40 of all drought events were rated as moderate notice that 0 18 0 09 and 0 50 of all drought events are categorized as extreme for the periods 1902 1939 1940 1977 and 1978 2015 respectively fig 3b in context of the study area and the number of events per period roughly 21 of grids experienced a drought event that rated on average as extreme between 1978 and 2015 while only 4 did between 1902 and 1939 combining the information contained across all grid points shows the overall status of the great plains however more relevant information can be acquired by analyzing the drought and wetting dynamics contained in subregions that contain distinctive information about drought variability 3 2 seasonal reofs 3 2 1 spring and summer thirteen eofs were selected for rotation using spring spei resulting in 10 subregions of similar drought variability that explain about 85 of the total drought variability fig 4 a correlation coefficients of rpcs with the original spei data for grid points within subregions were generally greater than 0 75 these subregions span administrative units and political boundaries for example subregion 1 which covers most of central and western kansas also includes an extension of land in interior southern colorado east of subregion 7 in colorado and northern new mexico it should be noted that the overall correlation in this area of colorado comparatively lower and it may be the result of high variability or it possessing characteristics more in common with areas west of the study domain the area along subregional boundaries in western south dakota demonstrate low correlation r 0 75 illustrating that the variability exhibited in these areas is not explained as well as other areas in the domain using this procedure the spring rpc time series demonstrate clear differences between subregion seasonal drought and wet spell onsets durations and severities fig 4b the time series also highlight periods when subregions experienced similar drought conditions e g drought between 1960 and 1980 based on severity and duration subregion 9 centered on eastern kansas and missouri experienced the longest period of sustained extreme spring drought during the 1960s spring droughts occurring during the 1960s and 1970s appear to have had somewhat larger areal coverage as evident by the red bands across most subregions in fig 4b the 2011 2012 springtime drought was the worst rpc 2 for subregion 4 in the texas panhandle overall each time series shows its own unique drought characteristics with differences in onset duration and intensity of spring drought events fourteen eofs were selected for rotation using summer spei data resulting in 9 subregions of similar drought variability that explain about 82 of the total drought variability fig 4c all subregions have at least one grid point with a correlation coefficient of 0 75 or greater and the area in central colorado subregion 7 demonstrates a much stronger relationship with its rpc than subregion 7 in spring fig 4a the orientation of subregions is notably different in the summer than during the spring fig 4a and c there is a nearly vertical axis at about the 100 meridian that extends from the southern portion of the study domain into central nebraska for most of the great plains summer drought in the 1930s fig 4d was notably extreme and had much higher regional coverage than spring drought the dust bowl era of the 1930s contained some of the driest and hottest growing seasons in modern u s history which would have had significant negative impacts on crop production glotter and elliott 2016 subregions across kansas and northward showed the most extreme decadal drought conditions during this time summer drought conditions between 2005 and 2015 were notably drier for subregions 1 2 5 and 7 extending across the high plains 3 2 2 fall and winter fifteen eofs were selected for rotation using fall spei data resulting in 12 subregions of similar drought variability that explain about 85 of the total original drought variability fig 5 a the orientation of subregions resembles the orientation for spring reofs fig 4a with boundaries angled towards the northeast there are correlation coefficients greater than 0 75 within all subregions except subregion 9 which is located along the minnesota and iowa border this area exhibits lower correlation during fall than spring or summer other areas exhibiting low correlation were in south central nebraska and north central kansas the rpcs for each subregion demonstrate that the multi decadal period starting in 1940 and ending during the early 1960s was notably dry fig 5b while 1970s fall conditions were overall wet with the most notable drought occurring in subregions 1 and 8 in the mid 1980s eighteen eofs were selected for rotation using winter spei data resulting in 10 subregions of similar drought variability that explain about 88 of the total original drought variability fig 5c the subregions constructed in the southern plains are quite large compared to those for spring summer and fall notably there is one that spans across most of the portion of texas within the study domain subregion 1 this is significant because for the other seasons the area of the domain that includes texas is divided across the low rolling plains additionally subregion 4 dominates most of kansas southeast nebraska and iowa these large subregions also demonstrate strong correlation highlighting the broad and homogenous influence of synoptic features during the winter in the southern plains drought planners may be able to consolidate resources when assessing winter mitigation strategies the area that demonstrates the most variability lies across colorado and minnesota upon examination of the rpc time series the period between 1960 and 1980 was notably the driest for most subregions fig 5d subregion 6 across western south dakota in the northern great plains experienced the longest duration of extreme decadal drought of any region during the late 1950s and early 1960s followed closely by subregion 1 during the mid to late 1950s 3 2 3 seasonal trends for springtime drought conditions subregion 6 in north central nebraska had a statistically significant trend of 0 06 rpc decade 1 fig 6 a during the summer subregion 8 across eastern nebraska and iowa had a statistically significant trend of 0 09 rpc decade 1 fig 6b trends during the fall and winter showed the strongest statistical evidence among all seasons fig 6c and d subregions 3 centered on southern colorado 4 centered on minnesota 7 centered on eastern texas and 11 centered on southeast south dakota demonstrated significant wetting trends of 0 06 0 06 0 08 and 0 09 rpc decade 1 during the fall respectively fig 6c winter subregions 5 6 and 9 also demonstrated statistically significant wetting trends of 0 07 0 06 and 0 16 rpc decade 1 respectively and all three are separated at distance across the domain and demonstrate no clear spatial pattern fig 6d as a whole seasonal trend analysis showed that either some regions in the great plains have trended towards wetter conditions since 1901 or they do not have significant trend values however it is interesting to note that some areas across the great plains were characterized by temporal trends that were positive and negative in different seasons for example areas in northwest nebraska demonstrated wetting and drying in winter subregion 6 and spring subregion 5 respectively these results emphasize the importance of seasonal analysis which has major implications for the agricultural community who depend on timely rainfall during different growing seasons 3 3 full record reofs fourteen eofs were selected for rotation when using the full record spei data resulting in 10 subregions of similar drought variability that explain about 87 of the total drought variability fig 7 a all rpcs excluding 9 for each subregion are highly correlated to the original spei data r 0 85 spatially the correlation matrix illustrated that the rpcs for most subregions in the great plains were significantly correlated 0 05 r 0 7 fig 7b the two pairs of subregions that have the strongest relationship are 2 and 7 and 5 and 8 0 6 r 0 7 in contrast subregions 4 and 7 across the southern ogallala aquifer and minnesota respectively have non significant correlations the spei drought conditions of subregions 4 and 7 act independently this demonstrates that summarizing the short term drought variability of the great plains as a single region would be a mischaracterization of the complexities that exist in this region particularly across the southern high plains and northern great plains for each subregion s full record rpc distributions of drought events and corresponding metrics were calculated using thresholds of 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 for the periods before and after 1958 likewise distributions of wet events were calculated using thresholds of 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 the distributions for the thresholds of 0 5 and 0 5 and results of the two sample kolmogorov smirnov test are presented in fig 8 there is no statistical evidence for changes in drought metric distributions between these two periods at this threshold fig 8a in contrast there is evidence of a distribution shift towards more severe p value 0 04 and intense p value 0 01 wet events between 1958 and 2015 across minnesota in subregion 7 fig 8b at thresholds less than 0 5 and greater than 0 5 results not shown only a few subregions had statistically significant changes in distributions for drought event metrics differences in drought event intensities between the two periods for subregion 2 at a threshold of 1 0 were statistically significant p value 0 02 this is an indication that the intensity of moderate drought events increased during 1958 2015 across western north dakota south dakota and eastern montana at a threshold of 1 5 the intensities of drought events in subregion 8 were statistically significant indicating an increase in drought event intensity during 1958 2015 p value 0 04 3 4 temporal changes in drought variability to examine temporal changes in drought variability ten leading reofs were retained for this analysis based on the number of subregions identified previously and a 50 year moving window starting from 1901 was used to calculate the total variance explained for each window a decrease in the amount of variance explained by the same number of reofs is an indication that the space time variability of drought increased because more reofs must be retained to explain the same proportion of variability fig 9 shows how the total variance explained by 10 reofs has changed over time by season the variance explained by summer reofs changed significantly between the periods 1932 1981 and 1937 1986 decreasing from 82 to almost 80 within a period of several years however it steadily rebounded between 1941 1990 and 1966 2015 the variance explained by fall reofs steadily increased and decreased over the period demonstrating little overall differences one explanation for the increasing variability is the change in coverage of major drought and wetting events results from the seasonal reof time series showed that persistent and widespread droughts e g in the 1930s and mid to late 1950s affecting most subregions occurred less frequently in the latter half of the twentieth century subregions experienced more localized drought and wetting events of variable duration severity and intensity increasing the space time variability in eof analysis the sharp rebound starting around 1961 2010 during the summer was most likely due to the major drought event between 2011 and 2012 which had substantial coverage across most of the great plains if historical trends continue and seasonal drought becomes more variable a more diverse set of resources and strategies may be required to deal with its impacts overall winter and spring showed an increase in variance explained by the reofs while the summer drought has become more complicated i e more difficult to explain in terms of variability fig 9 temporal variations of drought variability explained for the winter season were relatively smaller than those in other seasons indicating that the effects of climatic structures that drive drought variability changed less rapidly year to year in winter thus this suggests that spatially the effects of drought and wetting events became more homogenous should this homogeneity continue among winter events across the great plains there is the potential for resource managers to consolidate resources to mitigate impacts however when drought or wetting events do occur their impacts could be more widespread 4 discussion our results showed that temperatures have significantly increased for a large portion of the great plains during the summer and winter growing seasons while trends in precipitation have significantly changed for only isolated areas of the great plains fig 2 the seasonal rpc trends from eof analysis demonstrated that only some subregions experienced statistically significant changes in drought conditions and the rpc trends more closely resembled the patterns displayed by the precipitation trends than the temperature trends while much of the western great plains demonstrated statistically significant trends in temperature fig 2a and b only a few grid points had statistically significant precipitation trends fig 2c in the eof analysis the rpc trends of seasonal subregions in the western great plains were also not significant many areas in the eastern great plains that demonstrated positive trends in precipitation fig 2c also demonstrated significant wetting in the eof analysis fig 6 it is apparent that the warming that occurred in the western great plains did not significantly change the monthly differences between precipitation and pe that are inputted into the spei calculation emphasizing that precipitation is most likely the dominant driver of spei variability in the great plains which is similar to the results from previous work livneh and hoerling 2016 trend analysis also highlighted that some subregions covering similar areas demonstrated both drying and wetting trends depending on the season analyzed based on these results we contend that analysis of the seasonal rpc trends instead of the full record rpc trends has more practical implications for agriculture because full record analysis can mask seasonal trends that are diametrically opposed which would be misleading for crop producers while previous drought eof studies have focused more on the full drought record than the seasonal drought record we argue that drought analysis should where possible be conducted seasonally to truly understand the complexity of drought dynamics an important caveat to acknowledge is that the trends calculated in this study may have been slightly different if another gridded dataset product was chosen for analysis because gridded datasets process station observations differently it is important to consider the uncertainties in trends that result from the methodology used in dataset construction wang et al 2017 for example cru ts datasets are constructed using the climate anomaly method peterson et al 1998 which requires station data to meet a minimum number of observations for observed climatology at each time step available observation anomalies are gridded to 0 5 0 5 resolution using triangulated linear interpolation which are converted to absolute values using the 1961 1990 climatology harris et al 2014 analysis of temperature trends over the period 1901 2015 not shown demonstrated relatively good spatial agreement among other higher resolution datasets such as the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism di luzio et al 2008 and vose vose et al 2014 notably maximum temperature trends calculated from prism exhibited a higher coverage of grid points with significant decreases in temperature in the eastern areas of the great plains prism does not adjust for changes in instrumentation wang et al 2017 which may explain discrepancies among products precipitation trends among cru prism vose and global precipitation climatology centre gpcc exhibited much stronger agreement than minimum and maximum temperature there have been several proposed explanations for the observed wetting trends in the great plains and midwest some studies suggest that widespread expansion of irrigation and cropland that occurred during the 1950s enhanced summer precipitation by increasing atmospheric moisture and moisture convergence alter et al 2015 alter et al 2017 other research suggests that the variability of the great plains low level may have played a role in the alteration of precipitation patterns wang and chen 2009 rising temperatures resulting from an increase in global greenhouse concentrations have also been linked to an increase in atmospheric water vapor across areas of the great plains leading to an increase in the frequency of heavier rainfall events groisman et al 2004 villarini et al 2012 while our study cannot directly explain the trends we observed our results fit well within the current literature for this region although not explored in great detail dividing the entire period of record into smaller moving windows performing the eof analysis and examining changes in subregion patterns through time may provide insight into changes in synoptic structures that have dominated the great plains since instrumental records began seasonal eof analysis also demonstrated differences in the spatial patterns of the subregions this is additional evidence for conducting seasonal eof analysis because it provides insight into the different processes that dominate seasonal drought variability in the great plains these processes were more apparent during the rotation of selected eofs rotation of two leading eofs demonstrated that the dominant seasonal subregions of drought variability in the great plains occur in the northern and southern plains this division may be physically explained by the relative influence of sea surface temperatures in the pacific ocean for these two regions previous studies have found that drought variability in the southern great plains is more sensitive to changes in equatorial pacific sea surface temperatures than drought variability exhibited in the northern great plains which may respond greater to internal atmospheric variability hoerling et al 2009 warming and cooling of the sea surface temperatures in the pacific ocean can generate changes in the prevailing circulation patterns that transport moisture from this source region borchert 1950 rotation of three eofs divided the previously identified subregions into areas that resemble the synoptic structures that dominate weather for example during the summer in the southern plains subregions are sharply divided at the 100 meridian representing the western boundary of the northward transport of gulf moisture by the low level jet in the eastern great plains for the winter season subregions have boundaries that resemble synoptic fronts which result from the cyclonic movement of air masses across the great plains these physical modes of variability exhibited by the differences in seasonal synoptic structures provide a physical explanation of the subregion patterns in the eof analysis based on the total amount of drought variability in the great plains the selection rule proposed in this study identified 9 12 subregions compared to the karl and koscielny 1982 study the number of subregions identified in our analysis for the great plains was equal to or larger than the nine identified for the entire united states however the authors in that study chose the number of eofs to retain for rotation based on the original resolution of the dataset which included only 60 grid points across the entire u s in addition none of the subregions had rpcs that were strongly correlated with drought data in the central great plains other studies in areas outside the u s used north s rule to identify the number of eofs to retain for rotation and then constructed subregions using cluster analysis or examination of the coefficients of the reofs cai et al 2015 raziei et al 2010 we identified six to seven seasonal subregions using north s rule in the great plains which was less than the number identified using our selection rule however the correlation coefficients across subregions using north s rule were lower particularly in the areas identified in our analysis along subregion boundaries our rule could identify subregions across these areas that significantly improved correlation with the original data across most of the great plains analysis of the statistical properties of the rpcs in this study also demonstrated that the subregions had unique characteristics such as different drought or wetting trends providing strong evidence for their inclusion in drought monitoring because the selection rule proposed in this study tests the differences in correlation coefficients within subregions in sequential rotations we argue that they represent the best subregions of drought variability that can be obtained by eof analysis this was exhibited by the high correlation of the rpcs with the original spei data areas that consistently had lower correlations such as colorado indicate that dimensional reduction of drought variability in this region was difficult to achieve which may be expected given that this area represents a high degree of precipitation variability that results from the orographic lift of the rocky mountains that may not be represented adequately at the resolution of the cru dataset because drought indices are usually standardized the rpcs can be interpreted as a meaningful drought index which has numerous advantages when the goal is to proceed beyond subregion identification highly correlated drought rpcs for identified subregions can be examined for detection of climate change signals which has implications for drought management due to the information gain over a large area the design and properties of the selection rule in this study make the rule adaptable to different applications of drought monitoring or other dimension reductions of space time geophysical data we recognize that statistical tests other than the sign test could be utilized to determine improvements in the subregion correlation coefficients other tests that examine characteristics of a distribution other than the median might provide further insight into identifiable subregions although the characteristics of those distributions would need to be examined to ensure that test assumptions are reasonably satisfied manual adjustments may also be desired if any subregions identified do not add useful information without implementation of the sign test the upper limit of the number of identified subregions using all 891 eofs for rotation was approximately 18 20 the small additional subregions extended across areas with low correlation in the seasonal analysis however the correlation coefficients between those rpcs and the original spei data were still smaller than the coefficients for the main subregions and explains why they were excluded in this analysis using our selection rule the selection rule is also relatively robust to changes in the size of the domain increasing the domain size can change regional features along the domain boundary and reconstructing the regional patterns produced using the smaller domain generally requires a larger number of reofs because additional variability is introduced these properties make it suitable for applications in other areas of the world at larger and smaller spatial scales to identify subregions of variability of a geophysical variable through time because of the properties demonstrated by this selection rule and its ability to identify subregions that have physical basis in the synoptic structures that drive drought variability we argue that future drought management strategies and planning would be more advantageous in terms of these subregions 5 summary and conclusions there has been an increase in growing season maximum and minimum temperatures across many areas of the great plains between 1901 and 2015 the greatest increases in growing season precipitation have been isolated to areas primarily east of the 100 meridian three month spei drought event intensities increased in magnitude during the period 1978 2015 across the great plains although the number of events was lower compared to previous periods higher intensity droughts while less frequent will have negative impacts on agriculture as short term and large water deficits occur in critical stages of crop growth in contrast the number of total wet events has risen in recent years indicating an increased risk of excess moisture that may have major impacts on agriculture in the future rotated eof analysis using our selection rule identifies the main subregions of variability in the great plains and can be used to integrate drought monitoring information and inform drought management decisions at a local scale especially when there are not sufficient in situ climate stations our method produces subregions that are consistent with synoptic features and can be easily interpreted by drought management agencies it has been shown that the number and spatial extent of subregions changes by season reflecting the meteorological processes that dominate drought variability seasonal trends showed significant wetting for several subregions and there is statistical evidence that the distributions of drought and wetting events for a few subregions have changed between 1901 1957 and 1958 2015 changes in weather patterns both naturally and from the diverse set of human forcings council 2005 pielke et al 2007 have the potential to alter the dominant features that affect drought variability in the great plains the water resource community is considering the need to include changes in weather patterns from what occurred in the past to inform future management practices hossain et al 2015 analysis showed that drought variability was not stationary over the historical period there is evidence of increased space time drought variability since 1980 or later during the summer and decreased variability during the winter decision makers should interpret these changes in variability as an increase or decrease in the spatial drought complexities if drought and wetting events become more variable across space and time greater interregional cooperation will be desirable to accommodate for the wide range of potential impacts decision makers in the great plains that have an understanding of these trends in variability will be able to adjust long term resource management strategies that may help mitigate the economic and

6894,identification of subregions that share similar historical drought variability provides useful information for drought monitoring mitigation planning and resource allocation this study examined space time historical drought variability for the great plains spanning from 1901 to 2015 by using rotated empirical orthogonal functions reofs the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei on a three month timescale was utilized to examine spatial and temporal changes in agricultural drought we propose a new procedure for identifying the number of reofs to be selected for reconstructing subregions drought event intensities of moderate severe and extreme categories increased in recent years although the number of drought events decreased seasonal reofs demonstrated that 9 12 subregions were adequate to explain a significant proportion of the original variability in the great plains the time series for each subregion was highly correlated to the original spei data and reflected the seasonal meteorological processes that drive drought variability several significant wetting trends were found and there was statistical evidence that drought and wetting event severities had increased for a few subregions summer drought has become more variable across space and time indicating that a more diverse set of resources and strategies might be needed to mitigate impacts of spatially variable drought and wetting events in coming decades winter season drought has become less variable indicating that perhaps resources could be consolidated when dealing with impacts on a larger scale however less variability implies that drought and wetting events may occur across larger regions of the great plains during a given season keywords drought empirical orthogonal functions climate agriculture spei 1 introduction regionalizing variability across space and time is a complex multi scalar problem the demand for regional assessments of historical climate variability is growing due to its value in decision making processes such as the management of water resources and agricultural systems bonaccorso et al 2003 omondi et al 2013 the great plains of the

climate due to human and natural variations and long term change generate uncertainty in global food security easterling et al 1993 pielke et al 2013 daily monthly and annual perturbations in weather and climate across this agricultural region create significant impacts at local and regional scales drought a condition of moisture deficit sufficient to have an adverse effect on vegetation animals and society is a multi faceted and complex climate related phenomenon sönmez et al 2005 warwick 1975 the great plains has experienced highly variable drought conditions throughout the historical climate record since the late 1800s the most notable droughts include the multi year droughts of the 1930s and 1950s and the more recent droughts in the late 1980s and 2011 2012 that resulted in billions of dollars in agricultural losses svoboda et al 2002 human activity such as the expansion of agriculture into marginal lands colaizzi et al 2009 or groundwater depletion russo and lall 2017 has been shown to modify the vulnerability of agricultural systems to drought impacts poor management practices during the dust bowl era of the 1930s led to high rates of soil erosion and decreasing land productivity that resulted in off farm migration mcleman et al 2014 changes in policy and management practices that resulted from lessons learned during the 1930s resulted in less severe agricultural impacts during the 1950s wiener et al 2016 rising temperatures would intensify droughts due to increases in evaporation from the soil and transpiration from vegetation leading to more frequent withdrawals of underground water resources ipcc 2014 across the great plains such a change would increase the number of climate related challenges and might include 1 resolving increasing competition among land water and energy resources 2 developing sustainable agricultural systems 3 conserving diverse ecological systems and 4 enhancing the resilience of communities to the impacts of extreme events including more intense heat waves cold snaps drought and flooding events shafer et al 2014 the great plains cover a wide range in latitude and elevation spanning the continental land area between northern mexico and the prairie provinces of canada and experiencing an elevation gain of more than a thousand meters from texas to the base of the rocky mountains although its latitudinal extent exceeds its spread in longitude the great plains has a gradient in annual precipitation of more than 1200 mm in gulf coastal areas in the southeast to less than 400 mm at the eastern slopes of the rocky mountains pielke and doesken 2008 the köppen climate classification divides the great plains into four main categories humid subtropical hot summer humid continental warm summer humid continental and cold semi arid köppen 2011 differences in classifications are generally driven by latitude and elevation corresponding with gradients in annual mean temperature and precipitation the precipitation gradient results in two types of grasslands that dominate the great plains short and tallgrass prairie in the west and east respectively küchler 1964 these grasslands are vital ecosystems for farming grazing and biofuel production and are highly sensitive to rainfall variability knapp and smith 2001 shafer et al 2014 low precipitation during the growing season can trigger agricultural drought which occurs when soil moisture availability falls below a level that has an adverse effect on crop production panu and sharma 2002 the economic importance of this region and the space time variability of precipitation and temperature underscore the need for additional assessments of drought variability on timescales affecting these agricultural and socioeconomic systems e g seasonal and monthly several studies and methods have been used to examine historical drought variability of the great plains although records of climate observations began in the late 1800s scientists have used tree rings to reconstruct the paleoclimatic record over the last several centuries indicating that multi decadal droughts as severe as major droughts of the twentieth century have occurred in the great plains in the last millennium sauchyn et al 2003 stockton and meko 1983 woodhouse and overpeck 1998 other methods have been utilized to examine the characteristics of drought during the instrumental record guttman 1998 used spectral analysis of several drought indices to classify weather stations across the united states according to their characteristics and his results demonstrated incoherent regional patterns in the great plains other studies have used the trends directly calculated from the standardized precipitation index spi or the palmer drought severity index pdsi to show both wetting and drying has occurred across areas of the great plains logan et al 2010 yuan and quiring 2014 in addition to drought indices land surface modeling has been utilized to study the mechanisms that drive soil moisture deficits in the great plains showing that antecedent moisture conditions can have an impact on drought severity during the summer growing season livneh and hoerling 2016 broader studies of drought trends over the contiguous united states show a decrease in the percentage of dry areas from the 1950s to 1990s and an increase in the percentage of dry areas since the 1990s dai 2011 these studies demonstrate that regional variations in drought exist and characterizing large areas such as the great plains as a single region can produce misleading drought metrics that are not representative of the unique subregions that may exist emerging techniques provide an opportunity to more accurately identify and characterize the spatio temporal structures of regional historical drought variability empirical orthogonal function eof analysis a multivariate statistical method first used for climatological applications in the 1950s lorenz 1956 has been utilized in diverse applications to analyze the spatial and temporal variability of geophysical datasets bjornsson and venegas 1997 the eof procedure constructs orthogonal linear combinations that explain the maximum amount of variance in both space and time through various rotations of these linear combinations geographic regions of similar variability can be identified karl and koscielny 1982 used eof analysis to regionalize drought across the united states from long term records of pdsi nine broad regions were identified and spectral analysis revealed that regions in the interior u s experienced longer duration droughts other large and small scale studies of drought eofs have been conducted across the globe in regions including china cai et al 2015 romania bojariu et al 2012 cheval et al 2014 portugal martins et al 2012 santos et al 2010 the iberian peninsula vicente serrano 2006 turkey tatli and türkeş 2011 and sicily bonaccorso et al 2003 for example raziei et al 2010 regionalized drought across iran into four subregions based on the variability of the spi at a time scale of 24 months in these studies applications of eof analysis included but were not limited to 1 assessment of the similarities and differences amongst drought indices 2 identification of strong and weak temporal signals in the drought time series and 3 the separation of a region into sub climate regimes while many of these studies did not explore the drought metrics of these eof indices such as duration severity or intensity analysis of these metrics would enhance our understanding of the space time variability of these intrinsic drought characteristics identifying regions that share similar drought variability is important for drought monitoring drought mitigation planning and drought emergency management given that sub climates can span administrative regions interagency cooperation could help improve drought preparedness these insights are crucial for drought management agencies that require detailed but concise information on changes in historical climate for their areas the objective of this study was to investigate the spatial and temporal variability structures of seasonal and full record monthly drought and wetting episodes in the great plains from 1901 to 2015 by identification of subregions from eof analysis we proposed a new eof selection rule to identify significant subregions of variability the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei a recently developed multi scalar drought index that includes the effects of temperature variability was chosen for this analysis as it can identify an increase in drought severity due to higher water demand as a result of evapotranspiration vicente serrano et al 2010 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and data source for this study the domain extended between latitudes 32 and 48 and longitudes 93 and 106 covering over 2 100 000 km2 of the central united states fig 1 monthly precipitation temperature maximum and minimum and potential evapotranspiration coverage 0 5 0 5 grid were obtained from the climatic research unit ts v 3 24 01 cru at the university of east anglia uk harris et al 2014 for years between 1901 and 2015 a total of 891 cru grid points were used for the study cru was chosen for this analysis because its resolution allows for a reasonable number of grid points in the great plains to perform an eof analysis the inclusion of areas surrounding the great plains helps to avoid loss of variability and to isolate important drought features potentially hidden in a larger scale analysis richman 1986 2 2 standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index potential evapotranspiration pe provided by cru was estimated using a variant of the penman monteith procedure and the difference between precipitation and pe is calculated for each month these differences are summed based on the time scale chosen following the procedure in vicente serrano et al 2010 these summed differences are fitted to a three parameter log logistic cumulative probability distribution function and this procedure is performed separately for each month and grid point these probabilities are standardized using the approximation found in zelan and norman 1964 to obtain the spei this index ranges in value from approximately 3 to approximately 3 with negative values indicating drier than normal conditions and positive values indicating conditions wetter than normal spei values less than 2 0 or greater than 2 0 are considered extreme time series of spei values were calculated using tools developed at kansas state university the index was calibrated using data from the period 1931 1990 a time scale of three months was used to represent short term drought which is more closely related to agricultural drought vicente serrano et al 2011 the earliest available 3 month spei was march 1901 the model fit between observed summed differences of precipitation and pe and the expected values from the fitted log logistic distribution was evaluated for each month using the kolmogorov smirnov test at each grid point no test resulted in rejection of the null hypothesis that the data come from the log logistic distribution indicating that the statistical assumptions behind the spei are valid for this region 2 3 drought metrics duration severity and intensity were used to characterize drought and wetting events in each time series of spei values the duration of a drought event is the length of time in months that the drought index is consecutively at or below a given truncation threshold similarly the duration of a wetting event is the length of time in months that the drought index is at or above a given threshold the severity of each event is the cumulative sum of the index over the duration of the event the intensity of a drought or wetting event is its severity divided by its duration and is considered the average index or rating of that event to robustly investigate the significance of drought trends a modified mann kendall test was employed mann 1945 wilks 2011 to avoid inflated p values due to the underestimation of the test statistic variance hamed and ramachandra rao 1998 then the theil sen slope estimate was used to identify the magnitude of the trend theil 1950 the two sample kolmogorov smirnov test was implemented to test the hypothesis that the distributions of a metric calculated from drought or wetting events during different time periods come from the same continuous distribution massey 1951 statistical significance was assessed at a level of 5 for these tests 2 4 empirical orthogonal function analysis for this study grid point location and spei values were the variables and observations respectively for the eof analysis the resulting orthogonal eigenvectors also referred to as eofs point in the direction in which the data vectors exhibit the most variability the principal components pcs which represent how eofs evolve through time are obtained by projecting the eofs onto the original spei data eofs often exhibit characteristics that hamper their utility to isolate individual patterns of variation such as domain shape or size dependence richman 1986 because weather in the great plains is generally dominated by large regional atmospheric processes the orthogonality constraint on the eigenvectors can lead to problems with interpretation especially for the second and subsequent pcs wilks 2011 because of the limitations of eof analysis in the great plains a retained number of eof loadings each retained eof scaled by the square root of its eigenvalue were rotated using varimax rotation kaiser 1958 preisendorfer and mobley 1988 varimax rotation redistributes the variance among rotated eofs reofs and pcs rpcs and attempts to simplify the reofs by pushing loading coefficients toward 0 or 1 the loadings used for this rotation result in nonorthogonal reofs and rpcs wilks 2011 that are more regionally localized and highly correlated to the original spei data than the unrotated eofs and pcs several selection methods are available to determine the number of eofs that capture most of the variability without significant loss of information these methods can be divided into three classes rules based on the size of the last retained eigenvalue hannachi et al 2007 hypothesis testing preisendorfer and mobley 1988 and the structure of the retained principal components wilks 2011 one commonly used selection rule is north s rule of thumb north et al 1982 which uses the sampling error of each eigenvalue to determine non degenerate eofs however north s rule of thumb and other selection methods such as kaiser s rule or rule n overland and preisendorfer 1982 use the size or sampling properties of the eigenvalues and do not adequately fit the objective of this study because they do not use properties of the eofs after rotation we argue that the primary utility of reofs in drought analysis is their ability to identify subregions of similar variability through time without the constraint of orthogonality and propose that a more useful criterion is the correlation of the rpcs with the original data when subregions are identified with rpcs that are highly correlated to the original data drought characteristics can be generalized across large land areas as the number of eofs rotated increases the number of subregions identified increases and correlation coefficients increase at some rotation there is no significant improvement in the correlation coefficients based on this observation we propose a new rule to identify the rotation at which this occurs 2 5 selection rule for determining the number of rotated eofs the selection rule begins when a selected number of leading eofs n are rotated usually two at each of the 891 grid points the original standardized drought dataset is correlated with all n rpc time series using the absolute value of the correlation coefficients for each grid point the rpc time series with the highest correlation is reported as i which is designated as an integer between 1 and n after all grid points have been matched with a single rpc subregions can be identified by grouping together grid points with the same i forming a subregion mask next n 1 leading eofs are independently rotated and the same procedure is applied when n were rotated the subregion mask created using n 1 leading rpcs is projected onto the grid of correlation coefficients that was calculated during the rotation of n eofs this projection creates two samples of paired correlation coefficients corresponding to the subregions in the current and previous rotation for each subregion j identified in the rotation of n 1 eofs the difference between the current and previous correlation coefficients from each rotation at each point in the subregion is calculated and a sign test is performed to test the null hypothesis that the distribution of differences dj has zero median against the alternative that the median is not equal to zero at a significance level of 1 if the result of the sign test is statistically significant h j is recorded as h j 1 m e d i a n d j 0 1 m e d i a n d j 0 if the test is not significant h j is recorded as zero when j 1 n 1 h j 0 there was at least one subregion that had an improvement in the median correlation when an additional eof was rotated n is incremented by one and the procedure is repeated until the first occurrence when the criteria j 1 n 1 h j 0 is met indicative that the inclusion of an additional reof weakened the overall relationship between subregion rpcs and the original spei data the number of desirable reofs is given as n and the procedure concludes no statistically significant gains in information were made in the subregions identified using n 1 reofs and the subregions have become relatively stable it is important to note that there are cases when j 1 n 1 h j 0 at a rotation followed by j 1 n 1 h j 0 when additional reofs are included which is the rational for using the criteria j 1 n 1 h j 0 also if there were n reofs there might be fewer subregions identified based on this correlation procedure after the final number of reofs to rotate has been decided smooth boundaries between subregions can be drawn by interpolating the maximum correlations correlations should be presented with subregion boundaries to illustrate the strength of the relationship of these rpcs with the original spei data in some heterogeneous cases non continuous subregions can be identified due to similarities in drought dynamics separated at distance and these cases should be carefully examined when constructing a subregion mask the numerical magnitude and sign of the standardized rpc of each subregion can be interpreted as a drought index that possesses statistical properties similar to the input dataset i e the spei data thus the same seasonal and full record drought characteristics that were calculated for the spei can also be calculated for the rpc allowing for drought and wetting event detection and statistical analysis across spatial scales larger than a single grid point full record rpcs were used to calculate drought and wetting event durations severities and intensities for events occurring in two periods 1901 1957 and 1958 2015 to assess changes in the distributions of drought metrics to assess whether seasonal drought variability has remained stationary over time an reof analysis was conducted using a fixed number of reofs on a 50 year moving window starting 1901 1950 1902 1951 and continuing until 1966 2015 if the total variance explained by the reofs for each individual analysis stays approximately the same then climatic features that influence drought across the great plains have remained relatively stable through time 3 results 3 1 climate trends and drought statistics cru winter and summer growing season maximum temperature significantly increased between 1901 and 2015 across a majority of the northern and western high plains fig 2 a i and a ii the strongest rates of warming 0 2 0 3 c decade 1 occurred across the foothills of the rocky mountains in new mexico colorado and wyoming in the summer fig 2a ii spatial distribution of trends during the summer and winter growing seasons were relatively similar but across north dakota and minnesota trends were larger during the winter than during the summer during the summer season there were also several notable areas in the eastern great plains that experienced significant decreases in maximum temperature minimum temperature during the winter increased at a faster rate than during the summer fig 2b i and b ii and the proportion of grid points showing a statistically significant increasing trend was greater for minimum temperature than for maximum temperature fig 2a and b the largest differences between winter and summer minimum temperature trends occurred in eastern south dakota north dakota minnesota and new mexico there was also more significant warming in the southeast plains over arkansas during the summer than the winter these warming trends during the summer in the southeast are in direct contrast to the cooling trends displayed by maximum temperatures spatial distributions of growing season precipitation trends for both seasons were more variable and isolated fig 2c i and c ii of the grids with a statistically significant trend in precipitation most exhibited a positive trend fig 2c i and c ii isolated areas east of the 100 meridian during the summer increased at the highest rates and the rate of increase exceeded 2 mm decade 1 across northwest louisiana fig 2c ii during the winter growing season a small number of grids west of the 100 meridian had a modest decrease in precipitation 0 2 to 0 5 mm decade 1 in fig 2c i when evaluated using a threshold of 0 5 the 3 month spei data revealed that there were on average 143 droughts per grid point approximately 1 2 times per year in the great plains with a standard deviation of 8 8 in the great plains between 1901 and 2015 when the period was divided into three time intervals of equal duration excluding 1901 1902 1939 1940 1977 and 1978 2015 the average number of drought events per grid point was approximately 48 49 and 41 respectively notably the last 38 years had significantly fewer drought events than the previous two periods which was offset by an increase in the number of wet events using a threshold of 0 5 53 wet events for 1978 2015 vs 48 for 1902 1939 empirical cumulative frequency distributions ecfd of spei drought event intensities for these three time intervals are shown in fig 3 a the two sample kolmogorov smirnov test was statistically significant for all pairwise comparisons p values 10 5 these distributions demonstrate that of the drought events that occurred between 1978 and 2015 moderate severe and extreme drought events occurred at a higher frequency than in previous periods while the number of drought events decreased in recent years the intensity of those events increased divergence between time interval ecfds is evident beginning at intensities of around 1 75 reaching maximum separation around the transition between severe and moderate drought categories all three time intervals had less than 10 of all droughts rated severe or extreme and 35 40 of all drought events were rated as moderate notice that 0 18 0 09 and 0 50 of all drought events are categorized as extreme for the periods 1902 1939 1940 1977 and 1978 2015 respectively fig 3b in context of the study area and the number of events per period roughly 21 of grids experienced a drought event that rated on average as extreme between 1978 and 2015 while only 4 did between 1902 and 1939 combining the information contained across all grid points shows the overall status of the great plains however more relevant information can be acquired by analyzing the drought and wetting dynamics contained in subregions that contain distinctive information about drought variability 3 2 seasonal reofs 3 2 1 spring and summer thirteen eofs were selected for rotation using spring spei resulting in 10 subregions of similar drought variability that explain about 85 of the total drought variability fig 4 a correlation coefficients of rpcs with the original spei data for grid points within subregions were generally greater than 0 75 these subregions span administrative units and political boundaries for example subregion 1 which covers most of central and western kansas also includes an extension of land in interior southern colorado east of subregion 7 in colorado and northern new mexico it should be noted that the overall correlation in this area of colorado comparatively lower and it may be the result of high variability or it possessing characteristics more in common with areas west of the study domain the area along subregional boundaries in western south dakota demonstrate low correlation r 0 75 illustrating that the variability exhibited in these areas is not explained as well as other areas in the domain using this procedure the spring rpc time series demonstrate clear differences between subregion seasonal drought and wet spell onsets durations and severities fig 4b the time series also highlight periods when subregions experienced similar drought conditions e g drought between 1960 and 1980 based on severity and duration subregion 9 centered on eastern kansas and missouri experienced the longest period of sustained extreme spring drought during the 1960s spring droughts occurring during the 1960s and 1970s appear to have had somewhat larger areal coverage as evident by the red bands across most subregions in fig 4b the 2011 2012 springtime drought was the worst rpc 2 for subregion 4 in the texas panhandle overall each time series shows its own unique drought characteristics with differences in onset duration and intensity of spring drought events fourteen eofs were selected for rotation using summer spei data resulting in 9 subregions of similar drought variability that explain about 82 of the total drought variability fig 4c all subregions have at least one grid point with a correlation coefficient of 0 75 or greater and the area in central colorado subregion 7 demonstrates a much stronger relationship with its rpc than subregion 7 in spring fig 4a the orientation of subregions is notably different in the summer than during the spring fig 4a and c there is a nearly vertical axis at about the 100 meridian that extends from the southern portion of the study domain into central nebraska for most of the great plains summer drought in the 1930s fig 4d was notably extreme and had much higher regional coverage than spring drought the dust bowl era of the 1930s contained some of the driest and hottest growing seasons in modern u s history which would have had significant negative impacts on crop production glotter and elliott 2016 subregions across kansas and northward showed the most extreme decadal drought conditions during this time summer drought conditions between 2005 and 2015 were notably drier for subregions 1 2 5 and 7 extending across the high plains 3 2 2 fall and winter fifteen eofs were selected for rotation using fall spei data resulting in 12 subregions of similar drought variability that explain about 85 of the total original drought variability fig 5 a the orientation of subregions resembles the orientation for spring reofs fig 4a with boundaries angled towards the northeast there are correlation coefficients greater than 0 75 within all subregions except subregion 9 which is located along the minnesota and iowa border this area exhibits lower correlation during fall than spring or summer other areas exhibiting low correlation were in south central nebraska and north central kansas the rpcs for each subregion demonstrate that the multi decadal period starting in 1940 and ending during the early 1960s was notably dry fig 5b while 1970s fall conditions were overall wet with the most notable drought occurring in subregions 1 and 8 in the mid 1980s eighteen eofs were selected for rotation using winter spei data resulting in 10 subregions of similar drought variability that explain about 88 of the total original drought variability fig 5c the subregions constructed in the southern plains are quite large compared to those for spring summer and fall notably there is one that spans across most of the portion of texas within the study domain subregion 1 this is significant because for the other seasons the area of the domain that includes texas is divided across the low rolling plains additionally subregion 4 dominates most of kansas southeast nebraska and iowa these large subregions also demonstrate strong correlation highlighting the broad and homogenous influence of synoptic features during the winter in the southern plains drought planners may be able to consolidate resources when assessing winter mitigation strategies the area that demonstrates the most variability lies across colorado and minnesota upon examination of the rpc time series the period between 1960 and 1980 was notably the driest for most subregions fig 5d subregion 6 across western south dakota in the northern great plains experienced the longest duration of extreme decadal drought of any region during the late 1950s and early 1960s followed closely by subregion 1 during the mid to late 1950s 3 2 3 seasonal trends for springtime drought conditions subregion 6 in north central nebraska had a statistically significant trend of 0 06 rpc decade 1 fig 6 a during the summer subregion 8 across eastern nebraska and iowa had a statistically significant trend of 0 09 rpc decade 1 fig 6b trends during the fall and winter showed the strongest statistical evidence among all seasons fig 6c and d subregions 3 centered on southern colorado 4 centered on minnesota 7 centered on eastern texas and 11 centered on southeast south dakota demonstrated significant wetting trends of 0 06 0 06 0 08 and 0 09 rpc decade 1 during the fall respectively fig 6c winter subregions 5 6 and 9 also demonstrated statistically significant wetting trends of 0 07 0 06 and 0 16 rpc decade 1 respectively and all three are separated at distance across the domain and demonstrate no clear spatial pattern fig 6d as a whole seasonal trend analysis showed that either some regions in the great plains have trended towards wetter conditions since 1901 or they do not have significant trend values however it is interesting to note that some areas across the great plains were characterized by temporal trends that were positive and negative in different seasons for example areas in northwest nebraska demonstrated wetting and drying in winter subregion 6 and spring subregion 5 respectively these results emphasize the importance of seasonal analysis which has major implications for the agricultural community who depend on timely rainfall during different growing seasons 3 3 full record reofs fourteen eofs were selected for rotation when using the full record spei data resulting in 10 subregions of similar drought variability that explain about 87 of the total drought variability fig 7 a all rpcs excluding 9 for each subregion are highly correlated to the original spei data r 0 85 spatially the correlation matrix illustrated that the rpcs for most subregions in the great plains were significantly correlated 0 05 r 0 7 fig 7b the two pairs of subregions that have the strongest relationship are 2 and 7 and 5 and 8 0 6 r 0 7 in contrast subregions 4 and 7 across the southern ogallala aquifer and minnesota respectively have non significant correlations the spei drought conditions of subregions 4 and 7 act independently this demonstrates that summarizing the short term drought variability of the great plains as a single region would be a mischaracterization of the complexities that exist in this region particularly across the southern high plains and northern great plains for each subregion s full record rpc distributions of drought events and corresponding metrics were calculated using thresholds of 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 for the periods before and after 1958 likewise distributions of wet events were calculated using thresholds of 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 the distributions for the thresholds of 0 5 and 0 5 and results of the two sample kolmogorov smirnov test are presented in fig 8 there is no statistical evidence for changes in drought metric distributions between these two periods at this threshold fig 8a in contrast there is evidence of a distribution shift towards more severe p value 0 04 and intense p value 0 01 wet events between 1958 and 2015 across minnesota in subregion 7 fig 8b at thresholds less than 0 5 and greater than 0 5 results not shown only a few subregions had statistically significant changes in distributions for drought event metrics differences in drought event intensities between the two periods for subregion 2 at a threshold of 1 0 were statistically significant p value 0 02 this is an indication that the intensity of moderate drought events increased during 1958 2015 across western north dakota south dakota and eastern montana at a threshold of 1 5 the intensities of drought events in subregion 8 were statistically significant indicating an increase in drought event intensity during 1958 2015 p value 0 04 3 4 temporal changes in drought variability to examine temporal changes in drought variability ten leading reofs were retained for this analysis based on the number of subregions identified previously and a 50 year moving window starting from 1901 was used to calculate the total variance explained for each window a decrease in the amount of variance explained by the same number of reofs is an indication that the space time variability of drought increased because more reofs must be retained to explain the same proportion of variability fig 9 shows how the total variance explained by 10 reofs has changed over time by season the variance explained by summer reofs changed significantly between the periods 1932 1981 and 1937 1986 decreasing from 82 to almost 80 within a period of several years however it steadily rebounded between 1941 1990 and 1966 2015 the variance explained by fall reofs steadily increased and decreased over the period demonstrating little overall differences one explanation for the increasing variability is the change in coverage of major drought and wetting events results from the seasonal reof time series showed that persistent and widespread droughts e g in the 1930s and mid to late 1950s affecting most subregions occurred less frequently in the latter half of the twentieth century subregions experienced more localized drought and wetting events of variable duration severity and intensity increasing the space time variability in eof analysis the sharp rebound starting around 1961 2010 during the summer was most likely due to the major drought event between 2011 and 2012 which had substantial coverage across most of the great plains if historical trends continue and seasonal drought becomes more variable a more diverse set of resources and strategies may be required to deal with its impacts overall winter and spring showed an increase in variance explained by the reofs while the summer drought has become more complicated i e more difficult to explain in terms of variability fig 9 temporal variations of drought variability explained for the winter season were relatively smaller than those in other seasons indicating that the effects of climatic structures that drive drought variability changed less rapidly year to year in winter thus this suggests that spatially the effects of drought and wetting events became more homogenous should this homogeneity continue among winter events across the great plains there is the potential for resource managers to consolidate resources to mitigate impacts however when drought or wetting events do occur their impacts could be more widespread 4 discussion our results showed that temperatures have significantly increased for a large portion of the great plains during the summer and winter growing seasons while trends in precipitation have significantly changed for only isolated areas of the great plains fig 2 the seasonal rpc trends from eof analysis demonstrated that only some subregions experienced statistically significant changes in drought conditions and the rpc trends more closely resembled the patterns displayed by the precipitation trends than the temperature trends while much of the western great plains demonstrated statistically significant trends in temperature fig 2a and b only a few grid points had statistically significant precipitation trends fig 2c in the eof analysis the rpc trends of seasonal subregions in the western great plains were also not significant many areas in the eastern great plains that demonstrated positive trends in precipitation fig 2c also demonstrated significant wetting in the eof analysis fig 6 it is apparent that the warming that occurred in the western great plains did not significantly change the monthly differences between precipitation and pe that are inputted into the spei calculation emphasizing that precipitation is most likely the dominant driver of spei variability in the great plains which is similar to the results from previous work livneh and hoerling 2016 trend analysis also highlighted that some subregions covering similar areas demonstrated both drying and wetting trends depending on the season analyzed based on these results we contend that analysis of the seasonal rpc trends instead of the full record rpc trends has more practical implications for agriculture because full record analysis can mask seasonal trends that are diametrically opposed which would be misleading for crop producers while previous drought eof studies have focused more on the full drought record than the seasonal drought record we argue that drought analysis should where possible be conducted seasonally to truly understand the complexity of drought dynamics an important caveat to acknowledge is that the trends calculated in this study may have been slightly different if another gridded dataset product was chosen for analysis because gridded datasets process station observations differently it is important to consider the uncertainties in trends that result from the methodology used in dataset construction wang et al 2017 for example cru ts datasets are constructed using the climate anomaly method peterson et al 1998 which requires station data to meet a minimum number of observations for observed climatology at each time step available observation anomalies are gridded to 0 5 0 5 resolution using triangulated linear interpolation which are converted to absolute values using the 1961 1990 climatology harris et al 2014 analysis of temperature trends over the period 1901 2015 not shown demonstrated relatively good spatial agreement among other higher resolution datasets such as the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism di luzio et al 2008 and vose vose et al 2014 notably maximum temperature trends calculated from prism exhibited a higher coverage of grid points with significant decreases in temperature in the eastern areas of the great plains prism does not adjust for changes in instrumentation wang et al 2017 which may explain discrepancies among products precipitation trends among cru prism vose and global precipitation climatology centre gpcc exhibited much stronger agreement than minimum and maximum temperature there have been several proposed explanations for the observed wetting trends in the great plains and midwest some studies suggest that widespread expansion of irrigation and cropland that occurred during the 1950s enhanced summer precipitation by increasing atmospheric moisture and moisture convergence alter et al 2015 alter et al 2017 other research suggests that the variability of the great plains low level may have played a role in the alteration of precipitation patterns wang and chen 2009 rising temperatures resulting from an increase in global greenhouse concentrations have also been linked to an increase in atmospheric water vapor across areas of the great plains leading to an increase in the frequency of heavier rainfall events groisman et al 2004 villarini et al 2012 while our study cannot directly explain the trends we observed our results fit well within the current literature for this region although not explored in great detail dividing the entire period of record into smaller moving windows performing the eof analysis and examining changes in subregion patterns through time may provide insight into changes in synoptic structures that have dominated the great plains since instrumental records began seasonal eof analysis also demonstrated differences in the spatial patterns of the subregions this is additional evidence for conducting seasonal eof analysis because it provides insight into the different processes that dominate seasonal drought variability in the great plains these processes were more apparent during the rotation of selected eofs rotation of two leading eofs demonstrated that the dominant seasonal subregions of drought variability in the great plains occur in the northern and southern plains this division may be physically explained by the relative influence of sea surface temperatures in the pacific ocean for these two regions previous studies have found that drought variability in the southern great plains is more sensitive to changes in equatorial pacific sea surface temperatures than drought variability exhibited in the northern great plains which may respond greater to internal atmospheric variability hoerling et al 2009 warming and cooling of the sea surface temperatures in the pacific ocean can generate changes in the prevailing circulation patterns that transport moisture from this source region borchert 1950 rotation of three eofs divided the previously identified subregions into areas that resemble the synoptic structures that dominate weather for example during the summer in the southern plains subregions are sharply divided at the 100 meridian representing the western boundary of the northward transport of gulf moisture by the low level jet in the eastern great plains for the winter season subregions have boundaries that resemble synoptic fronts which result from the cyclonic movement of air masses across the great plains these physical modes of variability exhibited by the differences in seasonal synoptic structures provide a physical explanation of the subregion patterns in the eof analysis based on the total amount of drought variability in the great plains the selection rule proposed in this study identified 9 12 subregions compared to the karl and koscielny 1982 study the number of subregions identified in our analysis for the great plains was equal to or larger than the nine identified for the entire united states however the authors in that study chose the number of eofs to retain for rotation based on the original resolution of the dataset which included only 60 grid points across the entire u s in addition none of the subregions had rpcs that were strongly correlated with drought data in the central great plains other studies in areas outside the u s used north s rule to identify the number of eofs to retain for rotation and then constructed subregions using cluster analysis or examination of the coefficients of the reofs cai et al 2015 raziei et al 2010 we identified six to seven seasonal subregions using north s rule in the great plains which was less than the number identified using our selection rule however the correlation coefficients across subregions using north s rule were lower particularly in the areas identified in our analysis along subregion boundaries our rule could identify subregions across these areas that significantly improved correlation with the original data across most of the great plains analysis of the statistical properties of the rpcs in this study also demonstrated that the subregions had unique characteristics such as different drought or wetting trends providing strong evidence for their inclusion in drought monitoring because the selection rule proposed in this study tests the differences in correlation coefficients within subregions in sequential rotations we argue that they represent the best subregions of drought variability that can be obtained by eof analysis this was exhibited by the high correlation of the rpcs with the original spei data areas that consistently had lower correlations such as colorado indicate that dimensional reduction of drought variability in this region was difficult to achieve which may be expected given that this area represents a high degree of precipitation variability that results from the orographic lift of the rocky mountains that may not be represented adequately at the resolution of the cru dataset because drought indices are usually standardized the rpcs can be interpreted as a meaningful drought index which has numerous advantages when the goal is to proceed beyond subregion identification highly correlated drought rpcs for identified subregions can be examined for detection of climate change signals which has implications for drought management due to the information gain over a large area the design and properties of the selection rule in this study make the rule adaptable to different applications of drought monitoring or other dimension reductions of space time geophysical data we recognize that statistical tests other than the sign test could be utilized to determine improvements in the subregion correlation coefficients other tests that examine characteristics of a distribution other than the median might provide further insight into identifiable subregions although the characteristics of those distributions would need to be examined to ensure that test assumptions are reasonably satisfied manual adjustments may also be desired if any subregions identified do not add useful information without implementation of the sign test the upper limit of the number of identified subregions using all 891 eofs for rotation was approximately 18 20 the small additional subregions extended across areas with low correlation in the seasonal analysis however the correlation coefficients between those rpcs and the original spei data were still smaller than the coefficients for the main subregions and explains why they were excluded in this analysis using our selection rule the selection rule is also relatively robust to changes in the size of the domain increasing the domain size can change regional features along the domain boundary and reconstructing the regional patterns produced using the smaller domain generally requires a larger number of reofs because additional variability is introduced these properties make it suitable for applications in other areas of the world at larger and smaller spatial scales to identify subregions of variability of a geophysical variable through time because of the properties demonstrated by this selection rule and its ability to identify subregions that have physical basis in the synoptic structures that drive drought variability we argue that future drought management strategies and planning would be more advantageous in terms of these subregions 5 summary and conclusions there has been an increase in growing season maximum and minimum temperatures across many areas of the great plains between 1901 and 2015 the greatest increases in growing season precipitation have been isolated to areas primarily east of the 100 meridian three month spei drought event intensities increased in magnitude during the period 1978 2015 across the great plains although the number of events was lower compared to previous periods higher intensity droughts while less frequent will have negative impacts on agriculture as short term and large water deficits occur in critical stages of crop growth in contrast the number of total wet events has risen in recent years indicating an increased risk of excess moisture that may have major impacts on agriculture in the future rotated eof analysis using our selection rule identifies the main subregions of variability in the great plains and can be used to integrate drought monitoring information and inform drought management decisions at a local scale especially when there are not sufficient in situ climate stations our method produces subregions that are consistent with synoptic features and can be easily interpreted by drought management agencies it has been shown that the number and spatial extent of subregions changes by season reflecting the meteorological processes that dominate drought variability seasonal trends showed significant wetting for several subregions and there is statistical evidence that the distributions of drought and wetting events for a few subregions have changed between 1901 1957 and 1958 2015 changes in weather patterns both naturally and from the diverse set of human forcings council 2005 pielke et al 2007 have the potential to alter the dominant features that affect drought variability in the great plains the water resource community is considering the need to include changes in weather patterns from what occurred in the past to inform future management practices hossain et al 2015 analysis showed that drought variability was not stationary over the historical period there is evidence of increased space time drought variability since 1980 or later during the summer and decreased variability during the winter decision makers should interpret these changes in variability as an increase or decrease in the spatial drought complexities if drought and wetting events become more variable across space and time greater interregional cooperation will be desirable to accommodate for the wide range of potential impacts decision makers in the great plains that have an understanding of these trends in variability will be able to adjust long term resource management strategies that may help mitigate the economic and
