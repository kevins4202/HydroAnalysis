13885,advanced oxidation processes have gained attention recently due to their effectiveness in mineralizing toxic recalcitrant pollutants in this paper studies on combined sonolysis and electroxidation techniques have been reviewed for the degradation of the persistent organic pollutants and real industrial wastewater the effects of various parameters such as ultrasonic power current density initial ph and electrolyte concentration have been elucidated critical analysis of the studies 1996 2020 on the treatment of various synthetic and real wastewater using the sono electroxidation process has been considered ultrasound in combination with electrochemical technology is an attractive option for the treatment of industrial wastewater the application of ultrasound gives the synergistic effect by virtue of the physical and chemical effects of cavitation coupling these two techniques increases the mineralization degree by increasing the mass transport rate and the chemical reaction rate and reduce the electrode passivation and fouling problem woking with an optimized sonoelectrochemical reactor design with low power ultrasound with pulsed mode can remarkably decrease the energy cost and increase the economic viability of the treatment method challenges associated with the process are documented in this paper abbreviations aops advanced

1 introduction industrial wastewater pollution is a worldwide environmental issue because of the complex composition and other challenging characteristics of wastewater generated from various industries such as food cosmetics textile pharmaceutical pulp and paper industries 1 also industrial waste containing volatile organic compounds vocs pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps petroleum constituents and aromatics in wastewater such as 4 methyl benzylidene camphor 4 mbc octocrylene oc norfloxacin ciprofloxacin triclosan benzophenone 3 bp 3 uv filter galaxolide and tonalide polycyclic musk dankly ethers methyl t butyl ether mtbe are frequently released into the river ponds lakes and ultimately contaminating groundwater and creating a risk for the human health 2 as far as the occurrence of these pops in the wastewater is concerned it also comes from the municipal sewage treatment plants these micropollutants are mutagenic and hazardous and their derivatives are even more toxic than parent compounds therefore the removal of these persistent organic pollutants pops in wastewater has grown attention among the scientific community 3 various conventional physio chemical and biological treatment methods have been applied for the removal of pops however these methods have their own limitation in terms of secondary waste generation and poor degradation mineralization efficiency for the pollutant the problem of secondary solid waste can be solved by employing energy based techniques such as sonolysis us 4 electrochemical ec 5 6 and photocatalysis 7 which are called advanced oxidation processes aops 8 the most commonly used aops for the removal of pops in wastewater are fenton and fenton like 9 ec 10 photocatalyst 7 11 ultrasound based oxidation 12 ozonation 13 etc these all aops generate the different reactive oxygen species ros such as hydroxyl radicals oh singlet oxygen 1o2 triplet oxygen 3o2 etc 14 16 oxidation potential of these radicals such as standard redox potential of oh is e 2 8 v vs she towards the pollutant degradation is high 17 therefore these radicals can degrade most of the organic pollutants with the rate of the order of 106 109 l mol s 1 18 as an individual technique ultrasound takes a long time for the complete mineralization of the pollutant 19 and ec techniques suffered from the electrode passivation inactivation and polarization problem 20 22 recently sonoelectroxidation us ec an integrated technology of ultrasound and ec has gained attention as a new hybrid aop for the removal of recalcitrant organic pollutants a significant improvement in the oxidation efficiency of the pollutant have been reported using the us ec technique in the literature apart from pollutant oxidation the us prevents the deposition of the by product on the electrode surface increases the mass transfer rate and current efficiency and reduces the energy consumption for the complete mineralization of the pollutant 23 therefore the coupling of ultrasound with ec technology not only provides the enhanced efficiency for the pollutant degradation but also increases the life of the electrode and reduces the cost of the treatment over the past decades several studies have been devoted to the removal of pops using us ec techniques 1 8 23 27 these techniques reported that ultrasound induces the chemical biological and mechanical changes in the medium due to the physical and chemical effect of the cavitation 26 hence ultrasound could effectively make up the shortcoming of the ec techniques alone in this review paper progress in us ec technology for the degradation mineralization of the various organic waste in the last decade has been reviewed and various challenges are discussed in depth 2 sonoelectrolysis and its mechanism 2 1 mechanism of sonolysis sonolysis is an advanced oxidation process in which ultrasound waves are used for the degradation of the pollutants present in the wastewater ultrasound is nothing but a sound wave having a frequency higher than the human audible frequency of 16 khz 27 fig 1 shows us degradation mechanism of organic pollutants ultrasound mechanism for the degradation of pollutants based on acoustic cavitation which is a phenomenon of formation growth and transient collapse of microbubble in the liquid medium 28 when ultrasonic wave passes through the irradiating medium compression and expansion cycles of ultrasonic waves continuously exerted positive and negative pressure on the liquid 29 during the negative pressure microbubble expand and during positive pressure microbubble compress this expansion and compression cycle continues till negative pressure sufficiently is large enough to pull the liquid molecules from each other to the threshold limit hence cavities filled with gas and vapor get formed cavitation bubble gets formed and the bubble grows in size over a few cycle and finally explosive collapse occurs this transient collapse generates a temperature of 5000 k and pressure 1000 atm leading to the thermal dissociation of water molecules into oh and h radicals as shown in eq 1 5 30 32 sonolysis reaction occurs inside the cavitation bubble at the interface of the cavitation bubble as well as in bulk at the surface of the transient bubble the concentration of the oh radicals is comparatively high at the time of the collapse these radicals eject to the bulk medium where it reacts with the pollutant and decomposes it another mechanism of us oxidation is the pyrolysis of the organic pollutant which takes place under high temperature and pressure inside the cavitation microbubble hydrophobic types of the pollutants get inside the microbubble where oxidation of the pollutant takes place under higher temperatures 500 k and pressure 1000 atm 28 1 h2o ultrasound oh h 2 oh h h2o 3 h o2 ho2 4 oh oh h2o2 5 2 ho2 h2o2 o2 6 o2 2 o 2 1 1 limitations of us alone few studies have been reported which show the degradation of organic pollutants using the us alone 33 38 however complete mineralization of pollutants such as phenol and its derivative ppcps products and nitrogenous compounds nitrobenzene aniline and pyridine is not well reported using the us alone 8 us alone is not an efficient process for the degradation of all types of recalcitrant pollutants because oh radicals generated from the collapse of microbubble gets recombined at the gas liquid interface before being ejected into the bulk solution therefore oxidation of the pollutants will not take place in the bulk medium by oh radicals nature of the pollutant hydrophobic or hydrophilic and its degradation mechanism inside cavitation bubble gas liquid interface and bulk medium is important for the complete mineralization of the pollutants using the us alone 29 further hydrophilic pollutants do not get inside the cavitation bubble due to which direct pyrolysis of the pollutants does not occur inside the cavitation bubble therefore complete degradation of the pollutant will not occur using the us alone further energy consumption limitation at the higher frequency ultrasonic horn and higher ultrasonic power restrict the application of ultrasound in the low frequency range 20 100 khz and low ultrasonic power range 40 120 w due to which wide application of us alone on variety of pollutants is not feasible 2 2 synergistic mechanism of us ec techniques ec process individually also suffers from the limitation of the mass transport passivation of the electrode which decreases the efficiency of the electrode therefore coupling ultrasound with electrochemical technology can be a viable option to overcome the weakness of the us and ec alone 39 fig 2 shows the sono electroxidation degradation mechanism of refractory organic pollutants ultrasound in combination with the ec provides the synergistic effect via physical and chemical effects of ultrasound irradiation of the electrochemical cell using ultrasound produces physical effects such as microjet shock wave turbulence and acoustic streaming of ultrasound provide in situ cleaning of electrodes increase the rate of chemical reaction increase the mass transfer of the pollutants across the electrodes and reduce the diffusion layer thickness to several micrometers simultaneous effect of all these significantly increase the mineralization degree reduce the passivation and increases the life of the electrode further chemical effects of ultrasound increase the rate of formation of reactive hydroxyl radicals oh which react with the pollutant either in bulk medium or at the gas liquid interface 40 therefore a positive synergistic effect always exists when ultrasound is used in combination with electrolysis further due to the physical effect some part of the ultrasound energy gets absorbed by the liquid medium this results in the mechanical momentum of the liquid acoustic streaming due to which faradaic current and mass transfer of electroactive compound increases 39 the transient cavitation results in uneven and violent motion of the solution due to the mutual interaction of collapsing and oscillating bubbles the ultrasound increases the mass transport of the reactant to the electrode surface enhances the efficiency of the electrochemical cell and keeps the electrode clean and activated 39 ultrasonic frequency and anode material play an important role in the synergism of the process it was reported by compton et al 41 that higher ultrasonic frequency favor the chemical effect of the ultrasound i e higher rate of formation of the oh radicals while low frequency supports the mechanical effects such as the generation of a shock wave which results in an enhancement in the mass transfer and in situ activate the electrode 42 this effect results in an enhancement in electrolysis current due to which yield of electrolysis changes i e more than one reaction pathway with different rates 2 2 1 sono electrocoagulation electrocoagulation ecg is a versatile technique for the treatment of a variety of wastewaters such as oil tanning 43 car washing 44 gray 45 olive oil mill 46 pulp and paper mill 47 distillery 48 49 terephthalic acid 50 dairy 51 and dye 52 55 however electrode passivation which increases the resistance and reduces the releases of the coagulation material has been reported to be the main electrode problem during the treatment electrode passivation increases the cell voltage and decreases the current efficiency due to which the cost of treatment increases many investigators have coupled the ultrasonic process with ecg to prevent passivation 44 45 56 57 li et al 57 reported the beneficial effects of the us in combination with the ecg technique us significantly improved the phosphorus removal efficiency 99 6 from synthetic wastewater as compared to 81 3 using ecg only the synergistic effect of the us in combination with the ecg was attributed to i the mechanical effect of the us which destructs the dense layer of byproduct deposition on the electrode surface and ii enhanced hydroxide formation with increased adsorption of pollutants vianney et al 54 studied the degradation of azo dyes methyl red and congo red from aqueous solutions using us ecg process us alone gave 9 55 decolorization ecg gave 40 75 and us ecg gave 100 decolorization of congo red dye in 20 min the higher performance of us ecg was attributed to the increased production of the oh radicals by the us process which attack the nn bond of azo dye in another study raschitor et al 55 reported 92 rhodamine 6 g removal efficiency with us ecg as compared to 60 efficiency in the ecg process in 5 h treatment time turbidity removal of the wastewater also found to increase with the coupling of the us with the ecg process he et al 56 reported that the us ecg increases the removal efficiency of rb19 by 7 over the conventional electro coagulation process the author also reported that during the ecg process electrode impedance increased while it decreased during the us ecg this indicated that the passive film gets removed from the sacrificial electrode using the us due to which sacrificial electrode can generate more coagulant metal besides the us also decreased the size of the metal hydroxide which adsorb more pollutants in wastewater dizge et al 48 worked on brewery wastewater treatment using us ecg which enhanced the cod removal to 60 5 as compared to 46 5 using ecg alone at the optimum condition of 100 a m 2 ph 7 and reaction time of 60 min us enhanced radicals generation rate therefore higher reaction rate and pollution removal efficiency was obtained further us also affects the particle size formation of refractory compounds and organic material structure some studies report negative impacts of us in combination with ecg as well lakshmi and sivashanmugam 43 reported the treatment of oil tanning effluent by us assisted ecg technique using aluminum al and iron fe sacrificial electrodes in this study the us showed an adverse effect on the mineralization efficiency cod removal of 90 was obtained using ecg which decreased to 86 using us ecg however sludge generation increased from 0 49 kg m 3 using ecg to 0 9 kg m 3 using us ecg us didn t allow the formation of flocs and only anodic dissolution and mixing was occurring which decreased the cod removal efficiency the increase in sludge generation was attributed to the fact that the us reduced the diffusion layer thickness at the electrode surface and increased the current efficiency thus increasing the formation of metal ions thereby enhancing metal hydroxide generation in another reported study the us couldn t significantly influence the cod removal efficiency for the treatment of greywater 45 3 sonoelectroxidation of organic pollutant a number of researchers have worked on the degradation of the pollutants using the us ec process 1 8 23 26 58 59 this section presents the work done on the degradation of dyes pharmaceutical compounds aromatics and phthalates employing the us ec method a conventional us ec reactor which described the simultaneous removal of pollutant is shown in fig 3 3 1 dyes textile industries are considered as the primary source of the dye wastewater producing units that pollute the natural streams 60 dyes are difficult to remove by conventional physicochemical methods 61 therefore as an alternative aops such as photocatalytic degradation 62 ozonation 63 and ec 5 are found to be prominent techniques that can successfully mineralize the dyes containing industrial effluents percentage degradation of the dyes through the us ec and us ec process reported in different studies are depicted in fig 4 it was found that the us alone is not accomplished enough for the removal of these dye the ec process has shown some restrictions on the scale up of the process due to the limitation of the mass transfer electrode fouling and passivation problem 64 66 therefore the coupling of ultrasound with ec oxidation can be a viable technique which provides a synergistic effect se on degradation efficiency many studies reported almost 90 removal of dyes using the us ec oxidation process 8 42 67 68 table 1 presents a comparative assessment of studies on the degradation of dyes using the us ec process 69 81 some recently published literature for mineralization of dyes using the us ec process is discussed herein lorimer et al 81 showed degradation of the sandolan yellow dyes through ultrasonic assisted electroxidation with platinum and carbon electrode ultrasound when operated alone at two different frequencies of 20 khz and 40 khz did not decolorize the acidic sandolan yellow dyes moreover the dye also resisted 0 5 mol dm 3 of h2o2 decolorization of sandolan yellow was obtained using the addition of a sodium hypochlorite solution the rate of decolorization was much quicker by electrolysis alone using a platinum electrode as compared to the carbon electrode the effect of different types of electrode ti cu al ni graphite and stainless steel on the degradation of cyanide ions was studied by iordache et al 80 highest electroxidation efficiency 22 was obtained using the graphite electrode and lowest 10 with the ti electrode us ec efficiency was the highest 60 with aluminum electrode while the lowest using graphite fig 5 aluminum was found most efficient electrode with sonoelectro chlorination with 78 efficiency and graphite was found to be the least efficient electrode the efficiency of the electrodes was in the order graphite ti inox ni cu al for the sono electroxidation of cyanide ions in another study by chua et al 79 the mineralization of cyan ink effluent was carried out using two step treatment step one used combined oxidation of the ultrasound assisted ec process and step second used chemical oxidation process which involved feso4 and h2o2 the us alone provided no significant reduction in response to cod copper content and color removal after 3 h treatment time us in combination with the fenton process provide 45 cod removal that was more than fenton s process alone in the two step treatment of cyan ink effluent a 65 reduction of copper content 20 cod reduction with 98 reduction in sludge generation was reported in 3 h treatment time fenton s process alone produced 6 7 g cod 1 sludge due to the less amount of feso4 requirement at the second stage and highly acidic conditions of the treated effluent lead to higher solubility of the product for iron sludge treated effluent by the two stage process also met the copper discharge limit with less disposal cost of sludge which is an advantage over fenton s process rivera et al 78 removed acid black 24 ab 24 lg b mo and trupocor red tr dyes using the us ec technique with a graphite electrode the application of the ultrasound for degassing and activation of electrode surface in combination with the ec techniques increased the decolorization and cod removal of the various dyes degradation of ab 24 was higher 50 18 using the us ec process as compared to the ec treatment alone 20 76 cod removal was 19 05 and 14 28 using us ec and ec techniques lg b degradation was also observed in the continuous mode of the us ec technique and found that lg b decolorization was 95 at the optimum condition of 0 0025 mol l 1 of na2so4 with total reflux of 4 5 ml min 1 after 2 h treatment which was almost four times than ec treatment the difference in the removal percentage of these dyes was due to the types of chromophore present in dye structure mono azo lg b can be easily breakable than di azo ab 24 on the other hand ai et al 77 investigated the decolorization of rhodamine b rhb azo dye using the us ec process the decolorization of rhb using the us alone is not possible however 24 5 of decolorization was obtained using electrolysis alone and 91 4 degradation was reported using the sono electroxidation process reported results clearly showed the se of the combined process since the lower frequency of ultrasound were used in the study therefore oh radicals produced were less and only chemical effect of ultrasound is not enough for the synergetic degradation roll of physical effect was also important which improved the decolorization rate by an increase in the activity at the surface of electrode cleaning and peeling and increased the reaction rate of mass transfer siddique et al 76 investigated the decolorization of rb 19 using the pbo2 electrode for the us ec process his research group found that the us ec process is an effective technique in terms of energy consumption and decomposition of rb 19 about 90 decolorization with 56 toc removal was reported at the optimum condition of ph 8 80 khz ultrasonic frequency 120 min treatment time and 50 mg l 1 dye concentration 81 toc removal was observed with hydrolyzed dye reported results confirmed the synergism in the combined strategies of the us ec process wu et al 75 did studies on operation parameters current density ph initial dye concentration and electrolyte concentration for decolorization of ci reactive black 8 cirb 8 by ti ruo2 iro2 anodic oxidation with and without ultrasound with ultrasound alone negligible color removal was obtained later siddique et al 76 also reported only 13 degradation of rb 19 dyes using the us alone wu et al 75 found cod removal of 32 4 and cirb 8 removal efficiency of 62 9 at optimum condition of 31 7 ma cm 2 current density for initial dye concentration of 100 mg l 1 5 4 ph 90 min treatment time ultrasonic power of 100 w l 1 and 0 1 mol l 1 electrolyte concentration enhancement factor ratio of the rate constant of the us ec process to ec process using the us ec process was greater than one which shows that ultrasound irradiation enhanced the decolorization with ec oxidation process observed enhancement was due to the increase in turbulence and mass transfer of the pollutants 82 somayajula et al 74 worked on the decolorization of reactive red 195 rr 195 by the us ec method with the mmo mesh type electrode about 91 decolorization was found with the ec process and 99 decolorization was reported with the us ec process after 120 min treatment time lounis et al 70 reported only 3 decolorization of og using ultrasound alone while 90 removal after 30 min with ec treatment somayajula et al 74 reported cod removal of 23 using us ec and 14 using ec alone the effect of electrolytes concentration on decolorization was also investigated nacl and kcl provided 99 decolorization of rr 195 in 120 min as compared to 52 and 39 decolorization with na2so4 and na2co3 respectively the increase in treatment efficiency with the use of electrolytes was the production of hypochlorite ions by nacl and kcl wu et al 75 also reported that the presence of a high concentration of na2so4 in solution results in the scavenging of o h radicals by the sulfate ions yang et al 73 assessed the effect of the nano coating electrode on the degradation efficiency of methylene blue mb using the us ec process at the optimum condition 45 khz frequency 50 w power and 600 ma current toc removal efficiency was 92 with a nano coated electrode while under the same operating condition 70 toc removal was obtained using a conventional electrode shestakova et al 67 for the first time analyzed the modified electrode for the degradation of the mb dyes his research group assessed the sono electrocatalytic removal of the mb dye using the ti ta2o5 sno2 electrode prepared using the drop casting technique about 100 removal of mb was reported at the optimum frequency of 850 khz after 45 min treatment while the us alone took 90 min and electrolysis alone took 180 min for complete removal of mb dye cod removal was 78 9 40 4 and 85 4 using electrolysis us and us ec process respectively the energy consumption of the process was found to be 141 26 kw h m 3 for 0 025 mm mb dye these published studies were in agreement with the study reported by barros et al 68 they found almost 90 95 color removal of amaranth dyes using bdd anode after 90 min us ec treatment while only 8 amaranth dyes removal was seen using the us alone the performance of the us ec process at lower current density 10 25 ma cm 2 was found to be more effective therefore energy requirement of the process at lower current density was also found to be less 20 kw h kg 1 dye removed compared to the reported by shestakova et al 67 which is about 141 26 kw h m 3 on the other hand steter et al 72 reported 100 decolorization of amaranth dyes using the bdd electrode at lower current densities of 35 ma cm 2 energy consumption was found to be 5 3 kw h m 3 using a us ec reactor the toc removal was 92 1 using ec and 95 1 for the us ec process at the optimal current density of 35 ma cm 2 steter et al 72 found that at low current densities 10 25 ma cm 2 the apparent rate constant was higher for us ec techniques 10 1 min 1 as compared to ec alone 10 3 min 1 with an increase in the current density from 10 to 50 ma cm 2 current efficiency decreased from 55 to 20 the positive synergetic effect was found at lower current densities as compared to a higher current density due to saturation of the solution by oxygen and proxy radicals which increased the formation of oxidizing species like h2o2 and oxygen lounis et al 70 investigated the effect of operating parameters such as ultrasonic power current density for degradation of og dyes using the us ec reactor platinum anode and carbon felt cathode was used as an electrode it was found that with an increase in the ultrasonic power from 4 to 15 w removal efficiency increased to 100 at 15 w within 8 min however a further increase in power showed no significant effect on the mineralization of og dye ai et al 77 also assessed the ultrasonic power effect on rhodamine b rhb decolorization it was found that with an increase in ultrasonic power from 100 to 400 w decolorization of rhb increased while further increase in power up to 800 w decreased the decolorization this may be due to the delay in the growth of the cavitation bubble and long collapse duration leading to scavenging and recombination of o h radicals ultimately decreasing the degradation at the higher ultrasonic power lounis et al 70 reported that with an increase in the ph value from 3 to 6 og decolorization decreased due to the reduction in the oxidation potential of hydroxyl radical at ph 3 usec degradation was higher than at ph 2 due to the scavenging of o oh radicals by hydrogen ion at lower ph lounis et al 70 also studied the effect of pollutant concentration on the performance of us ec reactor they found that og percentage removal decreases from 92 to 87 with an increase in the concentration of the dye 0 6 mm to 0 8 mm wu et al 75 reported that with an increase in the concentration of dyes from 50 to 200 mg l 1 the rate constant value decreased from 0 0098 min 1 to 0 0081 min 1 for electroxidation process while values decreased from 0 0113 min 1 to 0 0101 min 1 for us ec process these results were found opposite to that reported by ai et al 77 during the study of the degradation of rhb dyes they reported that by changing the initial concentration of rhb dye from 10 to 50 mg l 1 the efficiency of removal of rhb was not affected barros et al 68 reported pseudo first order kinetic constant value of 4 6 10 2 min 1 for us ec treatment and 3 5 10 2 min 1 for electroxidation treatment mineralization efficiency was 95 for the us ec process and 80 for the ec process ultrasound enhanced the mineralization of the pollutant while the us alone was not able to mineralize the pollutant as toc removal of 19 only was observed ai et al 77 also reported that the us alone is not enough to degrade the textile dyes such as rhb lounis et al 70 show that with increases in current 30 to 100 ma og removal percentage increases results obtained were in agreement with the study of yang et al 73 they reported that with an increase in current 150 to 600 ma mineralization increases while further increases in the current slightly increase in toc reduction the possible reason is that the high applied current increases the rate of h2o2 generation which further decomposed to o h radicals through the cavitation phenomena similarly with increases in the concentration of fe ii ion 0 03 to 0 05 mm degradation rate was increased from 8 μm min 1 to 13 6 μm min 1 the increases in removal rate due to the increase in the production of o h radicals by electro fenton while it was also seen that further increases in the concentration of the fe ii ions from 0 05 mm to 0 5 mm og degradation decreases due to scavenging of o h radicals by fe ii giray et al 83 look ahead for degrading the real textile wastewater using the sonoelectrofenton process and reported 98 12 toc removal the effect of water matrices such as seawater pure water and mineral water was also reported by lounis et al 70 about 100 degradation was obtained after 8 min in seawater because of a high amount of nacl 35 g l 1 which lead to the production of hypochlorite ions while 94 was obtained in 20 min for mineral water with us ec treatment these results were in agreement with the studies of ai et al 77 they reported the effect of electrolyte concentration on decolorization of rhb they found that with 21 3 g l 1 na2so4 electrolyte concentration 100 decolorization was obtained in 12 min radi et al 71 studied the removal of cirb 49 with a carbon electrode 64 decolorization of cirb 49 at optimum ph 2 using sonochemical treatment while the us ec process enhanced the decolorization to 99 at ph 7 after 90 min of treatment the addition of 3 mol l 1 h2o2 slightly increased the decolorization while significantly increased the cod reduction from 76 2 in the absence of h2o2 to 87 8 they reported that because of the addition of h2o2 the rate of generation of oh radicals increased due to self decomposition under ultrasound irradiation and reduction of h2o2 in the conduction band produces additional oh a se in cod removal under ultrasonic irradiation at optimum condition was found which showed the hybridization of the us with electrolysis increased the mineralization of the pollutant radi et al 71 studied the degradation of cirb 49 dye using the us ec process results demonstrated that carbon working electrode and platinum electrode auxiliary electrode successfully decolorized 97 2 dyes and reduced 91 cod at the optimum condition of 8 3 ph 80 min treatment time and 10 mg l 1 initial dye concentration a synergism of 63 2 was reported in combined strategies of these two techniques this large positive se is due to the enhancement of the mass transfer and continuous activation of the electrode by ultrasound application 84 zhu et al 1 also studied the degradation of alizarin red s ars using us ec techniques it was investigated that at the optimum condition of 0 05 m na2so4 electrolyte concentration and ph 4 97 value 100 color removal and 86 07 cod removal was found lower temperature was favorable for the us ec techniques while higher temperatures above 45 c was favorable for ec with a higher rate of degradation 3 2 pharmaceuticals and personal care compounds pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps are the new class of emerging pollutants the presence of these types of contaminants in wastewater treatment plants groundwater seawater surface water soil and sludge has been reported 85 87 conventional methods have a limitation of sludge generation partial removal and high chemical requirements which increases the operating cost of the treatments therefore aops including us photolysis and electrolysis have been studied for remediation of ppcps such as ibp tcs and smx from the aqueous system percentage degradation of some pharmaceutical compound using these techniques are depicted in fig 6 some of the recent studies on ppcps pollutants using the us ec process are present in table 2 88 95 ren et al 95 reported the parametric study on triclosan tcs degradation using different combinations of electrode with higher frequency ultrasound 850 khz it was found that a diamond coated niobium electrode dcne was found best for the ec degradation of tcs which was 24 comparatively 9 with silicon carbide electrode sce and 6 using stainless steel electrode sse as shown in fig 7 about 35 se was observed with sse using the us ec system compared to 25 with sce and 8 with dcne the highest 82 tcs degradation was reported using sulfuric acid electrolyte and dcne electrode while 63 using sodium sulfate and 41 using sodium hydroxide effect of initial concentration of tcs on degradation efficiency was also seen and found that with an increase in the tcs concentration from 1 to 10 mg l 1 degradation efficiency decreased from 90 to 69 in 15 min treatment time energy efficiency increased and the highest energy efficiency observed was 1 312 mmol kw h 1 the effect of different electrolytes on the percentage degradation of tcs and phenol also reported by rean et al 95 it was found that naoh gave the highest percentage of degradation as compared to h2so4 and na2so4 electrolyte an overview of aops for the mineralization of tcs is shown in fig 8 almost all types of aops can successfully degrade the tcs from the wastewater tran et al 92 observed the degradation of carbamazepine cbz using ti pbo2 anode and ti cathode by the us ec method about 90 removal using the us ec process was reported at optimum condition of 180 min time 38 w ultrasonic power and 4 a current for 10 mg l 1 carbamazepine however this optimal condition was applied for the mineralization of the municipal wastewater effluent which contains 10 μg l 1 they found 93 removal of cbz 60 reduction of toc and a 93 reduction of cod finkbeiner et al 94 performed the mineralization of diclofenac dcf with the us ec process and found 90 degradation within 5 min the effect of various operating parameters such as applied voltage electrode gap immersion depth of electrode and ph was also studied dcf degradation decreased from 96 8 to 85 1 with an increase in the ph value from 4 4 to 9 9 they reported that this decrease in the degradation was due to the fact that at lower ph value diclofenac exists in nonpolar molecular form which is more hydrophobic and can easily be oxidized at the boundary layer of cavitation bubble compares to nonpolar form at higher ph value higher voltage lead to higher degradation of the dcf which is 93 at 7 2 v as compared to 54 at 2 8 v overview of different aops for diclofenac degradation is depicted in fig 9 it can be observed that almost all types of aops able to degraded the diclofenac from the wastewater without any generation of secondary waste it shows that aops can successfully applied for the mineralization of the pharmaceuticals pollutants thokchom et al 93 studied the ibp degradation kinetics with different electrolytes using a us assisted ec oxidation process it was found that the ultrasound as an individual treatment process was most effective using h2so4 rate constant 0 0326 min 1 as an electrolyte because of the non volatile property of ibp and hydrophobic nature in the case of h2so4 ec treatment was most effective with naoh rate constant 0 032 min 1 because of the hydrophilic form of the ibp at 10 75 ph similar results were reported by ciriaco et al 96 who used naoh for the mineralization of ibp with a modified electrode as depicted in fig 10 the combined us ec of ibp provided 89 32 degradation using naoh and 81 85 using h2so4 and 88 70 using deionized water tran et al 97 worked on titanium coated pbo2 electrode for the degradation of ibp using us ec process and reported 84 74 removal of ibp using us ec process with synergy degree of 5 26 which was lower than that reported by ren et al 84 while degrading phenol with us ec process 75 in which sse was used for 400 ml treatment volume they found a synergy degree of 60 using the us ec process this discrepancy in synergism was due to the difference in power imposed for the degradation of pollutants tran et al 97 imposed 244 w g 1 of ibu while ren et al 84 delivered 4521 wg 1 of phenol another reason is that the ibu structure is more complex than phenol for the oxidation therefore it was quite difficult to degrade ibu as compared to phenol tran et al 97 reported that ibp mineralization increased up to 84 2 with an increase in ultrasonic power from 5 to 40 w villaroel et al 98 reported that the degradation rate increased with increases in power for the degradation of acetaminophen in water madhavan et al 99 also assessed similar outcomes during the oxidation of dcf pollutants using the sonochemical process tran et al 97 reported 89 ibu removal and 84 toc removal with a current intensity of 10 a ciriaco et al 96 also reported 60 95 cod removal and 48 92 toc removal of ibu using electroxidation by ti pt pbo2 bdd anode electrode while da silva duarte et al 100 reported 95 rifampicin removal in 3 h using the bdd anode electrode yang et al 91 studied combined ultrasound ec degradation of actual pharmaceutical wastewater pww by nanocoated electrode ruo2 iro2 ti a significant improvement in the mineralization of the pollutant was reported using a nanocoated electrode the current density effect 2 8 ma cm 2 was found to be positive because of an increase in oh radical generation and diffusion with an increase in current density 94 cod removal of pww was reported using us ec treatment at optimum condition of current density 8 ma cm 2 ultrasonic power 100 w and 45 khz frequency however using the traditional electrode at the same operating condition only 70 cod removal was obtained the difference in cod removal between nanocoated electrode and conventional coated electrode a higher number of active sites are available in the nanocoated electrode as compared to the conventional coated electrode therefore ultrasound enhanced the mass transport inside the bulk and increased the generation of oh radicals from the surface of the nanocoated electrode due to the higher rate of oh radicals generation the rapid reaction of pollutants with oh radicals takes place ultimately higher mineralization takes place in the absence of ultrasound cod removal was 50 for both types of electrodes it was also observed that the presence of ultrasound enhanced the oxidation activity of chlorine tran et al 101 studied chlortetracycline degradation using ti pbo2 electrode 73 3 degradation was found at optimum condition of current 3 92 a ultrasonic power 20 w frequency 500 khz and 90 min treatment time at this optimum condition 61 4 mineralization toc removal was reported effectiveness of the us ec process was also evaluated by employing the real municipal wastewater and found that up to 98 oxidation of the chlortetracycline due to the presence of the chloride ion in the real wastewater both direct due to oh radicals and indirect hypochlorous acid formed by chloride oxidation anodic oxidation involved in the mineralization of the pollutants zaviska et al 102 also reported similar studies during the mineralization of real wastewater contaminated with bpa and 465 mg l 1 chloride ions they reported that within 30 min treatment time complete degradation of bpa took place in municipal wastewater while it took 100 min for the complete degradation of synthetic wastewater using na2so4 as an electrolyte huang et al 89 adopted a common platinum and graphite electrode for smx degradation using the us ec oxidation method the us alone showed a marginal degradation of smx while electrolysis gave 10 degradation and sonoelectrolysis provided 83 removal of smx the synergism of 14 7 at the optimum condition was reported direct anodic oxidation and oh radicals were both found to be responsible for this synergism tran et al 90 reported cbz degradation with titanium coated pbo2 ti pbo2 electrode and found 99 5 degradation at optimum condition using the us ec process 91 of cbz degradation was obtained using the ec process at the same condition in 30 days the synergy degree increased with an increase in the power of ultrasound the highest synergy degree of 33 5 was obtained at 40 w power dominguez et al 103 also assessed electroxidation mineralization of cbz using the ti bdd electrode ti bdd electrode caused complete degradation of cbz at the optimal condition the highest synergy degree of 25 36 and lowest synergy of 9 31 was reported by tran et al 90 at 1 a and 15 a respectively huang et al 89 also performed parametric studies for the degradation of smx his research found that smx degradation increased with an increase in applied current density up to 20 ma cm 2 above 20 ma cm 2 the rate of degradation slightly decreased this is because at higher current oxygen evolution takes place near the electrode which inhibits the direct oxidation of the pollutant effect of the addition of different electrolytes such as na2so4 nano3 and nacl fe2 and h2o2 on us ec and ec system was also observed nano3 gave the highest rate constant value with 83 removal while nacl gave the lowest value an additional effect of fe2 was also investigated and found that the us ec fe2 system was found to be the best among others employed for the mineralization of the smx tran et al 90 also examined the morphology of the electrode pre and post treatment using scanning electron microscopy eds analysis and eis measurement it was found that the surface of the electrode used in the us ec process does not contain any impurities while the surface of the electrode used in the electroxidation process contains impurities hence the promotional role of ultrasound in cleaning and peeling of the electrode was observed soltani et al 88 studied the degradation of ibuprofen using platinum and carbon black coated carbon cloth as a cathode with us ec techniques the us alone gave 13 8 degradation ec alone gave 58 degradation and us ec gave 84 2 degradation of the ibu indicate that the coupling of ultrasound using the us ec process enhanced the degradation of the ibu the effect of the presence of organic and inorganic compounds on the us ec reactor was also investigated it was found that methanol and ethanol both decreased the removal efficiency of ibp up to 47 2 and 71 7 respectively this is due to the scavenging of oh radicals by alcoholic compounds while the presence of inorganic such as carbonate and chloride increased the degradation efficiency of up to 95 3 and 88 4 respectively the presence of chloride ions generated the chlorine free radicals cl and increased the degradation rate of ibu 3 3 herbicide fungicides and insecticides few studies have been reported for the degradation of the herbicide fungicides and insecticides using the us ec process table 3 presents a comparative assessment of these studies for the degradation of herbicide and fungicide 104 110 3 3 1 herbicide bringas et al 107 worked on diuron herbicide mineralization using the bdd electrode by ultrasound assisted ec oxidation process 100 degradation of herbicide was obtained after 7 h dissolved organic carbon doc removal was 69 using ec and 91 using us ec after 8 h treatment a se of 43 at the optimum condition of 60 ma cm 2 20 khz ph 12 and 10 c was reported guo et al 111 reported a 10 degradation of 2 4 dinitrophenol using low frequency ultrasound in 4 h treatment abu hassan et al 112 reported 80 degradation and 20 25 mineralization of sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate souza et al 106 reported 100 degradation of 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 2 4 d herbicide using us ec process all studies show that the us ec process can mineralize herbicides kinetic study results revealed that high ph favors fast mineralization due to the accumulation of hypochlorite that acts as a redox agent canizares et al 113 observed similar results during the degradation of chlorophenols some cases of successful pesticide mineralization by means of us ec oxidation are also reported yasman et al 109 investigated the degradation of chloro organic compounds with the sonoelectrocatalytic process a common herbicide 2 4 d and 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dc phenol was selected as a model pollutant the application of pd and pd fe powder in the sonoelectrocatalytic process allowed the complete removal of the complex chlororganic compounds about 65 degradation of 2 4 d in 30 sec and complete conversion was obtained in 10 min using the pd electrode yasman et al 110 evaluated the performance of the us ec fenton process for the decomposition of 2 4 d and 2 4 dc phenol and found that the efficiency of sono electro fenton process for the mineralization of the pollutant is much higher than the other process 50 removal of 2 4 d solution in 60 seconds while complete degradation was obtained in 600 sec esclapez et al 108 investigated the improved ec route of tcaa a pesticide degradation using ultrasound a continuous flow us ec device on the pilot scale was used for the degradation of an organic compound high conversion 95 with high current efficiency 10 selectivity of 0 92 and degradation efficiency of 26 was reported they also found that the tcaa degradation got enhanced using high frequency ultrasound by means of dissociative adsorption incineration that occurred on both the electrodes 3 3 2 fungicides and insecticides steter et al 105 observed the degradation of thiram fungicide using the bdd electrode by the us ec method operating parameter effects on degradation kinetics were evaluated with an increase in current density from 10 to 50 ma cm 2 current efficiency decreased from 25 88 to 11 27 whereas energy consumption increased from 27 70 to 55 27 kw h m 3 ren et al 104 reported the degradation of chlorpyrifos insecticides using the us ec technique by sse 50 98 removal using the us 72 8 removal using the ec system and 93 3 removal using the us ec process was reported a synergism of 37 using the combined system was reported sodium sulfate was selected as an electrolyte so that the ph of the solution is not affected by the addition of the electrolyte 3 4 aromatic compounds aromatic compounds are persistent organic pollutants in the environment these compounds accumulate in high concentrations near the oil distillation plants 114 the decomposition of these organic complexes from the wastewater is still a changing task for the researcher the degradation of the various aromatic pollutants using us ec and us ec are shown in fig 11 table 4 presents a comparative assessment of studies on aromatics compound degradation using the us ec process 115 121 trabelsi et al 26 reported the degradation of phenol using the us ec process and found only 3 phenol degradation using the us alone while 75 degradation was obtained after 10 min using the us ec process with 20 khz ultrasound frequency at the optimum conditions 95 degradation was obtained with the same treatment time using a 540 khz ultrasound frequency with no toxic product lima leite et al 121 investigated the degradation of 2 4 dihydroxybenzoic acid 2 4 dhba under two ultrasonic frequencies 20 khz and 500 khz under the optimum condition 47 toc degradation was reported using the us ec technique de lima leite et al 122 reported that the electrolysis is able to degrade the pollutant but under low concentration and this technique is not efficient lima leite et al 121 investigated the combination of ultrasound and electro oxidation and found that under the combined technique pollutants can be effectively removed in low concentration at low ultrasound frequency the mass transfer rate and adsorption and desorption mechanisms got accelerated under ultrasound irradiation zhao et al 120 studied the decomposition of the phenol and phthalic acid pa in the presence of ultrasound using the bdd electrode anode and titanium foil cathode only 1 5 cod removal of phenol and 1 3 cod removal of phthalic acid was reported after 3 h using the us alone zhao et al 120 combined ultrasound and ec oxidation processes for the degradation of phenol and pa and reported 100 cod removal the promotional role of the ultrasound by virtue of chemical and physical effect of ultrasound was clearly observed another interesting result was found that the variation in energy consumption was lower in the case of the us ec process as compared to ec alone for both the pollutants this reflects that the us can reduce the ec energy requirement for the complete mineralization of the pollutants mass transport coefficient kd increased with the application of ultrasound and it was found to be 2 0 10 5 m s 1 in case of the us ec process for both the pollutant as compared to 6 7 10 6 m s 1 for pa and 5 4 10 6 m s 1 for phenol with ec alone this clearly shows that the kd value of the us ec system is higher than the ec system alone this is because the application of ultrasound in combination with ec increased the adsorption desorption process on the electrode surface ec alone gets difficult to desorb intermediates from the electrode surface while in the us ec process desorption of intermediates was easy zhao et al 24 assessed the effect of the bdd electrode and pt electrode for phenol degradation only 1 5 degradation of phenol using ultrasound was found in 3 h they investigated that the oxidation efficiency of phenol on the bdd electrode was faster than the pt electrode 39 cod removal was investigated using a pt electrode while 69 cod removal was reported using a bdd electrode garbellinil et al 123 also investigated the valuable effect of ultrasound for the degradation of pentachlorophenol using the bdd electrode they reported 19 8 degradation using us 70 8 degradation using electrolysis and 82 6 degradation using the us ec process zhao et al 24 reported that the bdd shows higher oep as compared to the pt electrode therefore higher degradation was obtained using the bdd electrode than the pt electrode average current efficiency was also investigated and found that in the ec process it was 6 5 using a pt electrode while it was 12 3 using the bdd electrode the average current efficiency increased to 9 7 in the us ec process using a pt electrode and increased to 24 6 using the bdd electrode about 100 us ec degradation of phenol was obtained in 3 h using the bdd electrode while it took 4 h using the pt electrode ren et al 84 published a study on phenol degradation by low cost sse using higher frequency 850 khz ultrasound for the economic performance and found 16 32 and 99 removal of phenol using us ec and us ec process they reported that with an increase in electrolyte concentration from 0 39 to 4 26 g l 1 percentage degradation increased from 24 to 67 energy consumption increased from 0 180 kw h to 0 198 kw h and energy efficiency increased from 0 520 to 1 354 mmol kwh 1 an increase in the percentage removal with an increase in the electrolyte concentration was due to an increase in the conductivity of the solution souza et al 118 also assessed the complete mineralization of dimethyl phthalate dmp using the us ec process by employing a conductive diamond electrode chen et al 117 reported that the enhancement in toc removal by combined strategies by virtue of ultrasound which increases the mass transfer rate across the electrode the influence of operational parameters on toc removal efficiency was also investigated and found that with an increase in temperature toc removal decreases 94 toc removal was obtained at the lowest temperature of 30 c this was due to a higher yield of h2o2 results in a higher rate of generation of o oh radicals at a lower temperature a stronger acidic medium was favorable for a higher toc removal rate effect of oxygen dosage and ferrous ion concentration was also investigated and found that with increases in oxygen dosage toc removal increases while at 150 mg l 1 ferrous ions concentration 99 toc removal reported xia et al 116 studied a dual pulse ultrasonic enhanced ec process for the degradation of nitrobenzene and found that dual pulse us ec process has a better efficiency in terms of degradation and energy consumption 63 degradation of nitrobenzene using the ec process and 78 degradation using the us ec process was reported 80 nitrobenzene degradation was obtained using a dual pulse us ec coupling process observed results are due to pulse mode diminished interference of ultrasound on ec degradation energy used by the dual pulse us ec method was only 46 5 of the conventional us ec method they also reported that the acidic condition was more favorable for the dual pulse us ec process than alkaline conditions aquinoneto et al 124 also reported the similar results that organic compound oxidation is more favorable in acidic medium this is because lower value of ph diminishes the oxygen evolution reaction further electrolyte concentration increased the removal efficiency due to an increase in the conductivity of the solution ultrasonic power has a positive effect on the pulsed process with increased ultrasonic power nitrobenzene degradation increased due to the enhancement in the cavitation activity of the bubble chen et al 117 considered the degradation of nitrotoluenes using a commonly used platinum electrode by the us ec process synergism was reported using toc removal efficiency 15 69 and almost complete mineralization 94 toc removal were reported using us electrolysis and sonoelectrolysis process dietrich et al 123 worked on the mineralization of bpa by combing the bdd electrode with a lower frequency 20 khz ultrasound 38 bpa degradation at 25 μm ultrasonic amplitude and 61 bpa degradation at 125 μm ultrasonic amplitude was reported increases in the amplitude increases the percentage removal this may be because of increasing hydroxyl radicals by higher amplitude ultrasound dietrich et al 115 also studied the effect of sonotrode immersion depth and found that with decreased immersion depth of sonotrode from 8 1 cm to 3 1 cm the bpa degradation decreases from 61 to 29 93 degradation of bp a was reported at the optimum condition of 2 cm electrode gap 24 khz frequency and 5 v power a synergistic index of 2 26 was investigated using 125 μm amplitude the percentage degradation of bpa using different methods is depicted in fig 12 dietrich et al 115 evaluated 0 024 0 016 and 0 090 min 1 rate constant value for the us ec and us ec process respectively some researchers also employed different types of electrode for degradation of persistent pollutants such as zhu et al 119 reported the removal of p substituted phenol using bdd and pbo2 electrode the study showed that ultrasonic irradiation increases the cod removal efficiency by virtue of mass transfer enhancement trabelsi et al 26 and lima leite et al 121 also reported the enhancement in ec oxidation of phenol at pt and bdd electrode due to improved mass transfer rate by ultrasound bdd electrode showed higher rate of removal of p substituted phenol 73 83 removal and 60 70 cod removal compare to the pbo2 electrode 50 70 5 25 cod removal 3 5 chlorinated compounds chlorinated compounds have been reported as a strong recalcitrant class of pollutants among others found in the aqueous life 125 due to the poor performance of the biological methods toward the degradation of the chlorinated compounds the researchers have studied alternative techniques such as catalytic hydrogenation photolysis and the us table 5 presents a comparative assessment of these studies for the degradation of chlorinated and other miscellaneous compounds 126 130 saez et al 127 studied the degradation of perchloroethylene which is used as a chlorinated solvent in many industries 55 degradation efficiency and 100 fractional conversion of perchloroethylene were reported using pb and pbo2 electrodes under low ultrasonic intensity energy consumption with the us ec process is less as compared to the sonochemical treatment because of the significant reduction in the time using a pulsed mode flow reactor in another study by saez et al 128 decomposition of perchloroethylene were carried out without electrolyte they reported that low conductivity wastewater could be successfully mineralized using an ultrasound assisted ec process ultrasound cavitation increases the mass transfer of ion across the electrodes which avoids the use of extra chemicals about 100 dechlorination was obtained at high ultrasonic power 3 6 other recovery of silver from the photographic effluents is a major problem industrially various techniques have been employed such as ion exchange electrolysis bacterial digestion to recover silver from photographic processing solution pollet et al 130 investigated the recovery of silver from photographic processing using ultrasound assisted electroxidation and found that under 20 khz ultrasonic frequency silver recovery increased with an increase in ultrasonic intensity the effect of the location of the ultrasound generator and electrode was also studied a higher rate constant for the removal of silver was observed when the ultrasonic horn was kept parallel to the electrode as compared to an upright position with respect to the electrode they also employed a rotating cylinder as a working electrode and found that with an increase in the rotation speed of the cylinder silver recovery increased in another study pollet et al 131 worked on the oxidation of thiosulphate with stainless steel and platinum electrode they found that ultrasound has a good impact on the degradation of thiosulphate this is because the cavitation activity of microbubble increased mass transfer which reduced the diffusion layer thickness however thiosulphate degradation using sonication alone was found to be negligible shetakova et al 126 coupled higher frequency ultrasound with ti ta2o5 sno2 electrode prepared by thermal decomposition and drop casting technique for the degradation of formic acid they reported 97 removal of formic acid using ultrasonic frequency of 1176 khz and current of 20 ma under 120 min treatment time while sonication alone had no effect on degradation of fa as only 3 degradation after 2 h was reported fa degradation of 92 8 using electrolysis and 99 degradation using us ec degradation at the optimum condition of frequency 381 khz 20 ma and 0 02 w cm 3 ultrasonic power was reported reported results stated that lower frequency provided higher removal of fa as compared to a higher frequency sundarapandiyan et al 129 also investigated the decomposition of organic pollutants in saline wastewater using the us ec method and found that ultrasound alone was not sufficient in the degradation of the pollutant only 29 91 cod reduction and 69 35 total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn reduction was obtained while 69 23 cod reduction and 93 4 tkn reduction was reported using the electrolysis process a complete reduction of tkn was achieved using the us ec process this shows that ultrasound alone is unable to degrade the toxic pollutants 4 energy consumption estimation in us ec techniques us and ec technology were found to be relatively inefficient in terms of energy consumption for the degradation of the wastewater containing refractory organic pollutants therefore both the techniques are not economically attractive or feasible alone for scale up several authors estimated the energy consumption in ec and us ec and found that the us in combination with ec generally reduces the energy consumption per unit mass of pollutant mineralized by increasing the rate of reaction 74 76 92 93 120 126 129 typical studies of energy consumption of the us ec and us ec technique are shown in table 6 siddique et al 74 reported that the us ec techniques for decomposition and decolorization of rb 19 dye is more effective in terms of energy requirement it was found that us ec techniques reduce energy requirement to half as compared to the electrolysis and us techniques alone the effect of ultrasonic frequency 40 80 khz on energy consumption was also reported it was found that with an increase in the frequency from 40 to 80 khz energy consumption decreased from 1 14 to 0 75 kw h l 1 while decomposition of dye increased from 49 to 65 for us ec techniques further ec alone required energy consumption of 1 20 kw h l 1 for 39 decomposition of rb 19 dye during 120 min treatment time which is higher than the us ec technique somayajula et al 74 calculated the energy consumption for the degradation of reactive red 195 ec technique required 72 3 kw h kg of cod removed 1 for 58 3 cod removal while the us ec technique consumed 65 7 kw h kg of cod removed 1 with 63 74 cod removal which clearly shows that us ec technique reduces the energy consumption for the mineralization of the dye by accelerating the rate of reaction sundarapand et al 129 reported that the energy consumption in the us ec process is inversely proportional to the power of ultrasound the author reported that with an increase in the ultrasonic power from 0 to 100 w energy consumption reduced from 0 51 kw h kg of cod removal 1 to 0 27 kw h kg of cod removed 1 however the energy consumption became constant with further increase in ultrasonic power hence an optimum ultrasonic power can reduce the energy consumption of us ec techniques because at optimum power sufficient number of cavity formed by oo h radicals which react with the pollutant and mineralize it zhao et al 120 studied the mineralization of phenol and phthalic acid on the bdd electrode it was reported that ultrasound was found to reduce the energy required for the complete mineralization of the pollutants by 69 for phthalic acid and by 74 for phenol energy consumption during phthalic acid treatment by ec was 395 wh g of cod removed 1 while that for us ec it was 123 wh g of cod removed 1 similarly energy consumption for phenol mineralization by ec was 435 wh g cod removed 1 while for us ec it was reduced to 112 wh g cod removed 1 however few studies have reported that the application of ultrasound in combination with the ec technology increases the energy required for the degradation of the pollutants 68 116 shestakova et al 126 worked on the effect of current on energy consumption of the ec process and found that with an increase in the current from 10 to 30 ma energy consumption increased from 675 to 700 kw h m 3 for 90 degradation of the formic acid further the effect of ultrasonic frequency on energy consumption was also considered using the us ec process and it was found that at the highest frequency of 1176 khz energy consumption was 4346 kw h m 3 the application of ultrasound with ec techniques increased the energy requirement as well as mineralization degree 97 barros et al 68 reported that the application of ultrasound in combination with ec techniques increases the energy consumption at the highest current density of 50 ma cm 2 ec required 102 7 kw h kg 1 while us ec required 337 3 kw h kg 1 though the overall rate of oxidation increased with the application of ultrasound but energy consumption increased xia et al 116 reported the dual pulse ultrasound approached to minimize the energy consumption in the us ec technique it was found that ec us ec and dual pulse us ec technique consumed energy of 0 0812 kw h l 1 0 3039 kw h l 1 and 0 1413 kw h l 1 respectively for 63 77 and 80 removal of nitrobenzene in 30 min respectively hence energy used in the degradation of nitrobenzene using dual pulsed us ec techniques was only about 46 5 that of conventional us ec techniques this study shows that energy consumption in the us ec method can be significantly reduced by dual pulsed ultrasound over the conventional us ec techniques for the mineralization of the refractory organic wastewater higher energy consumption in us ec techniques and limited scale up potential hindered the development of us ec techniques for better understanding the energy consumption more aspects like the design of suitable ultrasound producers electrode material must be taken in to account at comparable conditions so that this technique can be developed 5 summary and future perspectives ec technologies in combination with ultrasound are found to be promising techniques for the enhancement in the degradation of the pops due to their environmental compatibility amenability of automation high energy efficiency versatility and safe operation under mild operation condition ultrasound increases the pollutant mass transport across the electrode surface and eliminates the electrode fouling by virtue of the physical and chemical effects of cavitation such as micro jet and shock waves us ec techniques in situ generate oxidizing agent without any chemical addition and eliminate any passivation layer from the electrode surface which also enhanced direct oxidation of the pollutants on the surface of the electrode the use of us ec techniques also reduces the energy required for the complete mineralization of the pollutants further degradation rate kinetics is also higher in the us ec system however the energy required for the complete removal of the organic pollutant is still a crucial issue in the scale up of the geometry of the reactor for the industrial application this can be addressed by using lower ultrasonic intensity equipment in the pulse mode more contact between pollutants and ros is the essential criterion ultrasound frequency is a vital parameter in assessing the synergism more scientific studies on ultrasonic frequency is required in order to optimize it the electrode material activity in the presence of ultrasound needs to be further evaluated so as to compete with more expensive metal oxides such as iro2 and ruo2 both theoretical and experimental studies are required for giving a guideline for selecting a proper set of electrodes further the conversion of electrical energy into cavitation energy is inefficient about 30 40 supplied electrical energy is actually transferred to producing the desired final effect this issue needs to be addressed and planned in order to overcome the energy barrier optimum design and shape of the reactor along with the position of electrode and ultrasound generator are the two essential aspects of the us ec reactor which needs to be carefully addressed so that the scale up of the reactor for the industrial application can be possible novel electrode materials such as ta and sn for organic compound degradation are the best alternative of expensive electrode of pt group metal such as ir and ru thus the operating cost of the process can be minimized by electrode surface modification using a suitable precursor that can also provide high over potential for oxygen formation pilot scale studies on the us ec reactor is not much reported yet the power density used in reported studies is high it is recommended to use a low power density of approximately 0 05 wm l 1 in order to make the process economically viable at industrial scale a vast majority of the research has been performed in a laboratory only with the traditional design of the us ec reactor in which electrode is dipped in the us bath or ultrasonic horn dipped in ec cell it is must require to develop a new geometry of the us ec reactor by incorporating the above issues so that these techniques can be implemented in industries for the wastewater treatment overall contribution from the field of electrochemistry sonochemistry physics and chemical engineering can provide valuable input for the true optimization of us ec reactor geometries it should also be noted that this technology is in the developing phase once it will developed the cost of the treatment would decrease declaration of competing interest the authors

13885,advanced oxidation processes have gained attention recently due to their effectiveness in mineralizing toxic recalcitrant pollutants in this paper studies on combined sonolysis and electroxidation techniques have been reviewed for the degradation of the persistent organic pollutants and real industrial wastewater the effects of various parameters such as ultrasonic power current density initial ph and electrolyte concentration have been elucidated critical analysis of the studies 1996 2020 on the treatment of various synthetic and real wastewater using the sono electroxidation process has been considered ultrasound in combination with electrochemical technology is an attractive option for the treatment of industrial wastewater the application of ultrasound gives the synergistic effect by virtue of the physical and chemical effects of cavitation coupling these two techniques increases the mineralization degree by increasing the mass transport rate and the chemical reaction rate and reduce the electrode passivation and fouling problem woking with an optimized sonoelectrochemical reactor design with low power ultrasound with pulsed mode can remarkably decrease the energy cost and increase the economic viability of the treatment method challenges associated with the process are documented in this paper abbreviations aops advanced

1 introduction industrial wastewater pollution is a worldwide environmental issue because of the complex composition and other challenging characteristics of wastewater generated from various industries such as food cosmetics textile pharmaceutical pulp and paper industries 1 also industrial waste containing volatile organic compounds vocs pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps petroleum constituents and aromatics in wastewater such as 4 methyl benzylidene camphor 4 mbc octocrylene oc norfloxacin ciprofloxacin triclosan benzophenone 3 bp 3 uv filter galaxolide and tonalide polycyclic musk dankly ethers methyl t butyl ether mtbe are frequently released into the river ponds lakes and ultimately contaminating groundwater and creating a risk for the human health 2 as far as the occurrence of these pops in the wastewater is concerned it also comes from the municipal sewage treatment plants these micropollutants are mutagenic and hazardous and their derivatives are even more toxic than parent compounds therefore the removal of these persistent organic pollutants pops in wastewater has grown attention among the scientific community 3 various conventional physio chemical and biological treatment methods have been applied for the removal of pops however these methods have their own limitation in terms of secondary waste generation and poor degradation mineralization efficiency for the pollutant the problem of secondary solid waste can be solved by employing energy based techniques such as sonolysis us 4 electrochemical ec 5 6 and photocatalysis 7 which are called advanced oxidation processes aops 8 the most commonly used aops for the removal of pops in wastewater are fenton and fenton like 9 ec 10 photocatalyst 7 11 ultrasound based oxidation 12 ozonation 13 etc these all aops generate the different reactive oxygen species ros such as hydroxyl radicals oh singlet oxygen 1o2 triplet oxygen 3o2 etc 14 16 oxidation potential of these radicals such as standard redox potential of oh is e 2 8 v vs she towards the pollutant degradation is high 17 therefore these radicals can degrade most of the organic pollutants with the rate of the order of 106 109 l mol s 1 18 as an individual technique ultrasound takes a long time for the complete mineralization of the pollutant 19 and ec techniques suffered from the electrode passivation inactivation and polarization problem 20 22 recently sonoelectroxidation us ec an integrated technology of ultrasound and ec has gained attention as a new hybrid aop for the removal of recalcitrant organic pollutants a significant improvement in the oxidation efficiency of the pollutant have been reported using the us ec technique in the literature apart from pollutant oxidation the us prevents the deposition of the by product on the electrode surface increases the mass transfer rate and current efficiency and reduces the energy consumption for the complete mineralization of the pollutant 23 therefore the coupling of ultrasound with ec technology not only provides the enhanced efficiency for the pollutant degradation but also increases the life of the electrode and reduces the cost of the treatment over the past decades several studies have been devoted to the removal of pops using us ec techniques 1 8 23 27 these techniques reported that ultrasound induces the chemical biological and mechanical changes in the medium due to the physical and chemical effect of the cavitation 26 hence ultrasound could effectively make up the shortcoming of the ec techniques alone in this review paper progress in us ec technology for the degradation mineralization of the various organic waste in the last decade has been reviewed and various challenges are discussed in depth 2 sonoelectrolysis and its mechanism 2 1 mechanism of sonolysis sonolysis is an advanced oxidation process in which ultrasound waves are used for the degradation of the pollutants present in the wastewater ultrasound is nothing but a sound wave having a frequency higher than the human audible frequency of 16 khz 27 fig 1 shows us degradation mechanism of organic pollutants ultrasound mechanism for the degradation of pollutants based on acoustic cavitation which is a phenomenon of formation growth and transient collapse of microbubble in the liquid medium 28 when ultrasonic wave passes through the irradiating medium compression and expansion cycles of ultrasonic waves continuously exerted positive and negative pressure on the liquid 29 during the negative pressure microbubble expand and during positive pressure microbubble compress this expansion and compression cycle continues till negative pressure sufficiently is large enough to pull the liquid molecules from each other to the threshold limit hence cavities filled with gas and vapor get formed cavitation bubble gets formed and the bubble grows in size over a few cycle and finally explosive collapse occurs this transient collapse generates a temperature of 5000 k and pressure 1000 atm leading to the thermal dissociation of water molecules into oh and h radicals as shown in eq 1 5 30 32 sonolysis reaction occurs inside the cavitation bubble at the interface of the cavitation bubble as well as in bulk at the surface of the transient bubble the concentration of the oh radicals is comparatively high at the time of the collapse these radicals eject to the bulk medium where it reacts with the pollutant and decomposes it another mechanism of us oxidation is the pyrolysis of the organic pollutant which takes place under high temperature and pressure inside the cavitation microbubble hydrophobic types of the pollutants get inside the microbubble where oxidation of the pollutant takes place under higher temperatures 500 k and pressure 1000 atm 28 1 h2o ultrasound oh h 2 oh h h2o 3 h o2 ho2 4 oh oh h2o2 5 2 ho2 h2o2 o2 6 o2 2 o 2 1 1 limitations of us alone few studies have been reported which show the degradation of organic pollutants using the us alone 33 38 however complete mineralization of pollutants such as phenol and its derivative ppcps products and nitrogenous compounds nitrobenzene aniline and pyridine is not well reported using the us alone 8 us alone is not an efficient process for the degradation of all types of recalcitrant pollutants because oh radicals generated from the collapse of microbubble gets recombined at the gas liquid interface before being ejected into the bulk solution therefore oxidation of the pollutants will not take place in the bulk medium by oh radicals nature of the pollutant hydrophobic or hydrophilic and its degradation mechanism inside cavitation bubble gas liquid interface and bulk medium is important for the complete mineralization of the pollutants using the us alone 29 further hydrophilic pollutants do not get inside the cavitation bubble due to which direct pyrolysis of the pollutants does not occur inside the cavitation bubble therefore complete degradation of the pollutant will not occur using the us alone further energy consumption limitation at the higher frequency ultrasonic horn and higher ultrasonic power restrict the application of ultrasound in the low frequency range 20 100 khz and low ultrasonic power range 40 120 w due to which wide application of us alone on variety of pollutants is not feasible 2 2 synergistic mechanism of us ec techniques ec process individually also suffers from the limitation of the mass transport passivation of the electrode which decreases the efficiency of the electrode therefore coupling ultrasound with electrochemical technology can be a viable option to overcome the weakness of the us and ec alone 39 fig 2 shows the sono electroxidation degradation mechanism of refractory organic pollutants ultrasound in combination with the ec provides the synergistic effect via physical and chemical effects of ultrasound irradiation of the electrochemical cell using ultrasound produces physical effects such as microjet shock wave turbulence and acoustic streaming of ultrasound provide in situ cleaning of electrodes increase the rate of chemical reaction increase the mass transfer of the pollutants across the electrodes and reduce the diffusion layer thickness to several micrometers simultaneous effect of all these significantly increase the mineralization degree reduce the passivation and increases the life of the electrode further chemical effects of ultrasound increase the rate of formation of reactive hydroxyl radicals oh which react with the pollutant either in bulk medium or at the gas liquid interface 40 therefore a positive synergistic effect always exists when ultrasound is used in combination with electrolysis further due to the physical effect some part of the ultrasound energy gets absorbed by the liquid medium this results in the mechanical momentum of the liquid acoustic streaming due to which faradaic current and mass transfer of electroactive compound increases 39 the transient cavitation results in uneven and violent motion of the solution due to the mutual interaction of collapsing and oscillating bubbles the ultrasound increases the mass transport of the reactant to the electrode surface enhances the efficiency of the electrochemical cell and keeps the electrode clean and activated 39 ultrasonic frequency and anode material play an important role in the synergism of the process it was reported by compton et al 41 that higher ultrasonic frequency favor the chemical effect of the ultrasound i e higher rate of formation of the oh radicals while low frequency supports the mechanical effects such as the generation of a shock wave which results in an enhancement in the mass transfer and in situ activate the electrode 42 this effect results in an enhancement in electrolysis current due to which yield of electrolysis changes i e more than one reaction pathway with different rates 2 2 1 sono electrocoagulation electrocoagulation ecg is a versatile technique for the treatment of a variety of wastewaters such as oil tanning 43 car washing 44 gray 45 olive oil mill 46 pulp and paper mill 47 distillery 48 49 terephthalic acid 50 dairy 51 and dye 52 55 however electrode passivation which increases the resistance and reduces the releases of the coagulation material has been reported to be the main electrode problem during the treatment electrode passivation increases the cell voltage and decreases the current efficiency due to which the cost of treatment increases many investigators have coupled the ultrasonic process with ecg to prevent passivation 44 45 56 57 li et al 57 reported the beneficial effects of the us in combination with the ecg technique us significantly improved the phosphorus removal efficiency 99 6 from synthetic wastewater as compared to 81 3 using ecg only the synergistic effect of the us in combination with the ecg was attributed to i the mechanical effect of the us which destructs the dense layer of byproduct deposition on the electrode surface and ii enhanced hydroxide formation with increased adsorption of pollutants vianney et al 54 studied the degradation of azo dyes methyl red and congo red from aqueous solutions using us ecg process us alone gave 9 55 decolorization ecg gave 40 75 and us ecg gave 100 decolorization of congo red dye in 20 min the higher performance of us ecg was attributed to the increased production of the oh radicals by the us process which attack the nn bond of azo dye in another study raschitor et al 55 reported 92 rhodamine 6 g removal efficiency with us ecg as compared to 60 efficiency in the ecg process in 5 h treatment time turbidity removal of the wastewater also found to increase with the coupling of the us with the ecg process he et al 56 reported that the us ecg increases the removal efficiency of rb19 by 7 over the conventional electro coagulation process the author also reported that during the ecg process electrode impedance increased while it decreased during the us ecg this indicated that the passive film gets removed from the sacrificial electrode using the us due to which sacrificial electrode can generate more coagulant metal besides the us also decreased the size of the metal hydroxide which adsorb more pollutants in wastewater dizge et al 48 worked on brewery wastewater treatment using us ecg which enhanced the cod removal to 60 5 as compared to 46 5 using ecg alone at the optimum condition of 100 a m 2 ph 7 and reaction time of 60 min us enhanced radicals generation rate therefore higher reaction rate and pollution removal efficiency was obtained further us also affects the particle size formation of refractory compounds and organic material structure some studies report negative impacts of us in combination with ecg as well lakshmi and sivashanmugam 43 reported the treatment of oil tanning effluent by us assisted ecg technique using aluminum al and iron fe sacrificial electrodes in this study the us showed an adverse effect on the mineralization efficiency cod removal of 90 was obtained using ecg which decreased to 86 using us ecg however sludge generation increased from 0 49 kg m 3 using ecg to 0 9 kg m 3 using us ecg us didn t allow the formation of flocs and only anodic dissolution and mixing was occurring which decreased the cod removal efficiency the increase in sludge generation was attributed to the fact that the us reduced the diffusion layer thickness at the electrode surface and increased the current efficiency thus increasing the formation of metal ions thereby enhancing metal hydroxide generation in another reported study the us couldn t significantly influence the cod removal efficiency for the treatment of greywater 45 3 sonoelectroxidation of organic pollutant a number of researchers have worked on the degradation of the pollutants using the us ec process 1 8 23 26 58 59 this section presents the work done on the degradation of dyes pharmaceutical compounds aromatics and phthalates employing the us ec method a conventional us ec reactor which described the simultaneous removal of pollutant is shown in fig 3 3 1 dyes textile industries are considered as the primary source of the dye wastewater producing units that pollute the natural streams 60 dyes are difficult to remove by conventional physicochemical methods 61 therefore as an alternative aops such as photocatalytic degradation 62 ozonation 63 and ec 5 are found to be prominent techniques that can successfully mineralize the dyes containing industrial effluents percentage degradation of the dyes through the us ec and us ec process reported in different studies are depicted in fig 4 it was found that the us alone is not accomplished enough for the removal of these dye the ec process has shown some restrictions on the scale up of the process due to the limitation of the mass transfer electrode fouling and passivation problem 64 66 therefore the coupling of ultrasound with ec oxidation can be a viable technique which provides a synergistic effect se on degradation efficiency many studies reported almost 90 removal of dyes using the us ec oxidation process 8 42 67 68 table 1 presents a comparative assessment of studies on the degradation of dyes using the us ec process 69 81 some recently published literature for mineralization of dyes using the us ec process is discussed herein lorimer et al 81 showed degradation of the sandolan yellow dyes through ultrasonic assisted electroxidation with platinum and carbon electrode ultrasound when operated alone at two different frequencies of 20 khz and 40 khz did not decolorize the acidic sandolan yellow dyes moreover the dye also resisted 0 5 mol dm 3 of h2o2 decolorization of sandolan yellow was obtained using the addition of a sodium hypochlorite solution the rate of decolorization was much quicker by electrolysis alone using a platinum electrode as compared to the carbon electrode the effect of different types of electrode ti cu al ni graphite and stainless steel on the degradation of cyanide ions was studied by iordache et al 80 highest electroxidation efficiency 22 was obtained using the graphite electrode and lowest 10 with the ti electrode us ec efficiency was the highest 60 with aluminum electrode while the lowest using graphite fig 5 aluminum was found most efficient electrode with sonoelectro chlorination with 78 efficiency and graphite was found to be the least efficient electrode the efficiency of the electrodes was in the order graphite ti inox ni cu al for the sono electroxidation of cyanide ions in another study by chua et al 79 the mineralization of cyan ink effluent was carried out using two step treatment step one used combined oxidation of the ultrasound assisted ec process and step second used chemical oxidation process which involved feso4 and h2o2 the us alone provided no significant reduction in response to cod copper content and color removal after 3 h treatment time us in combination with the fenton process provide 45 cod removal that was more than fenton s process alone in the two step treatment of cyan ink effluent a 65 reduction of copper content 20 cod reduction with 98 reduction in sludge generation was reported in 3 h treatment time fenton s process alone produced 6 7 g cod 1 sludge due to the less amount of feso4 requirement at the second stage and highly acidic conditions of the treated effluent lead to higher solubility of the product for iron sludge treated effluent by the two stage process also met the copper discharge limit with less disposal cost of sludge which is an advantage over fenton s process rivera et al 78 removed acid black 24 ab 24 lg b mo and trupocor red tr dyes using the us ec technique with a graphite electrode the application of the ultrasound for degassing and activation of electrode surface in combination with the ec techniques increased the decolorization and cod removal of the various dyes degradation of ab 24 was higher 50 18 using the us ec process as compared to the ec treatment alone 20 76 cod removal was 19 05 and 14 28 using us ec and ec techniques lg b degradation was also observed in the continuous mode of the us ec technique and found that lg b decolorization was 95 at the optimum condition of 0 0025 mol l 1 of na2so4 with total reflux of 4 5 ml min 1 after 2 h treatment which was almost four times than ec treatment the difference in the removal percentage of these dyes was due to the types of chromophore present in dye structure mono azo lg b can be easily breakable than di azo ab 24 on the other hand ai et al 77 investigated the decolorization of rhodamine b rhb azo dye using the us ec process the decolorization of rhb using the us alone is not possible however 24 5 of decolorization was obtained using electrolysis alone and 91 4 degradation was reported using the sono electroxidation process reported results clearly showed the se of the combined process since the lower frequency of ultrasound were used in the study therefore oh radicals produced were less and only chemical effect of ultrasound is not enough for the synergetic degradation roll of physical effect was also important which improved the decolorization rate by an increase in the activity at the surface of electrode cleaning and peeling and increased the reaction rate of mass transfer siddique et al 76 investigated the decolorization of rb 19 using the pbo2 electrode for the us ec process his research group found that the us ec process is an effective technique in terms of energy consumption and decomposition of rb 19 about 90 decolorization with 56 toc removal was reported at the optimum condition of ph 8 80 khz ultrasonic frequency 120 min treatment time and 50 mg l 1 dye concentration 81 toc removal was observed with hydrolyzed dye reported results confirmed the synergism in the combined strategies of the us ec process wu et al 75 did studies on operation parameters current density ph initial dye concentration and electrolyte concentration for decolorization of ci reactive black 8 cirb 8 by ti ruo2 iro2 anodic oxidation with and without ultrasound with ultrasound alone negligible color removal was obtained later siddique et al 76 also reported only 13 degradation of rb 19 dyes using the us alone wu et al 75 found cod removal of 32 4 and cirb 8 removal efficiency of 62 9 at optimum condition of 31 7 ma cm 2 current density for initial dye concentration of 100 mg l 1 5 4 ph 90 min treatment time ultrasonic power of 100 w l 1 and 0 1 mol l 1 electrolyte concentration enhancement factor ratio of the rate constant of the us ec process to ec process using the us ec process was greater than one which shows that ultrasound irradiation enhanced the decolorization with ec oxidation process observed enhancement was due to the increase in turbulence and mass transfer of the pollutants 82 somayajula et al 74 worked on the decolorization of reactive red 195 rr 195 by the us ec method with the mmo mesh type electrode about 91 decolorization was found with the ec process and 99 decolorization was reported with the us ec process after 120 min treatment time lounis et al 70 reported only 3 decolorization of og using ultrasound alone while 90 removal after 30 min with ec treatment somayajula et al 74 reported cod removal of 23 using us ec and 14 using ec alone the effect of electrolytes concentration on decolorization was also investigated nacl and kcl provided 99 decolorization of rr 195 in 120 min as compared to 52 and 39 decolorization with na2so4 and na2co3 respectively the increase in treatment efficiency with the use of electrolytes was the production of hypochlorite ions by nacl and kcl wu et al 75 also reported that the presence of a high concentration of na2so4 in solution results in the scavenging of o h radicals by the sulfate ions yang et al 73 assessed the effect of the nano coating electrode on the degradation efficiency of methylene blue mb using the us ec process at the optimum condition 45 khz frequency 50 w power and 600 ma current toc removal efficiency was 92 with a nano coated electrode while under the same operating condition 70 toc removal was obtained using a conventional electrode shestakova et al 67 for the first time analyzed the modified electrode for the degradation of the mb dyes his research group assessed the sono electrocatalytic removal of the mb dye using the ti ta2o5 sno2 electrode prepared using the drop casting technique about 100 removal of mb was reported at the optimum frequency of 850 khz after 45 min treatment while the us alone took 90 min and electrolysis alone took 180 min for complete removal of mb dye cod removal was 78 9 40 4 and 85 4 using electrolysis us and us ec process respectively the energy consumption of the process was found to be 141 26 kw h m 3 for 0 025 mm mb dye these published studies were in agreement with the study reported by barros et al 68 they found almost 90 95 color removal of amaranth dyes using bdd anode after 90 min us ec treatment while only 8 amaranth dyes removal was seen using the us alone the performance of the us ec process at lower current density 10 25 ma cm 2 was found to be more effective therefore energy requirement of the process at lower current density was also found to be less 20 kw h kg 1 dye removed compared to the reported by shestakova et al 67 which is about 141 26 kw h m 3 on the other hand steter et al 72 reported 100 decolorization of amaranth dyes using the bdd electrode at lower current densities of 35 ma cm 2 energy consumption was found to be 5 3 kw h m 3 using a us ec reactor the toc removal was 92 1 using ec and 95 1 for the us ec process at the optimal current density of 35 ma cm 2 steter et al 72 found that at low current densities 10 25 ma cm 2 the apparent rate constant was higher for us ec techniques 10 1 min 1 as compared to ec alone 10 3 min 1 with an increase in the current density from 10 to 50 ma cm 2 current efficiency decreased from 55 to 20 the positive synergetic effect was found at lower current densities as compared to a higher current density due to saturation of the solution by oxygen and proxy radicals which increased the formation of oxidizing species like h2o2 and oxygen lounis et al 70 investigated the effect of operating parameters such as ultrasonic power current density for degradation of og dyes using the us ec reactor platinum anode and carbon felt cathode was used as an electrode it was found that with an increase in the ultrasonic power from 4 to 15 w removal efficiency increased to 100 at 15 w within 8 min however a further increase in power showed no significant effect on the mineralization of og dye ai et al 77 also assessed the ultrasonic power effect on rhodamine b rhb decolorization it was found that with an increase in ultrasonic power from 100 to 400 w decolorization of rhb increased while further increase in power up to 800 w decreased the decolorization this may be due to the delay in the growth of the cavitation bubble and long collapse duration leading to scavenging and recombination of o h radicals ultimately decreasing the degradation at the higher ultrasonic power lounis et al 70 reported that with an increase in the ph value from 3 to 6 og decolorization decreased due to the reduction in the oxidation potential of hydroxyl radical at ph 3 usec degradation was higher than at ph 2 due to the scavenging of o oh radicals by hydrogen ion at lower ph lounis et al 70 also studied the effect of pollutant concentration on the performance of us ec reactor they found that og percentage removal decreases from 92 to 87 with an increase in the concentration of the dye 0 6 mm to 0 8 mm wu et al 75 reported that with an increase in the concentration of dyes from 50 to 200 mg l 1 the rate constant value decreased from 0 0098 min 1 to 0 0081 min 1 for electroxidation process while values decreased from 0 0113 min 1 to 0 0101 min 1 for us ec process these results were found opposite to that reported by ai et al 77 during the study of the degradation of rhb dyes they reported that by changing the initial concentration of rhb dye from 10 to 50 mg l 1 the efficiency of removal of rhb was not affected barros et al 68 reported pseudo first order kinetic constant value of 4 6 10 2 min 1 for us ec treatment and 3 5 10 2 min 1 for electroxidation treatment mineralization efficiency was 95 for the us ec process and 80 for the ec process ultrasound enhanced the mineralization of the pollutant while the us alone was not able to mineralize the pollutant as toc removal of 19 only was observed ai et al 77 also reported that the us alone is not enough to degrade the textile dyes such as rhb lounis et al 70 show that with increases in current 30 to 100 ma og removal percentage increases results obtained were in agreement with the study of yang et al 73 they reported that with an increase in current 150 to 600 ma mineralization increases while further increases in the current slightly increase in toc reduction the possible reason is that the high applied current increases the rate of h2o2 generation which further decomposed to o h radicals through the cavitation phenomena similarly with increases in the concentration of fe ii ion 0 03 to 0 05 mm degradation rate was increased from 8 μm min 1 to 13 6 μm min 1 the increases in removal rate due to the increase in the production of o h radicals by electro fenton while it was also seen that further increases in the concentration of the fe ii ions from 0 05 mm to 0 5 mm og degradation decreases due to scavenging of o h radicals by fe ii giray et al 83 look ahead for degrading the real textile wastewater using the sonoelectrofenton process and reported 98 12 toc removal the effect of water matrices such as seawater pure water and mineral water was also reported by lounis et al 70 about 100 degradation was obtained after 8 min in seawater because of a high amount of nacl 35 g l 1 which lead to the production of hypochlorite ions while 94 was obtained in 20 min for mineral water with us ec treatment these results were in agreement with the studies of ai et al 77 they reported the effect of electrolyte concentration on decolorization of rhb they found that with 21 3 g l 1 na2so4 electrolyte concentration 100 decolorization was obtained in 12 min radi et al 71 studied the removal of cirb 49 with a carbon electrode 64 decolorization of cirb 49 at optimum ph 2 using sonochemical treatment while the us ec process enhanced the decolorization to 99 at ph 7 after 90 min of treatment the addition of 3 mol l 1 h2o2 slightly increased the decolorization while significantly increased the cod reduction from 76 2 in the absence of h2o2 to 87 8 they reported that because of the addition of h2o2 the rate of generation of oh radicals increased due to self decomposition under ultrasound irradiation and reduction of h2o2 in the conduction band produces additional oh a se in cod removal under ultrasonic irradiation at optimum condition was found which showed the hybridization of the us with electrolysis increased the mineralization of the pollutant radi et al 71 studied the degradation of cirb 49 dye using the us ec process results demonstrated that carbon working electrode and platinum electrode auxiliary electrode successfully decolorized 97 2 dyes and reduced 91 cod at the optimum condition of 8 3 ph 80 min treatment time and 10 mg l 1 initial dye concentration a synergism of 63 2 was reported in combined strategies of these two techniques this large positive se is due to the enhancement of the mass transfer and continuous activation of the electrode by ultrasound application 84 zhu et al 1 also studied the degradation of alizarin red s ars using us ec techniques it was investigated that at the optimum condition of 0 05 m na2so4 electrolyte concentration and ph 4 97 value 100 color removal and 86 07 cod removal was found lower temperature was favorable for the us ec techniques while higher temperatures above 45 c was favorable for ec with a higher rate of degradation 3 2 pharmaceuticals and personal care compounds pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps are the new class of emerging pollutants the presence of these types of contaminants in wastewater treatment plants groundwater seawater surface water soil and sludge has been reported 85 87 conventional methods have a limitation of sludge generation partial removal and high chemical requirements which increases the operating cost of the treatments therefore aops including us photolysis and electrolysis have been studied for remediation of ppcps such as ibp tcs and smx from the aqueous system percentage degradation of some pharmaceutical compound using these techniques are depicted in fig 6 some of the recent studies on ppcps pollutants using the us ec process are present in table 2 88 95 ren et al 95 reported the parametric study on triclosan tcs degradation using different combinations of electrode with higher frequency ultrasound 850 khz it was found that a diamond coated niobium electrode dcne was found best for the ec degradation of tcs which was 24 comparatively 9 with silicon carbide electrode sce and 6 using stainless steel electrode sse as shown in fig 7 about 35 se was observed with sse using the us ec system compared to 25 with sce and 8 with dcne the highest 82 tcs degradation was reported using sulfuric acid electrolyte and dcne electrode while 63 using sodium sulfate and 41 using sodium hydroxide effect of initial concentration of tcs on degradation efficiency was also seen and found that with an increase in the tcs concentration from 1 to 10 mg l 1 degradation efficiency decreased from 90 to 69 in 15 min treatment time energy efficiency increased and the highest energy efficiency observed was 1 312 mmol kw h 1 the effect of different electrolytes on the percentage degradation of tcs and phenol also reported by rean et al 95 it was found that naoh gave the highest percentage of degradation as compared to h2so4 and na2so4 electrolyte an overview of aops for the mineralization of tcs is shown in fig 8 almost all types of aops can successfully degrade the tcs from the wastewater tran et al 92 observed the degradation of carbamazepine cbz using ti pbo2 anode and ti cathode by the us ec method about 90 removal using the us ec process was reported at optimum condition of 180 min time 38 w ultrasonic power and 4 a current for 10 mg l 1 carbamazepine however this optimal condition was applied for the mineralization of the municipal wastewater effluent which contains 10 μg l 1 they found 93 removal of cbz 60 reduction of toc and a 93 reduction of cod finkbeiner et al 94 performed the mineralization of diclofenac dcf with the us ec process and found 90 degradation within 5 min the effect of various operating parameters such as applied voltage electrode gap immersion depth of electrode and ph was also studied dcf degradation decreased from 96 8 to 85 1 with an increase in the ph value from 4 4 to 9 9 they reported that this decrease in the degradation was due to the fact that at lower ph value diclofenac exists in nonpolar molecular form which is more hydrophobic and can easily be oxidized at the boundary layer of cavitation bubble compares to nonpolar form at higher ph value higher voltage lead to higher degradation of the dcf which is 93 at 7 2 v as compared to 54 at 2 8 v overview of different aops for diclofenac degradation is depicted in fig 9 it can be observed that almost all types of aops able to degraded the diclofenac from the wastewater without any generation of secondary waste it shows that aops can successfully applied for the mineralization of the pharmaceuticals pollutants thokchom et al 93 studied the ibp degradation kinetics with different electrolytes using a us assisted ec oxidation process it was found that the ultrasound as an individual treatment process was most effective using h2so4 rate constant 0 0326 min 1 as an electrolyte because of the non volatile property of ibp and hydrophobic nature in the case of h2so4 ec treatment was most effective with naoh rate constant 0 032 min 1 because of the hydrophilic form of the ibp at 10 75 ph similar results were reported by ciriaco et al 96 who used naoh for the mineralization of ibp with a modified electrode as depicted in fig 10 the combined us ec of ibp provided 89 32 degradation using naoh and 81 85 using h2so4 and 88 70 using deionized water tran et al 97 worked on titanium coated pbo2 electrode for the degradation of ibp using us ec process and reported 84 74 removal of ibp using us ec process with synergy degree of 5 26 which was lower than that reported by ren et al 84 while degrading phenol with us ec process 75 in which sse was used for 400 ml treatment volume they found a synergy degree of 60 using the us ec process this discrepancy in synergism was due to the difference in power imposed for the degradation of pollutants tran et al 97 imposed 244 w g 1 of ibu while ren et al 84 delivered 4521 wg 1 of phenol another reason is that the ibu structure is more complex than phenol for the oxidation therefore it was quite difficult to degrade ibu as compared to phenol tran et al 97 reported that ibp mineralization increased up to 84 2 with an increase in ultrasonic power from 5 to 40 w villaroel et al 98 reported that the degradation rate increased with increases in power for the degradation of acetaminophen in water madhavan et al 99 also assessed similar outcomes during the oxidation of dcf pollutants using the sonochemical process tran et al 97 reported 89 ibu removal and 84 toc removal with a current intensity of 10 a ciriaco et al 96 also reported 60 95 cod removal and 48 92 toc removal of ibu using electroxidation by ti pt pbo2 bdd anode electrode while da silva duarte et al 100 reported 95 rifampicin removal in 3 h using the bdd anode electrode yang et al 91 studied combined ultrasound ec degradation of actual pharmaceutical wastewater pww by nanocoated electrode ruo2 iro2 ti a significant improvement in the mineralization of the pollutant was reported using a nanocoated electrode the current density effect 2 8 ma cm 2 was found to be positive because of an increase in oh radical generation and diffusion with an increase in current density 94 cod removal of pww was reported using us ec treatment at optimum condition of current density 8 ma cm 2 ultrasonic power 100 w and 45 khz frequency however using the traditional electrode at the same operating condition only 70 cod removal was obtained the difference in cod removal between nanocoated electrode and conventional coated electrode a higher number of active sites are available in the nanocoated electrode as compared to the conventional coated electrode therefore ultrasound enhanced the mass transport inside the bulk and increased the generation of oh radicals from the surface of the nanocoated electrode due to the higher rate of oh radicals generation the rapid reaction of pollutants with oh radicals takes place ultimately higher mineralization takes place in the absence of ultrasound cod removal was 50 for both types of electrodes it was also observed that the presence of ultrasound enhanced the oxidation activity of chlorine tran et al 101 studied chlortetracycline degradation using ti pbo2 electrode 73 3 degradation was found at optimum condition of current 3 92 a ultrasonic power 20 w frequency 500 khz and 90 min treatment time at this optimum condition 61 4 mineralization toc removal was reported effectiveness of the us ec process was also evaluated by employing the real municipal wastewater and found that up to 98 oxidation of the chlortetracycline due to the presence of the chloride ion in the real wastewater both direct due to oh radicals and indirect hypochlorous acid formed by chloride oxidation anodic oxidation involved in the mineralization of the pollutants zaviska et al 102 also reported similar studies during the mineralization of real wastewater contaminated with bpa and 465 mg l 1 chloride ions they reported that within 30 min treatment time complete degradation of bpa took place in municipal wastewater while it took 100 min for the complete degradation of synthetic wastewater using na2so4 as an electrolyte huang et al 89 adopted a common platinum and graphite electrode for smx degradation using the us ec oxidation method the us alone showed a marginal degradation of smx while electrolysis gave 10 degradation and sonoelectrolysis provided 83 removal of smx the synergism of 14 7 at the optimum condition was reported direct anodic oxidation and oh radicals were both found to be responsible for this synergism tran et al 90 reported cbz degradation with titanium coated pbo2 ti pbo2 electrode and found 99 5 degradation at optimum condition using the us ec process 91 of cbz degradation was obtained using the ec process at the same condition in 30 days the synergy degree increased with an increase in the power of ultrasound the highest synergy degree of 33 5 was obtained at 40 w power dominguez et al 103 also assessed electroxidation mineralization of cbz using the ti bdd electrode ti bdd electrode caused complete degradation of cbz at the optimal condition the highest synergy degree of 25 36 and lowest synergy of 9 31 was reported by tran et al 90 at 1 a and 15 a respectively huang et al 89 also performed parametric studies for the degradation of smx his research found that smx degradation increased with an increase in applied current density up to 20 ma cm 2 above 20 ma cm 2 the rate of degradation slightly decreased this is because at higher current oxygen evolution takes place near the electrode which inhibits the direct oxidation of the pollutant effect of the addition of different electrolytes such as na2so4 nano3 and nacl fe2 and h2o2 on us ec and ec system was also observed nano3 gave the highest rate constant value with 83 removal while nacl gave the lowest value an additional effect of fe2 was also investigated and found that the us ec fe2 system was found to be the best among others employed for the mineralization of the smx tran et al 90 also examined the morphology of the electrode pre and post treatment using scanning electron microscopy eds analysis and eis measurement it was found that the surface of the electrode used in the us ec process does not contain any impurities while the surface of the electrode used in the electroxidation process contains impurities hence the promotional role of ultrasound in cleaning and peeling of the electrode was observed soltani et al 88 studied the degradation of ibuprofen using platinum and carbon black coated carbon cloth as a cathode with us ec techniques the us alone gave 13 8 degradation ec alone gave 58 degradation and us ec gave 84 2 degradation of the ibu indicate that the coupling of ultrasound using the us ec process enhanced the degradation of the ibu the effect of the presence of organic and inorganic compounds on the us ec reactor was also investigated it was found that methanol and ethanol both decreased the removal efficiency of ibp up to 47 2 and 71 7 respectively this is due to the scavenging of oh radicals by alcoholic compounds while the presence of inorganic such as carbonate and chloride increased the degradation efficiency of up to 95 3 and 88 4 respectively the presence of chloride ions generated the chlorine free radicals cl and increased the degradation rate of ibu 3 3 herbicide fungicides and insecticides few studies have been reported for the degradation of the herbicide fungicides and insecticides using the us ec process table 3 presents a comparative assessment of these studies for the degradation of herbicide and fungicide 104 110 3 3 1 herbicide bringas et al 107 worked on diuron herbicide mineralization using the bdd electrode by ultrasound assisted ec oxidation process 100 degradation of herbicide was obtained after 7 h dissolved organic carbon doc removal was 69 using ec and 91 using us ec after 8 h treatment a se of 43 at the optimum condition of 60 ma cm 2 20 khz ph 12 and 10 c was reported guo et al 111 reported a 10 degradation of 2 4 dinitrophenol using low frequency ultrasound in 4 h treatment abu hassan et al 112 reported 80 degradation and 20 25 mineralization of sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate souza et al 106 reported 100 degradation of 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 2 4 d herbicide using us ec process all studies show that the us ec process can mineralize herbicides kinetic study results revealed that high ph favors fast mineralization due to the accumulation of hypochlorite that acts as a redox agent canizares et al 113 observed similar results during the degradation of chlorophenols some cases of successful pesticide mineralization by means of us ec oxidation are also reported yasman et al 109 investigated the degradation of chloro organic compounds with the sonoelectrocatalytic process a common herbicide 2 4 d and 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dc phenol was selected as a model pollutant the application of pd and pd fe powder in the sonoelectrocatalytic process allowed the complete removal of the complex chlororganic compounds about 65 degradation of 2 4 d in 30 sec and complete conversion was obtained in 10 min using the pd electrode yasman et al 110 evaluated the performance of the us ec fenton process for the decomposition of 2 4 d and 2 4 dc phenol and found that the efficiency of sono electro fenton process for the mineralization of the pollutant is much higher than the other process 50 removal of 2 4 d solution in 60 seconds while complete degradation was obtained in 600 sec esclapez et al 108 investigated the improved ec route of tcaa a pesticide degradation using ultrasound a continuous flow us ec device on the pilot scale was used for the degradation of an organic compound high conversion 95 with high current efficiency 10 selectivity of 0 92 and degradation efficiency of 26 was reported they also found that the tcaa degradation got enhanced using high frequency ultrasound by means of dissociative adsorption incineration that occurred on both the electrodes 3 3 2 fungicides and insecticides steter et al 105 observed the degradation of thiram fungicide using the bdd electrode by the us ec method operating parameter effects on degradation kinetics were evaluated with an increase in current density from 10 to 50 ma cm 2 current efficiency decreased from 25 88 to 11 27 whereas energy consumption increased from 27 70 to 55 27 kw h m 3 ren et al 104 reported the degradation of chlorpyrifos insecticides using the us ec technique by sse 50 98 removal using the us 72 8 removal using the ec system and 93 3 removal using the us ec process was reported a synergism of 37 using the combined system was reported sodium sulfate was selected as an electrolyte so that the ph of the solution is not affected by the addition of the electrolyte 3 4 aromatic compounds aromatic compounds are persistent organic pollutants in the environment these compounds accumulate in high concentrations near the oil distillation plants 114 the decomposition of these organic complexes from the wastewater is still a changing task for the researcher the degradation of the various aromatic pollutants using us ec and us ec are shown in fig 11 table 4 presents a comparative assessment of studies on aromatics compound degradation using the us ec process 115 121 trabelsi et al 26 reported the degradation of phenol using the us ec process and found only 3 phenol degradation using the us alone while 75 degradation was obtained after 10 min using the us ec process with 20 khz ultrasound frequency at the optimum conditions 95 degradation was obtained with the same treatment time using a 540 khz ultrasound frequency with no toxic product lima leite et al 121 investigated the degradation of 2 4 dihydroxybenzoic acid 2 4 dhba under two ultrasonic frequencies 20 khz and 500 khz under the optimum condition 47 toc degradation was reported using the us ec technique de lima leite et al 122 reported that the electrolysis is able to degrade the pollutant but under low concentration and this technique is not efficient lima leite et al 121 investigated the combination of ultrasound and electro oxidation and found that under the combined technique pollutants can be effectively removed in low concentration at low ultrasound frequency the mass transfer rate and adsorption and desorption mechanisms got accelerated under ultrasound irradiation zhao et al 120 studied the decomposition of the phenol and phthalic acid pa in the presence of ultrasound using the bdd electrode anode and titanium foil cathode only 1 5 cod removal of phenol and 1 3 cod removal of phthalic acid was reported after 3 h using the us alone zhao et al 120 combined ultrasound and ec oxidation processes for the degradation of phenol and pa and reported 100 cod removal the promotional role of the ultrasound by virtue of chemical and physical effect of ultrasound was clearly observed another interesting result was found that the variation in energy consumption was lower in the case of the us ec process as compared to ec alone for both the pollutants this reflects that the us can reduce the ec energy requirement for the complete mineralization of the pollutants mass transport coefficient kd increased with the application of ultrasound and it was found to be 2 0 10 5 m s 1 in case of the us ec process for both the pollutant as compared to 6 7 10 6 m s 1 for pa and 5 4 10 6 m s 1 for phenol with ec alone this clearly shows that the kd value of the us ec system is higher than the ec system alone this is because the application of ultrasound in combination with ec increased the adsorption desorption process on the electrode surface ec alone gets difficult to desorb intermediates from the electrode surface while in the us ec process desorption of intermediates was easy zhao et al 24 assessed the effect of the bdd electrode and pt electrode for phenol degradation only 1 5 degradation of phenol using ultrasound was found in 3 h they investigated that the oxidation efficiency of phenol on the bdd electrode was faster than the pt electrode 39 cod removal was investigated using a pt electrode while 69 cod removal was reported using a bdd electrode garbellinil et al 123 also investigated the valuable effect of ultrasound for the degradation of pentachlorophenol using the bdd electrode they reported 19 8 degradation using us 70 8 degradation using electrolysis and 82 6 degradation using the us ec process zhao et al 24 reported that the bdd shows higher oep as compared to the pt electrode therefore higher degradation was obtained using the bdd electrode than the pt electrode average current efficiency was also investigated and found that in the ec process it was 6 5 using a pt electrode while it was 12 3 using the bdd electrode the average current efficiency increased to 9 7 in the us ec process using a pt electrode and increased to 24 6 using the bdd electrode about 100 us ec degradation of phenol was obtained in 3 h using the bdd electrode while it took 4 h using the pt electrode ren et al 84 published a study on phenol degradation by low cost sse using higher frequency 850 khz ultrasound for the economic performance and found 16 32 and 99 removal of phenol using us ec and us ec process they reported that with an increase in electrolyte concentration from 0 39 to 4 26 g l 1 percentage degradation increased from 24 to 67 energy consumption increased from 0 180 kw h to 0 198 kw h and energy efficiency increased from 0 520 to 1 354 mmol kwh 1 an increase in the percentage removal with an increase in the electrolyte concentration was due to an increase in the conductivity of the solution souza et al 118 also assessed the complete mineralization of dimethyl phthalate dmp using the us ec process by employing a conductive diamond electrode chen et al 117 reported that the enhancement in toc removal by combined strategies by virtue of ultrasound which increases the mass transfer rate across the electrode the influence of operational parameters on toc removal efficiency was also investigated and found that with an increase in temperature toc removal decreases 94 toc removal was obtained at the lowest temperature of 30 c this was due to a higher yield of h2o2 results in a higher rate of generation of o oh radicals at a lower temperature a stronger acidic medium was favorable for a higher toc removal rate effect of oxygen dosage and ferrous ion concentration was also investigated and found that with increases in oxygen dosage toc removal increases while at 150 mg l 1 ferrous ions concentration 99 toc removal reported xia et al 116 studied a dual pulse ultrasonic enhanced ec process for the degradation of nitrobenzene and found that dual pulse us ec process has a better efficiency in terms of degradation and energy consumption 63 degradation of nitrobenzene using the ec process and 78 degradation using the us ec process was reported 80 nitrobenzene degradation was obtained using a dual pulse us ec coupling process observed results are due to pulse mode diminished interference of ultrasound on ec degradation energy used by the dual pulse us ec method was only 46 5 of the conventional us ec method they also reported that the acidic condition was more favorable for the dual pulse us ec process than alkaline conditions aquinoneto et al 124 also reported the similar results that organic compound oxidation is more favorable in acidic medium this is because lower value of ph diminishes the oxygen evolution reaction further electrolyte concentration increased the removal efficiency due to an increase in the conductivity of the solution ultrasonic power has a positive effect on the pulsed process with increased ultrasonic power nitrobenzene degradation increased due to the enhancement in the cavitation activity of the bubble chen et al 117 considered the degradation of nitrotoluenes using a commonly used platinum electrode by the us ec process synergism was reported using toc removal efficiency 15 69 and almost complete mineralization 94 toc removal were reported using us electrolysis and sonoelectrolysis process dietrich et al 123 worked on the mineralization of bpa by combing the bdd electrode with a lower frequency 20 khz ultrasound 38 bpa degradation at 25 μm ultrasonic amplitude and 61 bpa degradation at 125 μm ultrasonic amplitude was reported increases in the amplitude increases the percentage removal this may be because of increasing hydroxyl radicals by higher amplitude ultrasound dietrich et al 115 also studied the effect of sonotrode immersion depth and found that with decreased immersion depth of sonotrode from 8 1 cm to 3 1 cm the bpa degradation decreases from 61 to 29 93 degradation of bp a was reported at the optimum condition of 2 cm electrode gap 24 khz frequency and 5 v power a synergistic index of 2 26 was investigated using 125 μm amplitude the percentage degradation of bpa using different methods is depicted in fig 12 dietrich et al 115 evaluated 0 024 0 016 and 0 090 min 1 rate constant value for the us ec and us ec process respectively some researchers also employed different types of electrode for degradation of persistent pollutants such as zhu et al 119 reported the removal of p substituted phenol using bdd and pbo2 electrode the study showed that ultrasonic irradiation increases the cod removal efficiency by virtue of mass transfer enhancement trabelsi et al 26 and lima leite et al 121 also reported the enhancement in ec oxidation of phenol at pt and bdd electrode due to improved mass transfer rate by ultrasound bdd electrode showed higher rate of removal of p substituted phenol 73 83 removal and 60 70 cod removal compare to the pbo2 electrode 50 70 5 25 cod removal 3 5 chlorinated compounds chlorinated compounds have been reported as a strong recalcitrant class of pollutants among others found in the aqueous life 125 due to the poor performance of the biological methods toward the degradation of the chlorinated compounds the researchers have studied alternative techniques such as catalytic hydrogenation photolysis and the us table 5 presents a comparative assessment of these studies for the degradation of chlorinated and other miscellaneous compounds 126 130 saez et al 127 studied the degradation of perchloroethylene which is used as a chlorinated solvent in many industries 55 degradation efficiency and 100 fractional conversion of perchloroethylene were reported using pb and pbo2 electrodes under low ultrasonic intensity energy consumption with the us ec process is less as compared to the sonochemical treatment because of the significant reduction in the time using a pulsed mode flow reactor in another study by saez et al 128 decomposition of perchloroethylene were carried out without electrolyte they reported that low conductivity wastewater could be successfully mineralized using an ultrasound assisted ec process ultrasound cavitation increases the mass transfer of ion across the electrodes which avoids the use of extra chemicals about 100 dechlorination was obtained at high ultrasonic power 3 6 other recovery of silver from the photographic effluents is a major problem industrially various techniques have been employed such as ion exchange electrolysis bacterial digestion to recover silver from photographic processing solution pollet et al 130 investigated the recovery of silver from photographic processing using ultrasound assisted electroxidation and found that under 20 khz ultrasonic frequency silver recovery increased with an increase in ultrasonic intensity the effect of the location of the ultrasound generator and electrode was also studied a higher rate constant for the removal of silver was observed when the ultrasonic horn was kept parallel to the electrode as compared to an upright position with respect to the electrode they also employed a rotating cylinder as a working electrode and found that with an increase in the rotation speed of the cylinder silver recovery increased in another study pollet et al 131 worked on the oxidation of thiosulphate with stainless steel and platinum electrode they found that ultrasound has a good impact on the degradation of thiosulphate this is because the cavitation activity of microbubble increased mass transfer which reduced the diffusion layer thickness however thiosulphate degradation using sonication alone was found to be negligible shetakova et al 126 coupled higher frequency ultrasound with ti ta2o5 sno2 electrode prepared by thermal decomposition and drop casting technique for the degradation of formic acid they reported 97 removal of formic acid using ultrasonic frequency of 1176 khz and current of 20 ma under 120 min treatment time while sonication alone had no effect on degradation of fa as only 3 degradation after 2 h was reported fa degradation of 92 8 using electrolysis and 99 degradation using us ec degradation at the optimum condition of frequency 381 khz 20 ma and 0 02 w cm 3 ultrasonic power was reported reported results stated that lower frequency provided higher removal of fa as compared to a higher frequency sundarapandiyan et al 129 also investigated the decomposition of organic pollutants in saline wastewater using the us ec method and found that ultrasound alone was not sufficient in the degradation of the pollutant only 29 91 cod reduction and 69 35 total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn reduction was obtained while 69 23 cod reduction and 93 4 tkn reduction was reported using the electrolysis process a complete reduction of tkn was achieved using the us ec process this shows that ultrasound alone is unable to degrade the toxic pollutants 4 energy consumption estimation in us ec techniques us and ec technology were found to be relatively inefficient in terms of energy consumption for the degradation of the wastewater containing refractory organic pollutants therefore both the techniques are not economically attractive or feasible alone for scale up several authors estimated the energy consumption in ec and us ec and found that the us in combination with ec generally reduces the energy consumption per unit mass of pollutant mineralized by increasing the rate of reaction 74 76 92 93 120 126 129 typical studies of energy consumption of the us ec and us ec technique are shown in table 6 siddique et al 74 reported that the us ec techniques for decomposition and decolorization of rb 19 dye is more effective in terms of energy requirement it was found that us ec techniques reduce energy requirement to half as compared to the electrolysis and us techniques alone the effect of ultrasonic frequency 40 80 khz on energy consumption was also reported it was found that with an increase in the frequency from 40 to 80 khz energy consumption decreased from 1 14 to 0 75 kw h l 1 while decomposition of dye increased from 49 to 65 for us ec techniques further ec alone required energy consumption of 1 20 kw h l 1 for 39 decomposition of rb 19 dye during 120 min treatment time which is higher than the us ec technique somayajula et al 74 calculated the energy consumption for the degradation of reactive red 195 ec technique required 72 3 kw h kg of cod removed 1 for 58 3 cod removal while the us ec technique consumed 65 7 kw h kg of cod removed 1 with 63 74 cod removal which clearly shows that us ec technique reduces the energy consumption for the mineralization of the dye by accelerating the rate of reaction sundarapand et al 129 reported that the energy consumption in the us ec process is inversely proportional to the power of ultrasound the author reported that with an increase in the ultrasonic power from 0 to 100 w energy consumption reduced from 0 51 kw h kg of cod removal 1 to 0 27 kw h kg of cod removed 1 however the energy consumption became constant with further increase in ultrasonic power hence an optimum ultrasonic power can reduce the energy consumption of us ec techniques because at optimum power sufficient number of cavity formed by oo h radicals which react with the pollutant and mineralize it zhao et al 120 studied the mineralization of phenol and phthalic acid on the bdd electrode it was reported that ultrasound was found to reduce the energy required for the complete mineralization of the pollutants by 69 for phthalic acid and by 74 for phenol energy consumption during phthalic acid treatment by ec was 395 wh g of cod removed 1 while that for us ec it was 123 wh g of cod removed 1 similarly energy consumption for phenol mineralization by ec was 435 wh g cod removed 1 while for us ec it was reduced to 112 wh g cod removed 1 however few studies have reported that the application of ultrasound in combination with the ec technology increases the energy required for the degradation of the pollutants 68 116 shestakova et al 126 worked on the effect of current on energy consumption of the ec process and found that with an increase in the current from 10 to 30 ma energy consumption increased from 675 to 700 kw h m 3 for 90 degradation of the formic acid further the effect of ultrasonic frequency on energy consumption was also considered using the us ec process and it was found that at the highest frequency of 1176 khz energy consumption was 4346 kw h m 3 the application of ultrasound with ec techniques increased the energy requirement as well as mineralization degree 97 barros et al 68 reported that the application of ultrasound in combination with ec techniques increases the energy consumption at the highest current density of 50 ma cm 2 ec required 102 7 kw h kg 1 while us ec required 337 3 kw h kg 1 though the overall rate of oxidation increased with the application of ultrasound but energy consumption increased xia et al 116 reported the dual pulse ultrasound approached to minimize the energy consumption in the us ec technique it was found that ec us ec and dual pulse us ec technique consumed energy of 0 0812 kw h l 1 0 3039 kw h l 1 and 0 1413 kw h l 1 respectively for 63 77 and 80 removal of nitrobenzene in 30 min respectively hence energy used in the degradation of nitrobenzene using dual pulsed us ec techniques was only about 46 5 that of conventional us ec techniques this study shows that energy consumption in the us ec method can be significantly reduced by dual pulsed ultrasound over the conventional us ec techniques for the mineralization of the refractory organic wastewater higher energy consumption in us ec techniques and limited scale up potential hindered the development of us ec techniques for better understanding the energy consumption more aspects like the design of suitable ultrasound producers electrode material must be taken in to account at comparable conditions so that this technique can be developed 5 summary and future perspectives ec technologies in combination with ultrasound are found to be promising techniques for the enhancement in the degradation of the pops due to their environmental compatibility amenability of automation high energy efficiency versatility and safe operation under mild operation condition ultrasound increases the pollutant mass transport across the electrode surface and eliminates the electrode fouling by virtue of the physical and chemical effects of cavitation such as micro jet and shock waves us ec techniques in situ generate oxidizing agent without any chemical addition and eliminate any passivation layer from the electrode surface which also enhanced direct oxidation of the pollutants on the surface of the electrode the use of us ec techniques also reduces the energy required for the complete mineralization of the pollutants further degradation rate kinetics is also higher in the us ec system however the energy required for the complete removal of the organic pollutant is still a crucial issue in the scale up of the geometry of the reactor for the industrial application this can be addressed by using lower ultrasonic intensity equipment in the pulse mode more contact between pollutants and ros is the essential criterion ultrasound frequency is a vital parameter in assessing the synergism more scientific studies on ultrasonic frequency is required in order to optimize it the electrode material activity in the presence of ultrasound needs to be further evaluated so as to compete with more expensive metal oxides such as iro2 and ruo2 both theoretical and experimental studies are required for giving a guideline for selecting a proper set of electrodes further the conversion of electrical energy into cavitation energy is inefficient about 30 40 supplied electrical energy is actually transferred to producing the desired final effect this issue needs to be addressed and planned in order to overcome the energy barrier optimum design and shape of the reactor along with the position of electrode and ultrasound generator are the two essential aspects of the us ec reactor which needs to be carefully addressed so that the scale up of the reactor for the industrial application can be possible novel electrode materials such as ta and sn for organic compound degradation are the best alternative of expensive electrode of pt group metal such as ir and ru thus the operating cost of the process can be minimized by electrode surface modification using a suitable precursor that can also provide high over potential for oxygen formation pilot scale studies on the us ec reactor is not much reported yet the power density used in reported studies is high it is recommended to use a low power density of approximately 0 05 wm l 1 in order to make the process economically viable at industrial scale a vast majority of the research has been performed in a laboratory only with the traditional design of the us ec reactor in which electrode is dipped in the us bath or ultrasonic horn dipped in ec cell it is must require to develop a new geometry of the us ec reactor by incorporating the above issues so that these techniques can be implemented in industries for the wastewater treatment overall contribution from the field of electrochemistry sonochemistry physics and chemical engineering can provide valuable input for the true optimization of us ec reactor geometries it should also be noted that this technology is in the developing phase once it will developed the cost of the treatment would decrease declaration of competing interest the authors

13886,catalytic reduction processes represent a promising approach to treat the toxic nitro aromatic pollutant 4 nitrophenol 4 np via converting 4 np to 4 aminophenol 4 ap many efforts have been invested into developing non precious metal oxides for the conversion of 4 np to 4 ap as co3o4 is validated as a useful non precious metal catalyst for 4 np reduction it is crucial to probe into the relationship of morphology property reactivity of co3o4 catalysts for optimizing design of co3o4 for 4 np reduction thus the catalytic activity of co3o4 for 4 np is particularly investigated in this study through examining 3 dimensional 3d co3o4 catalysts 3dcoos with different nanostructured morphologies including the conical co3o4 cco stacked co3o4 sco needled co3o4 nco and floral co3o4 fco for 4 np reduction a remarkably enhanced activity in the reduction of 4 np is realized over all 3dcoos than commercial co3o4 catalysts in particular cco shows the highest catalytic performance k 0 6882 min 1 and ea 37 4 kj mol 1 whereas fco exhibits the least catalytic activity with k 0 4709 min 1 and ea 47 1 kj mol 1 these values are far more superior than those obtained by the commercial co3o4 and the reported catalysts all four 3dcoos also show stable recyclability with complete 4 np reduction over five successive cycles these results and findings suggest that 3dcoos are certainly advantageous co based catalysts for 4 np reduction and through this study the relationship between morphology property and reactivity would be correlated to offer useful insights to design and apply 3d nanostructured co3o4 catalysts for 4 np reduction keywords 3d co3o4 nitrophenol catalytic reduction nanostructure 1 introduction over the past decades various techniques including electrochemical treatment 1 microbial degradation 2 adsorption 3 catalytic reduction 4 ozonation and photocatalysis 5 have been employed for the elimination of nitrophenol np isomers especially 4 nitrophenol 4 np this is because nitro aromatic compounds regarded as toxic to humans and the environment are largely contained in effluents from industrial sources 6 at levels greater than 20 μg l in the environment nitro aromatic compounds may be injurious to the central nervous system and blood disorders in humans 7 8 for these reasons it is imperative that techniques are developed to effectively deal with these organic compounds in wastewater catalytic reduction of 4 np has advantages of being more effective highly selective and taking place under mild conditions additionally and more importantly the sole product from the catalytic reduction of 4 np 4 aminophenol 4 ap is less toxic and of great commercial value yielding benefits in the photographic pharmaceutical agrochemical and textile industries 9 11 catalytic reduction therefore serves as an eco friendlier route to removing the negative effect of np on the environment as a result there exists an unrelenting urge to develop useful catalysts for the efficient conversion of these toxic np compounds to the less toxic aminophenols aps 10 12 transition metal oxides have been widely researched as candidates to substitute rare and more expensive noble metal containing catalysts for the reduction of 4 np 13 16 specifically tricobalt tetraoxides co3o4 have attracted significant attention in various fields due to their relative inexpensiveness nontoxicity high stability and variable oxidation states 17 21 co3o4 has received much usefulness as sensors 22 catalysts 23 battery electrodes 24 and magnetic materials 25 catalytically co3o4 have shown remarkable performance in wastewater treatments carbon monoxide co volatile organic compounds vocs and nitric oxide no 26 33 recently several works have been done on employing co3o4 for the reduction of 4 np 34 36 however lower catalytic activities have necessitated further development of this area 36 co3o4 with various dimensional architectures e g 1 2 or 3 dimensional 3d with different morphologies have been reported in literature 26 37 these have shown enhanced but diverse catalytic performances based on their surface active species surface areas reducibility and morphologies 26 38 therefore it would be necessary to investigate co3o4 with various morphologies especially with hierarchical nanostructures in order to probe into relationships between morphology property reactivity of co3o4 catalysts and offer insights to optimizing the design of co3o4 for catalytic 4 np reduction therefore the aim of this study is to investigate 3d co3o4 catalysts 3dcoos with various nanostructured morphologies for 4 np reduction specifically four 3dcoos would be prepared as illustrated in fig 1 including the conical co3o4 cco stacked co3o4 sco needled co3o4 nco and floral co3o4 fco catalytic performances based on kinetics activation energy and the reusability of the four 3dcoos towards reduction of 4 np are investigated and compared 2

with two different sizes of 10 μm and 50 80 nm were acquired from alfa aesar uk and sigma aldrich usa respectively for comparison with 3dcoos for 4 np reduction the microscale co3o4 catalyst was denoted as co3o4 mp whereas the nanoscale co3o4 catalyst was named as co3o4 np 2 2 preparation and characterization of 3dcoo catalysts 3dcoo 3dcoo with different nanostructured morphologies as depicted in fig 1 were fabricated via hydrothermal processes using various reagents conditions firstly the precursor of cco was fabricated by mixing 30 mmol of co ch3coo 2 140 ml of ethylene glycol and 60 mmol of urea for 1 h and the resultant mixture was then decanted into a teflon lined stainless steel vessel which was then heated at 180 c for 24 h the precursor of sco was synthesized using a similar method to that for preparing cco with co no3 2 instead of co ch3coo 2 the precursors of nco and fco were obtained by 30 mmol of cocl2 and co so4 2 respectively with 150 mmol of urea and 140 ml of deionized water at 100 c for 18 h as urea provides the reducing environment under hydrothermal conditions hydrolyzes to nh3 h2o and slowly interacted with co2 facilitating the formation and precipitation of cobalt hydroxide nanoparticles precursor before calcination to obtain oxides 39 43 during the process nh3 is released which contributes to the formation of mesoporous co3o4 44 46 the different hydrothermal reaction conditions and times were necessary to direct the precursor growth to achieve the desired variation in the morphologies through a morphologically template nucleation process 37 47 these resultant precursors were subsequently rinsed with di water and ethanol thoroughly dried at 65 c for 24 hours and calcined in static air at 300 c for 3 h at 1 c min 1 heating rate

nitrophenol to 4 aminophenol catalyzed by 3dcoos to investigate the catalytic activities of the 3dcoo catalysts for the reduction of 4 np to 4 ap 0 101 ml of 4 np 3 59 mm 0 145 ml of nabh4 408 mm and 2 191 ml di water were successively added in quartz cuvette and put in a uv vis spectrophotometer monitoring was conducted from 200 nm to 500 nm in the case of the time dependent absorption spectra and at 400 nm for the kinetics study typically the cuvette was put in the spectrometer after the addition of 4 np nabh4 and di water the reaction time was started only after the addition of 0 063 ml of catalyst 1 mg ml of catalyst the decrease in concentration of 4 np ions was monitored at different times until the absorption peak of 4 np disappears and the absorbance was zero for the time dependent absorption spectra and kinetics respectively the temperature dependence and recyclability tests were investigated following similar procedure as the kinetics study but with temperature variation 28 45 c and successive monitoring respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of 3dcoos the morphologies of the four 3dcoos were revealed using sem fig 1 b first shows a rounded granule of cco and a closer view validates that the surface of cco presented many cone like structures as illustrated in fig 1 a with sizes of a few hundreds of nanometers fig 1 d further displays a granule of sco which was obviously comprised of many thin sheets intercrossed on the other hand the morphology of nco is displayed in fig 1 f and the surface of nco was covered all over by nanoneedles validating its surficial needled nanostructure finally fig 1 h shows the morphology of fco in which the flower like granule could be observed and a closer view of fco validates that the surface of fco had very fine and thin floral petal like structures these sem images demonstrate that these 3dcoos were of very comparable sizes of a few micrometers but exhibited very different morphologies with distinct nanostructures on their surfaces moreover tem images lattices and selected area electron diffractions saed of these 3dcoos were then determined fig 2 a displays a tem image of the edge of cco and its corresponding lattice resolved image fig 2 b further indicates that both 202 and 0 22 crystal planes with a d spacing of 0 290 nm and an interfacial angle of 60 existed in cco this crystalline structure demonstrated that cco possessed the main exposed facet of 111 48 the saed of cco also suggested that cco had a poly crystalline structure 49 50 fig 2 c further shows a hrtem image of sco and the sheets of sco seemed to consist of many thin plates the corresponding lattice resolved image fig 2 d reveals that 111 and 2 20 planes of co3o4 could be detected in sco exhibiting an interfacial angle of 45 with d spacing of 0 467 and 0 290 nm respectively this suggests that sco possessed a dominant exposed facet of 110 51 and the saed analysis also indicated the polycrystalline structure in sco fig 2 low resolution high resolution tem images and electron diffraction patterns of 3dcoos a b cco c d sco e f nco and g h fco additionally fig 2 e displays a tem image of nanoneedles of nco and its lattice resolved image further indicated that nco consisted of a number of crystal planes such as 1 13 2 20 and 113 planes of co3o4 specifically the crystal plane 1 13 showed an interfacial angle of 65 towards the 220 plane and another interfacial angle of 50 towards the 1 31 plane these features suggested that nco also contained a primarily exposed facet of 110 51 its saed also demonstrated that nco exhibited the polycrystalline structure next the tem image of fco fig 2 g displays that the petal like part of fco and its lattice resolved image fig 2 h also suggests that both 2 20 and 11 1 planes existed in fco which were interfaced at 90 with d spacing of 0 276 and 0 459 nm respectively this demonstrates that fco exhibited a main exposed facet of 112 52 53 and fco also possessed the polycrystalline structure in view of its saed analysis fig 2 h the xrd patterns of these 3dcoos were then determined and displayed in fig s1 even though these 3dcoo catalysts exhibited various morphologies their xrd patterns were quite consistent with characteristic diffraction peaks at 19 0 31 3 36 8 38 5 44 8 59 4 and 65 2 corresponding to the 111 220 311 222 400 511 and 440 planes of co3o4 based on jcpds 42 1467 the chemical compositions and surface chemistry of 3dcoo catalysts were then determined using xps as displayed in fig s2 and fig 3 fig s2 shows the full survey spectra of these 3dcoos which appeared to be very similar with consistent and notable signals of co co3s co3p and co2p and o o1s with no other significant elements confirming that these 3dcoo catalysts were certainly comprised of cobalt oxide fig 3 a further shows the core level spectra of co2p of these 3dcoo catalysts after the deconvolution these co2p3 spectra showed the same underlying peaks located at 780 2 and 781 8 ev corresponding to co3 and co2 54 respectively which were the theoretical species in co3o4 on the other hand as the peak area was proportional to the amount of the specific species the fractions of co3 versus that of co2 seemed different in these 3dcoo catalysts specifically the amount of co3 over the total amount of co2 and co3 i e co3 co2 co3 in fco was 37 0 and 39 0 in nco 39 7 in sco 39 9 in cco this reveals that co3 was more abundant in cco than any other 3dcoos on the other hand fig 3 b displays the o1s core level xps spectra of the four 3dcoos the deconvoluted o1s spectra showed the presence of different surface oxygen species as summarized in table s1 notably significant contributions from four surface oxygen species are identified for each of 3dcoos the peaks centered at binding energy 533 6 532 8 530 2 and 529 2 ev were attributed to contributions from chemisorbed water ocw oxygen vacancies ovac hydroxyl ooh and lattice oxygen olatt respectively 26 27 38 peak area percentage distribution of the oxygen species table s1 indicates that fco exhibited the highest ratio of adsorbed oxygen 64 82 with nco having the least 50 96 nco on the other hand showed the highest ratio of surface oxygen vacancies 2 98 which was more than twice greater than that for cco 1 16 being the least of 3dcoos as can be seen from table s1 oxygen from water chemisorbed onto the surface was the least abundant of the surface oxygen species present however whereas the amount was significant on cco 0 35 ocw were almost non existent 0 01 on all other 3dcoos as these 3dcoo catalysts exhibited different proportions of co2 and co3 their oxidation reduction characteristics would be influenced and therefore examined by temperature programmed reduction tpr analyses fig 4 a displays tpr profiles of the 3dcoos which all exhibited two reduction peaks owing to the two step reduction process in particular the peak below 300 c would be ascribed to the reduction of co3 to co2 and the peak above 300 c was attributed to the reduction of co2 to co 55 56 interestingly the former peaks of cco and sco occurred at relatively low temperatures ca 240 c in comparison to those of nco and fco ca 280 c this was probably owed to the fact that cco and sco possessed higher fractions of co3 than nco and fco besides the latter peak of fco seemed to be the highest among these catalysts validating that fco had the highest proportion of co2 as seen in the xps analyses raman spectra of these 3dcoo catalysts have been also determined fig s3 and all these 3dcoos showed similar spectra of five notable raman peaks in the range of 150 750 cm 1 the peaks located at 194 523 and 620 cm 1 could be attributed to the f2g symmetry and the peak at 194 cm 1 was derived from the tetrahedral sites of co3o4 55 56 additionally the peak at 485 cm 1 was associated with the eg symmetry while the relatively high peak at 694 cm 1 could be ascribed to the a1g symmetry originating from the octahedral site of co3o4 i e co3o6 57 58 furthermore a closer view of the tall bands of the a1g at ca 690 cm 1 fig 4 b demonstrates that the a1g peaks of these 3dcoos noticeably shifted as the a1g peaks of fco moved to the lower frequency suggesting that fco contained more structural defection 55 which might promote the formation of surficial active species improving catalytic activities 59 as their textural properties might be also distinct owing to their different morphologies n2 sorption isotherms of these 3dcoo catalysts were measured and displayed in fig 5 a the n2 sorption isotherm of cco might be categorized as the iupac type iv isotherm with a hysteresis loop suggesting the existence of mesopores in cco which could be observed in the pore size distribution in fig 5 b its specific surface area and pore volume were then calculated as 52 7 m2 g and 0 207 cm3 g these pores might originate from cavities formed between the nanoscale cones present on the surface of cco moreover the n2 sorption isotherm of sco could be considered as the iupac type ii isotherm with more n2 sorption therefore sco exhibited a relatively higher surface area of 75 2 m2 g and a wider pore distribution fig 5 b and higher pore volume of 0 30 cm3 g this was possibly because the sheets of sco were intercrossed to afford various pores creating much more inter spaces on the other hand the n2 sorption isotherm nco could be regarded as the iupac type iii isotherm with much lower n2 sorption possibly due to its huge granule size its pore size distribution fig 5 b also validated that nco possessed a very low porosity the corresponding specific surface area and pore volume were then determined as 26 8 m2 g and 0 13 cm3 g in the case of fco its amount of n2 sorption appeared to be the highest and its sorption isotherm could be classified as the iupac type iv isotherm suggesting that fco contained mesopores as seen in its pore size distribution fig 5 b therefore fco showed the highest surface area of 121 1 m2 g and largest pore volume of 0 41 cm3 g these results of surface areas and porosities validated that the various nano structural morphologies of the 3dcoos led to distinct textural characteristics which might manifest different catalytic activities for 4 np reduction since 4 np reduction occurs in water the surface charge of 3dcoos should be crucial for interactions between 3dcoos and reactants fig s4 displays zeta potentials of the 3dcoos in the ph range of 3 11 the 3dcoos all showed similar trends that the surface charge decreased when ph was increased all the way up to 11 these 3dcoos all revealed positive surface charges under acidic conditions while exhibited negative charges under alkaline conditions with phpzc values ranging from 6 to 8 3 2 catalytic reduction of 4 nitrophenol to 4 aminophenol the catalytic activity of the 3dcoos were evaluated for 4 nitrophenol 4 np reduction to 4 ap and the time dependent absorption spectra for the reduction of 4 np by 3dcoos are displayed in fig 6 total conversion of 4 np to 4 ap occurred within 9 min in the presence of 3dcoo catalysts notably the fastest completion time was achieved in the cco system 5 5 min fig 6 a followed by sco 6 3 min fig 6 b nco 6 9 min fig 6 c and finally by fco 8 2 min fig 6 d thus the order of reaction completion followed cco sco nco fco this indicates that cco and fco were the most and least effective catalyst respectively furthermore with the dosage of nabh4 far exceeding that of 4 np the catalytic activities of the catalysts were quantified by determining the first order reduction rate constant k and turnover frequency tof for each of the four catalysts towards the reduction of 4 np was determined summarized in table s2 from the slope of plot of ln ct c0 against the reaction time t according to the expression 4 60 1 ln c t c 0 k t where c0 and ct are the 4 np concentration at time zero and at a certain reaction time t respectively it was clear from fig 7 and table s2 that the order of catalytic activity for 4 np reduction was cco sco nco fco to evaluate competitiveness of the 3dcoos two commercial co3o4 co3o4 mp and co3o4 np as shown in fig s5 were also tested for comparison in table s2 all 3dcoos i e cco k 0 6882 min 1 sco k 0 6171 min 1 nco k 0 4928 min 1 and fco k 0 4709 min 1 showed catalytic activities strikingly greater than these commercial cobalt oxides table s2 fig s6 the above results further demonstrated that the as synthesized 3dcoos were very advantageous catalysts for 4 np reduction higher catalytic activity of co3o4 catalysts is largely linked with effect from higher surface area highly defective structure surface properties highly exposed crystal planes and reducibility since the catalytic reduction of 4 nitrophenol to 4 aminophenol is deemed to be surface phenomenon the surface morphology of the four 3dcoos became extremely vital towards elucidating the reaction mechanism 61 higher surface areas generally exhibit exposure of more active sites hence better catalytic performance 27 38 62 64 with this in mind the effect of surface area was firstly considered however fco with the highest surface area was rather the least active catalyst depicting that the surface area was obviously not the main factor contributing to the enhanced catalytic performance of cco a similar discrepancy had been observed by song et al 27 it was obvious that the differing synthesis methods result in varying morphologies of the four 3dcoo samples i e cco sco nco fco and thus their effect on the catalytic performance could not be ignored 65 67 even though the surface area did not seem to correlate positively with the observed catalytic activity trend we cannot ignore the effect posed by the different exposed crystal planes as per the outcome of the hrtem characterization the exposed crystal planes of co3o4 spinel structure allowed for varying surface atomic configuration the openness in the surface structure of the co3o4 facets followed the order 111 110 112 68 69 specifically the predominantly exposed facets on cco sco nco and fco are 111 110 110 and 112 respectively fg 2 b d f h this agrees well with the catalytic reduction trend cco sco nco fco the open structure due to more interlayer spacing and tunnels allowed for more exposed active sites and also facilitated reactants diffusion leading to enhanced catalytic activity 68 70 referring from the raman spectroscopic analyses sco nco and fco especially fco showed highly defective structure i e red shift in a1g symmetry with respect to oxygen species in the octahedral sites i e co3o6 than cco fig 4 b this occurrence was beneficial for the adsorption of oxygen and water molecules 38 however with 4 nitrophenolate and borohydride ions competing with oxygen and water molecules for adsorption sites the catalytic reduction was hindered 71 72 the availability of oxygen vacancies has been validated as a critical factor for the adsorption activation and the movement of oxygen species during oxidation reactions however this might be detrimental to reduction reactions due to the limitation of electron transfer posed by adsorbed oxygen 5 19 hence the surface 4 np bh4 oads competition was expected to be greatest in the case of the fco catalyst system owing to its relatively defective structure and largest surface area leading to limited electron transfer to 4 np and unsatisfactory catalytic activity this observation also agreed with the xps fig 3 a analyses which showed lower co3 co2 ratio by fco than sco nco and cco confirming that the surface of fco possessed more adsorbed oxygen and oxygen vacancies partly explaining the decreased catalytic activity of sco system 38 73 74 this was further confirmed by the peak area percentages of the oxygen components obtained from the deconvoluted xps spectra shown in fig 3 b and table s1 it is noteworthy that the adsorption of h2o molecules either molecular or dissociative is ubiquitous with oxide surfaces 75 76 unlike adsorbed oxygen oads adsorbed water molecules have been shown to be beneficial for catalytic h2 production 77 from table s1 cco possessed the least abundant surface oxygen vacancies and highest chemisorbed water ocw therefore it was expected to receive the least resistance to electron flow by adsorbed oxygen as well as an enhanced catalytic h2 release translating into an enhanced catalytic activity furthermore from the h2 tpr fig 4 a low temperature reducibility of the catalysts followed the trend cco sco nco fco while cco was the most reducible fco was the least reducible this correlated well with the order of catalytic activity cco sco nco fco as higher catalytic activities have generally been linked with enhanced reducibility 27 78 79 since our reaction system did not undergo any form of agitation the stability of the catalysts in solution forming well dispersed suspension was vital the as synthesized co3o4 being nano sized may potentially suffer reduced catalytic activity due to aggregation in water 80 however higher physical stability maintained by sample particles can significantly decrease or entirely eliminate the possible formation of aggregates by catalysts 81 one way to assess this was by measuring the zeta potential at the ph of the reaction system ph 10 cco is the most stable z value of 30 mv the stabilities of the nco z value of 22 mv and sco z value of 20 mv were closely related but fco z value of 15 mv showed the least stability in water fig s4 greater stability of cco in water ensured well dispersed suspension and more exposed surface towards reaction on the other hand the lower stability of fco catalyst system might give rise to higher degree of aggregated suspension which hindered effective reaction 61 82 it is well established in previous literature the respective roles of transition metal based catalysts in the hydrolysis of nabh4 83 84 and as media to facilitate electron transfer towards the reduction of 4 np 10 85 86 based on our results we propose a possible mechanism for the 3dcoos catalyzed reduction of 4 np to 4 ap in the presence of nabh4 the presence of nabh4 in the 4 np aqueous solution led to the formation of 4 nitrophenolate ions 4 np as evidenced by a deep yellow color reduction of 4 np occurred only after the introduction of 3dcoo and can be summarized as follows i diffusion of bh4 and 4 np and adsorption onto 3dcoo surface through the co active sites ii electron release from h ions through 3dcoo to 4 np iii facilitation of h2 release from h2o and subsequent formation of active h on 3dcoo eq 2 iv hydrogenation of 4 np to 4 ap by active h on 3dcoo v desorption of reduced 4 ap into bulk solution to free co active sites for reduction cycle 2 bh4 3dcoo h2o bo2 h2 h 3dcoo 3 3 determination of activation energy ea the 3dcoo catalyzed reduction of 4 nitrophenol was conducted at three different temperatures 28 35 and 45 c and the rate constants obtained at each temperature were employed in determining the apparent activation energy ea based on the linear fitting of ln k versus 1 t fig 7 b and the arrhenius equation as follows 3 ln k ln a ea rt the activation energy determined for cco ea 37 4 kj mol 1 was the lowest and very well agreed with its highest catalytic activity k 0 6882 min 1 as observed experimentally table 1 summarizes all the determined activation energies it is observed that the activation energies determined for cco nco sco and fco were far lower than that for the commercial cobalt oxide co3o4 mp ea 52 5 kj mol 1 and much lower or comparable with other noble metal containing catalysts such as ag pt sepiolite ea 69 02 kj mol 1 and au pd core shell nanocubes ea 43 32 2 61 kj mol 1 table 1 14 15 as such our as synthesized 3dcoo especially cco were more facile in their activity towards 4 np conversion to 4 ap ideally higher activation energy ea leads to a lower reaction rate and vice versa however this was not observed when fco and the commercial co3o4 np systems were compared table 1 table s2 and table s3 and fig s7 i e fco system with a higher k 0 4709 min 1 than commercial co3o4 np 0 041 min 1 exhibited an ea 47 1 kj mol 1 which happened to be relatively higher than that for commercial co3o4 np 44 3 kj mol 1 the observed discrepancy clearly shows that ea is not the main contributing factor to the observed larger k value in fco than commercial co3o4 np and this also confirms our assertion under section 3 2 that the observed variation in catalytic activities among the as synthesized 3dcoos stemmed from the collective contributions from a number of factors the exceedingly higher surface area 121 1 m2 g 1 and pore volume 0 410 cm3 g 1 exhibited by fco compared with commercial co3o4 np 5 295 m² g 1 and 0 018 cm3 g 1 table s1 and table s3 was favorable in exposing more active catalytic sites in fco than commercial co3o4 np as a result larger amounts of 4 np species got reduced per time leading to the observed faster reduction kinetics in fco 51 62 64 even though it is evident from the ea values fco 47 1 kj mol 1 and co3o4 np 44 3 kj mol 1 that the reduction in the co3o4 np system is slightly facile this effect is not able to overcome the influence from the surface area and pore volume hence the observed discrepancy similar discrepancy between the k and ea was realized by wang and coworkers 88 3 4 recyclability of the 3dcoo catalysts the recyclability of catalysts is an important aspect for a more economical process thus recycling catalysis experiments were conducted for the four as synthesized 3dcoo catalysts 25 mg l 1 towards the reduction of 4 np by successive addition of 4 np aqueous solution 0 145 mm after each cycle in the presence of nabh4 27 5 mm it was apparent from fig 8 and fig s8 approximately 100 conversion of 4 np was realized with only slight decrease except for fco in the catalytic activity after five successive cycles depicting their high efficiency and stability for fco catalyst the reduction time decreased after the second cycle 2 min to 4 min and this time remained relatively unchanged through to the end of the fifth cycle 4 1 min the high efficiency and stability especially for cco nco sco catalysts ensure their effective practical usage in wastewater treatment the observed decrease in the activity was probably as a result of boron species that remained trapped on the catalysts and rendered some catalytic sites unavailable during successive reactions 89 91 this phenomenon was most significant in the fco catalyst system possibly because a relatively high amount of boron by products was trapped due to its large porosity 81 4 conclusion in this study the four 3d co3o4 catalysts with different nanostructured morphologies were fabricated and compared for their catalytic activities on the reduction of 4 np to 4 ap as these 3dcoos exhibited quite different morphologies their physical and chemical properties were substantially varied thereby demonstrating distinct catalytic activities for 4 np reduction generally these 3dcoos showed much higher catalytic activities than the commercial co3o4 spheres for 4 np reduction as these 3dcoos possessed high surface area and porous nanostructures while these 3dcoos were all promising cco appeared to be the most advantageous 3dcoo for 4 np reduction completing the reduction of 4 np within 6 min with k 0 6882 min 1 because cco possessed more reactive surface and more superior redox properties than other 3dcoo this value was by far greater than two commercial co3o4 catalysts the catalysts especially cco nco and sco exhibited excellent reusability for at least five cycles showing huge potential as non noble catalysts for practical applications these results and findings demonstrate that 3dcoos are certainly promising co3o4 catalysts for 4 np reduction the relationship between morphology properties and catalytic activities can be correlated and elucidated to provide important insights to design and apply hierarchically nanostructured co3o4 catalysts for 4 np reduction declaration of competing interest the

13886,catalytic reduction processes represent a promising approach to treat the toxic nitro aromatic pollutant 4 nitrophenol 4 np via converting 4 np to 4 aminophenol 4 ap many efforts have been invested into developing non precious metal oxides for the conversion of 4 np to 4 ap as co3o4 is validated as a useful non precious metal catalyst for 4 np reduction it is crucial to probe into the relationship of morphology property reactivity of co3o4 catalysts for optimizing design of co3o4 for 4 np reduction thus the catalytic activity of co3o4 for 4 np is particularly investigated in this study through examining 3 dimensional 3d co3o4 catalysts 3dcoos with different nanostructured morphologies including the conical co3o4 cco stacked co3o4 sco needled co3o4 nco and floral co3o4 fco for 4 np reduction a remarkably enhanced activity in the reduction of 4 np is realized over all 3dcoos than commercial co3o4 catalysts in particular cco shows the highest catalytic performance k 0 6882 min 1 and ea 37 4 kj mol 1 whereas fco exhibits the least catalytic activity with k 0 4709 min 1 and ea 47 1 kj mol 1 these values are far more superior than those obtained by the commercial co3o4 and the reported catalysts all four 3dcoos also show stable recyclability with complete 4 np reduction over five successive cycles these results and findings suggest that 3dcoos are certainly advantageous co based catalysts for 4 np reduction and through this study the relationship between morphology property and reactivity would be correlated to offer useful insights to design and apply 3d nanostructured co3o4 catalysts for 4 np reduction keywords 3d co3o4 nitrophenol catalytic reduction nanostructure 1 introduction over the past decades various techniques including electrochemical treatment 1 microbial degradation 2 adsorption 3 catalytic reduction 4 ozonation and photocatalysis 5 have been employed for the elimination of nitrophenol np isomers especially 4 nitrophenol 4 np this is because nitro aromatic compounds regarded as toxic to humans and the environment are largely contained in effluents from industrial sources 6 at levels greater than 20 μg l in the environment nitro aromatic compounds may be injurious to the central nervous system and blood disorders in humans 7 8 for these reasons it is imperative that techniques are developed to effectively deal with these organic compounds in wastewater catalytic reduction of 4 np has advantages of being more effective highly selective and taking place under mild conditions additionally and more importantly the sole product from the catalytic reduction of 4 np 4 aminophenol 4 ap is less toxic and of great commercial value yielding benefits in the photographic pharmaceutical agrochemical and textile industries 9 11 catalytic reduction therefore serves as an eco friendlier route to removing the negative effect of np on the environment as a result there exists an unrelenting urge to develop useful catalysts for the efficient conversion of these toxic np compounds to the less toxic aminophenols aps 10 12 transition metal oxides have been widely researched as candidates to substitute rare and more expensive noble metal containing catalysts for the reduction of 4 np 13 16 specifically tricobalt tetraoxides co3o4 have attracted significant attention in various fields due to their relative inexpensiveness nontoxicity high stability and variable oxidation states 17 21 co3o4 has received much usefulness as sensors 22 catalysts 23 battery electrodes 24 and magnetic materials 25 catalytically co3o4 have shown remarkable performance in wastewater treatments carbon monoxide co volatile organic compounds vocs and nitric oxide no 26 33 recently several works have been done on employing co3o4 for the reduction of 4 np 34 36 however lower catalytic activities have necessitated further development of this area 36 co3o4 with various dimensional architectures e g 1 2 or 3 dimensional 3d with different morphologies have been reported in literature 26 37 these have shown enhanced but diverse catalytic performances based on their surface active species surface areas reducibility and morphologies 26 38 therefore it would be necessary to investigate co3o4 with various morphologies especially with hierarchical nanostructures in order to probe into relationships between morphology property reactivity of co3o4 catalysts and offer insights to optimizing the design of co3o4 for catalytic 4 np reduction therefore the aim of this study is to investigate 3d co3o4 catalysts 3dcoos with various nanostructured morphologies for 4 np reduction specifically four 3dcoos would be prepared as illustrated in fig 1 including the conical co3o4 cco stacked co3o4 sco needled co3o4 nco and floral co3o4 fco catalytic performances based on kinetics activation energy and the reusability of the four 3dcoos towards reduction of 4 np are investigated and compared 2

with two different sizes of 10 μm and 50 80 nm were acquired from alfa aesar uk and sigma aldrich usa respectively for comparison with 3dcoos for 4 np reduction the microscale co3o4 catalyst was denoted as co3o4 mp whereas the nanoscale co3o4 catalyst was named as co3o4 np 2 2 preparation and characterization of 3dcoo catalysts 3dcoo 3dcoo with different nanostructured morphologies as depicted in fig 1 were fabricated via hydrothermal processes using various reagents conditions firstly the precursor of cco was fabricated by mixing 30 mmol of co ch3coo 2 140 ml of ethylene glycol and 60 mmol of urea for 1 h and the resultant mixture was then decanted into a teflon lined stainless steel vessel which was then heated at 180 c for 24 h the precursor of sco was synthesized using a similar method to that for preparing cco with co no3 2 instead of co ch3coo 2 the precursors of nco and fco were obtained by 30 mmol of cocl2 and co so4 2 respectively with 150 mmol of urea and 140 ml of deionized water at 100 c for 18 h as urea provides the reducing environment under hydrothermal conditions hydrolyzes to nh3 h2o and slowly interacted with co2 facilitating the formation and precipitation of cobalt hydroxide nanoparticles precursor before calcination to obtain oxides 39 43 during the process nh3 is released which contributes to the formation of mesoporous co3o4 44 46 the different hydrothermal reaction conditions and times were necessary to direct the precursor growth to achieve the desired variation in the morphologies through a morphologically template nucleation process 37 47 these resultant precursors were subsequently rinsed with di water and ethanol thoroughly dried at 65 c for 24 hours and calcined in static air at 300 c for 3 h at 1 c min 1 heating rate

and at 400 nm for the kinetics study typically the cuvette was put in the spectrometer after the addition of 4 np nabh4 and di water the reaction time was started only after the addition of 0 063 ml of catalyst 1 mg ml of catalyst the decrease in concentration of 4 np ions was monitored at different times until the absorption peak of 4 np disappears and the absorbance was zero for the time dependent absorption spectra and kinetics respectively the temperature dependence and recyclability tests were investigated following similar procedure as the kinetics study but with temperature variation 28 45 c and successive monitoring respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of 3dcoos the morphologies of the four 3dcoos were revealed using sem fig 1 b first shows a rounded granule of cco and a closer view validates that the surface of cco presented many cone like structures as illustrated in fig 1 a with sizes of a few hundreds of nanometers fig 1 d further displays a granule of sco which was obviously comprised of many thin sheets intercrossed on the other hand the morphology of nco is displayed in fig 1 f and the surface of nco was covered all over by nanoneedles validating its surficial needled nanostructure finally fig 1 h shows the morphology of fco in which the flower like granule could be observed and a closer view of fco validates that the surface of fco had very fine and thin floral petal like structures these sem images demonstrate that these 3dcoos were of very comparable sizes of a few micrometers but exhibited very different morphologies with distinct nanostructures on their surfaces moreover tem images lattices and selected area electron diffractions saed of these 3dcoos were then determined fig 2 a displays a tem image of the edge of cco and its corresponding lattice resolved image fig 2 b further indicates that both 202 and 0 22 crystal planes with a d spacing of 0 290 nm and an interfacial angle of 60 existed in cco this crystalline structure demonstrated that cco possessed the main exposed facet of 111 48 the saed of cco also suggested that cco had a poly crystalline structure 49 50 fig 2 c further shows a hrtem image of sco and the sheets of sco seemed to consist of many thin plates the corresponding lattice resolved image fig 2 d reveals that 111 and 2 20 planes of co3o4 could be detected in sco exhibiting an interfacial angle of 45 with d spacing of 0 467 and 0 290 nm respectively this suggests that sco possessed a dominant exposed facet of 110 51 and the saed analysis also indicated the polycrystalline structure in sco fig 2 low resolution high resolution tem images and electron diffraction patterns of 3dcoos a b cco c d sco e f nco and g h fco additionally fig 2 e displays a tem image of nanoneedles of nco and its lattice resolved image further indicated that nco consisted of a number of crystal planes such as 1 13 2 20 and 113 planes of co3o4 specifically the crystal plane 1 13 showed an interfacial angle of 65 towards the 220 plane and another interfacial angle of 50 towards the 1 31 plane these features suggested that nco also contained a primarily exposed facet of 110 51 its saed also demonstrated that nco exhibited the polycrystalline structure next the tem image of fco fig 2 g displays that the petal like part of fco and its lattice resolved image fig 2 h also suggests that both 2 20 and 11 1 planes existed in fco which were interfaced at 90 with d spacing of 0 276 and 0 459 nm respectively this demonstrates that fco exhibited a main exposed facet of 112 52 53 and fco also possessed the polycrystalline structure in view of its saed analysis fig 2 h the xrd patterns of these 3dcoos were then determined and displayed in fig s1 even though these 3dcoo catalysts exhibited various morphologies their xrd patterns were quite consistent with characteristic diffraction peaks at 19 0 31 3 36 8 38 5 44 8 59 4 and 65 2 corresponding to the 111 220 311 222 400 511 and 440 planes of co3o4 based on jcpds 42 1467 the chemical compositions and surface chemistry of 3dcoo catalysts were then determined using xps as displayed in fig s2 and fig 3 fig s2 shows the full survey spectra of these 3dcoos which appeared to be very similar with consistent and notable signals of co co3s co3p and co2p and o o1s with no other significant elements confirming that these 3dcoo catalysts were certainly comprised of cobalt oxide fig 3 a further shows the core level spectra of co2p of these 3dcoo catalysts after the deconvolution these co2p3 spectra showed the same underlying peaks located at 780 2 and 781 8 ev corresponding to co3 and co2 54 respectively which were the theoretical species in co3o4 on the other hand as the peak area was proportional to the amount of the specific species the fractions of co3 versus that of co2 seemed different in these 3dcoo catalysts specifically the amount of co3 over the total amount of co2 and co3 i e co3 co2 co3 in fco was 37 0 and 39 0 in nco 39 7 in sco 39 9 in cco this reveals that co3 was more abundant in cco than any other 3dcoos on the other hand fig 3 b displays the o1s core level xps spectra of the four 3dcoos the deconvoluted o1s spectra showed the presence of different surface oxygen species as summarized in table s1 notably significant contributions from four surface oxygen species are identified for each of 3dcoos the peaks centered at binding energy 533 6 532 8 530 2 and 529 2 ev were attributed to contributions from chemisorbed water ocw oxygen vacancies ovac hydroxyl ooh and lattice oxygen olatt respectively 26 27 38 peak area percentage distribution of the oxygen species table s1 indicates that fco exhibited the highest ratio of adsorbed oxygen 64 82 with nco having the least 50 96 nco on the other hand showed the highest ratio of surface oxygen vacancies 2 98 which was more than twice greater than that for cco 1 16 being the least of 3dcoos as can be seen from table s1 oxygen from water chemisorbed onto the surface was the least abundant of the surface oxygen species present however whereas the amount was significant on cco 0 35 ocw were almost non existent 0 01 on all other 3dcoos as these 3dcoo catalysts exhibited different proportions of co2 and co3 their oxidation reduction characteristics would be influenced and therefore examined by temperature programmed reduction tpr analyses fig 4 a displays tpr profiles of the 3dcoos which all exhibited two reduction peaks owing to the two step reduction process in particular the peak below 300 c would be ascribed to the reduction of co3 to co2 and the peak above 300 c was attributed to the reduction of co2 to co 55 56 interestingly the former peaks of cco and sco occurred at relatively low temperatures ca 240 c in comparison to those of nco and fco ca 280 c this was probably owed to the fact that cco and sco possessed higher fractions of co3 than nco and fco besides the latter peak of fco seemed to be the highest among these catalysts validating that fco had the highest proportion of co2 as seen in the xps analyses raman spectra of these 3dcoo catalysts have been also determined fig s3 and all these 3dcoos showed similar spectra of five notable raman peaks in the range of 150 750 cm 1 the peaks located at 194 523 and 620 cm 1 could be attributed to the f2g symmetry and the peak at 194 cm 1 was derived from the tetrahedral sites of co3o4 55 56 additionally the peak at 485 cm 1 was associated with the eg symmetry while the relatively high peak at 694 cm 1 could be ascribed to the a1g symmetry originating from the octahedral site of co3o4 i e co3o6 57 58 furthermore a closer view of the tall bands of the a1g at ca 690 cm 1 fig 4 b demonstrates that the a1g peaks of these 3dcoos noticeably shifted as the a1g peaks of fco moved to the lower frequency suggesting that fco contained more structural defection 55 which might promote the formation of surficial active species improving catalytic activities 59 as their textural properties might be also distinct owing to their different morphologies n2 sorption isotherms of these 3dcoo catalysts were measured and displayed in fig 5 a the n2 sorption isotherm of cco might be categorized as the iupac type iv isotherm with a hysteresis loop suggesting the existence of mesopores in cco which could be observed in the pore size distribution in fig 5 b its specific surface area and pore volume were then calculated as 52 7 m2 g and 0 207 cm3 g these pores might originate from cavities formed between the nanoscale cones present on the surface of cco moreover the n2 sorption isotherm of sco could be considered as the iupac type ii isotherm with more n2 sorption therefore sco exhibited a relatively higher surface area of 75 2 m2 g and a wider pore distribution fig 5 b and higher pore volume of 0 30 cm3 g this was possibly because the sheets of sco were intercrossed to afford various pores creating much more inter spaces on the other hand the n2 sorption isotherm nco could be regarded as the iupac type iii isotherm with much lower n2 sorption possibly due to its huge granule size its pore size distribution fig 5 b also validated that nco possessed a very low porosity the corresponding specific surface area and pore volume were then determined as 26 8 m2 g and 0 13 cm3 g in the case of fco its amount of n2 sorption appeared to be the highest and its sorption isotherm could be classified as the iupac type iv isotherm suggesting that fco contained mesopores as seen in its pore size distribution fig 5 b therefore fco showed the highest surface area of 121 1 m2 g and largest pore volume of 0 41 cm3 g these results of surface areas and porosities validated that the various nano structural morphologies of the 3dcoos led to distinct textural characteristics which might manifest different catalytic activities for 4 np reduction since 4 np reduction occurs in water the surface charge of 3dcoos should be crucial for interactions between 3dcoos and reactants fig s4 displays zeta potentials of the 3dcoos in the ph range of 3 11 the 3dcoos all showed similar trends that the surface charge decreased when ph was increased all the way up to 11 these 3dcoos all revealed positive surface charges under acidic conditions while exhibited negative charges under alkaline conditions with phpzc values ranging from 6 to 8 3 2 catalytic reduction of 4 nitrophenol to 4 aminophenol the catalytic activity of the 3dcoos were evaluated for 4 nitrophenol 4 np reduction to 4 ap and the time dependent absorption spectra for the reduction of 4 np by 3dcoos are displayed in fig 6 total conversion of 4 np to 4 ap occurred within 9 min in the presence of 3dcoo catalysts notably the fastest completion time was achieved in the cco system 5 5 min fig 6 a followed by sco 6 3 min fig 6 b nco 6 9 min fig 6 c and finally by fco 8 2 min fig 6 d thus the order of reaction completion followed cco sco nco fco this indicates that cco and fco were the most and least effective catalyst respectively furthermore with the dosage of nabh4 far exceeding that of 4 np the catalytic activities of the catalysts were quantified by determining the first order reduction rate constant k and turnover frequency tof for each of the four catalysts towards the reduction of 4 np was determined summarized in table s2 from the slope of plot of ln ct c0 against the reaction time t according to the expression 4 60 1 ln c t c 0 k t where c0 and ct are the 4 np concentration at time zero and at a certain reaction time t respectively it was clear from fig 7 and table s2 that the order of catalytic activity for 4 np reduction was cco sco nco fco to evaluate competitiveness of the 3dcoos two commercial co3o4 co3o4 mp and co3o4 np as shown in fig s5 were also tested for comparison in table s2 all 3dcoos i e cco k 0 6882 min 1 sco k 0 6171 min 1 nco k 0 4928 min 1 and fco k 0 4709 min 1 showed catalytic activities strikingly greater than these commercial cobalt oxides table s2 fig s6 the above results further demonstrated that the as synthesized 3dcoos were very advantageous catalysts for 4 np reduction higher catalytic activity of co3o4 catalysts is largely linked with effect from higher surface area highly defective structure surface properties highly exposed crystal planes and reducibility since the catalytic reduction of 4 nitrophenol to 4 aminophenol is deemed to be surface phenomenon the surface morphology of the four 3dcoos became extremely vital towards elucidating the reaction mechanism 61 higher surface areas generally exhibit exposure of more active sites hence better catalytic performance 27 38 62 64 with this in mind the effect of surface area was firstly considered however fco with the highest surface area was rather the least active catalyst depicting that the surface area was obviously not the main factor contributing to the enhanced catalytic performance of cco a similar discrepancy had been observed by song et al 27 it was obvious that the differing synthesis methods result in varying morphologies of the four 3dcoo samples i e cco sco nco fco and thus their effect on the catalytic performance could not be ignored 65 67 even though the surface area did not seem to correlate positively with the observed catalytic activity trend we cannot ignore the effect posed by the different exposed crystal planes as per the outcome of the hrtem characterization the exposed crystal planes of co3o4 spinel structure allowed for varying surface atomic configuration the openness in the surface structure of the co3o4 facets followed the order 111 110 112 68 69 specifically the predominantly exposed facets on cco sco nco and fco are 111 110 110 and 112 respectively fg 2 b d f h this agrees well with the catalytic reduction trend cco sco nco fco the open structure due to more interlayer spacing and tunnels allowed for more exposed active sites and also facilitated reactants diffusion leading to enhanced catalytic activity 68 70 referring from the raman spectroscopic analyses sco nco and fco especially fco showed highly defective structure i e red shift in a1g symmetry with respect to oxygen species in the octahedral sites i e co3o6 than cco fig 4 b this occurrence was beneficial for the adsorption of oxygen and water molecules 38 however with 4 nitrophenolate and borohydride ions competing with oxygen and water molecules for adsorption sites the catalytic reduction was hindered 71 72 the availability of oxygen vacancies has been validated as a critical factor for the adsorption activation and the movement of oxygen species during oxidation reactions however this might be detrimental to reduction reactions due to the limitation of electron transfer posed by adsorbed oxygen 5 19 hence the surface 4 np bh4 oads competition was expected to be greatest in the case of the fco catalyst system owing to its relatively defective structure and largest surface area leading to limited electron transfer to 4 np and unsatisfactory catalytic activity this observation also agreed with the xps fig 3 a analyses which showed lower co3 co2 ratio by fco than sco nco and cco confirming that the surface of fco possessed more adsorbed oxygen and oxygen vacancies partly explaining the decreased catalytic activity of sco system 38 73 74 this was further confirmed by the peak area percentages of the oxygen components obtained from the deconvoluted xps spectra shown in fig 3 b and table s1 it is noteworthy that the adsorption of h2o molecules either molecular or dissociative is ubiquitous with oxide surfaces 75 76 unlike adsorbed oxygen oads adsorbed water molecules have been shown to be beneficial for catalytic h2 production 77 from table s1 cco possessed the least abundant surface oxygen vacancies and highest chemisorbed water ocw therefore it was expected to receive the least resistance to electron flow by adsorbed oxygen as well as an enhanced catalytic h2 release translating into an enhanced catalytic activity furthermore from the h2 tpr fig 4 a low temperature reducibility of the catalysts followed the trend cco sco nco fco while cco was the most reducible fco was the least reducible this correlated well with the order of catalytic activity cco sco nco fco as higher catalytic activities have generally been linked with enhanced reducibility 27 78 79 since our reaction system did not undergo any form of agitation the stability of the catalysts in solution forming well dispersed suspension was vital the as synthesized co3o4 being nano sized may potentially suffer reduced catalytic activity due to aggregation in water 80 however higher physical stability maintained by sample particles can significantly decrease or entirely eliminate the possible formation of aggregates by catalysts 81 one way to assess this was by measuring the zeta potential at the ph of the reaction system ph 10 cco is the most stable z value of 30 mv the stabilities of the nco z value of 22 mv and sco z value of 20 mv were closely related but fco z value of 15 mv showed the least stability in water fig s4 greater stability of cco in water ensured well dispersed suspension and more exposed surface towards reaction on the other hand the lower stability of fco catalyst system might give rise to higher degree of aggregated suspension which hindered effective reaction 61 82 it is well established in previous literature the respective roles of transition metal based catalysts in the hydrolysis of nabh4 83 84 and as media to facilitate electron transfer towards the reduction of 4 np 10 85 86 based on our results we propose a possible mechanism for the 3dcoos catalyzed reduction of 4 np to 4 ap in the presence of nabh4 the presence of nabh4 in the 4 np aqueous solution led to the formation of 4 nitrophenolate ions 4 np as evidenced by a deep yellow color reduction of 4 np occurred only after the introduction of 3dcoo and can be summarized as follows i diffusion of bh4 and 4 np and adsorption onto 3dcoo surface through the co active sites ii electron release from h ions through 3dcoo to 4 np iii facilitation of h2 release from h2o and subsequent formation of active h on 3dcoo eq 2 iv hydrogenation of 4 np to 4 ap by active h on 3dcoo v desorption of reduced 4 ap into bulk solution to free co active sites for reduction cycle 2 bh4 3dcoo h2o bo2 h2 h 3dcoo 3 3 determination of activation energy ea the 3dcoo catalyzed reduction of 4 nitrophenol was conducted at three different temperatures 28 35 and 45 c and the rate constants obtained at each temperature were employed in determining the apparent activation energy ea based on the linear fitting of ln k versus 1 t fig 7 b and the arrhenius equation as follows 3 ln k ln a ea rt the activation energy determined for cco ea 37 4 kj mol 1 was the lowest and very well agreed with its highest catalytic activity k 0 6882 min 1 as observed experimentally table 1 summarizes all the determined activation energies it is observed that the activation energies determined for cco nco sco and fco were far lower than that for the commercial cobalt oxide co3o4 mp ea 52 5 kj mol 1 and much lower or comparable with other noble metal containing catalysts such as ag pt sepiolite ea 69 02 kj mol 1 and au pd core shell nanocubes ea 43 32 2 61 kj mol 1 table 1 14 15 as such our as synthesized 3dcoo especially cco were more facile in their activity towards 4 np conversion to 4 ap ideally higher activation energy ea leads to a lower reaction rate and vice versa however this was not observed when fco and the commercial co3o4 np systems were compared table 1 table s2 and table s3 and fig s7 i e fco system with a higher k 0 4709 min 1 than commercial co3o4 np 0 041 min 1 exhibited an ea 47 1 kj mol 1 which happened to be relatively higher than that for commercial co3o4 np 44 3 kj mol 1 the observed discrepancy clearly shows that ea is not the main contributing factor to the observed larger k value in fco than commercial co3o4 np and this also confirms our assertion under section 3 2 that the observed variation in catalytic activities among the as synthesized 3dcoos stemmed from the collective contributions from a number of factors the exceedingly higher surface area 121 1 m2 g 1 and pore volume 0 410 cm3 g 1 exhibited by fco compared with commercial co3o4 np 5 295 m² g 1 and 0 018 cm3 g 1 table s1 and table s3 was favorable in exposing more active catalytic sites in fco than commercial co3o4 np as a result larger amounts of 4 np species got reduced per time leading to the observed faster reduction kinetics in fco 51 62 64 even though it is evident from the ea values fco 47 1 kj mol 1 and co3o4 np 44 3 kj mol 1 that the reduction in the co3o4 np system is slightly facile this effect is not able to overcome the influence from the surface area and pore volume hence the observed discrepancy similar discrepancy between the k and ea was realized by wang and coworkers 88 3 4 recyclability of the 3dcoo catalysts the recyclability of catalysts is an important aspect for a more economical process thus recycling catalysis experiments were conducted for the four as synthesized 3dcoo catalysts 25 mg l 1 towards the reduction of 4 np by successive addition of 4 np aqueous solution 0 145 mm after each cycle in the presence of nabh4 27 5 mm it was apparent from fig 8 and fig s8 approximately 100 conversion of 4 np was realized with only slight decrease except for fco in the catalytic activity after five successive cycles depicting their high efficiency and stability for fco catalyst the reduction time decreased after the second cycle 2 min to 4 min and this time remained relatively unchanged through to the end of the fifth cycle 4 1 min the high efficiency and stability especially for cco nco sco catalysts ensure their effective practical usage in wastewater treatment the observed decrease in the activity was probably as a result of boron species that remained trapped on the catalysts and rendered some catalytic sites unavailable during successive reactions 89 91 this phenomenon was most significant in the fco catalyst system possibly because a relatively high amount of boron by products was trapped due to its large porosity 81 4 conclusion in this study the four 3d co3o4 catalysts with different nanostructured morphologies were fabricated and compared for their catalytic activities on the reduction of 4 np to 4 ap as these 3dcoos exhibited quite different morphologies their physical and chemical properties were substantially varied thereby demonstrating distinct catalytic activities for 4 np reduction generally these 3dcoos showed much higher catalytic activities than the commercial co3o4 spheres for 4 np reduction as these 3dcoos possessed high surface area and porous nanostructures while these 3dcoos were all promising cco appeared to be the most advantageous 3dcoo for 4 np reduction completing the reduction of 4 np within 6 min with k 0 6882 min 1 because cco possessed more reactive surface and more superior redox properties than other 3dcoo this value was by far greater than two commercial co3o4 catalysts the catalysts especially cco nco and sco exhibited excellent reusability for at least five cycles showing huge potential as non noble catalysts for practical applications these results and findings demonstrate that 3dcoos are certainly promising co3o4 catalysts for 4 np reduction the relationship between morphology properties and catalytic activities can be correlated and elucidated to provide important insights to design and apply hierarchically nanostructured co3o4 catalysts for 4 np reduction declaration of competing interest the

13887,this study investigated the removal of heavy metals from water using electrospun polyelectrolyte pe complex fibers of polyacrylic acid paa and polyallylamine hydrochloride pah pe fiber mats were fabricated under various electrospinning operating conditions to optimize fiber size and stability in aqueous solution the stable fiber mats were evaluated for their efficiency in removing heavy metals in synthetic metal solutions the effect of water matrix on heavy metal removal using the paa pah fiber mats was probed by comparing metal removals in the presence and absence of natural organic matter nom the fiber mats exhibited approximately 63 42 and 21 removals of lead pb cadmium cd and copper cu respectively in synthetic metal solutions at ph 3 4 furthermore approximately 70 98 and 92 removals of pb cd and cu respectively were observed at a higher ph 7 4 the heavy metal removal by the paa pah complex fiber mats may be attributed to the association of the metal ions with carboxylate ions from the fibers the presence of nom in the metal spiked solutions resulted in higher removal of metals by the fiber mats this can be attributed to the availability of nom derived carboxylic acid groups which resulted in increased metal carboxylate complexations this study implies that water matrix plays an important role that must be evaluated when removing metals using pe complex fibers keywords electrospinning polyelectrolyte fiber mats heavy metals polyacrylic acid polyallylamine hydrochloride 1 introduction heavy metals are used in manufacturing various consumer and industrial products 1 and various activities such as mining smelting and metal plating contribute to metal pollution 2 3 in addition heavy metals such as pb cu cd ni hg and sb present in electronic wastes e wastes 4 may end up in both water and soil due to the undisciplined processing of e wastes 5 heavy metals in the biosolids generated from the wastewater treatment plants become concentrated in the leachates that are generated in the landfills receiving those biosolids 1 the disposal of heavy metals in the environment can adversely impact the aquatic life 6 8 and alter the physiological and biochemical processes in plants 2 many metals have been reported to cause dna damage and conformational changes at high concentrations leading to cell cycle modulation carcinogenesis or apoptosis 9 several technologies including ion exchange chemical oxidation chemical precipitation and electro dialysis have been investigated to remove heavy metals from aqueous solutions 10 13 these technologies have demonstrated variable efficiencies in metal removal and the drawbacks associated with these technologies include high operation costs and the production of secondary contaminants alternatively biosorbents derived from various industrial byproducts and agricultural wastes 14 17 have shown promising metal removal efficiency with low operation cost but incurred high biological and chemical oxygen demands 18 membrane process can serve as effective barriers to recalcitrant organic and inorganic pollutants 19 21 however it is energy intensive and prone to fouling during long term operation 22 polyelectrolytes pe have been widely investigated as heavy metal ion removal media because of their high local concentration of functional groups such as carboxylates as well as strong interactions of these functional groups with metal ions 23 26 pes are macromolecules containing ionizable repeating units e g carboxylate amine and sulfonate depending on the charges pes can be cationic anionic or non ionic a major limitation of using pes in many desired water treatment applications is their solubility in water however recent studies 27 28 have reported that pe fibers produced by electrospinning solutions of oppositely charged pes such as polyacrylic acid paa and polyallylamine hydrochloric acid pah or paa and chitosan cs exhibit excellent stability in aqueous solutions ultrathin fibers with diameters in micron and sub micron ranges can be generated by electrospinning by applying a high electrostatic field to a viscoelastic jet created from a solution of desired polymer s electrospinning has been extensively explored as a scalable approach to manufacturing functional fibers 29 offering great control over fiber microstructure and geometry cost and time and vast material selection and is well suited to scale up 30 31 due to their high porosity and aspect ratio large surface area surface charges and versatility to immobilize active nanoparticles the electrospun es fibers have demonstrated great potential in environmental remediations including decoloration of organic dyes 32 removal of various emerging contaminants 33 34 and treatment of oily wastewater 35 past studies 36 38 have investigated metal ion removal using es fibers in synthetic solutions however there is a lack of studies investigating the effect of water matrix and a very few studies 39 40 focused on the removal of heavy metals using es fibers produced from pe complexes specifically fiber mats produced via electrospinning of pe complex of paa and pah that have excellent stability in aqueous solutions 27 have not been tested for heavy metal removal from waters furthermore determining the effect of water matrix on metal ion removal using such complex fibers is essential when considering practical water treatment applications to address the above mentioned knowledge gap we aimed to determine the heavy metal removal capability of stable fiber mats fabricated through electrospinning of paa pah complex solution in environmentally relevant aqueous solutions we performed scanning electron microscopy sem to determine the effect of electrospinning operating conditions and paa pah ratios on the physical morphology of paa pah fiber mats we also evaluated aqueous stability of the fiber mats by exposing them to metal ion solutions we determined the adsorptive removal of three environmentally important heavy metals i e lead pb cadmium cd and copper cu by the paa pah fiber mats at different ph conditions the removal efficiencies of the paa pah fiber mats were evaluated by determining the metal concentrations remaining in the solution using flame atomic absorption spectroscopy faas and also by examining the adsorbed metals on the fiber mats using energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds the effect of water matrix on heavy metal removal using the paa pah fiber mats was probed by comparing metal removals in the presence and absence of

3 ml bd disposable syringes with luer lok tips fisher scientific pah and paa were mixed at different molar ratios using a magnetic stirrer 200 300 rpm for 10 min to reach a homogeneous solution at room temperature the solution was then transferred into the 3 ml plastic syringe attached to the needle for electrospinning fig 1 the feed pump rate and the applied electrical potential were fixed at 0 6 μl h and 8 8 0 2 kv respectively the working distance between the needle tip and the aluminum foil collector was set at 10 5 cm a parchment paper was taped onto the aluminum foil collector for easy collection and removal of the fiber mats during the thermal crosslinking the parchment paper crumbled in the oven allowing the mat to be lifted from the paper the fiber mats were peeled off from the collector and dried at 140 c for 6 h in order to crosslink the polymers 2 3 fiber characterization the pe fiber mats were examined under scanning electron microscopy sem using a zeiss ultra 55 feg sem the samples were sputter coated with a 10 nm thin film of gold palladium prior to sem analysis paa pah ratios of 4 1 and 8 1 were examined to determine the influence of relative polymer concentrations on the morphology of the fibers the adsorbents on the fibers were identified using the noran system 7 energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds equipped with a silicon drift x ray detector fiber mats were prepared for eds analysis by placing them for 2 h into individually spiked metal solutions of 100 ppm of pb cu or cd to distinguish the metal peaks that were not necessarily observed on all locations of the fibers uniformly during initial characterization the fiber mats were then dried at room temperature for 24 h fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy was employed

reflection atr accessory with a diamond crystal 2 4 heavy metal removal the removal of heavy metals by stable pe fiber mats was evaluated by batch experiments 30 mg of fiber mats were submerged in to 100 ml of di water spiked with 2 ppm of each of pb cd and cu the solutions were left on a shaker 120 revolutions per min rpm for 120 min and then metal concentrations in the solutions were measured flame atomic absorption spectroscopy faas was conducted to measure metal concentrations in the solutions using a perkinelmer aanalyst 400 the effect of nom on metal removal by the fiber mats was investigated using di water spiked with suwannee river nom at 10 ppm and 20 ppm concentrations 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of electrospinning operating parameters and pe ratios on fiber size and stability stable pe fiber mats were produced from homogeneous polyacrylic acid paa polyallylamine hydrochloride pah complex solutions by dissolving pah into 25 paa aqueous solutions at 4 1 and 8 1 molar ratios of paa and pah the ph of the mixture was maintained at around 2 1 during the electrospinning process the impacts of electrospinning voltage and the distance between the needle and collecting pad i e the working distance on fabrication of the pe fibers were also examined to determine the optimal paa pah ratio and fiber size the free standing fibers and fiber mats were examined using sem as shown in fig 2 a and b the free standing fibers appear to remain unchanged at the two different applied voltages of 8 kv and 9 kv the fiber diameters ranging from approximately 600 nm 1500 nm appear to remain unchanged at the two electrospinning voltages applied as shown in fig 2 c and d varying the paa pah ratios did not result in any distinct difference in fiber diameter or shape the stability of the optimized fiber mats was evaluated by weighing the mass of fabricated fibers before and after mixing in metal ion solutions it was observed that the fibers were stable in the metal ion solutions and the weight difference before and after soaking the fibers in the metal ion solution was less than 6 3 2 heavy metal removal batch experiments were conducted following the protocol discussed in the materials and methods section to determine the adsorptive removal of selected heavy metals pb cd and cu from di water by the paa pah complex fiber mats with paa to pah ratio of 8 1 the experiments were carried out at two different ph values 3 4 and 7 4 which were continuously monitored and found to be unchanged over the experimental duration to probe the impact of ph on metal adsorption by the fibers at ph 3 4 the stabilized adsorptive removals of pb cd and cu by the fiber mats were approximately 63 42 and 21 respectively after 120 min of contact time fig 3 a while the adsorptive removal of cu equilibrates after around 10 min that for pb takes about 30 min the adsorption of cd however appears to continue beyond the experimental duration 120 min other studies 43 45 also reported lower removal of pb2 cu2 and cd2 by electrospun nanofibers at lower ph values 4 the adsorptive removals and capacity at equilibrium for all three metals increased at the higher ph 7 4 fig 3b at ph 7 4 the maximum adsorptive removals of pb cd and cu by the fiber mats reached to approximately 70 98 and 92 respectively the equilibrium was reached in between 80 100 min after 80 min for cu and cd and after 100 min for pb it is interesting to note that the initial adsorption of pb was lower at ph 7 4 compared to ph 3 4 until around 75 min but the adsorptive removal at equilibrium was approximately 7 higher at a higher ph fig 3b as explained further in section 3 4 using ft ir spectra the metal ion removal by the paa pah complex fiber mats may be attributed to the electrostatic interactions of the metal ions with carboxylate ions coo from the fibers the higher ph 7 4 facilitates the ionization of carboxylic acids cooh from the fiber mats into coo 44 resulting in enhanced metal association with the fibers the comparatively lower removal of pb2 at this ph could be due to its ionic radius which is larger than cu2 and cd2 46 resulting in less availability of coo for pb2 per unit surface area of the fibers when compared to cu2 and cd2 in the individually spiked metal solutions tested using electrospun nanofiber membrane of polyelectrolyte ethylene oxide peo chitosan aliabadi et al 46 showed less adsorption of pb2 compared to cd2 and cu2 by the nanofiber membranes which they suggested were due to the larger ionic radius of pb2 than cd2 and cu2 at ph 3 4 the carboxylate ions are deionized to cooh 44 and hence metal ion removal was likely governed by the complexation between the metals and cooh rather than due to electrostatic interactions as in the case of ph 7 4 bala et al 47 conducted a quantitative study to determine the binding strength of cooh with divalent metal ions and reported that pb2 always exhibits stronger binding with cooh than cd2 despite the smaller ionic radius of cd2 when compared to pb2 in the current study at ph 3 4 when the electrostatic interaction is not dominant which is the case of ph 7 4 instead pb2 binds stronger with cooh and exhibits higher removal efficiency than cd2 and cu2 at ph 7 4 however the electrostatic interaction between the metal ions and coo plays a dominant role and pb2 removal efficiency becomes less compared to cd2 and cu2 as explained earlier the cu ion removal efficiency observed in the current study was comparable to that in a study conducted by xiao et al 40 who reported 91 stabilized removal of cu when using composite paa polyvinyl alcohol pva nanofibers however they conducted the experiments using a high concentration 50 mg l single metal ion cu ii solution and the influence of nom on cu removal was not verified in that study in the current study the influence of water matrix on heavy metal removal using the paa pah complex fiber mats was determined by comparing metal removals in the presence and absence of nom as discussed in the following section eds analysis was conducted to confirm the presence of metals on the fiber mats the eds spectra fig 4 show the presence of carbon oxygen nitrogen and sodium which signify the composition of the polymers that constitute the fiber mats fig 4 b c and d show the presence of pb cd and cu respectively on the fiber mats that were in contact with the respective metal solutions it should be noted that there were locations on the fibers where peaks were not observed indicating that metal adsorption on to the fibers was not probably uniform hence the local concentrations and availabilities of functional groups such as carboxylates may have influenced the metal fiber interactions and metal removal from water the disappearance of or decrease in na peaks for the fibers exposed to metal solutions when compared to the control fibers fig 4a could be due to that fact that the metal ions had replaced na of the na salt of paa when in solution the langmuir 48 and freundlich 49 isotherm models given by eq 1 and eq 2 respectively were used to verify if the adsorption of the tested metals by the paa pah complex fibers can be represented by these models 1 1 q e 1 q m 1 k l q m c e 2 log q e log k f 1 n log c e where qe is the equilibrium adsorbent phase fiber mats concentration of an adsorbate metal mmol g ce is the equilibrium concentration of an adsorbate mmol l qm is the maximum adsorbent phase saturated concentration of adsorbate with monolayer coverage mmol g 48 kl and kf are langmuir adsorption constant l mmol and freundlich adsorption capacity parameter mmol g l mmol 1 n respectively 1 n is the freundlich adsorption intensity parameter unitless the langmuir isotherm provides a better fit for cu r2 0 974 and cd r2 0 904 when compared to the freundlich model table 1 implying the occurrence of monolayer adsorption of these metals by the paa pah fiber mats at ph 7 4 46 the maximum adsorbent phase saturated concentration of cu qm 0 481 mmol g was higher than that of cd qm 0 141 mmol g although using different electrospun nanofibers peo chitosan aliabadi et al 46 observed a better fit for both cu and cd using the langmuir model when compared to the freundlich model they also reported slightly higher maximum adsorption per unit weight for cu than that for cd in the current study pb adsorption by the paa pah fiber mats did not fit either the langmuir or the freundlich isotherms suggesting that further isotherm studies are required to identify a suitable model for metal adsorption by this specific blend of complex fibers 3 3 effect of nom on heavy metal removal by paa pah complex fiber mats the effect of nom on the removal of heavy metals by the electrospun stable paa pah complex fiber mats was evaluated at concentrations of 10 ppm and 20 ppm at ph 7 4 while the adsorptive removal of cd and cu was already very high 98 and 92 respectively in di water the presence of nom resulted in almost complete removal of all of the three metals at both the nom concentration levels tested fig 5 the removal of pb was approximately 30 higher in the nom spiked water when compared to the di water the enhanced removal of metal ions in the presence of nom can be attributed to the additional complexation due to the functional groups from nom 50 3 4 mechanism behind nom enhanced heavy metal removal by paa pah fiber mats the fiber mats were examined using ft ir to identify the functional groups and possible bonds with nom and metal ions when the fibers are exposed to ir radiation corresponding vibrational energy of atomic bonds is absorbed and the ft ir spectra show absorbance intensity against the wavenumbers or ir bands corresponding to the characteristic frequencies at which certain functional groups chemical bonds in the sample absorb ir this results in absorption spectra that are a unique fingerprint of a compound 51 fig 6 shows the ft ir spectra of the stable virgin fiber mat control and fibers collected from the batch experiments that were conducted using only nom spiked or both nom and metal spiked solutions the ft ir spectra in the ranges of 1720 1706 cm 1 and 1250 1020 cm 1 correspond to carboxylic acid cooh and amine cn stretching groups respectively 52 peaks at around 1400 cm 1 and 1600 cm 1 indicate carboxylate ion coo and those at around 1650 cm 1 and 1550 cm 1 indicate amides 51 the amide peaks 1553 and at 1551 cm 1 confirm paa pah crosslinking via carboxylate groups of paa and ammonium groups of pah 53 while the cooh and coo peaks for all of the samples were observed at 1706 cm 1 and 1405 cm 1 respectively the fiber mats from the nom solutions showed higher intensities fig 6 indicating higher availability of cooh and coo in the presence of nom hence the removal of the tested metals by the fiber mats may be attributed to the association of the metal ions with coo 54 interestingly the paa pah functional groups as well as the nom functional groups were so dominant in this case that the shifts in peaks that one might expect due to new complexations were not distinctly identified in fig 6 a conceptual model illustrating the mechanism of nom enhanced heavy metal removal by the fiber mats is shown in fig 7 as illustrated in fig 7 the enhanced metal removal in the presence of nom was likely due to the higher availability of coo from nom 4 conclusion in this study stable pe fiber mats were produced through electrospinning of paa and pah complex solutions while the fiber mats exhibited up to approximately 63 removal of the tested heavy metals pb cd and cu at ph 3 4 up to approximately 98 removal was observed at ph 7 4 from synthetic metal solutions confirming that higher ph facilitates more effective removal of pb cd and cu the presence of nom resulted in almost complete removal of all of the three metals at the higher ph 7 4 the removal of metal ions may be attributed to the dominance of carboxylate ions coo from the fiber mats leading to metal coo complexation the enhanced metal removal in the presence of nom is likely due to the higher availability of coo from nom the paa pah complex fiber mats tested in this study can be applied in heavy metal removal during drinking water production or wastewater treatment not only as pretreatment media but also as a component of hybrid membrane processes or may serve as nanoreactors where various nanoparticles can be immobilized 40 the fiber mats may be regenerated using acid and reused for several cycles to optimize process costs 46 our future work will focus on evaluating the application of the paa pah complex fiber mats as commercial membrane modifiers aimed at improving the membrane efficiency in removing heavy metals

13887,this study investigated the removal of heavy metals from water using electrospun polyelectrolyte pe complex fibers of polyacrylic acid paa and polyallylamine hydrochloride pah pe fiber mats were fabricated under various electrospinning operating conditions to optimize fiber size and stability in aqueous solution the stable fiber mats were evaluated for their efficiency in removing heavy metals in synthetic metal solutions the effect of water matrix on heavy metal removal using the paa pah fiber mats was probed by comparing metal removals in the presence and absence of natural organic matter nom the fiber mats exhibited approximately 63 42 and 21 removals of lead pb cadmium cd and copper cu respectively in synthetic metal solutions at ph 3 4 furthermore approximately 70 98 and 92 removals of pb cd and cu respectively were observed at a higher ph 7 4 the heavy metal removal by the paa pah complex fiber mats may be attributed to the association of the metal ions with carboxylate ions from the fibers the presence of nom in the metal spiked solutions resulted in higher removal of metals by the fiber mats this can be attributed to the availability of nom derived carboxylic acid groups which resulted in increased metal carboxylate complexations this study implies that water matrix plays an important role that must be evaluated when removing metals using pe complex fibers keywords electrospinning polyelectrolyte fiber mats heavy metals polyacrylic acid polyallylamine hydrochloride 1 introduction heavy metals are used in manufacturing various consumer and industrial products 1 and various activities such as mining smelting and metal plating contribute to metal pollution 2 3 in addition heavy metals such as pb cu cd ni hg and sb present in electronic wastes e wastes 4 may end up in both water and soil due to the undisciplined processing of e wastes 5 heavy metals in the biosolids generated from the wastewater treatment plants become concentrated in the leachates that are generated in the landfills receiving those biosolids 1 the disposal of heavy metals in the environment can adversely impact the aquatic life 6 8 and alter the physiological and biochemical processes in plants 2 many metals have been reported to cause dna damage and conformational changes at high concentrations leading to cell cycle modulation carcinogenesis or apoptosis 9 several technologies including ion exchange chemical oxidation chemical precipitation and electro dialysis have been investigated to remove heavy metals from aqueous solutions 10 13 these technologies have demonstrated variable efficiencies in metal removal and the drawbacks associated with these technologies include high operation costs and the production of secondary contaminants alternatively biosorbents derived from various industrial byproducts and agricultural wastes 14 17 have shown promising metal removal efficiency with low operation cost but incurred high biological and chemical oxygen demands 18 membrane process can serve as effective barriers to recalcitrant organic and inorganic pollutants 19 21 however it is energy intensive and prone to fouling during long term operation 22 polyelectrolytes pe have been widely investigated as heavy metal ion removal media because of their high local concentration of functional groups such as carboxylates as well as strong interactions of these functional groups with metal ions 23 26 pes are macromolecules containing ionizable repeating units e g carboxylate amine and sulfonate depending on the charges pes can be cationic anionic or non ionic a major limitation of using pes in many desired water treatment applications is their solubility in water however recent studies 27 28 have reported that pe fibers produced by electrospinning solutions of oppositely charged pes such as polyacrylic acid paa and polyallylamine hydrochloric acid pah or paa and chitosan cs exhibit excellent stability in aqueous solutions ultrathin fibers with diameters in micron and sub micron ranges can be generated by electrospinning by applying a high electrostatic field to a viscoelastic jet created from a solution of desired polymer s electrospinning has been extensively explored as a scalable approach to manufacturing functional fibers 29 offering great control over fiber microstructure and geometry cost and time and vast material selection and is well suited to scale up 30 31 due to their high porosity and aspect ratio large surface area surface charges and versatility to immobilize active nanoparticles the electrospun es fibers have demonstrated great potential in environmental remediations including decoloration of organic dyes 32 removal of various emerging contaminants 33 34 and treatment of oily wastewater 35 past studies 36 38 have investigated metal ion removal using es fibers in synthetic solutions however there is a lack of studies investigating the effect of water matrix and a very few studies 39 40 focused on the removal of heavy metals using es fibers produced from pe complexes specifically fiber mats produced via electrospinning of pe complex of paa and pah that have excellent stability in aqueous solutions 27 have not been tested for heavy metal removal from waters furthermore determining the effect of water matrix on metal ion removal using such complex fibers is essential when considering practical water treatment applications to address the above mentioned knowledge gap we aimed to determine the heavy metal removal capability of stable fiber mats fabricated through electrospinning of paa pah complex solution in environmentally relevant aqueous solutions we performed scanning electron microscopy sem to determine the effect of electrospinning operating conditions and paa pah ratios on the physical morphology of paa pah fiber mats we also evaluated aqueous stability of the fiber mats by exposing them to metal ion solutions we determined the adsorptive removal of three environmentally important heavy metals i e lead pb cadmium cd and copper cu by the paa pah fiber mats at different ph conditions the removal efficiencies of the paa pah fiber mats were evaluated by determining the metal concentrations remaining in the solution using flame atomic absorption spectroscopy faas and also by examining the adsorbed metals on the fiber mats using energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds the effect of water matrix on heavy metal removal using the paa pah fiber mats was probed by comparing metal removals in the presence and absence of natural organic matter nom mechanistic understanding of the nom metal fiber interaction was revealed through characterization of paa pah fiber mats and the metals and nom sorbed on to the mats using fourier transformed infrared ft ir spectroscopy 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials polyacrylic acid paa 25 wt solution in water approx m w 240 000 and polyallylamine hydrochloride pah powder approx

3 ml bd disposable syringes with luer lok tips fisher scientific pah and paa were mixed at different molar ratios using a magnetic stirrer 200 300 rpm for 10 min to reach a homogeneous solution at room temperature the solution was then transferred into the 3 ml plastic syringe attached to the needle for electrospinning fig 1 the feed pump rate and the applied electrical potential were fixed at 0 6 μl h and 8 8 0 2 kv respectively the working distance between the needle tip and the aluminum foil collector was set at 10 5 cm a parchment paper was taped onto the aluminum foil collector for easy collection and removal of the fiber mats during the thermal crosslinking the parchment paper crumbled in the oven allowing the mat to be lifted from the paper the fiber mats were peeled off from the collector and dried at 140 c for 6 h in order to crosslink the polymers 2 3 fiber characterization the pe fiber mats were examined under scanning electron microscopy sem using a zeiss ultra 55 feg sem the samples were sputter coated with a 10 nm thin film of gold palladium prior to sem analysis paa pah ratios of 4 1 and 8 1 were examined to determine the influence of relative polymer concentrations on the morphology of the fibers the adsorbents on the fibers were identified using the noran system 7 energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds equipped with a silicon drift x ray detector fiber mats were prepared for eds analysis by placing them for 2 h into individually spiked metal solutions of 100 ppm of pb cu or cd to distinguish the metal peaks that were not necessarily observed on all locations of the fibers uniformly during initial characterization the fiber mats were then dried at room temperature for 24 h fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy was employed to identify the chemical bonds or organic functional groups including amines carbohydrates and carboxylic acids humic substances 41 42 ft ir spectra were obtained using a shimadzu qatr s single reflection atr accessory with a diamond crystal 2 4 heavy metal removal the removal of heavy metals by stable pe fiber mats was evaluated by batch experiments 30 mg of fiber mats were submerged in to 100 ml of di water spiked with 2 ppm of each of pb cd and cu the solutions were left on a shaker 120 revolutions per min rpm for 120 min and then metal concentrations in the solutions were measured flame atomic absorption spectroscopy faas was conducted to measure metal concentrations in the solutions using a perkinelmer aanalyst 400 the effect of nom on metal removal by the fiber mats was investigated using di water spiked with suwannee river nom at 10 ppm and 20 ppm concentrations 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of electrospinning operating parameters and pe ratios on fiber size and stability stable pe fiber mats were produced from homogeneous polyacrylic acid paa polyallylamine hydrochloride pah complex solutions by dissolving pah into 25 paa aqueous solutions at 4 1 and 8 1 molar ratios of paa and pah the ph of the mixture was maintained at around 2 1 during the electrospinning process the impacts of electrospinning voltage and the distance between the needle and collecting pad i e the working distance on fabrication of the pe fibers were also examined to determine the optimal paa pah ratio and fiber size the free standing fibers and fiber mats were examined using sem as shown in fig 2 a and b the free standing fibers appear to remain unchanged at the two different applied voltages of 8 kv and 9 kv the fiber diameters ranging from approximately 600 nm 1500 nm appear to remain unchanged at the two electrospinning voltages applied as shown in fig 2 c and d varying the paa pah ratios did not result in any distinct difference in fiber diameter or shape the stability of the optimized fiber mats was evaluated by weighing the mass of fabricated fibers before and after mixing in metal ion solutions it was observed that the fibers were stable in the metal ion solutions and the weight difference before and after soaking the fibers in the metal ion solution was less than 6 3 2 heavy metal removal batch experiments were conducted following the protocol discussed in the materials and methods section to determine the adsorptive removal of selected heavy metals pb cd and cu from di water by the paa pah complex fiber mats with paa to pah ratio of 8 1 the experiments were carried out at two different ph values 3 4 and 7 4 which were continuously monitored and found to be unchanged over the experimental duration to probe the impact of ph on metal adsorption by the fibers at ph 3 4 the stabilized adsorptive removals of pb cd and cu by the fiber mats were approximately 63 42 and 21 respectively after 120 min of contact time fig 3 a while the adsorptive removal of cu equilibrates after around 10 min that for pb takes about 30 min the adsorption of cd however appears to continue beyond the experimental duration 120 min other studies 43 45 also reported lower removal of pb2 cu2 and cd2 by electrospun nanofibers at lower ph values 4 the adsorptive removals and capacity at equilibrium for all three metals increased at the higher ph 7 4 fig 3b at ph 7 4 the maximum adsorptive removals of pb cd and cu by the fiber mats reached to approximately 70 98 and 92 respectively the equilibrium was reached in between 80 100 min after 80 min for cu and cd and after 100 min for pb it is interesting to note that the initial adsorption of pb was lower at ph 7 4 compared to ph 3 4 until around 75 min but the adsorptive removal at equilibrium was approximately 7 higher at a higher ph fig 3b as explained further in section 3 4 using ft ir spectra the metal ion removal by the paa pah complex fiber mats may be attributed to the electrostatic interactions of the metal ions with carboxylate ions coo from the fibers the higher ph 7 4 facilitates the ionization of carboxylic acids cooh from the fiber mats into coo 44 resulting in enhanced metal association with the fibers the comparatively lower removal of pb2 at this ph could be due to its ionic radius which is larger than cu2 and cd2 46 resulting in less availability of coo for pb2 per unit surface area of the fibers when compared to cu2 and cd2 in the individually spiked metal solutions tested using electrospun nanofiber membrane of polyelectrolyte ethylene oxide peo chitosan aliabadi et al 46 showed less adsorption of pb2 compared to cd2 and cu2 by the nanofiber membranes which they suggested were due to the larger ionic radius of pb2 than cd2 and cu2 at ph 3 4 the carboxylate ions are deionized to cooh 44 and hence metal ion removal was likely governed by the complexation between the metals and cooh rather than due to electrostatic interactions as in the case of ph 7 4 bala et al 47 conducted a quantitative study to determine the binding strength of cooh with divalent metal ions and reported that pb2 always exhibits stronger binding with cooh than cd2 despite the smaller ionic radius of cd2 when compared to pb2 in the current study at ph 3 4 when the electrostatic interaction is not dominant which is the case of ph 7 4 instead pb2 binds stronger with cooh and exhibits higher removal efficiency than cd2 and cu2 at ph 7 4 however the electrostatic interaction between the metal ions and coo plays a dominant role and pb2 removal efficiency becomes less compared to cd2 and cu2 as explained earlier the cu ion removal efficiency observed in the current study was comparable to that in a study conducted by xiao et al 40 who reported 91 stabilized removal of cu when using composite paa polyvinyl alcohol pva nanofibers however they conducted the experiments using a high concentration 50 mg l single metal ion cu ii solution and the influence of nom on cu removal was not verified in that study in the current study the influence of water matrix on heavy metal removal using the paa pah complex fiber mats was determined by comparing metal removals in the presence and absence of nom as discussed in the following section eds analysis was conducted to confirm the presence of metals on the fiber mats the eds spectra fig 4 show the presence of carbon oxygen nitrogen and sodium which signify the composition of the polymers that constitute the fiber mats fig 4 b c and d show the presence of pb cd and cu respectively on the fiber mats that were in contact with the respective metal solutions it should be noted that there were locations on the fibers where peaks were not observed indicating that metal adsorption on to the fibers was not probably uniform hence the local concentrations and availabilities of functional groups such as carboxylates may have influenced the metal fiber interactions and metal removal from water the disappearance of or decrease in na peaks for the fibers exposed to metal solutions when compared to the control fibers fig 4a could be due to that fact that the metal ions had replaced na of the na salt of paa when in solution the langmuir 48 and freundlich 49 isotherm models given by eq 1 and eq 2 respectively were used to verify if the adsorption of the tested metals by the paa pah complex fibers can be represented by these models 1 1 q e 1 q m 1 k l q m c e 2 log q e log k f 1 n log c e where qe is the equilibrium adsorbent phase fiber mats concentration of an adsorbate metal mmol g ce

for cu r2 0 974 and cd r2 0 904 when compared to the freundlich model table 1 implying the occurrence of monolayer adsorption of these metals by the paa pah fiber mats at ph 7 4 46 the maximum adsorbent phase saturated concentration of cu qm 0 481 mmol g was higher than that of cd qm 0 141 mmol g although using different electrospun nanofibers peo chitosan aliabadi et al 46 observed a better fit for both cu and cd using the langmuir model when compared to the freundlich model they also reported slightly higher maximum adsorption per unit weight for cu than that for cd in the current study pb adsorption by the paa pah fiber mats did not fit either the langmuir or the freundlich isotherms suggesting that further isotherm studies are required to identify a suitable model for metal adsorption by this specific blend of complex fibers 3 3 effect of nom on heavy metal removal by paa pah complex fiber mats the effect of nom on the removal of heavy metals by the electrospun stable paa pah complex fiber mats was evaluated at concentrations of 10 ppm and 20 ppm at ph 7 4 while the adsorptive removal of cd and cu was already very high 98 and 92 respectively in di water the presence of nom resulted in almost complete removal of all of the three metals at both the nom concentration levels tested fig 5 the removal of pb was approximately 30 higher in the nom spiked water when compared to the di water the enhanced removal of metal ions in the presence of nom can be attributed to the additional complexation due to the functional groups from nom 50 3 4 mechanism behind

1720 1706 cm 1 and 1250 1020 cm 1 correspond to carboxylic acid cooh and amine cn stretching groups respectively 52 peaks at around 1400 cm 1 and 1600 cm 1 indicate carboxylate ion coo and those at around 1650 cm 1 and 1550 cm 1 indicate amides 51 the amide peaks 1553 and at 1551 cm 1 confirm paa pah crosslinking via carboxylate groups of paa and ammonium groups of pah 53 while the cooh and coo peaks for all of the samples were observed at 1706 cm 1 and 1405 cm 1 respectively the fiber mats from the nom solutions showed higher intensities fig 6 indicating higher availability of cooh and coo in the presence of nom hence the removal of the tested metals by the fiber mats may be attributed to the association of the metal ions with coo 54 interestingly the paa pah functional groups as well as the nom functional groups were so dominant in this case that the shifts in peaks that one might expect due to new complexations were not distinctly identified in fig 6 a conceptual model

approximately 63 removal of the tested heavy metals pb cd and cu at ph 3 4 up to approximately 98 removal was observed at ph 7 4 from synthetic metal solutions confirming that higher ph facilitates more effective removal of pb cd and cu the presence of nom resulted in almost complete removal of all of the three metals at the higher ph 7 4 the removal of metal ions may be attributed to the dominance of carboxylate ions coo from the fiber mats leading to metal coo complexation the enhanced metal removal in the presence of nom is likely due to the higher availability of coo from nom the

13888,the application of microalgae in wastewater treatment is gaining increasing attention due to the possible environmental benefits of using photosynthetic organisms for bioremediation tannery wastewaters however may be inhibiting for microorganisms growth due to the presence of toxic compounds especially chromium in this work we assessed the possibility of combining the application of biochar as an adsorbent for metals including chromium with microalgae cultivation for tannery wastewater treatment two different types of biochar pinewood biochar pb and a commercial one cb were tested as a pretreatment step prior to cultivation of chlorella protothecoides the application of both types of biochar led to a significant increase in growth rates 61 and 126 for pb and cb respectively and nutrients removal compared to cultivation in raw wastewaters concerning the comparison between different biochars it resulted that biochar production process and its physiochemical characteristics strongly affect cr iii adsorption performances with cb removing 99 6 from a synthetic medium in 5 min compared to 83 4 of pb in 3 h cr iii adsorption on cb followed freundlich isotherm model the kinetics of adsorption was also addressed and pseudo second order kinetics was found to be the best fitted model for cr iii adsorption on cb when applied to real tannery effluents chromium adsorption performances were affected by the complexity of the medium keywords chlorella protothecoides chromium adsorption photosynthetic bioremediation slow pyrolisis 1 introduction the tanning industry is specialized in the production of a wide range of bovine leathers for the footwear furnishings clothing and leather goods industries the impacts of tannery wastes on health and on the environment is potentially dangerous and continuously growing tannery effluent contains large amounts of pollutants such as salt lime sludge sulfides and acids 1 secondary effluents from wastewater treatment plants also contain large quantities of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus which may cause eutrophication in lakes and disrupt the balance of the ecosystem 2 in addition water generated during this industrial process has a significant amount of heavy metals especially chromium which is harmful for living organisms 3 the water discharged from tannery industries needs a specific treatment conventional wastewater treatment typically includes primary and secondary treatment primary treatment comprises sulfide oxidation solids separation and chromium precipitation various physicochemical methods such as filtration precipitation or physico chemical coagulation have been used other methods for chromium removal or recovery from industrial effluent include advanced treatment such as membrane separation 4 advanced oxidation processes 5 and ion exchange 6 secondary treatment is usually accomplished by activated sludge systems 7 which is possible after a proper pretreatment however conventional systems based on activated sludge result in the generation of a considerable amount of sludge which requires treatment before final disposal 8 as an alternative to conventional technologies the integration of a microalgae bacteria based process within wastewater treatment plants seems very promising due to the ability of these microorganisms to reduce the concentration of inorganic nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus in a gas self sustaining system i e avoiding the aeration of the conventional biological process 9 another interesting advantage is related to the nitrogen exploitation that results in the accumulation of such a compound in the biomass according to a circular economy perspective microalgae were also found to reduce the concentration of dissolved heavy metals such as mercury cadmium and copper lead aluminum and chromium 3 the applicability of microalgae bacteria consortia in industrial wastewater is still under preliminary investigation several studies demonstrated the capability of microalgal species to survive in tannery wastewater tww 10 as an example da fontoura et al 2 showed that scenedesmus species is able to grow in tww with a biomass production of 1 72 g l 1 obtaining removals of about 95 of total nitrogen ammonium phosphorous and chemical oxygen demand cod generally phycoremediation has been evaluated by several researchers and different microalgae and cyanobacteria such as species of oscillatoria phormidium ulothrix chlamydomonas scenedesmus have been evaluated for their ability to grow in tannery effluent and accumulate chromium 11 14 thus microalgae can be an alternative in the tww treatment reducing the environmental impact caused by their pollutants converting these nutrients into biomass that can be availed in different applications e g biofuels 3 however one drawback of growing microalgae directly in tww is that the presence of some pollutants may inhibit the algal growth besides producing a biomass which in itself is rich in metals and may not be used in some specific commercial products this could however be mitigated by integrating a biochar filtration step prior to the algal cultivation system biochar is a carbon rich material characterized by high porosity with oxygen functional groups and aromatic surfaces it is obtained from the thermal degradation of wood residues green waste and agricultural remains its porous structure with high surface volume ratio and affinity for non polar substances e g polyaromatic hydrocarbons makes it a potential sorbent for organic pollutants and pesticides 15 16 in the last few years biochar produced via slow pyrolysis or hydrothermal carbonization has shown potential to remove salts and many metal contaminants from water 17 20 for example biochar obtained from hydrothermal carbonization treatment htcb of pinewood 17 and alkali activated biochar a htcb from switchgrass 19 can be used as alternatives to powdered activated carbon for the sorption of metal ions and heavy metals from water researchers have investigated cr vi removal potential of biochar derived from rice husk organic solid wastes and sewage sludge 21 as well as from herb residue 22 increased cr vi removal efficiency and stabilization by magnetic iron nanoparticles assisted biochar has been reported by zhu et al 23 however the majority of these studies focused on cr vi removal potential of biochar and only a few are available that involved the evaluation of cr iii removal potential which is a component of current concern in the environmental field in this work we carried out a preliminary assessment of an integrated process comprising biochar based filtration for secondary effluent tww and subsequent microalgae cultivation to our knowledge this is the first attempt of integrating biochar technology with microalgal application the latter often characterized by poor results when applied to industrial wastewater accordingly the novel solution could provide an opportunity to minimize inhibitory compounds in algae cultivation which could significantly enhance the algae productivity and biochemical composition so that the produced biomass could be exploited for broader applications the influence of biochar production process on trivalent chromium removal efficiency from tannery effluent was also evaluated by comparing the performances of biochar obtained using different pyrolysis temperature and feedstock adsorption isotherm and kinetic studies were carried out to increase the knowledge on adsorption of cr iii on biochar by deepening the influence of metal and adsorbent concentration ratios as well as the effect of operating variables 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental plan biochar application was tested to specifically remove chromium and other pollutants from tannery wastewater and to assess its possible use as a pretreatment for algal cultivation in tannery wastewater different sets of experiments were carried out and results are reported in the same order the first set of experiments was carried out to assess the applicability of a laboratory made pinewood biochar pb in real tannery wastewater as a pretreatment followed by the growth of the microalga chlorella protothecoides this algal species was cultivated in such pretreated wastewater as well as in a non treated sample as a control the aim of this section was to prove the applicability of biochar pretreatment to improve algal growth the second set of experiments was carried out to specifically test the adsorption potential of laboratory made pinewood biochar pb on cr iii adsorption in synthetic solutions the adsorption performances were also compared to those of a commercial biochar cb the adsorption equilibrium was also studied from a kinetic point of view the experimental conditions cr concentration biochar dosage and time intervals were chosen according to a literature review 24 25 the aim of this section was to provide information about the difference in absorption due to pyrolysis operating conditions finally the commercial biochar cb was tested as a pretreatment for microalgae cultivation in real tannery wastewater third experimental set and a comparison of the performances with those obtained in the first set of experiments was discussed for clarity the experiments are summarized in table 1 2 2 microalgae species and cultivation set up chlorella protothecoides 3380 sag goettingen which is a widely investigated algal species for wastewater treatment applications 14 26 was grown in tww to assess its nutrient uptake effectiveness in this medium c protothecoidesis is a facultative heterotrophic green alga that can survive in a wide variety of environments 27 axenic pre inocula were maintained in bg 11 cultivation medium in drechsel bottles under controlled temperature and light conditions the algae wastewater treatment tests see section 3 2 were performed in batch photobioreactors namely 50 mm diameter drechsel bottles with a total volume of 250 ml quickfit drechsel for a duration of five days starting from a microalgae concentration corresponding to an optical density od750 0 3 the temperature of the photobioreactors was kept constant at 24 c by placing the bottle inside a thermostatic incubator cultures were continuously mixed by means of a magnetic stirrer artificial light was supplied by means of a led panel warm white and the light intensity was regulated by varying the distance of the photobioreactor from the light source the photon flux μmol photons m 2 s 1 in terms photosynthetically active radiation par 400 700 nm was measured with a photoradiometer delta ohm hd 2101 1 and set at 100 μmol photons m 2 s 1 to avoid the growth of unwanted bacteria or microalgae strains lab environment contamination the photobioreactors and all the tools were sterilized in an autoclave for 20 min at 121 c whereas the tannery wastewater was not sterilized so to maintain the endogenous microflora naturally present and better exploit the co2 o2 gas exchange between algae and bacteria 28 for this reason no external supply of air and co2 was provided to the cultures all the growth experiments were performed with at least two biological replicates 2 3 tannery wastewater tannery wastewater was collected from the inlet of the industrial urban wastewater treatment plant of montebello vicentino vi italy which receives wastewater from the tanneries located in the industrial leather districts of montebello zermeghedo and montorso vicenza italy and urban influents coming from the same area such waste streams are then treated by conventional activated sludge where an efficient removal of cod and nitrogen is performed besides the other contaminants the issue of chromium removal is borderline and more research is needed to lower the concentration of such compound which despite being under the law limits should be reduced to contain the environmental impact the tww after primary sedimentation was collected and stored in 1 0 l bottles and preserved at 20 c to limit the growth of endogenous microflora and variation of pollutants concentration no sterilization was carried out on the medium the tww was characterized in terms of ph and nutrients content two different tww samples tww 1 and tww 2 respectively were collected from the treatment plant in two different moments which were used in the first and the third sets of experiments respectively see section 2 1 the analysis of these two samples highlighted a different composition which was due to the inevitable variability of the wastewater inlet composition to the plant the values measured are reported in table 2 for both samples total nitrogen tn values were comparable with ammonia concentrations suggesting that nitrogen is mainly present as ammonium in addition the tannery wastewater samples were analysed by icp oes analysis resulting in the metals composition reported in table 3 it should be noticed that most of the chromium present in wastewater was easily settleable so that the soluble fraction resulted in 1 55 0 10 ppm in terms of elemental chromium the chromium present in the water was mainly in the trivalent form the italian law limits d lgs 152 06 are 0 2 mg l 1 for hexavalent chromium thus we refer to total chromium but it can be reasonably assumed that the presence of hexavalent chromium is less than 0 2 mg l 1 as certified by the tannery companies which have also revamped their processes in the recent past to avoid the application of such a highly toxic compound 2 4 biochar production and characterization laboratory produced pinewood biochar pb was obtained via slow pyrolysis of pinewood branches using a parr reactor in laboratory set up 29 the biomass was dried in an electric oven at 105 c for 2 days the bark was removed and the branches were chopped into pieces 10 mm x 20 mm 50 g of the biomass were incubated in the reactor the chamber was purged with nitrogen n2 for 5 min the highest treatment temperature htt was 400 c for a 30 min retention time at ambient pressure the reactor was slowly cooled with internal water coil system the resulting biochar was collected and its yield resulted about 35 40 w w flash 2000 elemental analyzer was used to determine the carbon hydrogen and nitrogen content of the biochar sample for quantifying ash component approximately 0 5 g of dried sample was weighed into ceramic crucibles and incinerated overnight in a muffle furnace at 575 c fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir analysis was carried out infrared spectra 4000 400 cm 1 were recorded using bruker alpha platinum atr bet analysis was carried out using nova 2000e surface area and pore size analyser quantachrome instruments raw biochar samples were analysed for multipoint bet surface area using nitrogen as the adsorbing gas the analysis involved degassing the sample at 150 c for 4 h another type of biochar cb was commercially procured by new hampshire biochar the charcola group according to the manufacturer mixed feedstock of hardwood and softwood such as maple birch pine etc were used to produce this biochar at 500 c via slow pyrolysis method biochar was passed through 0 02 0 17 μm sieves prior to its use in the experiment 2 5 application of biochar as a pretreatment for microalgal cultivation in the first and third sets of experiments pb and cb respectively were used as preliminary filtration step before microalgae cultivation in real tww for each treatment the amount of biochar needed was powdered in a mortar grinder weighted and added to the tww the biochar was maintained in suspension placing the test tube on a laboratory orbital shaker after the treatment biochar was separated from the liquid phase by vacuum filtration using a paper filter with a pore diameter of 0 8 μm the filtrate was collected and analysed for biochar treatment experiments the volume used was about 100 ml for each single experiment 2 5 1 growth measurement microalgal bacterial growth was monitored daily from each wastewater treatment test optical density od was measured with a spectrophotometer spectronic unicam uv 500 uv vis uk at a wavelength of 750 nm total suspended solids tss concentration were measured as dry weight by filtering a fixed volume of sample using 0 45 μm whatman uk filters the pre weighed filters were dried for 2 h at 105 c as these analyses do not distinguish between microalgae or bacteria contributions c protothecoides growth was analysed by cell count with a bürker chamber to account for microalgae growth only specific growth rate μ of microalgae was obtained by the linearization of exponential data in semi logarithmic graph of cell concentration according to malthus model 1 ln c x c x i n μ t where c x is the biomass concentration c x i n is the initial concentration and t the time considered 2 5 2 analytical procedures to evaluate the tww treatment performances initial and final concentration of pollutants were measured for each test chemical oxygen demand cod orthophosphates p po4 ammonia n nh3 nitrites no2 and nitrates no3 concentrations were measured with a spectrophotometer based on colorimetric tests cod concentration was assessed by a colorimetric method based on the oxidation of organic and inorganic compounds by potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 in acid conditions in addition to the latter the reagent also contains sulfuric acid h2so4 which works as a catalyst and mercury sulphate hgso4 which prevents interferences due to the presence of chloride ions absorbance at 445 nm of a sample reacted for 2 h at 148 c were then obtained orthophosphates were analysed with the molybdate ascorbic acid method the colorimetric reaction took place between orthophosphate ions and molybdenum under reducing conditions resulting in a blue complex whose absorbance was measured at 705 nm after 10 min reaction at room temperature ammonia concentration was evaluated by measuring the absorbance at 445 nm of a sample reacted for 5 min at room temperature using a standard test kit hydrocheck spectratest id 6201 which involves a colorimetric reaction between ammonium ions and the nessler s solution nitrates were evaluated using standard test kits hydrocheck spectratest id 6227 according to the griess test and measuring the absorbance at 520 nm of the sample after 8 min reaction at room temperature nitrates analysis was carried out by measuring the absorbance at 445 nm of the sample reacted for 10 min at room temperature with a standardized volume of powder reagent available in a standard test kit hydrocheck spectratest id 6223 metals concentration was measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes ametek spectro genesis 2 6 batch adsorption experiments with biochar in the second set of experiments biochar adsorption performances were characterized in synthetic medium to better understand their trivalent chromium adsorption capabilities chromium nitrate nonahydrate nitric acid chromium salt chemical formula crn3o9 molecular weight 238 01 g mol 1 supplied by fisher scientific il usa were used for the synthetic medium the stock solutions of 1 g l cr iii were prepared by dissolving 4 577 g crn3o9 in 1 l di water all other chemicals used were of analytical reagent grade all experiments were carried out in two replicates 2 6 1 comparison between adsorption potential of cb and pb two reactors were set one having cb as adsorbent and another one with pb each reactor had a 125 ml volume of 3 mg l 1 cr iii solution i e 0 375 g cr iii in total with 5 g l 1 dosage of adsorbent the concentration of biochar was selected based on the survey of previous literature 24 25 30 all mixtures were shaken at 180 rpm samples were collected at 5 min 20 min 40 min 60 min 180 min and 25 h using pvdf filter 0 22 μm results will be presented in the results and discussion section control no biochar and blank no cr iii samples were simultaneously carried through with the adsorption samples 2 6 2 batch adsorption isotherm experiment to investigate the best fitted adsorption isotherm different reactors with 125 ml of cr iii solution having concentration starting from 1 mg l 1 to 20 mg l 1 with 0 5 g l 1 of biochar dosage at each were set all mixtures were shaken at 180 rpm after 50 min of adsorption equilibrium samples were collected passing through 0 22 μm filter all experiments were performed in duplicate the amount of cr iii removed by adsorption was calculated using the following equation 2 q e v c 0 c e m where qe is the amount of cr iii removed per gram of biochar c0 and ce are the initial and equilibrium cr iii concentrations mg l 1 in solution v is the solution volume l and m is the weight of biochar g adsorption isotherm can estimate the adsorption capacity and provide knowledge of the physicochemical phenomena involved in the process isotherm can describe the equilibrium relationship between adsorbate and the adsorbent surface langmuir freundlich temkin dubinin radushkevich d r bet adsorption isotherms are some of the commonly used ones in this study langmuir and freundlich isotherm models were tested to fit the data as they are the most commonly used to fit the isotherm

to the relative adsorption capacity of the adsorbent mg g mg l n 1 n is the heterogeneity factor which is related to the capacity and intensity of the adsorption and ce the equilibrium solution concentration of cr iii mg l a plot of log qe versus log ce will give a straight line with a slope of 1 n and intercept of log kf 2 6 3 batch adsorption equilibrium experiment batch kinetic experiments involved using three different biochar dose 0 5 g l 1 2 g l 1 and 5 g l 1 and initial cr iii concentration 20 mg l 1 3 mg l 1 and 1 mg l 1 experiments were carried out for 25 h and samples were collected at regular intervals after filtering through 0 22 μm filter both experiments had duplicate reactors for each sampling interval to investigate the possible adsorption mechanism and to analyse the rate of adsorption of cr iii on biochar pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models were applied to the adsorption data 2 7 statistical analysis t student tests were applied to ascertain meaningful differences in nutrient removal with respect to the initial concentration of the wastewater and in specific growth rates of c protothecoides with and without the biochar pretreatment the level of statistical significance was assumed for p 0 05 and significantly different results are highlighted with an asterisk in the figures p values are reported in the text when the corresponding results are discussed 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of biochar application on tannery wastewater and as a pretreatment for algae cultivation pinewood biochar pb was used to assess its possible exploitation as an adsorbent in tww for metals removal based on the results of a previous study reporting good performances in synthetic solutions 17 the effects of its application were evaluated by varying the operating conditions such as contact time and amount of biochar added the results showing the effect of contact time on relevant metals concentrations obtained using a biochar concentration of 5 g l 1 are reported in fig 1 it is seen that after 5 min of contact about 34 of the total chromium was removed by the biochar p 0 01 and that longer contact times did not result in improved performances fig 1a besides chromium other metals present in the tannery wastewaters were found to be affected by the treatment as reported in fig 1b metals such as ni were reduced by 60 p 0 009 which could be beneficial for the subsequent algal growth while k and p were found at slightly higher concentrations after biochar pretreatment additional experiments were carried out by changing the amount of biochar added to the wastewater ranging between 5 50 g l 1 figure s1 supplementary material no differences were found among the different treatments resulting in chromium removal values very close to the ones reported in fig 1 suggesting that a biochar concentration of 5 g l 1 was indeed sufficient and there could be some other limitation to a higher removal possibly related to the complexity of the wastewater see section 3 5 for detailed discussion the effect of ph was also assessed without significant total cr removal improvement in the range of viability of microalgae data not shown the residual chromium content in the water even if lower than the current law limit still represents an environmental issue in fact the concerns about the possible effects of releasing such amount of chromium into the environment has led to the resolution of strongly reduced law limits corresponding to 50 μg l 1 of total chromium and 10 μg l 1 of the hexavalent form for drinkable water dlgs 31 2001 https www camera it parlam leggi deleghe testi 01031dl htm thus new methodologies should be applied to accomplish these constraints starting from the reduction of environmental inputs of the metals in wastewater treatment facilities according to the perspective of applying biochar filtration as a first pretreatment for subsequent algal bacteria cultivation cod ammonium and nitrates concentration was also evaluated before and after the adsorption step fig 2 cod and ammonium were not affected by the treatment while a slight decrease of n no3 was observed at higher contact times however the concentration of n no3 was negligible compared to the ammonium form so that overall soluble nitrogen can be considered almost constant the only nutrient that was significantly affected was phosphorus whose concentration as reported in fig 1b was found increased after biochar treatment p 0 007 0 024 at different contact times this might indeed possibly have a beneficial effect on the subsequent microalgal growth this behaviour with respect to nutrients adsorption is in agreement with what reported by other researchers for example zhou et al 31 reported limited adsorption or even released no3 and p which is in agreement also with the findings of zhang et al 32 it is suggested that an electrostatic repulsion occurs between the negatively charged surface of biochar and negatively charged no3 and p ions which makes it difficult for these compounds to be adsorbed concerning organic compounds kwarciak kozłowska et al 33 found a cod adsorption percentage of 53 with a heavy metals adsorption rate up to 96 from landfill leachate a possible explanation for the reduced adsorption could be the high affinity of heavy metal ions to biochar compared to cod ammonium and nitrates in particular in this study pores might be quickly occupied by cr iii leaving no binding site available for other compounds overall it can be concluded that adsorption of dominant species compounds requires systematic analysis which will depend on the type of wastewater and origin of contaminants as well as on the characteristics of the specific biochar after characterizing the adsorption performances of pb on real tww its potential as pretreatment for microalgal cultivation was tested the microalgal species used was c protothecoides which was firstly cultivated in raw tannery wastewater fig 3 to assess the growth performances in this complex substrate the growth obtained in such medium 0 59 0 02 d 1 was significantly slower compared to the values that are typically reported for this microalgal species in standard synthetic media about 1 d 1 34 35 thus even though the species was able to grow in tannery wastewater as such some inhibition phenomena occurred interestingly a remarkable improvement of the growth rate was observed when microalgae were cultivated after the pre treatment of the tannery wastewater with biochar as shown in the same figures in fact the growth rate increased from 0 59 0 02 to 0 95 0 02 d 1 p 0 002 very close to the values reported for synthetic media this suggests that biochar filtration was effective in reducing the concentration of inhibitory compounds in industrial wastewater it is not clear yet which kind of molecules may have caused the inhibition of microalgal growth but the improvement in growth rate after biochar treatment is promising in view of a combined application for industrial wastewater treatment in addition to increased growth rate the biochar pre treatment allowed also to partially remove cr from the medium hence reducing the amount eventually uptaken by the microalgal biomass nutrients removal was also monitored fig 4 the application of biochar pre treatment resulted in a slightly increased biological removal especially for nitrogen which increased from 38 to 49 p 0 022 this was in agreement with the increased growth reported in fig 3 the initial concentration of about 3 mg l 1 of n no3 remained constant for all the treatments suggesting that no nitrification occurred cod and p removal were instead not significantly affected by the treatment however cod removal was also carried out by the endogenous bacteria while p removal was high in both cases 83 as microalgae are very efficient in uptaking this nutrient in a wide variety of environmental conditions 36 3 2 biochar characterization the importance of the biochar properties as reported in the previous section the pb biochar was effective as a pretreatment for algal cultivation but showed a reduced removal of metals in particular chromium even though previous studies showed an efficient removal of such a compound 17 it should be highlighted that the chromium present in tww is the trivalent one while usually the adsorption capability reported by other authors is related to the hexavalent species in this regard tan et al 37 reported that adsorption of cr iii is stronger compared to cr vi they suggested one of the reasons behind this phenomenon is the higher cation exchange properties of cr iii compared to cr vi of the ca and mg elements that are present in the biochar as cao and mgo forms some contribute in buffering the ph of the solution while another portion takes part in cation exchange with cr3 and h which are hence removed from the solution cr vi species are instead negative ions hcro4 and cro4 2 and as a result cannot take part in cation exchange they proved this hypothesis by observing a lower concentration of released ca2 at equilibrium with cr vi solutions compared to cr iii another reason could be related to cr oh 3 precipitation at higher ph whereas cr vi does not precipitate regardless of change of ph a possible explanation of reduced removal might be related to the complexity of the wastewater which contained a huge amount of organic compounds as well as other metals possibly causing a competition in the adsorption efficiency of the biochar to further investigate the possible reasons for reduced cr adsorption in real tannery wastewaters it was decided to carry out some additional tests at lab scale using a synthetic medium with dissolved cr iii salts see section 2 6 moreover to investigate whether the type of biochar and its physiochemical properties could be affecting the adsorption performances pb was compared to a commercial biochar cb having different characteristics in terms of raw materials and operating conditions used for their production the elemental composition and surface area of the two types of biochar is given in tables 4 and 5 a shows the ftir fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectra of cb the spectra demonstrate the presence of several oxygen containing functional groups in biochar the peaks that can be identified and designated were aromatic cc 1418 cm 1 aromatic carbonyl carboxyl co phenolic oh 1027 cm 1 and aromatic ch 872 cm 1 fig 5b shows the ftir spectra of pinewood biochar pb the peaks that can be identified and designated were aromatic cc 1585 cm 1 asymmetric stretching of coo 1429 cm 1 and peak at 1171 cm 1 can be corresponding to roh and phenol groups 3 3 adsorption kinetics fig 6 shows the comparative removal percentage of cr iii using cb and pb commercial biochar was able to remove 99 6 cr iii within 5 min p 0 22 whereas the laboratory made pinewood biochar showed 83 4 removal after 1500 min 3 h p 0 16 however after 25 h both of the biochar showed almost similar removal efficiency varying surface functionality carboxylic and other oxygen containing functional groups of biochar attributed from feedstock and pyrolysis temperature can play an important role in this regard further investigation of this phenomenon could be the scope of future work it was evident from these studies that cb was more efficient in removing cr iii compared to the pb which was utilized for the preliminary investigation li et al 38 proposed that five basic mechanisms are responsible for heavy metal adsorption on biochar such as complexation cation exchange precipitation electrostatic interactions and chemical reduction there is not much research conducted on adsorption of cr iii on biochar compared to cr vi however according to the limited studies available three basic mechanisms are suggested to be responsible for cr iii adsorption on biochar a complexation with oxygen containing functional groups b cation exchange and c electrostatic interaction between cr iii ions and biochar 39 higher o c ratio corresponds to the presence of native negative charge from oxygen functional groups 29 40 which can play an important role in creating complexation with positively charged metal ions 41 o c was slightly lower for pb compared to cb which can be related to the lower cr iii removal potential of the former compared to that of cb during the batch experiment it was observed that the solution ph having cb was slightly higher 8 38 compared to the solution ph having pb 7 18 this little increase could be due to the release of cao and mgo into the solution upon adding biochar which suggest that cation exchange could also play some role chen et al and qian et al observed a similar phenomenon in their studies 37 42 according to studies conducted by other researchers sorption of cr iii increases with increasing solution ph 30 43 lower solution ph indicates higher h concentration which can take part in creating electrostatic attraction of positively charged cr iii species with negatively charged biochar however in this study the presence of cb in solution inhibited the increase of solution ph beyond 7 8 38 which might rule out the possibility of sorption of cr iii through electrostatic interaction it is evident from this discussion that o c ratio and solution ph seem to have minimal effect in cr iii sorption in this study it can be concluded that the extremely high surface area of cb approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher i e 285 40 m2 g vs 2 10 m2 g governs the overall sorption capacity this variation happened mainly due to the difference in feedstock and pyrolysis temperature adopted in the production of biochar accordingly the following investigations were carried out with respect to the cb only onward a complete set of batch adsorption experiment was conducted to evaluate the best fitted adsorption model and kinetics the langmuir and freundlich isotherm models were used to investigate the sorption isotherms of cr iii adsorption see section 2 6 2 the langmuir isotherm model assumes that adsorbate molecules occupy only one active site on adsorbent surface it also assumes that maximum adsorption happens in monolayer form which means that molecules of adsorbate are adsorbed only on the free surface of adsorbent and there is no interaction between adsorbed molecules 44 on the other hand the freundlich model assumes that adsorption happens on a heterogeneous adsorbent surface by multilayer adsorption the isotherms derived from the langmuir and freundlich models for sorption of cr iii on cb are shown in figs 7 a and b respectively the parameters obtained from the langmuir and freundlich models are listed in table 5 the values of the correlation coefficients r2 for the langmuir model was 0 98 p 0 056 and for the freundlich model was 0 99 p 0 008 according to table 5 it can be said that the linear fits using the two equations were good for explaining the adsorption but the fit with freundlich isotherm model was relatively better this suggests that biochar surface has some heterogeneity and sorption happens in multilayer the n value n 2 7 indicates that adsorption of cr iii on biochar for this study is a physical process which is in agreement with other literatures 45 46 the effect of adsorbent dosage was also evaluated and the results for the cr iii uptake using various amounts of cb 0 5 2 and 5 g l are shown in fig 8 a the equilibrium cr iii uptake capacity qe was found to decrease 4 31 to 0 6 mg g with an increase in the dosage of the adsorbent on the other hand removal rate of cr iii increased from 71 77 to 100 with the increase of adsorbent dose p 0 004 this can be explained by the hypothesis that increased adsorbent dose provided increased number of available bonding sites for adsorption which in turn reduced the adsorption capacity per bonding site 19 accordingly the effect of initial chromium concentration was assessed and cr iii adsorption with varying cr iii concentration is presented in fig 8 b it is evident that the equilibrium adsorption capacity of cr iii on cb increased from 0 19 to 3 9 mg g with the increase of initial cr iii concentration p 0 003 this indicates that initial ion concentration plays an important role to overcome mass transfer resistance of metal ions between solid and liquid phase the change in equilibrium adsorption capacity with contact time was also studied at given different initial concentrations ranging from 1 to 20 mg l results are shown in fig 9 cr iii adsorption was rapid for the first 50 min and continued at a slower rate afterwards till it reached equilibrium p 0 004 0 011 at different initial concentration equilibrium adsorption capacity increased with the increase of initial cr iii concentration 3 4 kinetic model of adsorption of trivalent chromium by cb different kinetic models can be employed to investigate the rate control mechanism of cr iii adsorption on cb in this study pseudo first order and pseudo second order were evaluated the linear form of pseudo first order kinetic equation is 5 ln qe qt ln qe k1t the linear form of pseudo second order kinetic equation is 6 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e here qe is the amount of cr iii adsorbed onto the adsorbent at equilibrium mg g qt is the amount of cr iii adsorbed at any time t mg g and k1 min 1 and k2 are the rate constant of the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic adsorption respectively which can be calculated from the slope of the linear plot of ln qe qt and t qt vs t fig 10 represents the fit of pseudo second order kinetics models to the adsorption of cr iii by cb the calculated value of k1 k2 qe and their corresponding correlation coefficient values r2 are presented in table 6 r squared describes the proportion of the variation in the dependent variable explained by the independent variables whereas adjusted r squared explains the statistic based on the number of independent variables in the model for the best estimate of the linearity multiple regression analysis have been conducted and adjusted r2 values have been reported here the regression coefficients for the models show that pseudo second order kinetic model fitted best with adsorption data when pseudo first order kinetic equation was applied to describe cr iii adsorption the equilibrium adsorption capacity qe of cb were calculated to be 0 11 mg g for 20 mg l initial cr iii concentration and 0 033 mg g for 3 mg l initial cr iii concentration which were significantly lower than the experimental values of 3 90 mg g and 0 60 mg g respectively therefore the pseudo first order model is not applicable for cr iii adsorption on cb hence the kinetic adsorption data were further employed to pseudo second order kinetic model and it was found that this model predicted the values of equilibrium adsorption capacity as 4 mg g and 0 6 mg g for 20 mg l and 3 mg l initial cr iii concentration respectively which almost accurately match with the experimentally acquired values therefore it could be stated that chemisorption might be the rate limiting step of cr iii adsorption on cb it can also be shown that the values of k2 decreased with the increase of initial cr iii concentration this was because when initial concentration increases it takes longer time to reach equilibrium hence the rate constant decreases 3 5 application of cb as pretreatment for algal cultivation having verified that cb outperformed pb in terms of cr iii adsorption in synthetic waters its adsorption capabilities were tested on real tannery wastewater to assess its possible application as a pretreatment for algae cultivation in this case the tannery wastewater sample showed different characteristics compared to the previous one tww 2 were found particularly polluted with higher content of nutrients and metals compared to tww 1 as reported in table 2 and 3 generally it appeared that different metals were adsorbed from the tannery wastewater by the cb compared to pb see section 3 1 al as ni s na si were partially removed by the application of cb 10 g l 1 for 30 min as well as fe and ca which was removed as in the case of pb a slight increase of k and mg was observed but also a reduction of p which was not observed previously with pb no significant differences were instead found for the other metals analysed concerning chromium a removal from 2 14 mg l 1 to 1 2 mg l 1 was observed accounting for 44 reduction of the initial tww content this result is lower than that expected based on previous adsorption experiments carried out in synthetic medium which is certainly due to the complexity of the wastewater used in fact part of the cod was removed by the application of biochar suggesting competition of organic matter to the biochar adsorption capabilities on the other hand the application of biochar on tww 2 showed similar results on the cultivation of c protothecoides as reported in fig 11 it should be noticed that the higher pollution level of the tww 2 caused a strong reduction of the growth capabilities of microalgae in the raw wastewater with respect to that obtained in tww 1 with a growth rate of about 0 23 0 001 d 1 and cell death after 3 days on the opposite the application of biochar pretreatment showed an increase of the growth rate up to 0 52 0 06 d 1 p 0 024 suggesting that the application of biochar was beneficial even in highly polluted waters nutrients removal was affected by the different microalgae growth in the two cases as reported in supplementary materials figure s2 in particular cod removal did not change as a consequence of biochar pretreatment and was equal to 64 1 in both cases on the other hand n and p removal improved from 14 to 34 p 0 079 and from 73 to 88 p 0 046 respectively thanks to biochar pre treatment it should be noted that the n concentration in tww 2 was slightly higher than that of tww 1 in this case the beneficial effect of the biochar filtration pre treatment was even more evident due to the significantly higher pollution level of tww 2 which strongly hindered biomass growth the removal of nitrogen is also interesting as it is stored in the biomass and not lost in the atmosphere as in the case of conventional nitrification denitrification processes showing the potential of microalgae in a waste to product perspective in summary the results of this study show that a combined biochar microalgae process for tannery wastewater treatment might be promising in view of an industrial bioremediation approach by increasing algal growth while also reducing the amount of heavy metals in the biomass the quality of the influent tannery wastewaters as well as the characteristics of the biochar can have a strong impact on the overall performances so that further investigation is necessary to optimize the process the complexity of the tannery wastewater composition should also be considered as if the biochar is not specific enough for metal removal some competition for adsorption site may occur thus lowering the metals remediation 4 conclusions this work aimed at assessing whether the combination of a biochar filtration step followed by microalgal cultivation could result in a promising technology for treating industrial wastewaters from tanneries these wastewaters have a complex composition which may cause inhibition phenomena in microorganisms in our experiments microalgal bacteria consortia were found to be able to grow and partially remove nutrients from such a stream however growth was slower compared to those reported in standard media on the other hand the application of a biochar filtration step on the raw wastewaters resulted in improved growth by 61 and 126 for two different sets of experiments and nutrient removal for the microalgal species tested in addition it was found that if the target of biochar adsorption is trivalent chromium the biochar production process is the key for an efficient removal of this metal in fact a commercial biochar produced by slow pyrolysis of mixed feedstock at 500 c allowed achieving an almost total removal of chromium iii from synthetic water significantly higher than that obtained with the biochar produced in the lab by slow pyrolysis of pinewood at 400 c ultimately the pollution level of the tannery wastewater influences the performances of both the biochar adsorption and the microalgal cultivation steps nonetheless biochar pretreatment always resulted in improved microalgal growth and nutrients removal performances highlighting the potential of the combined treatment for tannery wastewater bioremediation economic feasibility of such adsorption process widely depends on the regeneration re use of the spent adsorbent a comprehensive desorption study would be an interesting scope for future work funding this research did not receive

13888,the application of microalgae in wastewater treatment is gaining increasing attention due to the possible environmental benefits of using photosynthetic organisms for bioremediation tannery wastewaters however may be inhibiting for microorganisms growth due to the presence of toxic compounds especially chromium in this work we assessed the possibility of combining the application of biochar as an adsorbent for metals including chromium with microalgae cultivation for tannery wastewater treatment two different types of biochar pinewood biochar pb and a commercial one cb were tested as a pretreatment step prior to cultivation of chlorella protothecoides the application of both types of biochar led to a significant increase in growth rates 61 and 126 for pb and cb respectively and nutrients removal compared to cultivation in raw wastewaters concerning the comparison between different biochars it resulted that biochar production process and its physiochemical characteristics strongly affect cr iii adsorption performances with cb removing 99 6 from a synthetic medium in 5 min compared to 83 4 of pb in 3 h cr iii adsorption on cb followed freundlich isotherm model the kinetics of adsorption was also addressed and pseudo second order kinetics was found to be the best fitted model for cr iii adsorption on cb when applied to real tannery effluents chromium adsorption performances were affected by the complexity of the medium keywords chlorella protothecoides chromium adsorption photosynthetic bioremediation slow pyrolisis 1 introduction the tanning industry is specialized in the production of a wide range of bovine leathers for the footwear furnishings clothing and leather goods industries the impacts of tannery wastes on health and on the environment is potentially dangerous and continuously growing tannery effluent contains large amounts of pollutants such as salt lime sludge sulfides and acids 1 secondary effluents from wastewater treatment plants also contain large quantities of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus which may cause eutrophication in lakes and disrupt the balance of the ecosystem 2 in addition water generated during this industrial process has a significant amount of heavy metals especially chromium which is harmful for living organisms 3 the water discharged from tannery industries needs a specific treatment conventional wastewater treatment typically includes primary and secondary treatment primary treatment comprises sulfide oxidation solids separation and chromium precipitation various physicochemical methods such as filtration precipitation or physico chemical coagulation have been used other methods for chromium removal or recovery from industrial effluent include advanced treatment such as membrane separation 4 advanced oxidation processes 5 and ion exchange 6 secondary treatment is usually accomplished by activated sludge systems 7 which is possible after a proper pretreatment however conventional systems based on activated sludge result in the generation of a considerable amount of sludge which requires treatment before final disposal 8 as an alternative to conventional technologies the integration of a microalgae bacteria based process within wastewater treatment plants seems very promising due to the ability of these microorganisms to reduce the concentration of inorganic nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus in a gas self sustaining system i e avoiding the aeration of the conventional biological process 9 another interesting advantage is related to the nitrogen exploitation that results in the accumulation of such a compound in the biomass according to a circular economy perspective microalgae were also found to reduce the concentration of dissolved heavy metals such as mercury cadmium and copper lead aluminum and chromium 3 the applicability of microalgae bacteria consortia in industrial wastewater is still under preliminary investigation several studies demonstrated the capability of microalgal species to survive in tannery wastewater tww 10 as an example da fontoura et al 2 showed that scenedesmus species is able to grow in tww with a biomass production of 1 72 g l 1 obtaining removals of about 95 of total nitrogen ammonium phosphorous and chemical oxygen demand cod generally phycoremediation has been evaluated by several researchers and different microalgae and cyanobacteria such as species of oscillatoria phormidium ulothrix chlamydomonas scenedesmus have been evaluated for their ability to grow in tannery effluent and accumulate chromium 11 14 thus microalgae can be an alternative in the tww treatment reducing the environmental impact caused by their pollutants converting these nutrients into biomass that can be availed in different applications e g biofuels 3 however one drawback of growing microalgae directly in tww is that the presence of some pollutants may inhibit the algal growth besides producing a biomass which in itself is rich in metals and may not be used in some specific commercial products this could however be mitigated by integrating a biochar filtration step prior to the algal cultivation system biochar is a carbon rich material characterized by high porosity with oxygen functional groups and aromatic surfaces it is obtained from the thermal degradation of wood residues green waste and agricultural remains its porous structure with high surface volume ratio and affinity for non polar substances e g polyaromatic hydrocarbons makes it a potential sorbent for organic pollutants and pesticides 15 16 in the last few years biochar produced via slow pyrolysis or hydrothermal carbonization has shown potential to remove salts and many metal contaminants from water 17 20 for example biochar obtained from hydrothermal carbonization treatment htcb of pinewood 17 and alkali activated biochar a htcb from switchgrass 19 can be used as alternatives to powdered activated carbon for the sorption of metal ions and heavy metals from water researchers have investigated cr vi removal potential of biochar derived from rice husk organic solid wastes and sewage sludge 21 as well as from herb residue 22 increased cr vi removal efficiency and stabilization by magnetic iron nanoparticles assisted biochar has been reported by zhu et al 23 however the majority of these studies focused on cr vi removal potential of biochar and only a few are available that involved the evaluation of cr iii removal potential which is a component of current concern in the environmental field in this work we carried out a preliminary assessment of an integrated process comprising biochar based filtration for secondary effluent tww and subsequent microalgae cultivation to our knowledge this is the first attempt of integrating biochar technology with microalgal application the latter often characterized by poor results when applied to industrial wastewater accordingly the novel solution could provide an opportunity to minimize inhibitory compounds in algae cultivation which could significantly enhance the algae productivity and biochemical composition so that the produced biomass could be exploited for broader applications the influence of biochar production process on trivalent chromium removal efficiency from tannery effluent was also evaluated by comparing the performances of biochar obtained using different pyrolysis temperature and feedstock adsorption isotherm and kinetic studies were carried out to increase the knowledge on adsorption of cr iii on biochar by deepening the influence of metal and adsorbent concentration ratios as well as the effect of operating variables 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental plan biochar application was tested to specifically remove chromium and other pollutants from tannery wastewater and to assess its possible use as a pretreatment for algal cultivation in tannery wastewater different sets of experiments were carried out and results are reported in the same order the first set of experiments was carried out to assess the applicability of a laboratory made pinewood biochar pb in real tannery wastewater as a pretreatment followed by the growth of the microalga chlorella protothecoides this algal species was cultivated in such pretreated wastewater as well as in a non treated sample as a control the aim of this section was to prove the applicability of biochar pretreatment to improve algal growth the second set of experiments was carried out to specifically test the adsorption potential of laboratory made pinewood biochar pb on cr iii adsorption in synthetic solutions the adsorption performances were also compared to those of a commercial biochar cb the adsorption equilibrium was also studied from a kinetic point of view the experimental conditions cr concentration biochar dosage and time intervals were chosen according to a literature review 24 25 the aim of this section was to provide information about the difference in absorption due to pyrolysis operating conditions finally the commercial biochar cb was tested as a pretreatment for microalgae cultivation in real tannery wastewater third experimental set and a comparison of the performances with those obtained in the first set of experiments was discussed for clarity the experiments are summarized in table 1 2 2 microalgae species and cultivation set up chlorella protothecoides 3380 sag goettingen which is a widely investigated algal species for wastewater treatment applications 14 26 was grown in tww to assess its nutrient uptake effectiveness in this medium c protothecoidesis is a facultative heterotrophic green alga that can survive in a wide variety of environments 27 axenic pre inocula were maintained in bg 11 cultivation medium in drechsel bottles under controlled temperature and light conditions the algae wastewater treatment tests see section 3 2 were performed in batch photobioreactors namely 50 mm diameter drechsel bottles with a total volume of 250 ml quickfit drechsel for a duration of five days starting from a microalgae concentration corresponding to an optical density od750 0 3 the temperature of the photobioreactors was kept constant at 24 c by placing the bottle inside a thermostatic incubator cultures were continuously mixed by means of a magnetic stirrer artificial light was supplied by means of a led panel warm white and the light intensity was regulated by varying the distance of the photobioreactor from the light source the photon flux μmol photons m 2 s 1 in terms photosynthetically active radiation par 400 700 nm was measured with a photoradiometer delta ohm hd 2101 1 and set at 100 μmol photons m 2 s 1 to avoid the growth of unwanted bacteria or microalgae strains lab environment contamination the photobioreactors and all the tools were sterilized in an autoclave for 20 min at 121 c whereas the tannery wastewater was not sterilized so to maintain the endogenous microflora naturally present and better exploit the co2 o2 gas exchange between algae and bacteria 28 for this reason no external supply of air and co2 was provided to the cultures all the growth experiments were performed with at least two biological replicates 2 3 tannery wastewater tannery wastewater was collected from the inlet of the industrial urban wastewater treatment plant of montebello vicentino vi italy which receives wastewater from the tanneries located in the industrial leather districts of montebello zermeghedo and montorso vicenza italy and urban influents coming from the same area such waste streams are then treated by conventional activated sludge where an efficient removal of cod and nitrogen is performed besides the other contaminants the issue of chromium removal is borderline and more research is needed to lower the concentration of such compound which despite being under the law limits should be reduced to contain the environmental impact the tww after primary sedimentation was collected and stored in 1 0 l bottles and preserved at 20 c to limit the growth of endogenous microflora and variation of pollutants concentration no sterilization was carried out on the medium the tww was characterized in terms of ph and nutrients content two different tww samples tww 1 and tww 2 respectively were collected from the treatment plant in two different moments which were used in the first and the third sets of experiments respectively see section 2 1 the analysis of these two samples highlighted a different composition which was due to the inevitable variability of the wastewater inlet composition to the plant the values measured are reported in table 2 for both samples total nitrogen tn values were comparable with ammonia concentrations suggesting that nitrogen is mainly present as ammonium in addition the tannery wastewater samples were analysed by icp oes analysis resulting in the metals composition reported in table 3 it should be noticed that most of the chromium present in wastewater was easily settleable so that the soluble fraction resulted in 1 55 0 10 ppm in terms of elemental chromium the chromium present in the water was mainly in the trivalent form the italian law limits d lgs 152 06 are 0 2 mg l 1 for hexavalent chromium thus we refer to total chromium but it can be reasonably assumed that the presence of hexavalent chromium is less than 0 2 mg l 1 as certified by the tannery companies which have also revamped their processes in the recent past to avoid the application of such a highly toxic compound 2 4 biochar production and characterization laboratory produced pinewood biochar pb was obtained via slow pyrolysis of pinewood branches using a parr reactor in laboratory set up 29 the biomass was dried in an electric oven at 105 c for 2 days the bark was removed and the branches were chopped into pieces 10 mm x 20 mm 50 g of the biomass were incubated in the reactor the chamber was purged with nitrogen n2 for 5 min the highest treatment temperature htt was 400 c for a 30 min retention time at ambient pressure the reactor was slowly cooled with internal water coil system the resulting biochar was collected and its yield resulted about 35 40 w w flash 2000 elemental analyzer was used to determine the carbon hydrogen and nitrogen content of the biochar sample for quantifying ash component approximately 0 5 g of dried sample was weighed into ceramic crucibles and incinerated overnight in a muffle furnace at 575 c fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir analysis was carried out infrared spectra 4000 400 cm 1 were recorded using bruker alpha platinum atr bet analysis was carried out using nova 2000e surface area and pore size analyser quantachrome instruments raw biochar samples were analysed for multipoint bet surface area using nitrogen as the adsorbing gas the analysis involved degassing the sample at 150 c for 4 h another type of biochar cb was commercially procured by new hampshire biochar the charcola group according to the manufacturer mixed feedstock of hardwood and softwood such as maple birch pine etc were used to produce this biochar at 500 c via slow pyrolysis method biochar was passed through 0 02 0 17 μm sieves prior to its use in the experiment 2 5 application of biochar as a pretreatment for microalgal cultivation in the first and third sets of experiments pb and cb respectively were used as preliminary filtration step before microalgae cultivation in real tww for each treatment the amount of biochar needed was powdered in a mortar grinder weighted and added to the tww the biochar was maintained in suspension placing the test tube on a laboratory orbital shaker after the treatment biochar was separated from the liquid phase by vacuum filtration using a paper filter with a pore diameter of 0 8 μm the filtrate was collected and analysed for biochar treatment experiments the volume used was about 100 ml for each single experiment 2 5 1 growth measurement microalgal bacterial growth was monitored daily from each wastewater treatment test optical density od was measured with a spectrophotometer spectronic unicam uv 500 uv vis uk at a wavelength of 750 nm total suspended solids tss concentration were measured as dry weight by filtering a fixed volume of sample using 0 45 μm whatman uk filters the pre weighed filters were dried for 2 h at 105 c as these analyses do not distinguish between microalgae or bacteria contributions c protothecoides growth was analysed by cell count with a bürker chamber to account for microalgae growth only specific growth rate μ of microalgae was obtained by the linearization of exponential data in semi logarithmic graph of cell concentration according to malthus model 1 ln c x c x i n μ t where c x is the biomass concentration c x i n is the initial concentration and t the time considered 2 5 2 analytical procedures to evaluate the tww treatment performances initial and final concentration of pollutants were measured for each test chemical oxygen demand cod orthophosphates p po4 ammonia n nh3 nitrites no2 and nitrates no3 concentrations were measured with a spectrophotometer based on colorimetric tests cod concentration was assessed by a colorimetric method based on the oxidation of organic and inorganic compounds by potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 in acid conditions in addition to the latter the reagent also contains sulfuric acid h2so4 which works as a catalyst and mercury sulphate hgso4 which prevents interferences due to the presence of chloride ions absorbance at 445 nm of a sample reacted for 2 h at 148 c were then obtained orthophosphates were analysed with the molybdate ascorbic acid method the colorimetric reaction took place between orthophosphate ions and molybdenum under reducing conditions resulting in a blue complex whose absorbance was measured at 705 nm after 10 min reaction at room temperature ammonia concentration was evaluated by measuring the absorbance at 445 nm of a sample reacted for 5 min at room temperature using a standard test kit hydrocheck spectratest id 6201 which involves a colorimetric reaction between ammonium ions and the nessler s solution nitrates were evaluated using standard test kits hydrocheck spectratest id 6227 according to the griess test and measuring the absorbance at 520 nm of the sample after 8 min reaction at room temperature nitrates analysis was carried out by measuring the absorbance at 445 nm of the sample reacted for 10 min at room temperature with a standardized volume of powder reagent available in a standard test kit hydrocheck spectratest id 6223 metals concentration was measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes ametek spectro genesis 2 6 batch adsorption experiments with biochar in the second set of experiments biochar adsorption performances were characterized in synthetic medium to better understand their trivalent chromium adsorption capabilities chromium nitrate nonahydrate nitric acid chromium salt chemical formula crn3o9 molecular weight 238 01 g mol 1 supplied by fisher scientific il usa were used for the synthetic medium the stock solutions of 1 g l cr iii were prepared by dissolving 4 577 g crn3o9 in 1 l di water all other chemicals used were of analytical reagent grade all experiments were carried out in two replicates 2 6 1 comparison between adsorption potential of cb and pb two reactors were set one having cb as adsorbent and another one with pb each reactor had a 125 ml volume of 3 mg l 1 cr iii solution i e 0 375 g cr iii in total with 5 g l 1 dosage of adsorbent the concentration of biochar was selected based on the survey of previous literature 24 25 30 all mixtures were shaken at 180 rpm samples were collected at 5 min 20 min 40 min 60 min 180 min and 25 h using pvdf filter 0 22 μm results will be presented in the results and discussion section control no biochar and blank no cr iii samples were simultaneously carried through with the adsorption samples 2 6 2 batch adsorption isotherm experiment to investigate the best fitted adsorption isotherm different reactors with 125 ml of cr iii solution having concentration starting from 1 mg l 1 to 20 mg l 1 with 0 5 g l 1 of biochar dosage at each were set all mixtures were shaken at 180 rpm after 50 min of adsorption equilibrium samples were collected passing through 0 22 μm filter all experiments were performed in duplicate the amount of cr iii removed by adsorption was calculated using the following equation 2 q e v c 0 c e m where qe is the amount of cr iii removed per gram of biochar c0 and ce are the initial and equilibrium cr iii concentrations mg l 1 in solution v is the solution volume l and m is the weight of biochar g adsorption isotherm can estimate the adsorption capacity and provide knowledge of the physicochemical phenomena involved in the process isotherm can describe the equilibrium relationship between adsorbate and the adsorbent surface langmuir freundlich temkin dubinin radushkevich d r bet adsorption isotherms are some of the commonly used ones in this study langmuir and freundlich isotherm models were tested to fit the data as they are the most commonly used to fit the isotherm

experiments involved using three different biochar dose 0 5 g l 1 2 g l 1 and 5 g l 1 and initial cr iii concentration 20 mg l 1 3 mg l 1 and 1 mg l 1 experiments were carried out for 25 h and samples were collected at regular intervals after filtering through 0 22 μm filter both experiments had duplicate reactors for each sampling interval to investigate the possible adsorption mechanism and to analyse the rate of adsorption of cr iii on biochar pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models were applied to the adsorption data 2 7 statistical analysis t student tests were applied to ascertain meaningful differences in nutrient removal with respect to the initial concentration of the wastewater and in specific growth rates of c protothecoides with and without the biochar pretreatment the level of statistical significance was assumed for p 0 05 and significantly different results are highlighted with an asterisk in the figures p values are reported in the text when the corresponding results are discussed 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of biochar application on tannery wastewater and as a pretreatment for algae cultivation pinewood biochar pb was used to assess its possible exploitation as an adsorbent in tww for metals removal based on the results of a previous study reporting good performances in synthetic solutions 17 the effects of its application were evaluated by varying the operating conditions such as contact time and amount of biochar added the results showing the effect of contact time on relevant metals concentrations obtained using a biochar concentration of 5 g l 1 are reported in fig 1 it is seen that after 5 min of contact about 34 of the total chromium was removed by the biochar p 0 01 and that longer contact times did not result in improved performances fig 1a besides chromium other metals present in the tannery wastewaters were found to be affected by the treatment as reported in fig 1b metals such as ni were reduced by 60 p 0 009 which could be beneficial for the subsequent algal growth while k and p were found at slightly higher concentrations after biochar pretreatment additional experiments were carried out by changing the amount of biochar added to the wastewater ranging between 5 50 g l 1 figure s1 supplementary material no differences were found among the different treatments resulting in chromium removal values very close to the ones reported in fig 1 suggesting that a biochar concentration of 5 g l 1 was indeed sufficient and there could be some other limitation to a higher removal possibly related to the complexity of the wastewater see section 3 5 for detailed discussion the effect of ph was also assessed without significant total cr removal improvement in the range of viability of microalgae data not shown the residual chromium content in the water even if lower than the current law limit still represents an environmental issue in fact the concerns about the possible effects of releasing such amount of chromium into the environment has led to the resolution of strongly reduced law limits corresponding to 50 μg l 1 of total chromium and 10 μg l 1 of the hexavalent form for drinkable water dlgs 31 2001 https www camera it parlam leggi deleghe testi 01031dl htm thus new methodologies should be applied to accomplish these constraints starting from the reduction of environmental inputs of the metals in wastewater treatment facilities according to the perspective of applying biochar filtration as a first pretreatment for subsequent algal bacteria cultivation cod ammonium and nitrates concentration was also evaluated before and after the adsorption step fig 2 cod and ammonium were not affected by the treatment while a slight decrease of n no3 was observed at higher contact times however the concentration of n no3 was negligible compared to the ammonium form so that overall soluble nitrogen can be considered almost constant the only nutrient that was significantly affected was phosphorus whose concentration as reported in fig 1b was found increased after biochar treatment p 0 007 0 024 at different contact times this might indeed possibly have a beneficial effect on the subsequent microalgal growth this behaviour with respect to nutrients adsorption is in agreement with what reported by other researchers for example zhou et al 31 reported limited adsorption or even released no3 and p which is in agreement also with the findings of zhang et al 32 it is suggested that an electrostatic repulsion occurs between the negatively charged surface of biochar and negatively charged no3 and p ions which makes it difficult for these compounds to be adsorbed concerning organic compounds kwarciak kozłowska et al 33 found a cod adsorption percentage of 53 with a heavy metals adsorption rate up to 96 from landfill leachate a possible explanation for the reduced adsorption could be the high affinity of heavy metal ions to biochar compared to cod ammonium and nitrates in particular in this study pores might be quickly occupied by cr iii leaving no binding site available for other compounds overall it can be concluded that adsorption of dominant species compounds requires systematic analysis which will depend on the type of wastewater and origin of contaminants as well as on the characteristics of the specific biochar after characterizing the adsorption performances of pb on real tww its potential as pretreatment for microalgal cultivation was tested the microalgal species used was c protothecoides which was firstly cultivated in raw tannery wastewater fig 3 to assess the growth performances in this complex substrate the growth obtained in such medium 0 59 0 02 d 1 was significantly slower compared to the values that are typically reported for this microalgal species in standard synthetic media about 1 d 1 34 35 thus even though the species was able to grow in tannery wastewater as such some inhibition phenomena occurred interestingly a remarkable improvement of the growth rate was observed when microalgae were cultivated after the pre treatment of the tannery wastewater with biochar as shown in the same figures in fact the growth rate increased from 0 59 0 02 to 0 95 0 02 d 1 p 0 002 very close to the values reported for synthetic media this suggests that biochar filtration was effective in reducing the concentration of inhibitory compounds in industrial wastewater it is not clear yet which kind of molecules may have caused the inhibition of microalgal growth but the improvement in growth rate after biochar treatment is promising in view of a combined application for industrial wastewater treatment in addition to increased growth rate the biochar pre treatment allowed also to partially remove cr from the medium hence reducing the amount eventually uptaken by the microalgal biomass nutrients removal was also monitored fig 4 the application of biochar pre treatment resulted in a slightly increased biological removal especially for nitrogen which increased from 38 to 49 p 0 022 this was in agreement with the increased growth reported in fig 3 the initial concentration of about 3 mg l 1 of n no3 remained constant for all the treatments suggesting that no nitrification occurred cod and p removal were instead not significantly affected by the treatment however cod removal was also carried out by the endogenous bacteria while p removal was high in both cases 83 as microalgae are very efficient in uptaking this nutrient in a wide variety of environmental conditions 36 3 2 biochar characterization the importance of the biochar properties as reported in the previous section the pb biochar was effective as a pretreatment for algal cultivation but showed a reduced removal of metals in particular chromium even though previous studies showed an efficient removal of such a compound 17 it should be highlighted that the chromium present in tww is the trivalent one while usually the adsorption capability reported by other authors is related to the hexavalent species in this regard tan et al 37 reported that adsorption of cr iii is stronger compared to cr vi they suggested one of the reasons behind this phenomenon is the higher cation exchange properties of cr iii compared to cr vi of the ca and mg elements that are present in the biochar as cao and mgo forms some contribute in buffering the ph of the solution while another portion takes part in cation exchange with cr3 and h which are hence removed from the solution cr vi species are instead negative ions hcro4 and cro4 2 and as a result cannot take part in cation exchange they proved this hypothesis by observing a lower concentration of released ca2 at equilibrium with cr vi solutions compared to cr iii another reason could be related to cr oh 3 precipitation at higher ph whereas cr vi does not precipitate regardless of change of ph a possible explanation of reduced removal might be related to the complexity of the wastewater which contained a huge amount of organic compounds as well as other metals possibly causing a competition in the adsorption efficiency of the biochar to further investigate the possible reasons for reduced cr adsorption in real tannery wastewaters it was decided to carry out some additional tests at lab scale using a synthetic medium with dissolved cr iii salts see section 2 6 moreover to investigate whether the type of biochar and its physiochemical properties could be affecting the adsorption performances pb was compared to a commercial biochar cb having different characteristics in terms of raw materials and operating conditions used for their production the elemental composition and surface area of the two types of biochar is given in tables 4 and 5 a shows the ftir fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectra of cb the spectra demonstrate the presence of several oxygen containing functional groups in biochar the peaks that can be identified and designated were aromatic cc 1418 cm 1 aromatic carbonyl carboxyl co phenolic oh 1027 cm 1 and aromatic ch 872 cm 1 fig 5b shows the ftir spectra of pinewood biochar pb the peaks that can be identified and designated were aromatic cc 1585 cm 1 asymmetric stretching of coo 1429 cm 1 and peak at 1171 cm 1 can be corresponding to roh and phenol groups 3 3 adsorption kinetics fig 6 shows the comparative removal percentage of cr iii using cb and pb commercial biochar was able to remove 99 6 cr iii within 5 min p 0 22 whereas the laboratory made pinewood biochar showed 83 4 removal after 1500 min 3 h p 0 16 however after 25 h both of the biochar showed almost similar removal efficiency varying surface functionality carboxylic and other oxygen containing functional groups of biochar attributed from feedstock and pyrolysis temperature can play an important role in this regard further investigation of this phenomenon could be the scope of future work it was evident from these studies that cb was more efficient in removing cr iii compared to the pb which was utilized for the preliminary investigation li et al 38 proposed that five basic mechanisms are responsible for heavy metal adsorption on biochar such as complexation cation exchange precipitation electrostatic interactions and chemical reduction there is not much research conducted on adsorption of cr iii on biochar compared to cr vi however according to the limited studies available three basic mechanisms are suggested to be responsible for cr iii adsorption on biochar a complexation with oxygen containing functional groups b cation exchange and c electrostatic interaction between cr iii ions and biochar 39 higher o c ratio corresponds to the presence of native negative charge from oxygen functional groups 29 40 which can play an important role in creating complexation with positively charged metal ions 41 o c was slightly lower for pb compared to cb which can be related to the lower cr iii removal potential of the former compared to that of cb during the batch experiment it was observed that the solution ph having cb was slightly higher 8 38 compared to the solution ph having pb 7 18 this little increase could be due to the release of cao and mgo into the solution upon adding biochar which suggest that cation exchange could also play some role chen et al and qian et al observed a similar phenomenon in their studies 37 42 according to studies conducted by other researchers sorption of cr iii increases with increasing solution ph 30 43 lower solution ph indicates higher h concentration which can take part in creating electrostatic attraction of positively charged cr iii species with negatively charged biochar however in this study the presence of cb in solution inhibited the increase of solution ph beyond 7 8 38 which might rule out the possibility of sorption of cr iii through electrostatic interaction it is evident from this discussion that o c ratio and solution ph seem to have minimal effect in cr iii sorption in this study it can be concluded that the extremely high surface area of cb approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher i e 285 40 m2 g vs 2 10 m2 g governs the overall sorption capacity this variation happened mainly due to the difference in feedstock and pyrolysis temperature adopted in the production of biochar accordingly the following investigations were carried out with respect to the cb only onward a complete set of batch adsorption experiment was conducted to evaluate the best fitted adsorption model and kinetics the langmuir and freundlich isotherm models were used to investigate the sorption isotherms of cr iii adsorption see section 2 6 2 the langmuir isotherm model assumes that adsorbate molecules occupy only one active site on adsorbent surface it also assumes that maximum adsorption happens in monolayer form which means that molecules of adsorbate are adsorbed only on the free surface of adsorbent and there is no interaction between adsorbed molecules 44 on the other hand the freundlich model assumes that adsorption happens on a heterogeneous adsorbent surface by multilayer adsorption the isotherms derived from the langmuir and freundlich models for sorption of cr iii on cb are shown in figs 7 a and b respectively the parameters obtained from the langmuir and freundlich models are listed in table 5 the values of the correlation coefficients r2 for the langmuir model was 0 98 p 0 056 and for the freundlich model was 0 99 p 0 008 according to table 5 it can be said that the linear fits using the two equations were good for explaining the adsorption but the fit with freundlich isotherm model was relatively better this suggests that biochar surface has some heterogeneity and sorption happens in multilayer the n value n 2 7 indicates that adsorption of cr iii on biochar for this study is a physical process which is in agreement with other literatures 45 46 the effect of adsorbent dosage was also evaluated and the results for the cr iii uptake using various amounts of cb 0 5 2 and 5 g l are shown in fig 8 a the equilibrium cr iii uptake capacity qe was found to decrease 4 31 to 0 6 mg g with an increase in the dosage of the adsorbent on the other hand removal rate of cr iii increased from 71 77 to 100 with the increase of adsorbent dose p 0 004 this can be explained by the hypothesis that increased adsorbent dose provided increased number of available bonding sites for adsorption which in turn reduced the adsorption capacity per bonding site 19 accordingly the effect of initial chromium concentration was assessed and cr iii adsorption with varying cr iii concentration is presented in fig 8 b it is evident that the equilibrium adsorption capacity of cr iii on cb increased from 0 19 to 3 9 mg g with the increase of initial cr iii concentration p 0 003 this indicates that initial ion concentration plays an important role to overcome mass transfer resistance of metal ions between solid and liquid phase the change in equilibrium adsorption capacity with contact time was also studied at given different initial concentrations ranging from 1 to 20 mg l results are shown in fig 9 cr iii adsorption was rapid for the first 50 min and continued at a slower rate afterwards till it reached equilibrium p 0 004 0 011 at different initial concentration equilibrium adsorption capacity increased with the increase of initial cr iii concentration 3 4 kinetic model of adsorption of trivalent chromium by cb different kinetic models can be employed to investigate the rate control mechanism of cr iii adsorption on cb in this study pseudo first order and pseudo second order were evaluated the linear form of pseudo first order kinetic equation is 5 ln qe qt ln qe k1t the linear form of pseudo second order kinetic equation is 6 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e here qe is the amount of cr iii adsorbed onto the adsorbent at equilibrium mg g qt is the amount of cr iii adsorbed at any time t mg g and k1 min 1 and k2 are the rate constant of the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic adsorption respectively which can be calculated from the slope of the linear plot of ln qe qt and t qt vs t fig 10 represents the fit of pseudo second order kinetics models to the adsorption of cr iii by cb the calculated value of k1 k2 qe and their corresponding correlation coefficient values r2 are presented in table 6 r squared describes the proportion of the variation in the dependent variable explained by the independent variables whereas adjusted r squared explains the statistic based on the number of independent variables in the model for the best estimate of the linearity multiple regression analysis have been conducted and adjusted r2 values have been reported here the regression coefficients for the models show that pseudo second order kinetic model fitted best with adsorption data when pseudo first order kinetic equation was applied to describe cr iii adsorption the equilibrium adsorption capacity qe of cb were calculated to be 0 11 mg g for 20 mg l initial cr iii concentration and 0 033 mg g for 3 mg l initial cr iii concentration which were significantly lower than the experimental values of 3 90 mg g and 0 60 mg g respectively therefore the pseudo first order model is not applicable for cr iii adsorption on cb hence the kinetic adsorption data were further employed to pseudo second order kinetic model and it was found that this model predicted the values of equilibrium adsorption capacity as 4 mg g and 0 6 mg g for 20 mg l and 3 mg l initial cr iii concentration respectively which almost accurately match with the experimentally acquired values therefore it could be stated that chemisorption might be the rate limiting step of cr iii adsorption on cb it can also be shown that the values of k2 decreased with the increase of initial cr iii concentration this was because when initial concentration increases it takes longer time to reach equilibrium hence the rate constant decreases 3 5 application of cb as pretreatment for algal cultivation having verified that cb outperformed pb in terms of cr iii adsorption in synthetic waters its adsorption capabilities were tested on real tannery wastewater to assess its possible application as a pretreatment for algae cultivation in this case the tannery wastewater sample showed different characteristics compared to the previous one tww 2 were found particularly polluted with higher content of nutrients and metals compared to tww 1 as reported in table 2 and 3 generally it appeared that different metals were adsorbed from the tannery wastewater by the cb compared to pb see section 3 1 al as ni s na si were partially removed by the application of cb 10 g l 1 for 30 min as well as fe and ca which was removed as in the case of pb a slight increase of k and mg was observed but also a reduction of p which was not observed previously with pb no significant differences were instead found for the other metals analysed concerning chromium a removal from 2 14 mg l 1 to 1 2 mg l 1 was observed accounting for 44 reduction of the initial tww content this result is lower than that expected based on previous adsorption experiments carried out in synthetic medium which is certainly due to the complexity of the wastewater used in fact part of the cod was removed by the application of biochar suggesting competition of organic matter to the biochar adsorption capabilities on the other hand the application of biochar on tww 2 showed similar results on the cultivation of c protothecoides as reported in fig 11 it should be noticed that the higher pollution level of the tww 2 caused a strong reduction of the growth capabilities of microalgae in the raw wastewater with respect to that obtained in tww 1 with a growth rate of about 0 23 0 001 d 1 and cell death after 3 days on the opposite the application of biochar pretreatment showed an increase of the growth rate up to 0 52 0 06 d 1 p 0 024 suggesting that the application of biochar was beneficial even in highly polluted waters nutrients removal was affected by the different microalgae growth in the two cases as reported in supplementary materials figure s2 in particular cod removal did not change as a consequence of biochar pretreatment and was equal to 64 1 in both cases on the other hand n and p removal improved from 14 to 34 p 0 079 and from 73 to 88 p 0 046 respectively thanks to biochar pre treatment it should be noted that the n concentration in tww 2 was slightly higher than that of tww 1 in this case the beneficial effect of the biochar filtration pre treatment was even more evident due to the significantly higher pollution level of tww 2 which strongly hindered biomass growth the removal of nitrogen is also interesting as it is stored in the biomass and not lost in the atmosphere as in the case of conventional nitrification denitrification processes showing the potential of microalgae in a waste to product perspective in summary the results of this study show that a combined biochar microalgae process for tannery wastewater treatment might be promising in view of an industrial bioremediation approach by increasing algal growth while also reducing the amount of heavy metals in the biomass the quality of the influent tannery wastewaters as well as the characteristics of the biochar can have a strong impact on the overall performances so that further investigation is necessary to optimize the process the complexity of the tannery wastewater composition should also be considered as if the biochar is not specific enough for metal removal some competition for adsorption site may occur thus lowering the metals remediation 4 conclusions this work aimed at assessing whether the combination of a biochar filtration step followed by microalgal cultivation could result in a promising technology for treating industrial wastewaters from tanneries these wastewaters have a complex composition which may cause inhibition phenomena in microorganisms in our experiments microalgal bacteria consortia were found to be able to grow and partially remove nutrients from such a stream however growth was slower compared to those reported in standard media on the other hand the application of a biochar filtration step on the raw wastewaters resulted in improved growth by 61 and 126 for two different sets of experiments and nutrient removal for the microalgal species tested in addition it was found that if the target of biochar adsorption is trivalent chromium the biochar production process is the key for an efficient removal of this metal in fact a commercial biochar produced by slow pyrolysis of mixed feedstock at 500 c allowed achieving an almost total removal of chromium iii from synthetic water significantly higher than that obtained with the biochar produced in the lab by slow pyrolysis of pinewood at 400 c ultimately the pollution level of the tannery wastewater influences the performances of both the biochar adsorption and the microalgal cultivation steps nonetheless biochar pretreatment always resulted in improved microalgal growth and nutrients removal performances highlighting the potential of the combined treatment for tannery wastewater bioremediation economic feasibility of such adsorption process widely depends on the regeneration re use of the spent adsorbent a comprehensive desorption study would be an interesting scope for future work funding this research did not receive

13889,the study on the removal of rhodamine b under ultrasonic assisted oxidation or called as sonocatalytic oxidation using tin oxide immobilized onto montmorillonite sno2 mmt has been investigated a hydrothermal synthesis was used for preparing the immobilized sno2 nanoparticles into montmorillonite structure and the as synthesized material was characterized using x ray diffraction gas sorption analysis uv vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy uv vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy techniques the kinetics study of the sonocatalytic assisted oxidation was performed by the comparison with sno2 and mmt and in order to discover the kinetic characteristics of the sonocatalytic oxidation varied condition such as the effect of initial concentration of rhodamine b ph the addition of h2o2 were examined the proposed kinetic model revealed that the degradation obeys the apparent first order rate kinetics refer to the dependence of the kinetics reaction to the initial concentration rhodamine b and h2o2 concentration it is noted that the reaction fit with the langmuir and okitsu model suggesting that the sonocatalytic mechanism is influenced by active interface interaction for the cavitation and radical formation as the main operational parameters ph of the solution directly influences the initial rate of the reaction as the effect of zeta potential of the surface reusability study revealed that the catalyst maintains the stability until 3 cycles utilization with the maximum degradation efficiency of 100 under the condition of ultrasound frequency of 40 w 68 khz catalyst dose of 0 5 g l and reaction time of 2 h keywords advanced oxidation process clay modification dye degradation sonocatalytic degradation sno2 1 introduction wastewater containing dyes are usually found from some industries such as textiles printing and some home creative industries and often create severe environmental pollution the difficulties in dye removal of the wastewater sometimes leads for discharging non or not completely treated wastewater into environmental water bodies dyes are the most important class of synthetic organic compounds with some negative effects such as irritating properties carcinogenic and destroying aquatic environment 1 thus years of researches develop treatment methods that are more effective in eliminating dyes from the wastewater sustainable low cost and efficient are the essential properties of the technique for applicability in industries including small scale industries considering the persistence characteristics of dye compounds which generally consist of aromatic and stable organic compounds catalytic oxidation is still a powerful technique among some mentionable methods complete oxidation will give mineralization as the main route of the treatment without any further arrangements for the clean technology 2 3 the catalytic oxidation itself can be conducted under some intensification process such as electrocatalytic photocatalytic and ultrasound or commonly called as sonocatalytic technique the combination of procedure and catalyst activity plays an important role in the degradation mechanism and its efficiency 4 5 among various combinative processes the ultrasonic assisted degradation of organic compounds is a promising technique that was reported to be effective due to its simple equipment high efficiency stable operation safety and no secondary pollution 6 7 in such cases photocatalytic degradation over a kind of material nanomaterial showed higher effectiveness compared to the sonocatalytic process but it can also in reverse for the other cases the effectiveness of sonocatalytic and photocatalytic process for dye degradation depends on factors such as the photocatalyst catalyst dye irradiation time catalyst dosage ph etc some papers reported the higher degradation efficiency of sonocatalytic process rather than photocatalytic process for example the degradation of methylene blue over tio2 cnt catalysts and the degradation of reactive black with core shell nanocrystal 8 9 metal oxide semiconductors such as tio2 sno2 zno zro2 showed the activity for the sonocatalytic process refer to capability for electron promotion at the valence band ecb into the conduction band cb leaving a hole hvb and producing radicals for further oxidation process of organic compounds 10 11 particularly tin oxide sno2 is the potential candidate for semiconductor for use as catalysts due to its bandgap energy and less toxicity several researches explored the capability of sno2 in sonocatalysis and photo sonocataysis 12 13 however the stability of sno2 and low efficiency due to its large bandgap 3 6 ev and high recombination rate of electron hole pairs restricts the use of sno2 as an efficient sonocatalyst in order to recover these problems nanocomposites formation of sno2 has been attempted instead of its structural modification 12 previous researches reported the use of multi walled carbon nanotube mwct graphene zeolite and some porous solids for sonocatalytic and photocatalytic activity enhancement 14 15 previous research on cyproflaxine and methyl green degradation over sonocatalytic process conducted by tio2 montmorillonite suggested that montmorillonite structure provides effective surface and support for the tio2 as an active catalyst by high specific surface area 16 17 the resulting nanocomposites showed good capability to facilite the oxidation reduction mechanism by the semiconductor active site by providing adsorption desorption mechanism within these schemes immobilizations of sno2 into clay structure including bentonite or montmorillonite were reported as promising composites for catalytic oxidation reactions 18 to our knowledge the study on synthesis of sno2 montmorillonite for sonocatalytic application has not been reported refer to the potency of smectite clay modification this research attempted to prepare the composite of sno2 with montmorillonite furthermore called as sno2 mmt and studied its catalytic activity in sonocatalytic degradation of dye as a dye model rhodamine b rhb was chosen due to its abundantly used in some textile industries research highlights the use of hydrothermal technique as a different method with were reported from some previous research physicochemical characterization techniques consist of x ray diffraction xrd gas sorption analysis field emission scanning electron microscope energy dispersive x ray fesem eds and transmission electron microscopy tem were employed for the study further it was subjected toward sonocatalytic activity studies for the oxidation of rhb in varied condition 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials montmorillonite sample was collected from pacitan east java indonesia the sample was activated by refluxing in 2 m of sulfuric acid for 4 h followed by washing using water until the filtrate was neutral ph 6 7 sno2 mmt nanocomposite was prepared by mixing an aqueous suspension of montmorillonite 5 g in 250 ml with precursor solution made by mixing of stannic chloride solution with naoh at the sn oh molar ratio of 1 2 followed by stirring for 4 h the mixture of the suspension and precursor solution was made by setting 20 wt of sn percentage in the targeted composite the mixture was stirred magnetically for 4 h before then hydrothermally aged in autoclave at 150 c overnight the precipitate obtained was washed using 3 l of aquadest dried at 80 c for 24 h and calcined at 600 c for 2 h for comparative studies sno2 nanoparticles were also synthesized by the reaction between stannic chloride dihydrate and sodium hydroxide at the sn oh molar ratio of 1 2 in the aqueous solutions the mixture was stirred for 4 h at room temperature and the resulting precipitate was filtered washed and dried at 80 c for 24 h finally it was calcined at 600 c for 2 h 19 2 2 characterization characterization of the samples was employed by x ray diffraction analysis rigaku miniflex 600 tokyo japan ni filtered cu kα with the voltage of 40 kv and 20 ma current was utilized the surface profile consists of specific surface area pore volume and pore radius parameters were determined by n2 adsorption desorption experiment using nova 1200e gas sorption analyzer for each adsorption experiment liquid n2 at the temperature 77 k was utilized the specific surface area of materials was calculated based on brunair emmet teller bet method while the pore volume data was determined using barrett joyner and halenda bjh method ftir spectroscopy was carried out using perkin elmer atr singapore surface morphology was studied by using fesem taken on a jx jeol electron microscope the photoluminescence spectrum was recorded with fluorescence spectrophotometer jasco v760 tokyo japan 2 3 catalytic activity test sonocatalytic degradation of rb was employed by an ultrasonic probe with a frequency of 40 khz and ultrasonic power of 68 w delta dh68h taiwan for each experiment 0 5 g of the catalyst was added into 1 l of rhb solution and then the sonicator probe was immersed into the mixture the sampling was conducted at the interval of time by collecting the solution and centrifuged before analyzed using uv vis spectrophotometric method a calibration curve of rhodamine b at the desired concentration range was employed by measuring the absorbance at 554 nm using a hitachi u2080 uv vis spectrophotometer degradation efficiency de was calculated based on the change of rhb concentration before and after treatment using the following eq 1 1 d e c 0 c t c 0 x 100 identification on the presence of dye degradation was conducted by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lcms the specified operational condition consists of a mixture of methyl alcohol and water 50 50 v v as the mobile phase with the flow rate of 0 8 ml min 1 and the injection volume of 20 μl were applied on a hitachi lcms instrument ms analysis was performed on spray voltage of 3 5 kv capillary temperature 325 c capillary voltage 50 v tube lens 120 v and the detection of the mass range was ranging at 50 600 m z total organic carbon toc was measured by us environmental protection agency usepa method 415 3 reusability of the catalyst was tested after each recycling process the recycling was performed by filtering the catalyst after use washing using ethanol and dried at 200 c for 2 h 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical character of material the crystalline structures of sno2 mmt and sno2 mmt composites were confirmed by xrd patterns fig 1 the diffraction peaks at 26 9 37 9 39 58 and 51 9 of sno2 and sno2 mmt samples are found and correspond to 110 101 200 and 211 with the extension of peak at and 54 7 which corresponding to 002 planes of tetragonal rutile sno2 jcpds 41 1445 respectively meanwhile mmt presents the characteristic peaks at 5 55 19 7 27 7 35 5 and 54 6 as identification of 001 211 004 and 006 of montmorillonite structure the peak at 27 4 is the indication quartz q contained in the montmorillonite sample since the material is natural mineral which is available and inseparable with silica materials the 001 peak of montmorillonite at 5 55 m 001 represents the basal spacing d001 of 13 5 nm it is also concluded that the immobilization of sno2 is not representing the pillarization of sno2 into interlayer structure of mmt since the 001 peak is disappeared rather than shifted into a left side or indicating the increasing the basal spacing the pattern is similar with previous research on sno2 immobilization into bentonite 18 with the sn percentage ranging at 10 30 using debye scherrer equation eq 2 the crystallite size of sno2 nps on sno2 mmt surface is calculated to be 54 6 nm the presence of sno2 nps in the composite is also characterized by sem edx profile as well as tem profile figs 2 and 3 a relative rougher surface was expressed by sno2 mmt respect to the mmt s surface which implies a layered structure as surface characteristic of smectite clay refer to the surface profile of sno2 nps these rougher and irregular particles on surface are the identification of the supported sno2 based on eds spectra the sno2 content in the composite was calculated to be 21 8 wt table 1 which is slightly higher compared with targeted content 20 wt in addition tem profile of sno2 mmt fig 3 with hrtem profile inset presents the non homogeneous spherical particles of sno2 ranging at 40 60 nm in size meanwhile the sno2 nps shows the bigger particles in range the particle size range is fit with the crystallite size measured by xrd calculation to ensure the presence of sno2 interaction with the support xps analysis was conducted and the results are presented in fig 4 the survey scan spectrum depicted in fig 4a demonstrates the presence of si al fe sn o and na peaks confirming the main component of montmorillonite and the supported sno2 the deconvoluted o1 s spectrum fig 4b demonstrated the two peaks centered at 486 9 and 485 8 ev which belong to the sn4 o and sn2 o bonds this suggests that the partial transition of sn4 to sn2 occurred 20 21 the deconvolution of sn 3d spectrum shows two peaks at 530 3 and 531 7 ev fig 5 c which belong to the sno and oh bonds as the proof of sno2 structure in the composite furthermore fig 4c depicts two peaks of the sn 3d5 2 and sn 3d3 2 spin orbit at at 486 9 and 495 3 ev respectively it is also noted that the distance between the two peaks is 8 4 ev which confirms the formation of sn4 oxidation state in sno2 the change in surface profile from mmt into sno2 mmt is in line with the surface parameters listed in table 2 which are calculated from adsorption desorption isotherm fig 5 the sno2 immobilization affected to increase specific surface area of mmt from 76 m2 g to 128 m2 g corresponding with the increasing pore volume from 1 02 10 2 cc g to 1 90 10 2 cc g the parameters are higher compared with sno2 nps as an indication of the formation of porous structure on the surface which is important for heterogeneous catalysis mechanism to estimate the band gap energy of the composite uv drs analysis was performed fig 6 the diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples were evaluated using the tauc plot equation of the measured reflectance according to the following eq 2 2 αhν 2 a hν eg where α ν eg and a are the absorption coefficient light frequency bandgap energy and a constant respectively the band gap energy was obtained by extrapolating the linear portion of the α h ν 2 curve versus hν to zero and from this the estimated bandgap energies of the sno2 and sno2 mmt obtained from the tauc plot are 3 54 and 3 6 ev respectively the increasing eg of sno2 by supporting onto mmt suggesting the effect of smaller particle size which furthermore respect to the stabilization of the excited electron 3 2 catalytic activity of sno2 mmt kinetics of rhb sonocatalytic degradation over sno2 sno2 mmt and mmt is depicted at fig 7 the kinetic plots imply that both sno2 and sno2 mmt show the degradation activity as demonstrated by the decreasing rhb concentration effectively at time range of 0 120 min meanwhile mmt does not show significant effect to c co at the same time the data suggests that the presence of sno2 as catalyst active material plays role in the degradation mechanism at the meantime the slightly decreasing rhb concentration over mmt is occurred by adsorption mechanism even though in the system h2o2 was added but there is no significant change in rhb concentration the change in rhb concentration describes the presence of cavitation by the catalytic active sites from sno2 which produce efficient amount of hydroxyl radicals to degrade rhb the interaction among ultrasound and active site creates a hot spot and furthermore it generates strong oxidizing conditions by the interaction between radicals formed and the hydroxyl radicals h and oh coming from h2o2 as oxidant by following mechanism 14 22 sno2 e h e o2 o2 e oh oh h h2o oh oh o2 dye co2 h2o schematic representation of sonocatalytic mechanism is presented in fig 8 investigation on the kinetics of rhb degradation was studied by applying two kinetics equations pseudo first order kinetics and pseudo second order kinetics with following eq 3 4 3 l n c t c 0 k t 4 1 c t k t 1 c 0 and the calculated parameters are presented in table 3 from comparison on the use sno2 mmt and sno2 it is also notably concluded that the degradation efficiency initial rate and kinetics constant as shown by the slope of the plot over sno2 mmt are higher compared to sno2 table 3 the r2 parameters suggest that the data obeys pseudo first order kinetics since the r2 of pseudo first order kinetics model is higher than of pseudo second order kinetics model using the pseudo first order plot the apparent kinetics constant slope of the reaction over sno2 mmt and sno2 are 0 032 min and 0 020 min and are consequently comparable with the initial rate 0 60 mg l min and 0 38 mg l min respectively by using the consideration that sno2 is active site for degradation mechanism turnover number ton of the reaction was calculated based on the percentage of rhb degraded per mass of sno2 in the catalyst and the values are calculated to be 2 74 mg wt l and 0 38 mg wt l respectively the values demonstrate the relevance of sno2 supporting into mmt structure which possibly correlated with the preserved specific surface area of the composite form to enhance the efficiency by the participation of adsorption in the mechanism the data indicated that the kinetics rely on initial concentration of rb and it presumably that the surface interactive occurs at the bubble liquid interface at the interface spot amount of hydroxyl radicals can be denoted as in a constant amount so the equation of reaction rate 5 5 r k rhb oh which can be simplified expressed as 6 6 r kapp rhb with kapp k oh similar kinetics profile and possible mechanism was similar with sonocatalytic degradation of rhb by sno2 and tio2 reported by previous works 23 25 the identification of degradation mechanism in the sonocatalysis process was studied by lcms analysis giving the data presented at fig 9 the chromatograms of initial and treated solution for 30 and 60 min show the degradation as identified by some new peaks of treated solutions respect to the chromatogram of initial solution in addition the mass spectra of treated solution exhibit the fraction with m z of 362 274 228 216 172 168 148 122 104 90 76 and 74 as identification of degradation products the identified molecules from these mass spectra were products from n de ethylation and decarboxylation m z 274 oxalic acid c2h2o4 m z 90 3 diethylamino phenol c10h15no m z 168 2 vinylbenzoic acid c9h8o2 m z 148 2 2 5 dihydroxypheny acetic acid c8h8o4 m z 168 malonic acid c3h4o4 m z 104 and formic acid ch2o2 m z 46 these observed intermediates are the proof of degradation via n de ethylation de alkylation de amination de carboxylation de hydration cleavage of the chromophore and the breakage of ring structure refer to 26 28 the proof of degradation is also identified by the toc removal at varied initial concentration of rhb by the treatment for an hour as presented in fig 10 toc removal ranging at 35 58 is demonstrated from initial rhb concentration of 5 50 ppm the toc represents the removal of organic content over oxidation mechanism which consist the released produced gas the reducing toc removal at the increasing initial concentration of rhb is related with the higher amount of intermediates products in more concentrated solution 3 3 kinetics model of sonocatalytic reaction as the rhb degradation obey pseudo first order kinetics the degradation rate is depending on the initial concentration of rhb effect of initial concentration on initial rate can be used for determining the effect of surface interaction during cavitation kinetics plot on varied initial rhb concentration is depicted in fig 11 refer to previous sonocataytic process the decomposition of dye molecule occurs in the interface region of the cavitation bubbles since the concentration of oh radicals is adequate for the effective reaction at the interface and cavitation zone after the bubble collapse and the temperature is also high the oxidative and thermal decomposition will be quickly occurred in this zone taking into account that interaction of interface and radicals play an important role in the kinetic refer to 29 langmuir adsorption in the reaction mechanism is assumed to be occurred and the model can be applied with following eq 7 7 r 0 k k c o 1 k c 0 which can be converted into a linear form eq 8 8 1 r 0 1 k k c 0 1 k with r is the initial dye degradation rate mg l min k is the apparent rate constant min 1 k is the equilibrium constant l mg and c0 is the initial dye concentration mg l k is the equilibrium constant which corresponds to the ratio of the adsorption to desorption rate constants of dye onto an effective reaction site another model which is modified langmuir model called as okitsu s model was also tested with following eq 7 a c 0 k c 0 r 1 k based on the kinetics data presented with plot at fig 11a the langmuir and okitsu models are presented in fig 11b and c and the calculated parameters are listed in table 4 due to the r2 parameters it is concluded that both models are fit with the kinetics data suggesting that these obey the basic assumption of okitsu s model in short the pollutant molecules in the interface are proportional to the initial concentration in solution the adsorption desorption equilibrium occurs in between interfacial zone and bulk state of the catalyst high concentration of radicals are existed for the fast degradation 22 3 4 effect of h2o2 concentration based on the kinetics results the sonocatalytic degradation kinetics under varied h2o2 concentration was then studied and the results are illustrated in fig 12 as shown the pattern expressed the increasing degradation rate at increasing h2o2 ranging from 0 to 2 10 3 m but then maintained at further increasing concentration high concentrations of h2o2 will adversely affect the efficiency of photocatalytic reaction by the radical scavenger and holes h scavenger according to following reactions h2o2 ho h2o ho2 ho2 ho h2o o2 3 5 effect of ph of the solution from the kinetics plot at fig 13 it is concluded that the degradation efficiency of rhb is highly affected by the ph value refer to the fitness to l h kinetics the degradation mechanism is related to the equilibrium governing the surface interaction between dye radicals and sno2 in the reactin system fig 13a and b show that the degradation reach fastest on ph 4 with the degradation efficiency of more than 98 and initial rate of 37 mg l min the increase in ph value to 7 until 11 significantly reduces the initial rate it is noteworthy that the isoelectric point of sno2 mmt from zeta potential analysis fig 13c is ph 4 4 while rhb is a cationic organic dye in the solutions at ph 4 4 the sno2 mmt will be negatively charged and attractive to rhb so the surface interaction will be more effective but at strong acidic ph 2 the surface interaction and radicals formation is retarded by the high concentration of proton on the other hand the addition alkaline medium at ph 4 0 the degradation efficiency and rate of rhb over sno2 can be enhanced however higher concentration of hydroxyl ions 4 4 the surface interaction will prevents the degradation mechanism the more hydroxyl ions in the system is also proven by that even the zeta potential at ph 11 is higher than ph 9 but it gives no significant different in initial rate 3 6 effect of radical scavenger to study the role of oh in sonocatalytic degradation the effect of oh scavenging agents edta and isopropanol on kinetics was examined the compared kinetic plots with comparative kinetics constant inset presented in fig 14 shows that both edta and isopropanol significantly suppressed the degradation of rhb the trapped radicals by the scavengers could not later react to oxidize rhb it is noted that isopropanol is more effective as the scavenger since it reduced kinetic constant

hydrothermal synthesis was used for preparing the immobilized sno2 nanoparticles into montmorillonite structure and the as synthesized material was characterized using x ray diffraction gas sorption analysis uv vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy uv vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy techniques the kinetics study of the sonocatalytic assisted oxidation was performed by the comparison with sno2 and mmt and in order to discover the kinetic characteristics of the sonocatalytic oxidation varied condition such as the effect of initial concentration of rhodamine b ph the addition of h2o2 were examined the proposed kinetic model revealed that the degradation obeys the apparent first order rate kinetics refer to the dependence of the kinetics reaction to the initial concentration rhodamine b and h2o2 concentration it is noted that the reaction fit with the langmuir and okitsu model suggesting that the sonocatalytic mechanism is influenced by active interface interaction for the cavitation and radical formation as the main operational parameters ph of the solution directly influences the initial rate of the reaction as the effect of zeta potential of the surface reusability study revealed that the catalyst maintains the stability until 3 cycles utilization with the maximum degradation efficiency of 100 under the condition of ultrasound frequency of 40 w 68 khz catalyst dose of 0 5 g l and reaction time of 2 h keywords advanced oxidation process clay modification dye degradation sonocatalytic degradation sno2 1 introduction wastewater containing dyes are usually found from some industries such as textiles printing and some home creative industries and often create severe environmental pollution the difficulties in dye removal of the wastewater sometimes leads for discharging non or not completely treated wastewater into environmental water bodies dyes are the most important class of synthetic organic compounds with some negative effects such as irritating properties carcinogenic and destroying aquatic environment 1 thus years of researches develop treatment methods that are more effective in eliminating dyes from the wastewater sustainable low cost and efficient are the essential properties of the technique for applicability in industries including small scale industries considering the persistence characteristics of dye compounds which generally consist of aromatic and stable organic compounds catalytic oxidation is still a powerful technique among some mentionable methods complete oxidation will give mineralization as the main route of the treatment without any further arrangements for the clean technology 2 3 the catalytic oxidation itself can be conducted under some intensification process such as electrocatalytic photocatalytic and ultrasound or commonly called as sonocatalytic technique the combination of procedure and catalyst activity plays an important role in the degradation mechanism and its efficiency 4 5 among various combinative processes the ultrasonic assisted degradation of organic compounds is a promising technique that was reported to be effective due to its simple equipment high efficiency stable operation safety and no secondary pollution 6 7 in such cases photocatalytic degradation over a kind of material nanomaterial showed higher effectiveness compared to the sonocatalytic process but it can also in reverse for the other cases the effectiveness of sonocatalytic and photocatalytic process for dye degradation depends on factors such as the photocatalyst catalyst dye irradiation time catalyst dosage ph etc some papers reported the higher degradation efficiency of sonocatalytic process rather than photocatalytic process for example the degradation of methylene blue over tio2 cnt catalysts and the degradation of reactive black with core shell nanocrystal 8 9 metal oxide semiconductors such as tio2 sno2 zno zro2 showed the activity for the sonocatalytic process refer to capability for electron promotion at the valence band ecb into the conduction band cb leaving a hole hvb and producing radicals for further oxidation process of organic compounds 10 11 particularly tin oxide sno2 is the potential candidate for semiconductor for use as catalysts due to its bandgap energy and less toxicity several researches explored the capability of sno2 in sonocatalysis and photo sonocataysis 12 13 however the stability of sno2 and low efficiency due to its large bandgap 3 6 ev and high recombination rate of electron hole pairs restricts the use of sno2 as an efficient sonocatalyst in order to recover these problems nanocomposites formation of sno2 has been attempted instead of its structural modification 12 previous researches reported the use of multi walled carbon nanotube mwct graphene zeolite and some porous solids for sonocatalytic and photocatalytic activity enhancement 14 15 previous research on cyproflaxine and methyl green degradation over sonocatalytic process conducted by tio2 montmorillonite suggested that montmorillonite structure provides effective surface and support for the tio2 as an active catalyst by high specific surface area 16 17 the resulting nanocomposites showed good capability to facilite the oxidation reduction mechanism by the semiconductor active site by providing adsorption desorption mechanism within these schemes immobilizations of sno2 into clay structure including bentonite or montmorillonite were reported as promising composites for catalytic oxidation reactions 18 to our knowledge the study on synthesis of sno2 montmorillonite for sonocatalytic application has not been reported refer to the potency of smectite clay modification this research attempted to prepare the composite of sno2 with montmorillonite furthermore called as sno2 mmt and studied its catalytic activity in sonocatalytic degradation of dye as a dye model rhodamine b rhb was chosen due to its abundantly used in some textile industries research highlights the use of hydrothermal technique as a different method with were reported from some previous research physicochemical characterization techniques consist of x ray diffraction xrd gas sorption analysis field emission scanning electron microscope energy dispersive x ray fesem eds and transmission electron microscopy tem were employed for the study further it was subjected toward sonocatalytic activity studies for the oxidation of rhb in varied condition 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials montmorillonite sample was collected from pacitan east java indonesia the sample was activated by refluxing in 2 m of sulfuric acid for 4 h followed by washing using water until the filtrate was neutral ph 6 7 sno2 mmt nanocomposite was prepared by mixing an aqueous suspension of montmorillonite 5 g in 250 ml with precursor solution made by mixing of stannic chloride solution with naoh at the sn oh molar ratio of 1 2 followed by stirring for 4 h the mixture of the suspension and precursor solution was made by setting 20 wt of sn percentage in the targeted composite the mixture was stirred magnetically for 4 h before then hydrothermally aged in autoclave at 150 c overnight the precipitate obtained was washed using 3 l of aquadest dried at 80 c for 24 h and calcined at 600 c for 2 h for comparative studies sno2 nanoparticles were also synthesized by the reaction between stannic chloride dihydrate and sodium hydroxide at the sn oh molar ratio of 1 2 in the aqueous solutions the mixture was stirred for 4 h at room temperature and the resulting precipitate was filtered washed and dried at 80 c for 24 h finally it was calcined at 600 c for 2 h 19 2 2 characterization characterization of the samples was employed by x ray diffraction analysis rigaku miniflex 600 tokyo japan ni filtered cu kα with the voltage of 40 kv and 20 ma current was utilized the surface profile consists of specific surface area pore volume and pore radius parameters were determined by n2 adsorption desorption experiment using nova 1200e gas sorption analyzer for each adsorption experiment liquid n2 at the temperature 77 k was utilized the specific surface area of materials was calculated based on brunair emmet teller bet method while the pore volume data was determined using barrett joyner and halenda bjh method ftir spectroscopy was carried out using perkin elmer atr singapore surface morphology was studied by using fesem taken on a jx jeol electron microscope the photoluminescence spectrum was recorded with fluorescence spectrophotometer jasco v760 tokyo japan 2 3 catalytic activity test sonocatalytic degradation of rb was employed by an ultrasonic probe with a frequency of 40 khz and ultrasonic power of 68 w delta dh68h taiwan for each experiment 0 5 g of the catalyst was added into 1 l of rhb solution and then the sonicator probe was immersed into the mixture the sampling was conducted at the interval of time by collecting the solution and centrifuged before analyzed using uv vis spectrophotometric method a calibration curve of rhodamine b at the desired concentration range was employed by measuring the absorbance at 554 nm using a hitachi u2080 uv vis spectrophotometer degradation efficiency de was calculated based on the change of rhb concentration before and after treatment using the following eq 1 1 d e c 0 c t c 0 x 100 identification on the presence of dye degradation was conducted by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lcms the specified operational condition consists of a mixture of methyl alcohol and water 50 50 v v as the mobile phase with the flow rate of 0 8 ml min 1 and the injection volume of 20 μl were applied on a hitachi lcms instrument ms analysis was performed on spray voltage of 3 5 kv capillary temperature 325 c capillary voltage 50 v tube lens 120 v and the detection of the mass

recycling was performed by filtering the catalyst after use washing using ethanol and dried at 200 c for 2 h 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical character of material the crystalline structures of sno2 mmt and sno2 mmt composites were confirmed by xrd patterns fig 1 the diffraction peaks at 26 9 37 9 39 58 and 51 9 of sno2 and sno2 mmt samples are found and correspond to 110 101 200 and 211 with the extension of peak at and 54 7 which corresponding to 002 planes of tetragonal rutile sno2 jcpds 41 1445 respectively meanwhile mmt presents the characteristic peaks at 5 55 19 7 27 7 35 5 and 54 6 as identification of 001 211 004 and 006 of montmorillonite structure the peak at 27 4 is the indication quartz q contained in the montmorillonite sample since the material is natural mineral which is available and inseparable with silica materials the 001 peak of montmorillonite at 5 55 m 001 represents the basal spacing d001 of 13 5 nm it is also concluded that the immobilization of sno2 is not representing the pillarization of sno2 into interlayer structure of mmt since the 001 peak is disappeared rather than shifted into a left side or indicating the increasing the basal spacing the pattern is similar with previous research on sno2 immobilization into bentonite 18 with the sn percentage ranging at 10 30 using debye scherrer equation eq 2 the crystallite size of sno2 nps on sno2 mmt surface is calculated to be 54 6 nm the presence of sno2 nps in the composite is also characterized by sem edx profile as well as tem profile figs 2 and 3 a relative rougher surface was expressed by sno2 mmt respect to the mmt s surface which implies a layered structure as surface characteristic of smectite clay refer to the surface profile of sno2 nps these rougher and irregular particles on surface are the identification of the supported sno2 based on eds spectra the sno2 content in the composite was calculated to be 21 8 wt table 1 which is slightly higher compared with targeted content 20 wt in addition tem profile of sno2 mmt fig 3 with hrtem profile inset presents the non homogeneous spherical particles of sno2 ranging at 40 60 nm in size meanwhile the sno2 nps shows the bigger particles in range the particle size range is fit with the crystallite size measured by xrd calculation to ensure the presence of sno2 interaction with the support xps analysis was conducted and the results are presented in fig 4 the survey scan spectrum depicted in fig 4a demonstrates the presence of si al fe sn o and na peaks confirming the main component of montmorillonite and the supported sno2 the deconvoluted o1 s spectrum fig 4b demonstrated the two peaks centered at 486 9 and 485 8 ev which belong to the sn4 o and sn2 o bonds this suggests that the partial transition of sn4 to sn2 occurred 20 21 the deconvolution of sn 3d spectrum shows two peaks at 530 3 and 531 7 ev fig 5 c which belong to the sno and oh bonds as the proof of sno2 structure in the composite furthermore fig 4c depicts two peaks of the sn 3d5 2 and sn 3d3 2 spin orbit at at 486 9 and 495 3 ev respectively it is also noted that the distance between the two peaks is 8 4 ev which confirms the formation of sn4 oxidation state in sno2 the change in surface profile from mmt into sno2 mmt is in line with the surface parameters listed in table 2 which are calculated from adsorption desorption isotherm fig 5 the sno2 immobilization affected to increase specific surface area of mmt from 76 m2 g to 128 m2 g corresponding with the increasing pore volume from 1 02 10 2 cc g to 1 90 10 2 cc g the parameters are higher compared with sno2 nps as an indication of the formation of porous structure on the surface which is important for heterogeneous catalysis mechanism to estimate the band gap energy of the composite uv drs analysis was performed fig 6 the diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples were evaluated using the tauc plot equation of the measured reflectance according to the following eq 2 2 αhν 2 a hν eg where α ν eg and a are the absorption coefficient light frequency bandgap energy and a constant respectively the band gap energy was obtained by extrapolating the linear portion of the α h ν 2 curve versus hν to zero and from this the estimated bandgap energies of the sno2 and sno2 mmt obtained from the tauc plot are 3 54 and 3 6 ev respectively the increasing eg of sno2 by supporting onto mmt suggesting the effect of smaller particle size which furthermore respect to the stabilization of the excited electron 3 2 catalytic activity of sno2 mmt kinetics of rhb sonocatalytic degradation over sno2 sno2 mmt and mmt is depicted at fig 7 the kinetic plots imply that both sno2 and sno2 mmt show the degradation activity as demonstrated by the decreasing rhb concentration effectively at time range of 0 120 min meanwhile mmt does not show significant effect to c co at the same time the data suggests that the presence of sno2 as catalyst active material plays role in the degradation mechanism at the meantime the slightly decreasing rhb concentration over mmt is occurred by adsorption mechanism even though in the system h2o2 was added but there is no significant change in rhb concentration the change in rhb concentration describes the presence of cavitation by the catalytic active sites from sno2 which produce efficient amount of hydroxyl radicals to degrade rhb the interaction among ultrasound and active site creates a hot spot and furthermore it generates strong oxidizing conditions by the interaction between radicals formed and the hydroxyl radicals h and oh coming from h2o2 as oxidant by following mechanism 14 22 sno2 e h e o2 o2 e oh oh h h2o oh oh o2 dye co2 h2o schematic representation of sonocatalytic mechanism is presented in fig 8 investigation on the kinetics of rhb degradation was studied by applying two kinetics equations pseudo first order kinetics and pseudo second order kinetics with following eq 3 4 3 l n c t c 0 k t 4 1 c t k t 1 c 0 and the calculated parameters are presented in table 3 from comparison on the use sno2 mmt and sno2 it is also notably concluded that the degradation efficiency initial rate and kinetics constant as shown by the slope of the plot over sno2 mmt are higher compared to sno2 table 3 the r2 parameters suggest that the data obeys pseudo first order kinetics since the r2 of pseudo first order kinetics model is higher than of pseudo second order kinetics model using the pseudo first order plot the apparent kinetics constant slope of the reaction over sno2 mmt and sno2 are 0 032 min and 0 020 min and are consequently comparable with the initial rate 0 60 mg l min and 0 38 mg l min respectively by using the consideration that sno2 is active site for degradation mechanism turnover number ton of the reaction was calculated based on the percentage of rhb degraded per mass of sno2 in the catalyst and the values are calculated to be 2 74 mg wt l and 0 38 mg wt l respectively the values demonstrate the relevance of sno2 supporting into mmt structure which possibly correlated with the preserved specific surface area of the composite form to enhance the efficiency by the participation of adsorption in the mechanism the data indicated that the kinetics rely on initial concentration of rb and it presumably that the surface interactive occurs at the bubble liquid interface at the interface spot amount of hydroxyl radicals can be denoted as in a constant amount so the equation of reaction rate 5 5 r k rhb oh which can be simplified expressed as 6 6 r kapp rhb with kapp k oh similar kinetics profile and possible mechanism was similar with sonocatalytic degradation of rhb by sno2 and tio2 reported by previous works 23 25 the identification of degradation mechanism in the sonocatalysis process was studied by lcms analysis giving the data presented at fig 9 the chromatograms of initial and treated solution for 30 and 60 min show the degradation as identified by some new peaks of treated solutions respect to the chromatogram of initial solution in addition the mass spectra of treated solution exhibit the fraction with m z of 362 274 228 216 172 168 148 122 104 90 76 and 74 as identification of degradation products the identified molecules from these mass spectra were products from n de ethylation and decarboxylation m z 274 oxalic acid c2h2o4 m z 90 3 diethylamino phenol c10h15no m z 168 2 vinylbenzoic acid c9h8o2 m z 148 2 2 5 dihydroxypheny acetic acid c8h8o4 m z 168 malonic acid c3h4o4 m z 104 and formic acid ch2o2 m z 46 these observed intermediates are the proof of degradation via n de ethylation de alkylation de amination de carboxylation de hydration cleavage of the chromophore and the breakage of ring structure refer to 26 28 the proof of degradation is also identified by the toc removal at varied initial concentration of rhb by the treatment for an hour as presented in fig 10 toc removal ranging at 35 58 is demonstrated from initial rhb concentration of 5 50 ppm the toc represents the removal of organic content over oxidation mechanism which consist the released produced gas the reducing toc removal at the increasing initial concentration of rhb is related with the higher amount of intermediates products in more concentrated solution 3 3 kinetics model of sonocatalytic reaction as the rhb degradation obey pseudo first order kinetics the degradation rate is depending on the initial concentration of rhb effect of initial concentration on initial rate can be used for determining the effect of surface interaction during cavitation kinetics plot on varied initial rhb concentration is depicted in fig 11 refer to previous sonocataytic process the decomposition of dye molecule occurs in the interface region of the cavitation bubbles since the concentration of oh radicals is adequate for the effective reaction at the interface and cavitation zone after the bubble collapse and the temperature is also high the oxidative and thermal decomposition will be quickly occurred in this zone taking into account that interaction of interface and radicals play an important role in the kinetic refer to 29 langmuir adsorption in the reaction mechanism is assumed to be occurred and the model can be applied with following eq 7 7 r 0 k k c o 1 k c 0 which can be converted into a linear form eq 8 8 1 r 0 1 k k c 0 1 k with r is the initial dye degradation rate mg l min k is the apparent rate constant min 1 k is the equilibrium constant l mg and c0 is the initial dye concentration mg l k is the equilibrium constant which corresponds to the ratio of the adsorption to desorption rate constants of dye onto an effective reaction site another model which is modified langmuir model called as okitsu s model was also tested with following eq 7 a c 0 k c 0 r 1 k based on the kinetics data presented with plot at fig 11a the langmuir and okitsu models are presented in fig 11b and c and the calculated parameters are listed in table 4 due to the r2 parameters it is concluded that both models are fit with the kinetics data suggesting that these obey the basic assumption of okitsu s model in short the pollutant molecules in the interface are proportional to the initial concentration in solution the adsorption desorption equilibrium occurs in between interfacial zone and bulk state of the catalyst high concentration of radicals are existed for the fast degradation 22 3 4 effect of h2o2 concentration based on the kinetics results the sonocatalytic degradation kinetics under varied h2o2 concentration was then studied and the results are illustrated in fig 12 as shown the pattern expressed the increasing degradation rate at increasing h2o2 ranging from 0 to 2 10 3 m but then maintained at further increasing concentration high concentrations of h2o2 will adversely affect the efficiency of photocatalytic reaction by the radical scavenger and holes h scavenger according to following reactions h2o2 ho h2o ho2 ho2 ho h2o o2 3 5 effect of ph of the solution from the kinetics plot at fig 13 it is concluded that the degradation efficiency of rhb is highly affected by the ph value refer to the fitness to l h kinetics the degradation mechanism is related to the equilibrium governing the surface interaction between dye radicals and sno2 in the reactin system fig 13a and b show that the degradation reach fastest on ph 4 with the degradation efficiency of more than 98 and initial rate of 37 mg l min the increase in ph value to 7 until 11 significantly reduces the initial rate it is noteworthy that the isoelectric point of sno2 mmt from zeta potential analysis fig 13c is ph 4 4 while rhb is a cationic organic dye in the solutions at ph 4 4 the sno2 mmt will be negatively charged and attractive to rhb so the surface interaction will be more effective but at strong acidic ph 2 the surface interaction and radicals formation is retarded by the high concentration of proton on the other hand the addition alkaline medium at ph 4 0 the degradation efficiency and rate of rhb over sno2 can be enhanced however higher concentration of hydroxyl ions 4 4 the surface interaction will prevents the degradation mechanism the more hydroxyl ions in the system is also proven by that even the zeta potential at ph 11 is higher than ph 9 but it gives no significant different in initial rate 3 6 effect of radical scavenger to study the role of oh in sonocatalytic degradation the effect of oh scavenging agents edta and isopropanol on kinetics was examined the compared kinetic plots with comparative kinetics constant inset presented in fig 14 shows that both edta and isopropanol significantly suppressed the degradation of rhb the trapped radicals by the scavengers could not later react to oxidize rhb it is noted that isopropanol is more effective as the scavenger since it reduced kinetic constant compared to edta in general the use of sno2 mmt for the sonocatalytic degradation of rhb presented in this work is notably similar with other catalyst materials as listed in table 5 it is worthy to state that sno2 mmt shows as a potential material for sonocatalytic degradation of dye 3 7 catalyst reusability reusability is an important character for the catalyst to be applied in industrial scale

ethanol and dried after the completion of each cycle from the data of de and initial rate it is concluded that sno2 mmt catalyst is stable until 3rd cycles and going reduced for the additional cycles
