3110,evapotranspiration et is a vital factor in terrestrial water and energy cycles exploring the spatiotemporal variations in et and transpiration t can improve our understanding of the role of vegetation restoration in the context of climate change karst ecosystems are particularly sensitive and vulnerable to environmental change in this study we investigated the spatiotemporal changes of et t and the transpiration fraction t et in the longjiang river basin lrb of southwest china from 1987 to 2018 using the variable infiltration capacity vic model in karst areas the original third soil layer in the vic model was modified to an epikarst zone and a reservoir module was integrated with the model model validation and evaluation showed that the modified vic model performed well in fitting the observations of runoff and et during the 32 year study period et t and t et increased by 2 30 mm yr 1 2 21 mm yr 1 and 0 0006 respectively with the significant increase concentrated in areas with increased forestland high positive correlations between ndvi and et t and t et were observed in areas where forestland and grassland increased temperature and wind speed were positively correlated with et t and t et in areas with low altitude and abundant precipitation where large areas of cropland are present there was a positive correlation between precipitation and et in karst areas whereas the negative correlation between precipitation and t was mainly occurred in non karst areas the scenario analysis based on different land use data revealed that et and t et exhibited significant differences in karst areas but not in non karst areas indicating that karst areas were more affected by ecological restoration moreover t did not show a significant increase after vegetation restoration suggesting that increased et was mainly caused by evaporation this study provides insights into the effects of vegetation restoration and climate change on et t and t et under different geological conditions and can help implement appropriate afforestation strategies in different geological settings keywords evapotranspiration transpiration fraction vegetation restoration climate change longjiang river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as a crucial variable in surface hydrological processes and energy exchange in terrestrial ecosystems evapotranspiration et plays an important role in water allocation and water resource management jin et al 2017 ma et al 2019 by returning 60 of global terrestrial precipitation to the atmosphere et directly affects the water supply capacity of surface ecosystems wang et al 2021 transpiration t is usually coupled with canopy conductance and vegetation activity therefore investigating et and t fraction t et is important for estimating water budgets and understanding ecosystem water use efficiency wang et al 2014 recent studies have demonstrated that climate change and large scale vegetation restoration substantially influence et and t et at multiple spatiotemporal scales yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2018b in some areas anthropogenic revegetation facilitates ecological recovery and improves local ecosystems liao et al 2018 qiao et al 2021 however ecologically fragile ecosystems are extremely sensitive to hydrological processes induced by anthropogenic activities hao et al 2016 wang et al 2020a thus a thorough understanding of the spatiotemporal patterns of et and t et and their response to climate change and vegetation restoration is crucial for ensuring efficient water resource use and protection of the ecological environment numerous methods exist for quantifying et and t et and related drivers these methods predominantly include field based experimental methods e g sap flow lysimeter and eddy covariance techniques and several standard equations e g penman equation tie et al 2018 wang et al 2018 yang et al 2021 however most methods are constrained to the site or field scale and are difficult to apply on a regional scale because of limitations in the local soil vegetation and climate conditions conversely remote sensing offers a cost effective method for determining vegetation characteristics and estimating et and t et at a high spatiotemporal resolution and large spatial scale zhang et al 2016b as remote sensing products cannot illustrate the physical relationships between et and t et and different drivers nor predict changes in et and t et various physical hydrological models or land surface models are employed to explore the response of et and t et to climate and vegetation changes bai et al 2019 dash et al 2021 yang et al 2021 based on a simplified water balance approach land surface models lsms achieve effective regional et estimates under data poor conditions sun et al 2021 the variable infiltration capacity vic model is one such lsm that considers et and t in detail liang and xie 2003 moreover the vic model considers the hydrological interactions between soil vegetation and the atmosphere as well as the sub grid heterogeneity of land cover which facilitates a more accurate simulation of the impacts of climate change and vegetation restoration on et and transpiration fraction dash et al 2021 zhang et al 2021c previous findings have demonstrated that land use and climate precipitation temperature wind speed etc affect water energy availability and lead to spatiotemporal variations in the et process for example vegetation restoration has been shown to cause increases in et and t et bai et al 2019 lian et al 2018 in contrast xie et al 2015 showed that afforestation has a slight impact on hydrological processes moreover many studies have indicated that variations in et are affected by precipitation xie et al 2015 yang et al 2016b whereas others suggested that afforestation is the dominant factor affecting et variations bai et al 2019 jin et al 2017 meanwhile great efforts have been made to analyze the et and related processes in karst areas for example zhang et al 2018a compared et variations and their drivers in three agroforestry ecosystems heilman et al 2012 compared water and energy fluxes in two different ecosystems on the edwards plateau and concluded that the water storage capacity limited the increase in et liu et al 2016 investigated the impacts of climate and landforms on et in 13 karst basins based on the budyko hypothesis however their study did not contrast the differences in et and t et and potential mechanism between karst and non karst areas the karst landscape in southwest china is one of the largest continuous karst areas in the world characterized by shallow surface soil and the underneath epikarst layer a more porous and permeable zone compared to the overlying soil wang et al 2020b williams 2008 even with abundant precipitation it is still prone to engineering water shortage tan et al 2021 since the implementation of the grain to green project in 2000 2001 the southwest karst region has experienced remarkable shifts in land use or land cover as shown by the conversion of large areas of cropland to grassland or forest zhang et al 2021a with more intense vegetation restoration presented during 2001 2016 than during 1982 2000 zhang et al 2021b thus the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi showed increasing trends after 2002 lian et al 2020 however massive afforestation may have negative effects on ecohydrological processes including soil desiccation poor vegetation development and fragmented distribution of vegetation communities which may also be related to bedrock weathering and climate change li et al 2018 in karst areas soil layer is thin and epikarst comprises highly weathered carbonate rock beneath the surface or extensively exposed at the surface which is the key region different from the non karst areas highly weathered carbonate rock could constrain vegetation growth due to the rapid infiltration of water into epikarst thus the epikarst zone plays an important role in the karst hydrological process and vegetation growth moreover the southwest karst region is affected by climate change with decreasing rainfall and an increased risk of drought over the past 60 years liu et al 2014 despite the importance of et and t as indicators of water availability in terrestrial ecosystems the controls and mechanisms underlying the spatiotemporal changes in et and t et in karst areas remain poorly understood the main objective of this study is to clarify the response of et and t et to climate change and vegetation restoration in the longjiang river basin lrb under two different geological conditions karst and non karst areas the presence of reservoir can alter the downstream hydrological behavior thus the distributed vic hydrological model was improved by adding a reservoir module meanwhile as the epikarst is the core region different from the non karst areas the original third soil layer in the vic model was modified to an epikarst zone then we conducted two model simulations with and without epikarst and reservoirs to evaluate the model performance spatiotemporal pattern of et and t et and their change attributed to climate and vegetation restoration were investigated using mann kendall trend test and partial correlation analysis we aim to address the following scientific question how do vegetation restoration and climate change affect et and t et in two areas with different geological backgrounds 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the longjiang river basin lrb is a second order tributary of the xijiang river in the pearl river system originating from sandu county guizhou province and meandering for approximately 358 km in a northwest to southeast direction before converging into the liujiang river fig 1 a the study region covers a total drainage area of 15 820 km2 and has an elevation of 65 1665 m the region is characterized by a subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual temperature of 21 c and annual precipitation of 1490 mm of which 70 90 is concentrated between april and september resulting in significant seasonal variations in runoff the annual runoff in the region is 13 2 109 m3 of which 85 40 occurs in the flood season vegetation coverage is high with 97 88 and 98 41 of the lrb covered by forestland grassland and crop natural vegetation mosaic in 2001 and 2015 respectively whereas urban and built up land only represents a small area of the catchment 0 38 and 0 42 fig 1b the region is a typical karst basin dominated by carbonate 56 4 and impure carbonate rocks 23 8 consisting mainly of highly soluble limestone dolomite mixed limestone dolomite and their intercalation with other rocks fig 1c non carbonate rocks 19 8 predominantly clastic rocks are distributed in the east of the lrb 2 2 data preparation topographic data used to extract the channel river network were collected

of et martens et al 2016 talsma et al 2018 yang et al 2017 in this study gleam v3 5a was applied to a 32 year period from 1987 to 2018 3 methodology 3 1 vic hydrological model the vic model is a grid based macroscale land surface hydrological model that considers both water and energy balances originally proposed by wood et al 1992 the vic model is a one layer model based on the infiltration capacity of the soil subsequently liang et al 1996 improved the model to a two layer model by incorporating the storage capacity curve of the xinanjiang model to advance the representation of soil moisture dynamics in the surface layer and diffusion processes of soil water between soil layers a 10 cm soil layer was separated from the upper soil layer therefore the model in this study has three soil column layers the vic 3l model considers both horton and dunne runoff generation mechanisms and accounts for sub grid vegetation variability by dividing each grid cell 0 1 0 1 in our study into a wealth of tiles liang and xie 2003 the total runoff of each grid cell is divided into surface runoff and baseflow surface runoff which is based on the variable infiltration curve is generated only from the top two soil layers and baseflow occurs only in the bottom layer as calculated by the arno model franchini and pacciani 1991 considering that the vic model only generates runoff yield data the lohmann routing model was added to obtain runoff values at the outlet of the basin lohmann et al 1996 the presence of reservoir and dam affects downstream hydrological behavior hence a reservoir module is integrated with this routing model the reservoir module was developed considering the reservoir operation which relied on rule curves or operating rules dang et al 2020 the specifications of reservoir information including design aspects e g dead and critical water levels and reservoir operation parameters e g operating approach maximum and minimum water levels are provided in table 1 the vic model computes total et based on three major components i e vegetation transpiration t canopy interception evaporation ec and soil evaporation es 1 et i 1 n c i e c i t i c n 1 e s where ci is the fraction of vegetation cover for the it h vegetation class in a grid cn 1 is the fraction of bare soil in a grid t reflects the influence of radiation soil moisture vapor pressure deficit air

maximum infiltration capacity mm d 1 io is the point infiltration capacity mm d 1 and can be expressed as 5 i o i m 1 1 a 1 b i where a is the proportion of area with infiltration capacity less than io bi is the infiltration shape parameter to adapt to the specific structure of karst geomorphology the third layer of the model was modified as an epikarst zone for karst areas whereas all three layers were soil for non karst areas epikarst is the first karst development layer below the soil or surface it is an important element within the karst critical zone the epikarst layer is a vertical extension of the soil where the climate plant roots and geology form a more porous and permeable zone compared to the overlying soil and non karst areas given the unique conditions of the epikarst zone the soil and epikarst parameters were set separately soil parameters such as bulk density and porosity were derived from the fao unesco soil database since the average soil thickness in the lrb is about 90 cm fig s1 the thickness of the first and second soil layers is set at 10 cm and 80 cm respectively due to saturated hydraulic conductivity ks being related to bulk density and soil texture the calculation of ks was revised based on the formula used by dash et al 2020 6 log k s 9 56 0 81 log p silt 1 09 log p clay 4 64 b d where psilt and pclay are the percentage of silt and clay respectively bd is bulk density g cm 3 epikarst parameters were acquired from related references and experimental data for the mulian catchment of huanjiang station which is a typical cockpit karst catchment in the study area wang et al 2020a the porosity of epikarst ranges from 1 to 10 exhibiting strong heterogeneity in previous research the porosity is generally set to 10 xu et al 2020 zhang et al 2011 the mean epikarst bd of 2 4 g cm 3 is close to that of 2 5 g cm 3 from field investigations in our study area wang et al 2020b considering the plant rooting depth and the water that plant can utilize from underlying rock fissures the epikarst thickness is set to 2 m cai et al 2022 xu et al 2020 zhang et al 2011 plant rooting depth is a vital parameter for regulating hydrological processes and surface atmosphere interactions the fraction of plant roots is typically set according to the proposed fractions of different plant functional types most plant roots 89 in the karst landscape are distributed in the topsoil layer and become less abundant with depth ni et al 2015 nie et al 2014 therefore in our study area the approximate fraction of plant roots in the soil and epikarst layer was set to 0 8 and 0 2 for woodland and 0 9 and 0 1 for grassland in karst areas and 0 7 and 0 3 for woodland and 0 8 and 0 2 for grassland in non karst areas respectively gerten et al 2004 yang et al 2016a 3 2 model calibration and validation despite the above physical based parameters the vic model incorporates other types of parameters that cannot be measured or are difficult to obtain because of their high heterogeneity the physical meanings and ranges of these parameters are listed in table 2 the rosenbrock method a typical function test problem in unconstrained optimization theory and method was adopted to calibrate the vic model by adjusting the aforementioned parameters rosenbrock 1960 two years of data 1985 1986 were used for model spin up followed by twenty years 1987 2006 of data for calibration and twelve years 2007 2018 of data for validation the performance of model simulations for et and t was first calibrated based on the determination coefficient r2 and percent bias pbias the formulas are expressed as follows 7 r 2 i 1 n x i obs x i obs x i sim x i sim i 1 n x i obs x i obs 2 i 1 n x i sim x i sim 2 2 8 pbias i 1 n x i obs x i sim i 1 n x i obs 100 where n is study period and i is the year ranging from 1 to n x i obs and x i obs are the observations in year i and average observations during the study period and x i sim and x i sim are the simulated values in year i and average simulations during the study period besides the direct calibration using gleam et and t the indirect validation was also performed based on streamflow observations using two extensively employed performance metrics nash sutcliffe coefficient nse and kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 nash and sutcliffe 1970 these two indicators are calculated by the following formulas 9 nse 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i μ o 2 10 kge 1 r 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 11 β μ s μ 0 12 γ cv s cv o σ s μ s σ o μ o where o i and s i are the observed and simulated runoff values respectively μ o is the average observed runoff r denotes the pearson correlation coefficient β and γ are the bias ratio and variability ratio respectively μ s is the mean simulated runoff σ s and σ o represent the standard deviation of simulated and observed runoff respectively 3 3 impact of vegetation restoration on et and t et to explore the impact of vegetation restoration on et t and t et different land use or land cover data lucc were used to run the calibrated vic model during the variation period 2003 2018 first land cover lai and albedo data from 2005 2010 and 2015 were employed to estimate et values for the real vegetation scenario etwith veg the information represents three periods 2003 2007 2005 2008 2012 2010 and 2013 2018 2015 then the vic model was forced using data lucc lai and albedo from 2001 to estimate et values without vegetation restoration etwithout veg the differences between etwith veg and etwithout veg can be considered the effect of vegetation restoration on et furthermore the impact of vegetation restoration on t and t et was also analyzed 3 4 statistical analysis the sen s slope mann kendall trend test and abrupt test were employed to determine the trend magnitude and significance of et t and t et and investigate the abrupt change point in the annual et and t time series sen s slope is a robust non parametric trend method that is insensitive to measurement errors and outliers sen 1968 the formula for calculating the change rate is as follows 13 β m e d i a n x j x i j i j i where β is the change rate and xi and xj are the et t and t et values in year i and j β 0 indicates an increasing trend and β 0 indicates a decreasing trend the mk trend test is also a non parametric method that is widely used for the detection of trends without considering underlying distributional assumptions and missing values β and z values are used to evaluate the magnitude of the trend and the significance test in sen s slope and mk trend test respectively a positive z value indicates an increasing trend z 0 indicates an unchanged time series and a negative z value indicates a decreasing trend kendall 1975 mann 1945 a significant trend occurs if z 1 96 95 significance level similarly if the intersection of forward and backward sequences in the abrupt test occurs beyond 1 96 then a critical change point can be identified in that period analysis of variance anova was used to analyze the significance of the differences in et t and t et under different land use scenarios one way anova assumes that the observations within each group are normally distributed and that the data are homoscedastic that is the standard deviations are equal before we accept or reject the null hypothesis we conduct significance tests such as the tukey kramer test least significant difference and duncan test precipitation p temperature tem wind speed ws and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi were selected as the main driving factors to explore their effects on et t and t et since the ndvi data are available from 1982 to 2015 partial correlation analysis was performed for each pixel during 1987 2015 the partial correlation coefficient r denotes the degree of correlation between et and each driving factor where all other driving factors were controlled 4 results 4 1 model validation and evaluation first we evaluated the model performance for simulating et and t dynamics as their accuracy is essential for analyzing the impacts of vegetation restoration and climate factors on et besides the direct calibration between simulated et and gleam et indirect validation was performed based on monthly runoff simulations and observations we calibrated two instances of vic with and without epikarst and reservoirs results showed that both model instances have a good capacity for tracking the et and t dynamics during 1987 2018 simulated and gleam derived outputs were all around the 1 1 line with r2 ranging from 0 73 to 0 90 fig 2 compared with the original vic model the r2 of improved model increased to 0 90 0 88 and the pbias decreased by 4 14 4 66 for et t during the calibration period thereby improving the simulation effect of the model the comparison results between the monthly runoff simulations and observations are shown in fig 3 similarly both model instances have the same accuracy in reproducing runoff with regard to simulated runoff considering karst and reservoir influence the nse and kge increased to 0 65 and 0 66 respectively 4 2 spatiotemporal pattern of et t and t et the regional average time series 1987 2018 exhibited increasing trends in et t and t et with gradients of 2 30 mm yr 1 2 21 mm yr 1 and 0 0006 respectively fig 4 as shown in fig s2 an abrupt change point in annual et t and t et values was detected in 2002 2004 and 2004 respectively before the abrupt change et t and t et increased at rates of 1 61 mm yr 1 1 14 mm yr 1 and 0 0007 respectively after the abrupt change the slope of et t and t et were all higher with mean rates of 2 02 mm yr 1 2 22 mm yr 1 and 0 0002 respectively the mean annual et during 1987 2018 ranged from 586 66 to 951 20 mm with higher values typically observed in the southeastern regions and lower values largely in the northeastern regions fig 4d a similar pattern was identified in the annual t values annual t et varied from 0 44 to 0 76 with higher t et in the central area of the lrb fig 4f the et and t time series showed significant increasing trends in most areas of the lrb with mean values of 2 22 and 2 24 mm yr 1 respectively only small parts in the southeast and central part of the lrb showed decreasing trends the rate of t et variation ranged from 0 0024 to 0 0035 et t and t et presented significant increasing trends in the middle and eastern regions of the lrb where large areas of forestland increased 4 3 correlations between driving forces and et and t et to spatially analyze the effect of driving forces on the et process we performed the partial correlation analysis between et t and t et and meteorological factors and ndvi for each pixel from 1987 to 2015 fig 5 generally et was positively correlated with driving forces significant correlations between et and p and ws were observed in the southeastern and central regions fig 5a and g whereas ndvi was significantly correlated with et in the northwestern and central regions where large areas of forestland and grassland increased fig 5j stronger correlations between et and p and ws were observed in karst areas however the partial correlation coefficient between et and ndvi was generally higher in non karst areas than in karst areas a negative correlation between p and t was found in 63 33 of the study area fig 5b whereas the other driving forces were positively correlated with t t had significant correlations with tem and ws in the southeastern regions of the lrb fig 5e and h the significant correlation between t and p and ndvi was mainly distributed in a small part of the central and eastern regions fig 5b and k correlations between t and tem and ws tended to be stronger in karst areas fig 5e and h whereas those between t and p tended to be stronger in non karst areas negative correlations between p and t et were found in 92 22 of the study area fig 5c with high correlation distributed in the central and southeastern regions t et had significant correlations with tem in the southeastern regions of the lrb whereas ndvi showed no significant correlation with t et overall there was a high correlation between t et and p and tem in karst areas whereas a strong correlation between t et and ws was observed in non karst areas fig 5i 4 4 effects of vegetation restoration on et and t et based on the scenario analysis vegetation restoration increased the et and t fig 6 et exhibited significant increasing trends with rates of 4 91 whereas t insignificantly increased by 2 24 as the increase rate of et is greater than that of t t et tends to decrease after vegetation restoration etwith veg was higher than etwithout veg in 91 11 of the study area with only several pixels showing the opposite trend in the southeast and northwest of the lrb fig 7 a c the spatial pattern of t was similar to that of et with an increase in 73 89 of the study area fig 7d f as a consequence t et showed decreasing trends in 97 22 of the study area with a mean change rate of 2 58 figs 6 and 7g i overall et and t increased considerably in the eastern regions where large areas of forestland increased but decreased in the southeastern regions where large areas of cropland are present after vegetation restoration et and t in karst areas increased by 38 53 mm and 11 56 mm respectively whereas t et decreased by 0 02 fig 8 et and t et showed significant differences under vegetation change scenarios in karst areas the increase in et and t in karst areas was less than that in non karst areas especially for t however there were no significant differences among et t and t et in non karst areas 5 discussion 5 1 performance of the vic model soil and epikarst thicknesses dsoil and depi and related properties are fundamental parameters that influence hydrological processes in this study the third layer of the vic model was defined as an epikarst zone for karst areas whereas all three layers were soil for the non karst areas generally depi varies in space ranging from 2 to 20 m or more liu et al 2020 wang et al 2020a zhang et al 2011 however the upper epikarst where the fissure network was strongly developed was usually modeled xu et al 2020 simulated the average depi with a range from 2 4 m to 9 8 m using the varkarst hydrological model similarly cai et al 2022 set depi to 2 m in their model overall the epikarst zone was included with reasonable parameters based on references and local field investigation the simulated results provide acceptable et and runoff estimates first monthly et and t data were used to calibrate the vic model based on two instances of vic with and without epikarst and reservoirs second to further ascertain the validity of the runoff estimation we also compared the vic estimated runoff with observations the improved model showed r2 nse kge increased and pbias decreased thereby improving the model performance although some research claimed that the vic model might overestimate or underestimate et values dash et al 2020 hiep et al 2018 the locally calibrated vic model could improve the et estimates billah et al 2015 overall both model instances showed a similar trend in the et and flow regime the calibration process may compensate for the absence of epikarst and reservoir structure by adjusting the soil parameter values that can capture the alterations caused by reservoirs or epikarst thereby yielding an acceptable model performance dang et al 2020 5 2 variations in et and t et and their response to vegetation restoration the mean annual et and t were 842 98 and 620 16 mm yr 1 during 1987 2018 being similar to the field scale findings in karst areas with annual t ranging from 626 to 701 mm yr 1 du et al 2021 the estimated t et ratio varied from 0 44 to 0 76 which is acceptable according to the results for global terrestrial ecosystems 35 80 coenders gerrits et al 2014 good et al 2015 also reported that t accounted for 64 13 of et when calculated using two flux methods consistent with the previous study niu et al 2019 the t et of the forest ecosystems located in the central area of the lrb was generally higher than that of the non forest ecosystems in the southeast of the lrb previous findings have indicated that vegetation restoration is important for vegetation growth cai et al 2022 li et al 2018 china s ecological restoration projects implemented over the past decades are regarded as highly ambitious with billions of trees planted to improve the ecological environment and drive greening trends vulnerable karst ecosystems are a priority target for restoration projects thus numerous ecological policies and projects have been implemented in this area notably vegetation greening and biomass carbon have increased significantly tong et al 2018 therefore as the main human activity in the study area vegetation restoration exhibited a substantial impact on et variation peng et al 2021 also demonstrated that the positive effect of human activities began to increase in 2000 and areas of increasing lai as a result of human activities developed a steady spatial distribution in 2004 vegetation dynamics affect et processes by regulating interception surface roughness and albedo yang et al 2022 the results of the scenario analysis showed a considerable increase in et and t after vegetation restoration comparison between etwithout veg and etwith veg however the increase in t was not significant indicating that the increase in et was mainly caused by interception evaporation fig 6 this can be largely explained by the fact that the area of forestland continuously increased with a net increase of 1 155 51 km2 accounting for 88 28 of the total net increase in land use area in the lrb from lucc2001 to lucc2015 table 3 this finding is consistent with the work of lian et al 2020 who reported annual ndvi improved after vegetation restoration and human activity was the main cause of increased non flood season runoff in the lrb in addition et and t increased more in non karst areas than those in karst areas this result could be attributed to increased forestland distribution in non karst areas which are less affected by human activities due to their high altitude cai et al 2022 also found that annual lai increased at a higher rate in non karst areas than that in karst areas from period 1992 2003 to period 2004 2015 5 3 spatial differences of primary environmental controlling regulations for et and t et three climate factors p tem and ws and ndvi values were used to explore the primary environmental controlling regulations for et and t et at the pixel scale we found that increased p can increase et but reduce t and t et fig 5 which is consistent with previous studies niu et al 2019 this result indicated that the increased et was caused by increased interception losses and soil evaporation generally p was conducive to vegetation growth similar results were observed by nagler et al 2007 who reported that annual et was mainly influenced by summer p in grassland and shrubland ecosystems qiao et al 2021 also observed a strong correlation between p and ndvi in most karst areas specifically the p driven increase in et mainly occurred in karst areas while the p driven decrease in t mainly occurred in non karst areas fig 5 the main reason for this is that karst areas are characterized by thin soil and high infiltration capacity therefore increased p can increase the amount of water available in karst ecosystems for non karst ecosystems increased p may reduce the solar radiation and thus decrease t du et al 2021 also suggested that climax forest communities in karst areas were generally not limited by water tem and ws showed positive effects on et t and t et in the southeast of the lrb tem can increase et both directly and indirectly on the one hand rising tem causes an increase in the vapor pressure deficit and atmospheric water demand thereby affecting plant photosynthesis and transpiration zhao et al 2022 on the other hand increased tem could elevate soil and canopy evaporation followed by increasing et previous studies have indicated that the warming induced growing season length is significantly correlated with et hwang et al 2018 ws is a crucial indicator dominating the efficiency of water vapor transfer between the canopy and atmosphere a high ws commonly corresponds to high transport efficiency which then contributes to increased water vapor production and increased et mcvicar et al 2012 however tem and ws were significantly correlated with et t and t et in the southeast of the lrb with abundant precipitation and low altitude fig 5 suggesting a relatively high water storage in this area heilman et al 2012 ndvi was the dominant factor that controlled et in the northwest and central areas of the lrb where large areas of forestland increased t and et showed similar spatial distributions for the partial correlation with ndvi previous studies demonstrated a positive relationship between lai dynamics and seasonal or annual t et variations li et al 2019 lian et al 2018 our results corroborate this relationship and demonstrate that lai has important implications for t et fig 9 paschalis et al 2018 investigated the mechanism of t et constancy in the global ecosystem and found that vegetation adaptations to the local climate result in covariations in leaf area and rainfall characteristics that limit t et this limitation stems from the mutual feedback between et t and evaporation which may be constrained by water or energy availability 5 4 implications for ecohydrology an increase in et and the related drivers will alter water energy and carbon balance under the influences of changing climate and vegetation restoration first an increase in et may change the water balance both et and t exhibited a negative relationship with the runoff coefficient fig 10 previous studies have also revealed that vegetation restoration and warmer and drier climates may contribute to a decrease in runoff zhang et al 2016a in addition vegetation restoration causing increased et and t indicates a reduction in soil water availability as p inputs have not increased significantly in recent decades fig s3 second an increase in et may change the energy dynamics for given radiation a higher et means more latent heat and less sensible heat which may influence the land surface properties changes in the land surface properties can affect vegetation growth through their regulatory effects on photosynthesis yang et al 2019 third an increase in et may change the carbon balance a higher et implies higher carbon sequestration thus as the rate of carbon assimilation increases more plants will grow leading to more water uptake by plants 5 5 uncertainties and future improvements despite our improvements to the vic model and its reasonable performance in simulating runoff and et processes in the lrb it is essential to consider uncertainties of the results for example the model tended to underestimate the peak flow chawla and mujumdar 2015 and hiep et al 2018 documented similar mismatches in the vic model this underestimation of peak flow might be related to the fact that reservoir storage was not validated because time series data are not available in addition the large spatial domain and homogeneously calibrated soil parameters might affect the capability of the calibration process to compensate for the absence of reservoir and epikarst therefore both model instances vic with and without epikarst and reservoirs have a good capacity in reproducing et and runoff however due to the prevalence of water resource management in land surface models an in depth understanding of the representation of reservoirs epikarst and other structures is necessary for model accuracy which highly depends on the availability of observations therefore for future studies measured data together with remote sense images should be more considered to ensure the robustness of these models with respect to epikarst and reservoir operation characteristics 6 conclusions the spatiotemporal patterns of et t and t et were analyzed based on the local calibrated vic model from 1987 to 2018 for karst and non karst areas in the lrb china the partial correlation analysis and scenario analysis were used to explore the main driving factors and the impact of vegetation restoration on et in general the improved vic model demonstrated a good ability to track et and runoff variations et t and t et over the study period increased at a rate of 2 30 mm yr 1 2 21 mm yr 1 and 0 0006 respectively we found that increase in et was mainly caused by interception evaporation for the driving factors precipitation was positively correlated with et but negatively correlated with t and t et in most areas of the lrb specifically the precipitation driven increase in et mainly occurred in karst areas whereas precipitation driven decrease in t mainly occurred in non karst areas ndvi was the predominant factor influencing et and t in the northwestern and central regions of the lrb where large areas of forestland and grassland increased in contrast tem and ws were the main driving factors of et t and t et in the southeastern regions with abundant precipitation and low altitude where large areas of cropland are present generally et and t significantly correlated with meteorological factors in karst areas suggesting that karst areas are subject to climate change after vegetation restoration et and t et showed significant differences in karst areas but not in non karst areas indicating that ecological restoration in karst areas is more prominent credit

3110,evapotranspiration et is a vital factor in terrestrial water and energy cycles exploring the spatiotemporal variations in et and transpiration t can improve our understanding of the role of vegetation restoration in the context of climate change karst ecosystems are particularly sensitive and vulnerable to environmental change in this study we investigated the spatiotemporal changes of et t and the transpiration fraction t et in the longjiang river basin lrb of southwest china from 1987 to 2018 using the variable infiltration capacity vic model in karst areas the original third soil layer in the vic model was modified to an epikarst zone and a reservoir module was integrated with the model model validation and evaluation showed that the modified vic model performed well in fitting the observations of runoff and et during the 32 year study period et t and t et increased by 2 30 mm yr 1 2 21 mm yr 1 and 0 0006 respectively with the significant increase concentrated in areas with increased forestland high positive correlations between ndvi and et t and t et were observed in areas where forestland and grassland increased temperature and wind speed were positively correlated with et t and t et in areas with low altitude and abundant precipitation where large areas of cropland are present there was a positive correlation between precipitation and et in karst areas whereas the negative correlation between precipitation and t was mainly occurred in non karst areas the scenario analysis based on different land use data revealed that et and t et exhibited significant differences in karst areas but not in non karst areas indicating that karst areas were more affected by ecological restoration moreover t did not show a significant increase after vegetation restoration suggesting that increased et was mainly caused by evaporation this study provides insights into the effects of vegetation restoration and climate change on et t and t et under different geological conditions and can help implement appropriate afforestation strategies in different geological settings keywords evapotranspiration transpiration fraction vegetation restoration climate change longjiang river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as a crucial variable in surface hydrological processes and energy exchange in terrestrial ecosystems evapotranspiration et plays an important role in water allocation and water resource management jin et al 2017 ma et al 2019 by returning 60 of global terrestrial precipitation to the atmosphere et directly affects the water supply capacity of surface ecosystems wang et al 2021 transpiration t is usually coupled with canopy conductance and vegetation activity therefore investigating et and t fraction t et is important for estimating water budgets and understanding ecosystem water use efficiency wang et al 2014 recent studies have demonstrated that climate change and large scale vegetation restoration substantially influence et and t et at multiple spatiotemporal scales yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2018b in some areas anthropogenic revegetation facilitates ecological recovery and improves local ecosystems liao et al 2018 qiao et al 2021 however ecologically fragile ecosystems are extremely sensitive to hydrological processes induced by anthropogenic activities hao et al 2016 wang et al 2020a thus a thorough understanding of the spatiotemporal patterns of et and t et and their response to climate change and vegetation restoration is crucial for ensuring efficient water resource use and protection of the ecological environment numerous methods exist for quantifying et and t et and related drivers these methods predominantly include field based experimental methods e g sap flow lysimeter and eddy covariance techniques and several standard equations e g penman equation tie et al 2018 wang et al 2018 yang et al 2021 however most methods are constrained to the site or field scale and are difficult to apply on a regional scale because of limitations in the local soil vegetation and climate conditions conversely remote sensing offers a cost effective method for determining vegetation characteristics and estimating et and t et at a high spatiotemporal resolution and large spatial scale zhang et al 2016b as remote sensing products cannot illustrate the physical relationships between et and t et and different drivers nor predict changes in et and t et various physical hydrological models or land surface models are employed to explore the response of et and t et to climate and vegetation changes bai et al 2019 dash et al 2021 yang et al 2021 based on a simplified water balance approach land surface models lsms achieve effective regional et estimates under data poor conditions sun et al 2021 the variable infiltration capacity vic model is one such lsm that considers et and t in detail liang and xie 2003 moreover the vic model considers the hydrological interactions between soil vegetation and the atmosphere as well as the sub grid heterogeneity of land cover which facilitates a more accurate simulation of the impacts of climate change and vegetation restoration on et and transpiration fraction dash et al 2021 zhang et al 2021c previous findings have demonstrated that land use and climate precipitation temperature wind speed etc affect water energy availability and lead to spatiotemporal variations in the et process for example vegetation restoration has been shown to cause increases in et and t et bai et al 2019 lian et al 2018 in contrast xie et al 2015 showed that afforestation has a slight impact on hydrological processes moreover many studies have indicated that variations in et are affected by precipitation xie et al 2015 yang et al 2016b whereas others suggested that afforestation is the dominant factor affecting et variations bai et al 2019 jin et al 2017 meanwhile great efforts have been made to analyze the et and related processes in karst areas for example zhang et al 2018a compared et variations and their drivers in three agroforestry ecosystems heilman et al 2012 compared water and energy fluxes in two different ecosystems on the edwards plateau and concluded that the water storage capacity limited the increase in et liu et al 2016 investigated the impacts of climate and landforms on et in 13 karst basins based on the budyko hypothesis however their study did not contrast the differences in et and t et and potential mechanism between karst and non karst areas the karst landscape in southwest china is one of the largest continuous karst areas in the world characterized by shallow surface soil and the underneath epikarst layer a more porous and permeable zone compared to the overlying soil wang et al 2020b williams 2008 even with abundant precipitation it is still prone to engineering water shortage tan et al 2021 since the implementation of the grain to green project in 2000 2001 the southwest karst region has experienced remarkable shifts in land use or land cover as shown by the conversion of large areas of cropland to grassland or forest zhang et al 2021a with more intense vegetation restoration presented during 2001 2016 than during 1982 2000 zhang et al 2021b thus the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi showed increasing trends after 2002 lian et al 2020 however massive afforestation may have negative effects on ecohydrological processes including soil desiccation poor vegetation development and fragmented distribution of vegetation communities which may also be related to bedrock weathering and climate change li et al 2018 in karst areas soil layer is thin and epikarst comprises highly weathered carbonate rock beneath the surface or extensively exposed at the surface which is the key region different from the non karst areas highly weathered carbonate rock could constrain vegetation growth due to the rapid infiltration of water into epikarst thus the epikarst zone plays an important role in the karst hydrological process and vegetation growth moreover the southwest karst region is affected by climate change with decreasing rainfall and an increased risk of drought over the past 60 years liu et al 2014 despite the importance of et and t as indicators of water availability in terrestrial ecosystems the controls and mechanisms underlying the spatiotemporal changes in et and t et in karst areas remain poorly understood the main objective of this study is to clarify the response of et and t et to climate change and vegetation restoration in the longjiang river basin lrb under two different geological conditions karst and non karst areas the presence of reservoir can alter the downstream hydrological behavior thus the distributed vic hydrological model was improved by adding a reservoir module meanwhile as the epikarst is the core region different from the non karst areas the original third soil layer in the vic model was modified to an epikarst zone then we conducted two model simulations with and without epikarst and reservoirs to evaluate the model performance spatiotemporal pattern of et and t et and their change attributed to climate and vegetation restoration were investigated using mann kendall trend test and partial correlation analysis we aim to address the following scientific question how do vegetation restoration and climate change affect et and t et in two areas with different geological backgrounds 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the longjiang river basin lrb is a second order tributary of the xijiang river in the pearl river system originating from sandu county guizhou province and meandering for approximately 358 km in a northwest to southeast direction before converging into the liujiang river fig 1 a the study region covers a total drainage area of 15 820 km2 and has an elevation of 65 1665 m the region is characterized by a subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual temperature of 21 c and annual precipitation of 1490 mm of which 70 90 is concentrated between april and september resulting in significant seasonal variations in runoff the annual runoff in the region is 13 2 109 m3 of which 85 40 occurs in the flood season vegetation coverage is high with 97 88 and 98 41 of the lrb covered by forestland grassland and crop natural vegetation mosaic in 2001 and 2015 respectively whereas urban and built up land only represents a small area of the catchment 0 38 and 0 42 fig 1b the region is a typical karst basin dominated by carbonate 56 4 and impure carbonate rocks 23 8 consisting mainly of highly soluble limestone dolomite mixed limestone dolomite and their intercalation with other rocks fig 1c non carbonate rocks 19 8 predominantly clastic rocks are distributed in the east of the lrb 2 2 data preparation topographic data used to extract the channel river network were collected

gleam was compared with our simulated et results to validate the performance of the vic model https www gleam eu gleam et is an advanced lsm that utilizes satellite forcing datasets to yield a global et product at a spatial resolution of 0 25 gleam et is divided into transpiration interception loss soil evaporation open water evaporation and snow sublimation the priestley and taylor equations in gleam calculate the potential et based on the surface net radiation and near surface air temperature potential et was converted into actual transpiration or bare soil evaporation using a cover dependent and multiplicative stress factor s based on observations of microwave vegetation optical depth and estimates of root zone soil moisture interception loss was calculated separately using a gash analytical model gash 1979 and further refined by valente et al 1997 estimates of actual evaporation for water bodies and regions covered by ice and or snow were based on a modified priestley taylor equation considering its ability to estimate et and exhibit good agreement with fluxne measurements gleam et product has been widely employed to detect and validate the spatiotemporal pattern of et martens et al 2016 talsma et al 2018 yang et al 2017 in this study gleam v3 5a was applied to a 32 year period from 1987 to 2018 3 methodology 3 1 vic hydrological model the vic model is a grid based macroscale land surface hydrological model that considers both water and energy balances originally proposed by wood et al 1992 the vic model is a one layer model based on the infiltration capacity of the soil subsequently liang et al 1996 improved the model to a two layer model by incorporating the storage capacity curve of the xinanjiang model to advance the representation of soil moisture dynamics in the surface layer and diffusion processes of soil water between soil layers a 10 cm soil layer was separated from the upper soil layer therefore the model in this study has three soil column layers the vic 3l model considers both horton and dunne runoff generation mechanisms and accounts for sub grid vegetation variability by dividing each grid cell 0 1 0 1 in our study into a wealth of tiles liang and xie 2003 the total runoff of each grid cell is divided into surface runoff and baseflow surface runoff which is based on the variable infiltration curve is generated only from the top two soil layers and baseflow occurs only in the bottom layer as calculated by the arno model franchini and pacciani 1991 considering that the vic model only generates runoff yield data the lohmann routing model was added to obtain runoff values at the outlet of the basin lohmann et al 1996 the presence of reservoir and dam affects downstream hydrological behavior hence a reservoir module is integrated with this routing model the reservoir module was developed considering the reservoir operation which relied on rule curves or operating rules dang et al 2020 the specifications of reservoir information including design aspects e g dead and critical water levels and reservoir operation parameters e g operating approach maximum and minimum water levels are provided in table 1 the vic model computes total et based on three major components i e vegetation transpiration t canopy interception evaporation ec and soil evaporation es 1 et i 1 n c i e c i t i c n 1 e s where ci is the fraction of vegetation cover for the it h vegetation class in a grid cn 1 is the fraction of bare soil in a grid t reflects the influence of radiation soil moisture vapor pressure deficit air

the maximum canopy evaporation ec for the it h vegetation class is specified as 3 e c w i w im 2 3 et p r w r w r 0 evaporation from bare soil es occurs only in the first layer in the vic model es is

maximum infiltration capacity mm d 1 io is the point infiltration capacity mm d 1 and can be expressed as 5 i o i m 1 1 a 1 b i where a is the proportion of area with infiltration capacity less than io bi is the infiltration shape parameter to adapt to the specific structure of karst geomorphology the third layer of the model was modified as an epikarst zone for karst areas whereas all three layers were soil for non karst areas epikarst is the first karst development layer below the soil or surface it is an important element within the karst critical zone the epikarst layer is a vertical extension of the soil where the climate plant roots and geology form a more porous and permeable zone compared to the overlying soil and non karst areas given the unique conditions of the epikarst zone the soil and epikarst parameters were set separately soil parameters such as bulk density and porosity were derived from the fao unesco soil database since the average soil thickness in the lrb is about 90 cm fig s1 the thickness of the first and second soil layers is set at 10 cm and 80 cm respectively due to saturated hydraulic conductivity ks being related to bulk density and soil texture the calculation of ks was revised based on the formula used by dash et al 2020 6 log k s 9 56 0 81 log p silt 1 09 log p clay 4 64 b d where psilt and pclay are the percentage of silt and clay respectively bd is bulk density g cm 3 epikarst parameters were acquired from related references and experimental data for the mulian catchment of huanjiang station which is a typical cockpit karst catchment in the study area wang et al 2020a the porosity of epikarst ranges from 1 to 10 exhibiting strong heterogeneity in previous research the porosity is generally set to 10 xu et al 2020 zhang et al 2011 the mean epikarst bd of 2 4 g cm 3 is close to that of 2 5 g cm 3 from field investigations in our study area wang et al 2020b considering the plant rooting depth and the water that plant can utilize from underlying rock fissures the epikarst thickness is set to 2 m cai et al 2022 xu et al 2020 zhang et al 2011 plant rooting depth is a vital parameter for regulating hydrological processes and surface atmosphere interactions the fraction of plant roots is typically set according to the proposed fractions of different plant functional types most plant roots 89 in the karst landscape are distributed in the topsoil layer and become less abundant with depth ni et al 2015 nie et al 2014 therefore in our study area the approximate fraction of plant roots in the soil and epikarst layer was set to 0 8 and 0 2 for woodland and 0 9 and 0 1 for grassland in karst areas and 0 7 and 0 3 for woodland and 0 8 and 0 2 for grassland in non karst areas respectively gerten et al 2004 yang et al 2016a 3 2 model calibration and validation despite the above physical based parameters the vic model incorporates other types of parameters that cannot be measured or are difficult to obtain because of their high heterogeneity the physical meanings and ranges of these parameters are listed in table 2 the rosenbrock method a typical function test problem in unconstrained optimization theory and method was adopted to calibrate the vic model by adjusting the aforementioned parameters rosenbrock 1960 two years of data 1985 1986 were used for model spin up followed by twenty years 1987 2006 of data for calibration and twelve years 2007 2018 of data for validation the performance of model simulations for et and t was first calibrated based on the determination coefficient r2 and percent bias pbias the formulas are expressed as follows 7 r 2 i 1 n x i obs x i obs x i sim x i sim i 1 n x i obs x i obs 2 i 1 n x i sim x i sim 2 2 8 pbias i 1 n x i obs x i sim i 1 n x i obs 100 where n is study period and i is the year ranging from 1 to n x i obs and x i obs are the observations in year i and average observations during the study period and x i sim and x i sim are the simulated values in year i and average simulations during the study period besides the direct calibration using gleam et and t the indirect validation was also performed based on streamflow observations using two extensively employed performance metrics nash sutcliffe coefficient nse and kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 nash and sutcliffe 1970 these two indicators are calculated by the following formulas 9 nse 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i μ o 2 10 kge 1 r 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 11 β μ s μ 0 12 γ cv s cv o σ s μ s σ o μ o where o i and s i are the observed and simulated runoff values respectively μ o is the average observed runoff r denotes the pearson correlation coefficient β and γ are the bias ratio and variability ratio respectively μ s is the mean simulated runoff σ s and σ o represent the standard deviation of simulated and observed runoff respectively 3 3 impact of vegetation restoration on et and t et to explore the impact of vegetation restoration on et t and t et different land use or land cover data lucc were used to run the calibrated vic model during the variation period 2003 2018 first land cover lai and albedo data from 2005 2010 and 2015 were employed to estimate et values for the real vegetation scenario etwith veg the information represents three periods 2003 2007 2005 2008 2012 2010 and 2013 2018 2015 then the vic model was forced using data lucc lai and albedo from 2001 to estimate et values without vegetation restoration etwithout veg the differences between etwith veg and etwithout veg can be considered the effect of vegetation restoration on et furthermore the impact of vegetation restoration on t and t et was also analyzed 3 4 statistical analysis the sen s slope mann kendall trend test and abrupt test were employed to determine the trend magnitude and significance of et t and t et and investigate the abrupt change point in the annual et and t time series sen s slope is a robust non parametric trend method that is insensitive to measurement errors and outliers sen 1968 the formula for calculating the change rate is as follows 13 β m e d i a n x j x i j i j i where β is the change rate and xi and xj are the et t and t et values in year i and j β 0 indicates an increasing trend and β 0 indicates a decreasing trend the mk trend test is also a non parametric method that is widely used for the detection of trends without considering underlying distributional assumptions and missing values β and z values are used to evaluate the magnitude of the trend and the significance test in sen s slope and mk trend test respectively a positive z value indicates an increasing trend z 0 indicates an unchanged time series and a negative z value indicates a decreasing trend kendall 1975 mann 1945 a significant trend occurs if z 1 96 95 significance level similarly if the intersection of forward and backward sequences in the abrupt test occurs beyond 1 96 then a critical change point can be identified in that period analysis of variance anova was used to analyze the significance of the differences in et t and t et under different land use scenarios one way anova assumes that the observations within each group are normally distributed and that the data are homoscedastic that is the standard deviations are equal before we accept or reject the null hypothesis we conduct significance tests such as the tukey kramer test least significant difference and duncan test precipitation p temperature tem wind speed ws and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi were selected as the main driving factors to explore their effects on et t and t et since the ndvi data are available from 1982 to 2015 partial correlation analysis was performed for each pixel during 1987 2015 the partial correlation coefficient r denotes the degree of correlation between et and each driving factor where all other driving factors were controlled 4 results 4 1 model validation and evaluation first we evaluated the model performance for simulating et and t dynamics as their accuracy is essential for analyzing the impacts of vegetation restoration and climate factors on et besides the direct calibration between simulated et and gleam et indirect validation was performed based on monthly runoff simulations and observations we calibrated two instances of vic with and without epikarst and reservoirs results showed that both model instances have a good capacity for tracking the et and t dynamics during 1987 2018 simulated and gleam derived outputs were all around the 1 1 line with r2 ranging from 0 73 to 0 90 fig 2 compared with the original vic model the r2 of improved model increased to 0 90 0 88 and the pbias decreased by 4 14 4 66 for et t during the calibration period thereby improving the simulation effect of the model the comparison results between the monthly runoff simulations and observations are shown in fig 3 similarly both model instances have the same accuracy in reproducing runoff with regard to simulated runoff considering karst and reservoir influence the nse and kge increased to 0 65 and 0 66 respectively 4 2 spatiotemporal pattern of et t and t et the regional average time series 1987 2018 exhibited increasing trends in et t and t et with gradients of 2 30 mm yr 1 2 21 mm yr 1 and 0 0006 respectively fig 4 as shown in fig s2 an abrupt change point in annual et t and t et values was detected in 2002 2004 and 2004 respectively before the abrupt change et t and t et increased at rates of 1 61 mm yr 1 1 14 mm yr 1 and 0 0007 respectively after the abrupt change the slope of et t and t et were all higher with mean rates of 2 02 mm yr 1 2 22 mm yr 1 and 0 0002 respectively the mean annual et during 1987 2018 ranged from 586 66 to 951 20 mm with higher values typically observed in the southeastern regions and lower values largely in the northeastern regions fig 4d a similar pattern was identified in the annual t values annual t et varied from 0 44 to 0 76 with higher t et in the central area of the lrb fig 4f the et and t time series showed significant increasing trends in most areas of the lrb with mean values of 2 22 and 2 24 mm yr 1 respectively only small parts in the southeast and central part of the lrb showed decreasing trends the rate of t et variation ranged from 0 0024 to 0 0035 et t and t et presented significant increasing trends in the middle and eastern regions of the lrb where large areas of forestland increased 4 3 correlations between driving forces and et and t et to spatially analyze the effect of driving forces on the et process we performed the partial correlation analysis between et t and t et and meteorological factors and ndvi for each pixel from 1987 to 2015 fig 5 generally et was positively correlated with driving forces significant correlations between et and p and ws were observed in the southeastern and central regions fig 5a and g whereas ndvi was significantly correlated with et in the northwestern and central regions where large areas of forestland and grassland increased fig 5j stronger correlations between et and p and ws were observed in karst areas however the partial correlation coefficient between et and ndvi was generally higher in non karst areas than in karst areas a negative correlation between p and t was found in 63 33 of the study area fig 5b whereas the other driving forces were positively correlated with t t had significant correlations with tem and ws in the southeastern regions of the lrb fig 5e and h the significant correlation between t and p and ndvi was mainly distributed in a small part of the central and eastern regions fig 5b and k correlations between t and tem and ws tended to be stronger in karst areas fig 5e and h whereas those between t and p tended to be stronger in non karst areas negative correlations between p and t et were found in 92 22 of the study area fig 5c with high correlation distributed in the central and southeastern regions t et had significant correlations with tem in the southeastern regions of the lrb whereas ndvi showed no significant correlation with t et overall there was a high correlation between t et and p and tem in karst areas whereas a strong correlation between t et and ws was observed in non karst areas fig 5i 4 4 effects of vegetation restoration on et and t et based on the scenario analysis vegetation restoration increased the et and t fig 6 et exhibited significant increasing trends with rates of 4 91 whereas t insignificantly increased by 2 24 as the increase rate of et is greater than that of t t et tends to decrease after vegetation restoration etwith veg was higher than etwithout veg in 91 11 of the study area with only several pixels showing the opposite trend in the southeast and northwest of the lrb fig 7 a c the spatial pattern of t was similar to that of et with an increase in 73 89 of the study area fig 7d f as a consequence t et showed decreasing trends in 97 22 of the study area with a mean change rate of 2 58 figs 6 and 7g i overall et and t increased considerably in the eastern regions where large areas of forestland increased but decreased in the southeastern regions where large areas of cropland are present after vegetation restoration et and t in karst areas increased by 38 53 mm and 11 56 mm respectively whereas t et decreased by 0 02 fig 8 et and t et showed significant differences under vegetation change scenarios in karst areas the increase in et and t in karst areas was less than that in non karst areas especially for t however there were no significant differences among et t and t et in non karst areas 5 discussion 5 1 performance of the vic model soil and epikarst thicknesses dsoil and depi and related properties are fundamental parameters that influence hydrological processes in this study the third layer of the vic model was defined as an epikarst zone for karst areas whereas all three layers were soil for the non karst areas generally depi varies in space ranging from 2 to 20 m or more liu et al 2020 wang et al 2020a zhang et al 2011 however the upper epikarst where the fissure network was strongly developed was usually modeled xu et al 2020 simulated the average depi with a range from 2 4 m to 9 8 m using the varkarst hydrological model similarly cai et al 2022 set depi to 2 m in their model overall the epikarst zone was included with reasonable parameters based on references and local field investigation the simulated results provide acceptable et and runoff estimates first monthly et and t data were used to calibrate the vic model based on two instances of vic with and without epikarst and reservoirs second to further ascertain the validity of the runoff estimation we also compared the vic estimated runoff with observations the improved model showed r2 nse kge increased and pbias decreased thereby improving the model performance although some research claimed that the vic model might overestimate or underestimate et values dash et al 2020 hiep et al 2018 the locally calibrated vic model could improve the et estimates billah et al 2015 overall both model instances showed a similar trend in the et and flow regime the calibration process may compensate for the absence of epikarst and reservoir structure by adjusting the soil parameter values that can capture the alterations caused by reservoirs or epikarst thereby yielding an acceptable model performance dang et al 2020 5 2 variations in et and t et and their response to vegetation restoration the mean annual et and t were 842 98 and 620 16 mm yr 1 during 1987 2018 being similar to the field scale findings in karst areas with annual t ranging from 626 to 701 mm yr 1 du et al 2021 the estimated t et ratio varied from 0 44 to 0 76 which is acceptable according to the results for global terrestrial ecosystems 35 80 coenders gerrits et al 2014 good et al 2015 also reported that t accounted for 64 13 of et when calculated using two flux methods consistent with the previous study niu et al 2019 the t et of the forest ecosystems located in the central area of the lrb was generally higher than that of the non forest ecosystems in the southeast of the lrb previous findings have indicated that vegetation restoration is important for vegetation growth cai et al 2022 li et al 2018 china s ecological restoration projects implemented over the past decades are regarded as highly ambitious with billions of trees planted to improve the ecological environment and drive greening trends vulnerable karst ecosystems are a priority target for restoration projects thus numerous ecological policies and projects have been implemented in this area notably vegetation greening and biomass carbon have increased significantly tong et al 2018 therefore as the main human activity in the study area vegetation restoration exhibited a substantial impact on et variation peng et al 2021 also demonstrated that the positive effect of human activities began to increase in 2000 and areas of increasing lai as a result of human activities developed a steady spatial distribution in 2004 vegetation dynamics affect et processes by regulating interception surface roughness and albedo yang et al 2022 the results of the scenario analysis showed a considerable increase in et and t after vegetation restoration comparison between etwithout veg and etwith veg however the increase in t was not significant indicating that the increase in et was mainly caused by interception evaporation fig 6 this can be largely explained by the fact that the area of forestland continuously increased with a net increase of 1 155 51 km2 accounting for 88 28 of the total net increase in land use area in the lrb from lucc2001 to lucc2015 table 3 this finding is consistent with the work of lian et al 2020 who reported annual ndvi improved after vegetation restoration and human activity was the main cause of increased non flood season runoff in the lrb in addition et and t increased more in non karst areas than those in karst areas this result could be attributed to increased forestland distribution in non karst areas which are less affected by human activities due to their high altitude cai et al 2022 also found that annual lai increased at a higher rate in non karst areas than that in karst areas from period 1992 2003 to period 2004 2015 5 3 spatial differences of primary environmental controlling regulations for et and t et three climate factors p tem and ws and ndvi values were used to explore the primary environmental controlling regulations for et and t et at the pixel scale we found that increased p can increase et but reduce t and t et fig 5 which is consistent with previous studies niu et al 2019 this result indicated that the increased et was caused by increased interception losses and soil evaporation generally p was conducive to vegetation growth similar results were observed by nagler et al 2007 who reported that annual et was mainly influenced by summer p in grassland and shrubland ecosystems qiao et al 2021 also observed a strong correlation between p and ndvi in most karst areas specifically the p driven increase in et mainly occurred in karst areas while the p driven decrease in t mainly occurred in non karst areas fig 5 the main reason for this is that karst areas are characterized by thin soil and high infiltration capacity therefore increased p can increase the amount of water available in karst ecosystems for non karst ecosystems increased p may reduce the solar radiation and thus decrease t du et al 2021 also suggested that climax forest communities in karst areas were generally not limited by water tem and ws showed positive effects on et t and t et in the southeast of the lrb tem can increase et both directly and indirectly on the one hand rising tem causes an increase in the vapor pressure deficit and atmospheric water demand thereby affecting plant photosynthesis and transpiration zhao et al 2022 on the other hand increased tem could elevate soil and canopy evaporation followed by increasing et previous studies have indicated that the warming induced growing season length is significantly correlated with et hwang et al 2018 ws is a crucial indicator dominating the efficiency of water vapor transfer between the canopy and atmosphere a high ws commonly corresponds to high transport efficiency which then contributes to increased water vapor production and increased et mcvicar et al 2012 however tem and ws were significantly correlated with et t and t et in the southeast of the lrb with abundant precipitation and low altitude fig 5 suggesting a relatively high water storage in this area heilman et al 2012 ndvi was the dominant factor that controlled et in the northwest and central areas of the lrb where large areas of forestland increased t and et showed similar spatial distributions for the partial correlation with ndvi previous studies demonstrated a positive relationship between lai dynamics and seasonal or annual t et variations li et al 2019 lian et al 2018 our results corroborate this relationship and demonstrate that lai has important implications for t et fig 9 paschalis et al 2018 investigated the mechanism of t et constancy in the global ecosystem and found that vegetation adaptations to the local climate result in covariations in leaf area and rainfall characteristics that limit t et this limitation stems from the mutual feedback between et t and evaporation which may be constrained by water or energy availability 5 4 implications for ecohydrology an increase in et and the related drivers will alter water energy and carbon balance under the influences of changing climate and vegetation restoration first an increase in et may change the water balance both et and t exhibited a negative relationship with the runoff coefficient fig 10 previous studies have also revealed that vegetation restoration and warmer and drier climates may contribute to a decrease in runoff zhang et al 2016a in addition vegetation restoration causing increased et and t indicates a reduction in soil water availability as p inputs have not increased significantly in recent decades fig s3 second an increase in et may change the energy dynamics for given radiation a higher et means more latent heat and less sensible heat which may influence the land surface properties changes in the land surface properties can affect vegetation growth through their regulatory effects on photosynthesis yang et al 2019 third an increase in et may change the carbon balance a higher et implies higher carbon sequestration thus as the rate of carbon assimilation increases more plants will grow leading to more water uptake by plants 5 5 uncertainties and future improvements despite our improvements to the vic model and its reasonable performance in simulating runoff and et processes in the lrb it is essential to consider uncertainties of the results for example the model tended to underestimate the peak flow chawla and mujumdar 2015 and hiep et al 2018 documented similar mismatches in the vic model this underestimation of peak flow might be related to the fact that reservoir storage was not validated because time series data are not available in addition the large spatial domain and homogeneously calibrated soil parameters might affect the capability of the calibration process to compensate for the absence of reservoir and epikarst therefore both model instances vic with and without epikarst and reservoirs have a good capacity in reproducing et and runoff however due to the prevalence of water resource management in land surface models an in depth understanding of the representation of reservoirs epikarst and other structures is necessary for model accuracy which highly depends on the availability of observations therefore for future studies measured data together with remote sense images should be more considered to ensure the robustness of these models with respect to epikarst and reservoir operation characteristics 6 conclusions the spatiotemporal patterns of et t and t et were analyzed based on the local calibrated vic model from 1987 to 2018 for karst and non karst areas in the lrb china the partial correlation analysis and scenario analysis were used to explore the main driving factors and the impact of vegetation restoration on et in general the improved vic model demonstrated a good ability to track et and runoff variations et t and t et over the study period increased at a rate of 2 30 mm yr 1 2 21 mm yr 1 and 0 0006 respectively we found that increase in et was mainly caused by interception evaporation for the driving factors precipitation was positively correlated with et but negatively correlated with t and t et in most areas of the lrb specifically the precipitation driven increase in et mainly occurred in karst areas whereas precipitation driven decrease in t mainly occurred in non karst areas ndvi was the predominant factor influencing et and t in the northwestern and central regions of the lrb where large areas of forestland and grassland increased in contrast tem and ws were the main driving factors of et t and t et in the southeastern regions with abundant precipitation and low altitude where large areas of cropland are present generally et and t significantly correlated with meteorological factors in karst areas suggesting that karst areas are subject to climate change after vegetation restoration et and t et showed significant differences in karst areas but not in non karst areas indicating that ecological restoration in karst areas is more prominent credit

3111,high energy outburst floods triggered by failure of landslide and glacial dams have strongly impacted rivers in eastern tibet affecting river geomorphology human settlements and infrastructure however understanding the impact of these extreme outburst floods on river landscape evolution is hampered due to lack of event based observations the second largest modern outburst flood recorded in the yigong river in 2000 provides an opportunity to investigate changes in river morphology caused by such extreme floods by combining remote sensing images from 1984 to 2020 and 2 d numerical flood simulations with the hydrologic engineering center s river analysis system hec ras software we show that the riverbank displacement during the yigong outburst flood ygof is an order of magnitude greater than that in other periods channel migration and variation in channel width in the upper reach ur straths are greater than those in the down reach dr gorges and the curvature of the ur was greatly reduced by the ygof while that of the dr increased furthermore the channel morphology after the ygof has become more dynamic the relationship among the product of the dimensionless curvature w

potential to significantly affect geomorphic evolution and channel dynamics of rivers liu et al 2019 lamb and fonstad 2010 the lake outburst floods frequently affect rivers along the margins of the tibetan plateau in many ways montgomery et al 2004 korup et al 2006 gupta and sah 2008 korup and montgomery 2008 korup et al 2010 turzewski et al 2019 high magnitude glacial lake outburst floods have an enhanced ability to mobilize boulder armored accelerating bedrock incision cook et al 2018 large outburst floods strengthen the lateral scour of hillslope toes increasing hillslope gradients and leading to many flood triggered landslides larsen and montgomery 2012 turzewski et al 2019 suggested that outburst floods have a potentially strong influence on mountainous landscapes cook et al 2018 concluded that long term valley evolution in the himalayas may be driven by glacial lake outburst flood frequency and magnitude rather than by precipitation dependent erosion rapid changes of river geomorphology by so called ancient megafloods with peak discharges 1 0 106 m3 s have been revealed by concrete geological evidence on earth and mars such as bedrock grooves basin like potholes streamline hills and huge boulder bars baker 1973 2002 baker and milton 1974 bretz 1923 carling 1996 gupta et al 2007 komatsu et al 2009 lamb et al 2008 malde 1968 o connor 1993 rudoy 2002 in contrast to the megafloods most of similar studies of modern floods focus on low magnitude flood events due to infrequency of high energy floods cook et al 2018 lamb and fonstad 2010 such knowledge on the low magnitude floods has little help in understanding the processes and geomorphological effects of extreme modern and paleo floods because of the great difference in the order of magnitudes moreover a detailed investigation on erosion and deposition of high energy modern floods probably gives a clue of some geomorphic effects of the paleofloods quantifying planform changes of large and actively migrating plain rivers worldwide over a time scale of decades is extremely important for determining the controlling factors of channel migration advancing the theory of river morphodynamics and understanding the roles of climate and human influence on river plane changes gautier et al 2007 baki and gan 2012 gupta et al 2013 frias et al 2015 schwendel et al 2015 schwenk et al 2015 schwenk et al 2017 a growing number of studies have utilized remote sensing imagery to quantify the channel dynamics of major rivers such as those in the tropical amazon kalliola et al 1992 yang et al 1999 baki and gan 2012 gupta et al 2013 constantine et al 2014 schwendel et al 2015 however few studies have investigated the spatial and temporal variations in channel dynamics over rugged topography especially rapid channel changes during high energy flood events the high energy ygof in 2000 has been well documented in terms of its geometric characteristics of landslide dams duration of reservoir impoundment breach timing peak discharge geomorphic and sedimentary record and impact on downstream areas shang et al 2003 evans and delaney 2011 delaney and evans 2015 wu et al 2020 carling and fan 2020 although numerical simulations have been used to reconstruct outburst flood hydraulics delaney and evans 2015 turzewski et al 2019 few studies have discussed the drastic changes in river channels in response to the ygof based on field surveys details of outburst flood hydraulics can help us better understand the processes of outburst flood erosion and its influences on river morphology and the extent to which they might fundamentally differ from the processes of monsoonal floods turzewski et al 2019 to investigate the strong influence of the ygof on the landscape evolution of mountainous river and the relationship between the hydraulics and channel morphology characteristics we interpreted the landsat remote sensing imagery from 1984 to 2020 and aerial images for over 18 km of the yigong river and simulated the ygof hydraulics of the research stretch our findings highlight that high energy outburst floods play an extremely important role in the landscape evolution of the tibetan plateau s eastern margin and thus are helpful for the understanding of outburst flood hydraulics 2 background the eastern himalayas are one of the most rapidly uplifting and eroding regions worldwide and are characterized by extreme topographic relief and frequent earthquakes turzewski et al 2019 deep cutting alpine and gorge landforms in the yarlung tsangpo river drainage area has formed due to the strong geomorphic effect of gravity on the landscape which sets the stage for river damming and outburst floods ren et al 2001 the yigong river originates from the southern foot of the nyenchen tonglha mountains in northwestern jiali county and meanders 295 km to the confluence at the tongmai bridge fig 1 b shang et al 2003 the warm wet current from the indian ocean steered by the yarlung tsangpo gorge and the n s oriented boshula mountain range leads to the formation of a tongue like rain belt projecting northward into the yigong region sun 1996 according to 1951 2011 data from the yigong meteorological station the mean annual rainfall in the yigong area is approximately 810 1250 mm zhou et al 2016 the rainfall from april to october accounts for 90 of the annual total rainfall while the dry season occurs from november to february shang et al 2003 as most of the yigong river drainage area is covered by glaciers meltwater from glaciers and snow cover provides more than 60 of the total river flow as its temperature increases abruptly shang et al 2003 at 8p m on april 9 2000 a large rock avalanche occurred with a volume of approximately 1 15 108 m3 delaney and evans 2015 at zhamu creek of the yigong river in southeastern tibet fig 1a 1b the whole process lasted approximately 10 min and covered a horizontal distance of 8 km and a vertical elevation difference of 3330 m from its source at 5520 m to its fan at 2190 m shang et al 2003 consequently a large accumulation body approximately 2 5 km in length and 1 0 km in width shang et al 2003 suddenly dammed the yigong river the maximum thickness of the dam was approximately 90 m with a minimum thickness of 55 m shang et al 2003 the water level of yigong lake rose by approximately 54 m during the following 62 days shang et al 2003 at 6 a m on june 8 the impounded water began to drain through a spillway then the dam breached catastrophically at 9p m on june 10 shang et al 2003 xu et al 2008 subsequently the ygof abruptly increased the water level downstream by more than 50 m shang et al 2003 and destroyed almost all of the highways and infrastructure across the yigong river fig 2 the peak discharge recorded at the tongmai bridge was estimated as 1 26 105 m3 s zhu et al 2003 1 2 105 m3 s shang et al 2003 and 1 24 105 m3 s ma 2006 with a peak water depth of 52 m hu et al 2021 according to delaney and evans 2015 a simulated peak discharge of 1 1 105 m3 s maximum flow depth of 54 9 m and maximum velocity of 14 57 m s were estimated at the tongmai bridge near the confluence of the yigong and parlung rivers by using the flo 2d model turzewski et al 2019 demonstrated that the simulated maximum discharge was 1 39 105 m3 s at the tongmai bridge and 1 73 105 m3 s at the breach with 2d numerical flood simulations by using geoclaw software recently hu et al 2021 showed that the maximum simulated values of velocity and flow area at the tongmai bridge were 15 7 m s and 8350 m2 respectively the flood greatly impacted the river geomorphology immediately downstream of the breach resulting in a rapid change in channel morphology and large boulder bars formed on both sides of the river channel fig 1c fig 2a 3 data and methods in order to investigate the characteristics of channel configuration and boulder bars associated with the ygof we conducted a field survey in may 2020 a handheld global positioning system gps was employed during the fieldwork we confirmed the location of prominent landforms related to the ygof and permanent features such as bridges landmarks crossroads and river channel confluences for this study the reach was divided into upper reach ur straths and down reach dr gorges taking into account the large gap in valley shape and the boundary was set at 12 3 km downstream of the yigong residual dam 3 1 data collection multitemporal landsat images spanning 1984 2020 were analyzed to quantify the channel dynamics to ensure data availability data comparability and cloud cover only low flow stage images in december that are considered as at normal water levels were selected to minimize errors in identifying morphological features a total of 9 images from 1984 1989 1994 1999 2000 2006 2011 2016 and 2020 were consequently used to construct the eight periods the first four remote sensing satellite images 30 m pixel resolution were obtained from the thematic mapper tm on landsat 5 https doi org 10 5066 f7n015tq and the 2000 2011 and 2016 data were acquired from the enhanced thematic mapper etm on landsat 7 https doi org 10 5066 f7wh2p8g with spatial resolutions of 30 m 20 m and 20 m respectively the 2006 data were retrieved from the quickbird satellite imagery of digitalglobe inc with a resolution of 0 52 m https doi org 10 5066 p9539rh2 and the 2020 data were produced by synthesizing high resolution aerial images taken by a dajiang unmanned aerial vehicle uav with a resolution of 0 05 m the resolutions of all remotely sensed images obtained from the series of landsat satellites were enhanced by using a histogram equalization algorithm as demonstrated above the locations of permanent features which are well distributed throughout the imagery and selected as ground control points gcps were used to register each landsat scene to the specific region standard universal transverse mercator utm projection 3 2 data processing and analysis a variety of automated techniques are already available for determining planform channel characteristics from remote sensing satellite images pavelsky and smith 2008 fisher et al 2013 legg et al 2014 allen and pavelsky 2015 rowland et al 2016 schwenk et al 2017 due to the high elevation extreme topographic relief high gradient hillslope and glacial coverage that create a fuzzy spectral signature resulting in classification uncertainty the manual classification method was used to digitize channel boundaries from each landsat scene yang et al 1999 gupta et al 2013 while the criterion for manual digitization of remotely sensed images taken before the ygof was the soil vegetation limit gurnell 1997 a soil water limit approach was used to confirm the river boundaries in the landsat mosaic after 2000 due to erosion and deposition associated with the ygof to improve the reliability of the river boundary data a variable controlling method was used in this study the river boundaries were manually digitized for each remotely sensed image by the same operator under the same zoom level of 1 5 000 the 18 km of the yigong river channel in the research area extracted from each remotely sensed image from the residual rock avalanche dam to the tongmai bridge was divided into segments by constructing sections that were perpendicular to the channel centerline of the reach at 100 m intervals to characterize the channel dynamics the length of the transverse line was considered the channel width w of each segment and the channel centerline was used to measure channel curvature r to determine the bankline movement of each segment spanning that period the overlay analysis method in geographic information system gis was used to compare the two banklines extracted from remotely sensed images at the start and end of each period the transversal lines at the beginning of that period were extended to intersect both banklines for the entire period and the positions of the intersection points were compared to quantify the linear change in the bankline position over that period fig 3 each subsequent period underwent the process outlined

using publicly available srtm gl1 data srtm data were acquired in february 2000 according to the peak discharge of 1 26 105 m3 s hu et al 2021 the variation in water level and lake area data over time china institute of water resources and hydropower research we calculated the hydrograph of the ygof at the breach as the initial condition fig 4 manning s roughness parameter n was calibrated using the peak discharge 126 000 m3 s and water depth 52 m at the tongmai bridge during the ygof the simulated elevation of the water surface at the tongmai bridge corresponds well with the ygof when n was set as 0 03 and 0 035 for the river channel and floodplain respectively the n values were also the suggested values for mountain streams such as the yigong river our sensitivity tests show that a 25 variation in n results in a variation of 2 68 2 87 in flood water depth and a variation of 0 15 0 2 in peak discharge therefore for all simulations n is spatially uniform and does not change over time which is consistent with previous outburst flood studies e g alho et al 2010 bohorquez et al 2016 clarke et al 2004 denlinger and o connell 2010 miyamoto et al 2006 o connor 1993 o connor and baker 1992 4 results 4 1 channel configuration the superimposed channel configuration maps of the ur and dr between 1984 and 2020 are shown in fig 5 before the ygof 1984 1999 the main changes in the river channels in the ur and dr were expansion and contraction at some locations the ygof 1999 2000 caused massive changes in the ur which mainly consisted of channel straightening and meandering downstream migration while the dr was slightly affected by floods and the channel changes were mainly widening and narrowing at some locations subsequently considerable channel migration activity and contraction occurred at 11 km in the ur during 2000 2006 whereas lateral erosion seemed to have ceased by 2011 during 2006 2011 the channel showed a prominent tendency to migrate towards the left bank and narrowed to some extent afterward the channel planform was stable in the last two periods in the dr the river channel first migrated towards the right bank in 2000 2006 and then migrated in the opposite direction during 2006 2011 during the last two periods the channel morphology in the dr was similar to that in the ur the greatest change in channel location occurred during the ygof in 2000 moreover the channel morphology of the ur was more variable than that of the dr during the study period 4 2 bank migration migrations on both banks along the course of the lower yigong river from the residual dam to the tongmai bridge during the period of 1984 2020 are shown graphically in fig 6 by superimposing these channel boundaries generally each bank had parallel sections characterized by high migration and movement in the same direction furthermore the bank migration of the ur is more dynamic than that of the dr according to the dataset obtained from measurements on the left bank the maximum bank erosion was 220 m at 8 1 km while the maximum bank accretion was 370 m at 7 3 km due to the ygof the maximum right bank encroachment on the floodplain was 360 m at 7 3 km while the maximum bank accretion was 260 m at 8 2 km during 1999 2000 bank migration during the period of 1999 2000 is an order of magnitude greater than that during other periods moreover bank migration of the ur is far larger than that of the dr 4 3 channel width the variations in the channel width along the nearly 18 km reach of the lower yigong river during different periods is illustrated in fig 7 this figure shows that the highly variable and unpredictable channel width during the ygof contrasts with the stability of the river before 2000 the maximum channel width spanning the study period was 177 m which occurred in 2000 near the boundary between the ur and dr the ygof widened the dr channel and the width at 14 5 km continued to increase even after 2000 due to the limited boundaries the most changed things are the planimetric form of the ur channel and the dimension of the dr channel 4 4 channel curvature a comparison of the pre event and post event channel configurations indicates that the main channel has undergone substantial lateral migration as illustrated in fig 8 a three reaches have undergone substantial lateral migration exceeding 200 m in the ur r1 r3 while no such changes occurred in the dr the maximum lateral migration was 318 m at r1 287 m at r2 and 369 m at r3 according to the variation in the dimensionless curvature w r before and after the outburst flood along the study reach the ur and dr also showed different characteristics in response to the high energy ygof fig 7b in the ur the change in the dimensionless curvature after the ygof plotted almost within the variation range of that before the ygof especially at r1 r3 the maximum absolute value of the dimensionless curvature at r1 r3 decreased from 0 43 0 47 and 1 99 before the ygof to 0 15 0 33 and 0 43 after the event respectively the abnormal peak dimensionless curvature of the channel at the tail of r3 before the ygof may be attributed to the molongqu creek alluvial fan that changes the river course and results in river bending in this location furthermore molongqu creek carries a large amount of sediment to the main channel forming a mid channel bar that widens the channel in this location if this extreme value is excluded the maximum absolute value of the dimensionless curvature at r3 decreases from 0 44 before the ygof to 0 43 after the ygof this phenomenon indicates that the curvature of the ur was greatly reduced under the influence of the ygof nevertheless in the dr the variation in the dimensionless curvature after the ygof exceeds the changing range of the dimensionless curvature before the ygof which showed that the curvature of the dr increased during the ygof 4 5 flood simulation the maximum flow depth of the ygof in the study area is illustrated in fig 9 at approximately 1 h the flood initially reached the tongmai bridge and the flood peak reached the tongmai bridge at 7 h which was similar to the direct observation shang et al 2003 the maximum flow depth of 53 1 m at the tongmai bridge is substantially consistent with the result of delaney and evans 2015 the whole outburst process lasted for nearly 24 h and the drainage volume was approximately 2 11 109 m3 5 discussion 5 1 implications for channel morphological changes in response to the ygof the ur straths adjacent to the breach contain well developed river terraces and the boundary material is mainly composed of gravel and coarse sand fig 10 a however the boundary material of the dr gorges is mainly composed of bedrock or colluvial deposits fig 10b the variation in the channel is not significant and mainly manifested by the widening and narrowing at some parts of the reach in the first three periods before the ygof 1984 1989 1989 1994 and 1994 1999 and the last three periods after the ygof 2006 2011 2011 2016 and 2016 2020 the channel change may have been jointly controlled by multiple factors such as changes in sediment and water inputs seasonal floods size of the boulders in the channel bed thickness of the boulder layer armoring the bedrock bed bank stability presence of mid channel bars and interference of human activities cook et al 2018 galay 1980 lawler et al 1999 li et al 2007 merritt and wohl 2003 sarma 2005 tiegs and pohl 2005 wallick et al 2007 knighton 1984 sarma et al 2018 xu 1997 during the ygof the high energy flood especially its leading edge had more capacity to erode the concave bank by transporting large boulders than the run off driven floods in the ur because of its high instantaneous discharge which exceeded the threshold for mobilizing boulder sized clasts as well as its enhancement of the sediment entrainment due to its velocity difference cook et al 2018 immediately the high sediment concentration flood gradually accumulated a large number of boulders and gravel at the tail of the convex bank or formed sand bars within the channel due to the locally weak hydrodynamic conditions in addition the weak lithology and high erosion rate in the yigong river basin greatly enhanced the influence of the ygof on the fluvial geomorphology the bedrock in the basin is mainly composed of grayish green gravel bearing sandstone black gravel bearing slate and slate interbedded with marble and the stratified cataclastic structures are widely developed gu 1979 under these bedrock conditions with well developed joints and fractures channel boundaries with limited or no cohesion can amplify the block plucking and channel incision caused by the ygof consequently in the ur the ygof straightened the channel and caused meander bends to migrate downstream fig 11 c resulting in substantial lateral migration of the channel fig 11a alteration of the bank material structure and significant decrease in the dimensionless curvature however in the gorge dr the ygof strongly scoured the colluvium that had accumulated on both sides of the channel giving rise to the widening of the channel fig 11b additionally the material deposited at the tail of the convex bank could cause minor lateral migration of the channel and enlargement of the dimensionless curvature fig 11d in the next period 2000 2006 immediately after the ygof some sections of the reach had lateral channel migration this phenomenon reveals that due to the impact of the erosion and accretion of catastrophic outburst floods the material structure of the riverbank had undergone a drastic change and the degree of consolidation had decreased significantly leading to bank failure this failed bank material in the yigong river could rapidly deposit on the opposite bank feed mid channel bars or be dispersed as suspended load and transported further downstream simon et al 2002 li et al 2007 dewan et al 2017 due to their high energy and strong capacity to transport coarse sediment cook et al 2018 outburst floods should be considered as an essential part of the fluvial system and a major agent of river geomorphological evolution in high mountain river channels 5 2 relationship between simulated flood hydraulics and channel dynamics adjacent plots of the bank migration and shear stress series along the study reach underline their relationship and the necessity of the phase lag fig 12 the ygof caused a large migration of channels in the study reach and the bank migration in the ur was significantly greater than that in the dr nevertheless in the longitudinal shear stress variation along the reach the peak values in the ur and dr are basically similar except that the peak shear stress at approximately 1 km in the ur is approximately 7 kpa which is significantly larger than the other peaks interestingly phase lags occurs between the peak values of bank migration and shear stress at noticeable positions and the mean phase lag is approximately 846 m theoretically the location of the channel subjected to the maximum shear stress would gradually migrate downstream during the evolution of the ygof due to the scouring and erosion of the flood however the terrain remains unchanged in the numerical simulation resulting in these phase lags although the peak shear stress is still obvious in the dr the relatively small variation in the bank migration resulting in the phenomenon of phase lags is inconspicuous which may account for the extreme resistance of the bedrock boundary of the channel the relationship among the product of the dimensionless curvature w r simulated flow velocity u and the relative migration rate m w along the study reach during the ygof is illustrated in fig 13 although this relationship exhibits a large variance most of the data plot within the envelope curves implying that an upper threshold of relative migration rates for both the ur and dr holds a specific value of w r u with a maximum relative migration rate occurring where w r u 1 within contrast to previous studies on the curvature migration rate relationship of plain river channels hickin and nanson 1975 1984 furbish 1988 hudson and kesel 2000 we added the maximum flow speed factor of the ygof numerical simulation results to the dimensionless curvature to determine the relationships among flow speed curvature and migration rate previous studies hickin and nanson 1975 1984 hooke 1987 furbish 1988 hudson and kesel 2000 reported peak migration rates occurring where the r m ranged between 1 0 and 3 0 while this study showed that the maximum relative migration rate in the ur and dr occurred where w r u 1 in addition the shape of the envelope curve in the ur is similar to that in the dr which indicates that under the influence of a high energy outburst flood the location of the maximum relative migration rate in the study reach meets the following condition 1 u r w k where k is an eigen flow speed set to 1 m s in this study which is controlled by lithology and bank materials the main reason accounting for the differences between this study and other studies may be the exceptional flow regime during the ygof most of the previous studies focused on plain rivers with normal flow regimes however the flow regime was considerably more complex during the short lived ygof carrivick 2010 mentioned that outburst floods on horizontal beds can possess three longitudinal flow regimes the sophisticated flow regime leads to a rapid change in the flow speed consequently for channel migration under high energy floods the change in the flow speed should be considered although we obtained interesting results in the study reach it is unclear whether these results can be applied to other alpine river valleys this uncertainty may be associated with the complexity of bank materials hudson s 2000 research in the lower mississippi valley suggested that the complexity of floodplain sediments impacts the relationship between the curvature and migration rate therefore due to the different material compositions and lithologies of the boundary banks of the river valleys the eigen flow speed may deviate to some extent 5 3 evaluation of simulation results a calibrated hydrograph of the ygof at a breach as the initial upstream boundary condition leads to a lower peak discharge and a longer time to reach the peak discharge than would be expected based on the assumption of instantaneous dam failure turzewski et al 2019 but similar to the field based estimates of shang et al 2003 at the tongmai bridge 18 km downstream the maximum flow depth 54 9 m obtained using the flo 2d model of delaney and evans 2015 exceeded our simulated maximum flow depth 53 1 m by 3 3 however turzewski et al 2019 simulated maximum flow depths of 76 to 79 m at the same location much of this discrepancy results from the different initial upstream boundary condition types moreover different dems used in flood simulations also account for the large gap between these simulations results therefore it is difficult to compare the simulations directly it is obvious from recent state of the art modeling of outburst floods worldwide that a relatively close match can be attained between the dynamic simulated flood stage and geomorphological evidence carling et al 2010 consistency between the simulated results and geomorphology can provide considerable confidence that the modeling is accurate and that higher quality worldwide modeling is warranted in the future bohorquez et al 2016 here we compare simulations and geomorphological evidence in the ygof to evaluate our model generally the simulated inundation should exceed the elevation of all deposits because the inundation area of the ygof is more pronounced in the ur the deposit marks mapped in the ur field are the most robust evidence validating our simulated flood stage fig 14 a fig 14a shows that the simulated inundation and deposits are highly consistent in the ygof however a local mismatch occurred at the edge of the simulated inundation area due to uncertainties in the dem and the choice of a uniform roughness parameter a layer of fine gravel coarse sand can be observed at these marginal locations fig 14b fig 14c litty et al 2016 suggested that the transport and subsequent deposition of sediment grains by a free surface flow does not occur until the flow first exceeds and then falls below the threshold for sediment transport allowing bar top deposition which indicates a relationship between the maximum flood level and the uppermost surface of the deposits consequently the surface elevations of coarse grained giant bars deposited by outburst floods have been used as indicators of the maximum flood stage with an error within a few meters carling et al 2010 bohorquez and ancey 2015 carling and fan 2020 wu et al 2020 ideally a rigorous three dimensional model of sediment transport and water flow is necessary for replicating reconstructions of catastrophic floods given the balance between model precision and computational expense however a detailed description of ample coupled three dimensional models of water and sediment transport systems might ultimately be challenging and could introduce increased complexity miyamoto et al 2006 moreover the magnitude of catastrophic floods is generally too large to model and analyze in detail although the depth averaged two dimensional methods in hec ras 2d are widely used in modern river system analyses due to their sufficient accuracy for practical purposes bates and de roo 2000 the uncertainties in catastrophic flood hydraulics obstruct our understanding of related sediment transport patterns flow velocity depth and regime as well as the duration magnitude and spatial distribution of sediment load are strongly impacted by the interaction of the flow through the rugged valley topography above modern channels turzewski et al 2019 because the rapid changes in valley topography and the precise physics of erosion and deposition processes in high energy outburst floods remain uncertain existing two dimensional hydraulic models are unable to simulate sediment transport therefore our model concentrates on flood water flow and neglects sediment transport related effects in summary our hec ras retrospective flood simulations appear to successfully match the ygof to some extent however this model also has some disadvantages 1 the ygof topography is not entirely represented by a preflood dem the yigong landslide dam blocked the yigong river and the rock avalanche debris considerably altered the topography near the breach position 2 the hydrodynamic developments at magnitudes of catastrophic floods do not sufficiently simulate flood erosion 3 catastrophic flooding may produce a sophisticated flow regime with large sediment loads which the two dimensional hydraulic models are unable to simulate alho et al 2010 despite these shortcomings 2d numerical simulation of catastrophic floods can coherently model flood hydraulics in a consistent manner facilitating comparison with other simulation results and cross verification with geomorphological and sedimentological field evidence to better understand erosion and deposition processes 6 conclusions this paper investigates the impacts of the high energy ygof in 2000 on river morphology from the residual landslide dam to the tongmai bridge by remote sensing interpretation and numerical flood simulation comparative analysis of the channel characteristics such as bank migration channel width and curvature that were extracted from satellite and aerial images in gis revealed that channel migration during the high energy ygof was more dynamic than that of all the other periods combined 1984 2020 after the ygof bank migration and variation in the channel width in the ur were greater than those in the dr the curvature in the ur was greatly reduced under the influence of the ygof while the curvature of the dr increased which was related to the bank materials and local valley topography the flood tended to change the planimetric form of the ur channel while to change the dimension of the dr channel our numerical simulation of the ygof presented confirmable values for the maximum flow depth 53 1 m and the flood peak arrival time 7 h at the tongmai bridge the sound simulation results allow us to confidently examine the relationship between the simulated hydraulic parameters and the channel characteristics the locations of the peaks of the bank displacement and the shear stress are staggered and the mean lag length is approximately 846 m the maximum relative migration rate for both the ur and dr occurs where w r u 1 which implies an extraordinary flow regime during the ygof due to the interaction of flood hydraulics with the local channel boundary this paper provides new insights into the rapid changes in mountain river channels in response to high energy outburst floods and then promote our understanding for paleo flood dynamics and hydraulic reconstruction it is also helpful to establish knowledge of how extreme outburst floods impact mountain landscapes over decadal timescales in order to mitigate the long term hazard chain and its consequences for mountainous river and hillslope management credit authorship

3111,high energy outburst floods triggered by failure of landslide and glacial dams have strongly impacted rivers in eastern tibet affecting river geomorphology human settlements and infrastructure however understanding the impact of these extreme outburst floods on river landscape evolution is hampered due to lack of event based observations the second largest modern outburst flood recorded in the yigong river in 2000 provides an opportunity to investigate changes in river morphology caused by such extreme floods by combining remote sensing images from 1984 to 2020 and 2 d numerical flood simulations with the hydrologic engineering center s river analysis system hec ras software we show that the riverbank displacement during the yigong outburst flood ygof is an order of magnitude greater than that in other periods channel migration and variation in channel width in the upper reach ur straths are greater than those in the down reach dr gorges and the curvature of the ur was greatly reduced by the ygof while that of the dr increased furthermore the channel morphology after the ygof has become more dynamic the relationship among the product of the dimensionless curvature w

volumes of impounded water such as glacial lakes baker and bunker 1985 rudoy and baker 1993 bjorck 1995 cook et al 2018 or landslide dammed lakes korup 2004 dai et al 2005 wu et al 2009 have the potential to significantly affect geomorphic evolution and channel dynamics of rivers liu et al 2019 lamb and fonstad 2010 the lake outburst floods frequently affect rivers along the margins of the tibetan plateau in many ways montgomery et al 2004 korup et al 2006 gupta and sah 2008 korup and montgomery 2008 korup et al 2010 turzewski et al 2019 high magnitude glacial lake outburst floods have an enhanced ability to mobilize boulder armored accelerating bedrock incision cook et al 2018 large outburst floods strengthen the lateral scour of hillslope toes increasing hillslope gradients and leading to many flood triggered landslides larsen and montgomery 2012 turzewski et al 2019 suggested that outburst floods have a potentially strong influence on mountainous landscapes cook et al 2018 concluded that long term valley evolution in the himalayas may be driven by glacial lake outburst flood frequency and magnitude rather than by precipitation dependent erosion rapid changes of river geomorphology by so called ancient megafloods with peak discharges 1 0 106 m3 s have been revealed by concrete geological evidence on earth and mars such as bedrock grooves basin like potholes streamline hills and huge boulder bars baker 1973 2002 baker and milton 1974 bretz 1923 carling 1996 gupta et al 2007 komatsu et al 2009 lamb et al 2008 malde 1968 o connor 1993 rudoy 2002 in contrast to the megafloods most of similar studies of modern floods focus on low magnitude flood events due to infrequency of high energy floods cook et al 2018 lamb and fonstad 2010 such knowledge on the low magnitude floods has little help in understanding the processes and geomorphological effects of extreme modern and paleo floods because of the great difference in the order of magnitudes moreover a detailed investigation on erosion and deposition of high energy modern floods probably gives a clue of some geomorphic effects of the paleofloods quantifying planform changes of large and actively migrating plain rivers worldwide over a time scale of decades is extremely important for determining the controlling factors of channel migration advancing the theory of river morphodynamics and understanding the roles of climate and human influence on river plane changes gautier et al 2007 baki and gan 2012 gupta et al 2013 frias et al 2015 schwendel et al 2015 schwenk et al 2015 schwenk et al 2017 a growing number of studies have utilized remote sensing imagery to quantify the channel dynamics of major rivers such as those in the tropical amazon kalliola et al 1992 yang et al 1999 baki and gan 2012 gupta et al 2013 constantine et al 2014 schwendel et al 2015 however few studies have investigated the spatial and temporal variations in channel dynamics over rugged topography especially rapid channel changes during high energy flood events the high energy ygof in 2000 has been well documented in terms of its geometric characteristics of landslide dams duration of reservoir impoundment breach timing peak discharge geomorphic and sedimentary record and impact on downstream areas shang et al 2003 evans and delaney 2011 delaney and evans 2015 wu et al 2020 carling and fan 2020 although numerical simulations have been used to reconstruct outburst flood hydraulics delaney and evans 2015 turzewski et al 2019 few studies have discussed the drastic changes in river channels in response to the ygof based on field surveys details of outburst flood hydraulics can help us better understand the processes of outburst flood erosion and its influences on river morphology and the extent to which they might fundamentally differ from the processes of monsoonal floods turzewski et al 2019 to investigate the strong influence of the ygof on the landscape evolution of mountainous river and the relationship between the hydraulics and channel morphology characteristics we interpreted the landsat remote sensing imagery from 1984 to 2020 and aerial images for over 18 km of the yigong river and simulated the ygof hydraulics of the research stretch our findings highlight that high energy outburst floods play an extremely important role in the landscape evolution of the tibetan plateau s eastern margin and thus are helpful for the understanding of outburst flood hydraulics 2 background the eastern himalayas are one of the most rapidly uplifting and eroding regions worldwide and are characterized by extreme topographic relief and frequent earthquakes turzewski et al 2019 deep cutting alpine and gorge landforms in the yarlung tsangpo river drainage area has formed due to the strong geomorphic effect of gravity on the landscape which sets the stage for river damming and outburst floods ren et al 2001 the yigong river originates from the southern foot of the nyenchen tonglha mountains in northwestern jiali county and meanders 295 km to the confluence at the tongmai bridge fig 1 b shang et al 2003 the warm wet current from the indian ocean steered by the yarlung tsangpo gorge and the n s oriented boshula mountain range leads to the formation of a tongue like rain belt projecting northward into the yigong region sun 1996 according to 1951 2011 data from the yigong meteorological station the mean annual rainfall in the yigong area is approximately 810 1250 mm zhou et al 2016 the rainfall from april to october accounts for 90 of the annual total rainfall while the dry season occurs from november to february shang et al 2003 as most of the yigong river drainage area is covered by glaciers meltwater from glaciers and snow cover provides more than 60 of the total river flow as its temperature increases abruptly shang et al 2003 at 8p m on april 9 2000 a large rock avalanche occurred with a volume of approximately 1 15 108 m3 delaney and evans 2015 at zhamu creek of the yigong river in southeastern tibet fig 1a 1b the whole process lasted approximately 10 min and covered a horizontal distance of 8 km and a vertical elevation difference of 3330 m from its source at 5520 m to its fan at 2190 m shang et al 2003 consequently a large accumulation body approximately 2 5 km in length and 1 0 km in width shang et al 2003 suddenly dammed the yigong river the maximum thickness of the dam was approximately 90 m with a minimum thickness of 55 m shang et al 2003 the water level of yigong lake rose by approximately 54 m during the following 62 days shang et al 2003 at 6 a m on june 8 the impounded water began to drain through a spillway then the dam breached catastrophically at 9p m on june 10 shang et al 2003 xu et al 2008 subsequently the ygof abruptly increased the water level downstream by more than 50 m shang et al 2003 and destroyed almost all of the highways and infrastructure across the yigong river fig 2 the peak discharge recorded at the tongmai bridge was estimated as 1 26 105 m3 s zhu et al 2003 1 2 105 m3 s shang et al 2003 and 1 24 105 m3 s ma 2006 with a peak water depth of 52 m hu et al 2021 according to delaney and evans 2015 a simulated peak discharge of 1 1 105 m3 s maximum flow depth of 54 9 m and maximum velocity of 14 57 m s were estimated at the tongmai bridge near the confluence of the yigong and parlung rivers by using the flo 2d model turzewski et al 2019 demonstrated that the simulated maximum discharge was 1 39 105 m3 s at the tongmai bridge and 1 73 105 m3 s at the breach with 2d numerical flood simulations by using geoclaw software recently hu et al 2021 showed that the maximum simulated values of velocity and flow area at the tongmai bridge were 15 7 m s and 8350 m2 respectively the flood greatly impacted the river geomorphology immediately downstream of the breach resulting in a rapid change in channel morphology and large boulder bars formed on both sides of the river channel fig 1c fig 2a 3 data and methods in order to investigate the characteristics of channel configuration and boulder bars associated with the ygof we conducted a field survey in may 2020 a handheld global positioning system gps was employed during the fieldwork we confirmed the location of prominent landforms related to the ygof and permanent features such as bridges landmarks crossroads and river channel confluences for this study the reach was divided into upper reach ur straths and down reach dr gorges taking into account the large gap in valley shape and the boundary was set at 12 3 km downstream of the yigong residual dam 3 1 data collection multitemporal landsat images spanning 1984 2020 were analyzed to quantify the channel dynamics to ensure data availability data comparability and cloud cover only low flow stage images in december that are considered as at normal water levels were selected to minimize errors in identifying morphological features a total of 9 images from 1984 1989 1994 1999 2000 2006 2011 2016 and 2020 were consequently used to construct the eight periods the first four remote sensing satellite images 30 m pixel resolution were obtained from the thematic mapper tm on landsat 5 https doi org 10 5066 f7n015tq and the 2000 2011 and 2016 data were acquired from the enhanced thematic mapper etm on landsat 7 https doi org 10 5066 f7wh2p8g with spatial resolutions of 30 m 20 m and 20 m respectively the 2006 data were retrieved from the quickbird satellite imagery of digitalglobe inc with a resolution of 0 52 m https doi org 10 5066 p9539rh2 and the 2020 data were produced by synthesizing high resolution aerial images taken by a dajiang unmanned aerial vehicle uav with a resolution of 0 05 m the resolutions of all remotely sensed images obtained from the series of landsat satellites were enhanced by using a histogram equalization algorithm as demonstrated above the locations of permanent features which are well distributed throughout the imagery and selected as ground control points gcps were used to register each landsat scene to the specific region standard universal transverse mercator utm projection 3 2 data processing and analysis a variety of automated techniques are already available for determining planform channel characteristics from remote sensing satellite images pavelsky and smith 2008 fisher et al 2013 legg et al 2014 allen and pavelsky 2015 rowland et al 2016 schwenk et al 2017 due to the high elevation extreme topographic relief high gradient hillslope and glacial coverage that create a fuzzy spectral signature resulting in classification uncertainty the manual classification method was used to digitize channel boundaries from each landsat scene yang et al 1999 gupta et al 2013 while the criterion for manual digitization of remotely sensed images taken before the ygof was the soil vegetation limit gurnell 1997 a soil water limit approach was used to confirm the river boundaries in the landsat mosaic after 2000 due to erosion and deposition associated with the ygof to improve the reliability of the river boundary data a variable controlling method was used in this study the river boundaries were manually digitized for each remotely sensed image by the same operator under the same zoom level of 1 5 000 the 18 km of the yigong river channel in the research area extracted from each remotely sensed image from the residual rock avalanche dam to the tongmai bridge was divided into segments by constructing sections that were perpendicular to the channel centerline of the reach at 100 m intervals to characterize the channel dynamics the length of the transverse line was considered the channel width w of each segment and the channel centerline was used to measure channel curvature r to determine the bankline movement of each segment spanning that period the overlay analysis method in geographic information system gis was used to compare the two banklines extracted from remotely sensed images at the start and end of each period the transversal lines at the beginning of that period were extended to intersect both banklines for the entire period and the positions of the intersection points were compared to quantify the linear change in the bankline position over that period fig 3 each subsequent period underwent the process outlined

china institute of water resources and hydropower research we calculated the hydrograph of the ygof at the breach as the initial condition fig 4 manning s roughness parameter n was calibrated using the peak discharge 126 000 m3 s and water depth 52 m at the tongmai bridge during the ygof the simulated elevation of the water surface at the tongmai bridge corresponds well with the ygof when n was set as 0 03 and 0 035 for the river channel and floodplain respectively the n values were also the suggested values for mountain streams such as the yigong river our sensitivity tests show that a 25 variation in n results in a variation of 2 68 2 87 in flood water depth and a variation of 0 15 0 2 in peak discharge therefore for all simulations n is spatially uniform and does not change over time which is consistent with previous outburst flood studies e g alho et al 2010 bohorquez et al 2016 clarke et al 2004 denlinger and o connell 2010 miyamoto et al 2006 o connor 1993 o connor and baker 1992 4 results 4 1 channel configuration the superimposed channel configuration maps of the ur and dr between 1984 and 2020 are shown in fig 5 before the ygof 1984 1999 the main changes in the river channels in the ur and dr were expansion and contraction at some locations the ygof 1999 2000 caused massive changes in the ur which mainly consisted of channel straightening and meandering downstream migration while the dr was slightly affected by floods and the channel changes were mainly widening and narrowing at some locations subsequently considerable channel migration activity and contraction occurred at 11 km in the ur during 2000 2006 whereas lateral erosion seemed to have ceased by 2011 during 2006 2011 the channel showed a prominent tendency to migrate towards the left bank and narrowed to some extent afterward the channel planform was stable in the last two periods in the dr the river channel first migrated towards the right bank in 2000 2006 and then migrated in the opposite direction during 2006 2011 during the last two periods the channel morphology in the dr was similar to that in the ur the greatest change in channel location occurred during the ygof in 2000 moreover the channel morphology of the ur was more variable than that of the dr during the study period 4 2 bank migration migrations on both banks along the course of the lower yigong river from the residual dam to the tongmai bridge during the period of 1984 2020 are shown graphically in fig 6 by superimposing these channel boundaries generally each bank had parallel sections characterized by high migration and movement in the same direction furthermore the bank migration of the ur is more dynamic than that of the dr according to the dataset obtained from measurements on the left bank the maximum bank erosion was 220 m at 8 1 km while the maximum bank accretion was 370 m at 7 3 km due to the ygof the maximum right bank encroachment on the floodplain was 360 m at 7 3 km while the maximum bank accretion was 260 m at 8 2 km during 1999 2000 bank migration during the period of 1999 2000 is an order of magnitude greater than that during other periods moreover bank migration of the ur is far larger than that of the dr 4 3 channel width the variations in the channel width along the nearly 18 km reach of the lower yigong river during different periods is illustrated in fig 7 this figure shows that the highly variable and unpredictable channel width during the ygof contrasts with the stability of the river before 2000 the maximum channel width spanning the study period was 177 m which occurred in 2000 near the boundary between the ur and dr the ygof widened the dr channel and the width at 14 5 km continued to increase even after 2000 due to the limited boundaries the most changed things are the planimetric form of the ur channel and the dimension of the dr channel 4 4 channel curvature a comparison of the pre event and post event channel configurations indicates that the main channel has undergone substantial lateral migration as illustrated in fig 8 a three reaches have undergone substantial lateral migration exceeding 200 m in the ur r1 r3 while no such changes occurred in the dr the maximum lateral migration was 318 m at r1 287 m at r2 and 369 m at r3 according to the variation in the dimensionless curvature w r before and after the outburst flood along the study reach the ur and dr also showed different characteristics in response to the high energy ygof fig 7b in the ur the change in the dimensionless curvature after the ygof plotted almost within the variation range of that before the ygof especially at r1 r3 the maximum absolute value of the dimensionless curvature at r1 r3 decreased from 0 43 0 47 and 1 99 before the ygof to 0 15 0 33 and 0 43 after the event respectively the abnormal peak dimensionless curvature of the channel at the tail of r3 before the ygof may be attributed to the molongqu creek alluvial fan that changes the river course and results in river bending in this location furthermore molongqu creek carries a large amount of sediment to the main channel forming a mid channel bar that widens the channel in this location if this extreme value is excluded the maximum absolute value of the dimensionless curvature at r3 decreases from 0 44 before the ygof to 0 43 after the ygof this phenomenon indicates that the curvature of the ur was greatly reduced under the influence of the ygof nevertheless in the dr the variation in the dimensionless curvature after the ygof exceeds the changing range of the dimensionless curvature before the ygof which showed that the curvature of the dr increased during the ygof 4 5 flood simulation the maximum flow depth of the ygof in the study area is illustrated in fig 9 at approximately 1 h the flood initially reached the tongmai bridge and the flood peak reached the tongmai bridge at 7 h which was similar to the direct observation shang et al 2003 the maximum flow depth of 53 1 m at the tongmai bridge is substantially consistent with the result of delaney and evans 2015 the whole outburst process lasted for nearly 24 h and the drainage volume was approximately 2 11 109 m3 5 discussion 5 1 implications for channel morphological changes in response to the ygof the ur straths adjacent to the breach contain well developed river terraces and the boundary material is mainly composed of gravel and coarse sand fig 10 a however the boundary material of the dr gorges is mainly composed of bedrock or colluvial deposits fig 10b the variation in the channel is not significant and mainly manifested by the widening and narrowing at some parts of the reach in the first three periods before the ygof 1984 1989 1989 1994 and 1994 1999 and the last three periods after the ygof 2006 2011 2011 2016 and 2016 2020 the channel change may have been jointly controlled by multiple factors such as changes in sediment and water inputs seasonal floods size of the boulders in the channel bed thickness of the boulder layer armoring the bedrock bed bank stability presence of mid channel bars and interference of human activities cook et al 2018 galay 1980 lawler et al 1999 li et al 2007 merritt and wohl 2003 sarma 2005 tiegs and pohl 2005 wallick et al 2007 knighton 1984 sarma et al 2018 xu 1997 during the ygof the high energy flood especially its leading edge had more capacity to erode the concave bank by transporting large boulders than the run off driven floods in the ur because of its high instantaneous discharge which exceeded the threshold for mobilizing boulder sized clasts as well as its enhancement of the sediment entrainment due to its velocity difference cook et al 2018 immediately the high sediment concentration flood gradually accumulated a large number of boulders and gravel at the tail of the convex bank or formed sand bars within the channel due to the locally weak hydrodynamic conditions in addition the weak lithology and high erosion rate in the yigong river basin greatly enhanced the influence of the ygof on the fluvial geomorphology the bedrock in the basin is mainly composed of grayish green gravel bearing sandstone black gravel bearing slate and slate interbedded with marble and the stratified cataclastic structures are widely developed gu 1979 under these bedrock conditions with well developed joints and fractures channel boundaries with limited or no cohesion can amplify the block plucking and channel incision caused by the ygof consequently in the ur the ygof straightened the channel and caused meander bends to migrate downstream fig 11 c resulting in substantial lateral migration of the channel fig 11a alteration of the bank material structure and significant decrease in the dimensionless curvature however in the gorge dr the ygof strongly scoured the colluvium that had accumulated on both sides of the channel giving rise to the widening of the channel fig 11b additionally the material deposited at the tail of the convex bank could cause minor lateral migration of the channel and enlargement of the dimensionless curvature fig 11d in the next period 2000 2006 immediately after the ygof some sections of the reach had lateral channel migration this phenomenon reveals that due to the impact of the erosion and accretion of catastrophic outburst floods the material structure of the riverbank had undergone a drastic change and the degree of consolidation had decreased significantly leading to bank failure this failed bank material in the yigong river could rapidly deposit on the opposite bank feed mid channel bars or be dispersed as suspended load and transported further downstream simon et al 2002 li et al 2007 dewan et al 2017 due to their high energy and strong capacity to transport coarse sediment cook et al 2018 outburst floods should be considered as an essential part of the fluvial system and a major agent of river geomorphological evolution in high mountain river channels 5 2 relationship between simulated flood hydraulics and channel dynamics adjacent plots of the bank migration and shear stress series along the study reach underline their relationship and the necessity of the phase lag fig 12 the ygof caused a large migration of channels in the study reach and the bank migration in the ur was significantly greater than that in the dr nevertheless in the longitudinal shear stress variation along the reach the peak values in the ur and dr are basically similar except that the peak shear stress at approximately 1 km in the ur is approximately 7 kpa which is significantly larger than the other peaks interestingly phase lags occurs between the peak values of bank migration and shear stress at noticeable positions and the mean phase lag is approximately 846 m theoretically the location of the channel subjected to the maximum shear stress would gradually migrate downstream during the evolution of the ygof due to the scouring and erosion of the flood however the terrain remains unchanged in the numerical simulation resulting in these phase lags although the peak shear stress is still obvious in the dr the relatively small variation in the bank migration resulting in the phenomenon of phase lags is inconspicuous which may account for the extreme resistance of the bedrock boundary of the channel the relationship among the product of the dimensionless curvature w r simulated flow velocity u and the relative migration rate m w along the study reach during the ygof is illustrated in fig 13 although this relationship exhibits a large variance most of the data plot within the envelope curves implying that an upper threshold of relative migration rates for both the ur and dr holds a specific value of w r u with a maximum relative migration rate occurring where w r u 1 within contrast to previous studies on the curvature migration rate relationship of plain river channels hickin and nanson 1975 1984 furbish 1988 hudson and kesel 2000 we added the maximum flow speed factor of the ygof numerical simulation results to the dimensionless curvature to determine the relationships among flow speed curvature and migration rate previous studies hickin and nanson 1975 1984 hooke 1987 furbish 1988 hudson and kesel 2000 reported peak migration rates occurring where the r m ranged between 1 0 and 3 0 while this study showed that the maximum relative migration rate in the ur and dr occurred where w r u 1 in addition the shape of the envelope curve in the ur is similar to that in the dr which indicates that under the influence of a high energy outburst flood the location of the maximum relative migration rate in the study reach meets the following condition 1 u r w k where k is an eigen flow speed set to 1 m s in this study which is controlled by lithology and bank materials the main reason accounting for the differences between this study and other studies may be the exceptional flow regime during the ygof most of the previous studies focused on plain rivers with normal flow regimes however the flow regime was considerably more complex during the short lived ygof carrivick 2010 mentioned that outburst floods on horizontal beds can possess three longitudinal flow regimes the sophisticated flow regime leads to a rapid change in the flow speed consequently for channel migration under high energy floods the change in the flow speed should be considered although we obtained interesting results in the study reach it is unclear whether these results can be applied to other alpine river valleys this uncertainty may be associated with the complexity of bank materials hudson s 2000 research in the lower mississippi valley suggested that the complexity of floodplain sediments impacts the relationship between the curvature and migration rate therefore due to the different material compositions and lithologies of the boundary banks of the river valleys the eigen flow speed may deviate to some extent 5 3 evaluation of simulation results a calibrated hydrograph of the ygof at a breach as the initial upstream boundary condition leads to a lower peak discharge and a longer time to reach the peak discharge than would be expected based on the assumption of instantaneous dam failure turzewski et al 2019 but similar to the field based estimates of shang et al 2003 at the tongmai bridge 18 km downstream the maximum flow depth 54 9 m obtained using the flo 2d model of delaney and evans 2015 exceeded our simulated maximum flow depth 53 1 m by 3 3 however turzewski et al 2019 simulated maximum flow depths of 76 to 79 m at the same location much of this discrepancy results from the different initial upstream boundary condition types moreover different dems used in flood simulations also account for the large gap between these simulations results therefore it is difficult to compare the simulations directly it is obvious from recent state of the art modeling of outburst floods worldwide that a relatively close match can be attained between the dynamic simulated flood stage and geomorphological evidence carling et al 2010 consistency between the simulated results and geomorphology can provide considerable confidence that the modeling is accurate and that higher quality worldwide modeling is warranted in the future bohorquez et al 2016 here we compare simulations and geomorphological evidence in the ygof to evaluate our model generally the simulated inundation should exceed the elevation of all deposits because the inundation area of the ygof is more pronounced in the ur the deposit marks mapped in the ur field are the most robust evidence validating our simulated flood stage fig 14 a fig 14a shows that the simulated inundation and deposits are highly consistent in the ygof however a local mismatch occurred at the edge of the simulated inundation area due to uncertainties in the dem and the choice of a uniform roughness parameter a layer of fine gravel coarse sand can be observed at these marginal locations fig 14b fig 14c litty et al 2016 suggested that the transport and subsequent deposition of sediment grains by a free surface flow does not occur until the flow first exceeds and then falls below the threshold for sediment transport allowing bar top deposition which indicates a relationship between the maximum flood level and the uppermost surface of the deposits consequently the surface elevations of coarse grained giant bars deposited by outburst floods have been used as indicators of the maximum flood stage with an error within a few meters carling et al 2010 bohorquez and ancey 2015 carling and fan 2020 wu et al 2020 ideally a rigorous three dimensional model of sediment transport and water flow is necessary for replicating reconstructions of catastrophic floods given the balance between model precision and computational expense however a detailed description of ample coupled three dimensional models of water and sediment transport systems might ultimately be challenging and could introduce increased complexity miyamoto et al 2006 moreover the magnitude of catastrophic floods is generally too large to model and analyze in detail although the depth averaged two dimensional methods in hec ras 2d are widely used in modern river system analyses due to their sufficient accuracy for practical purposes bates and de roo 2000 the uncertainties in catastrophic flood hydraulics obstruct our understanding of related sediment transport patterns flow velocity depth and regime as well as the duration magnitude and spatial distribution of sediment load are strongly impacted by the interaction of the flow through the rugged valley topography above modern channels turzewski et al 2019 because the rapid changes in valley topography and the precise physics of erosion and deposition processes in high energy outburst floods remain uncertain existing two dimensional hydraulic models are unable to simulate sediment transport therefore our model concentrates on flood water flow and neglects sediment transport related effects in summary our hec ras retrospective flood simulations appear to successfully match the ygof to some extent however this model also has some disadvantages 1 the ygof topography is not entirely represented by a preflood dem the yigong landslide dam blocked the yigong river and the rock avalanche debris considerably altered the topography near the breach position 2 the hydrodynamic developments at magnitudes of catastrophic floods do not sufficiently simulate flood erosion 3 catastrophic flooding may produce a sophisticated flow regime with large sediment loads which the two dimensional hydraulic models are unable to simulate alho et al 2010 despite these shortcomings 2d numerical simulation of catastrophic floods can coherently model flood hydraulics in a consistent manner facilitating comparison with other simulation results and cross verification with geomorphological and sedimentological field evidence to better understand erosion and deposition processes 6 conclusions this paper investigates the impacts of the high energy ygof in 2000 on river morphology from the residual landslide dam to the tongmai bridge by remote sensing interpretation and numerical flood simulation comparative analysis of the channel characteristics such as bank migration channel width and curvature that were extracted from satellite and aerial images in gis revealed that channel migration during the high energy ygof was more dynamic than that of all the other periods combined 1984 2020 after the ygof bank migration and variation in the channel width in the ur were greater than those in the dr the curvature in the ur was greatly reduced under the influence of the ygof while the curvature of the dr increased which was related to the bank materials and local valley topography the flood tended to change the planimetric form of the ur channel while to change the dimension of the dr channel our numerical simulation of the ygof presented confirmable values for the maximum flow depth 53 1 m and the flood peak arrival time 7 h at the tongmai bridge the sound simulation results allow us to confidently examine the relationship between the simulated hydraulic parameters and the channel characteristics the locations of the peaks of the bank displacement and the shear stress are staggered and the mean lag length is approximately 846 m the maximum relative migration rate for both the ur and dr occurs where w r u 1 which implies an extraordinary flow regime during the ygof due to the interaction of flood hydraulics with the local channel boundary this paper provides new insights into the rapid changes in mountain river channels in response to high energy outburst floods and then promote our understanding for paleo flood dynamics and hydraulic reconstruction it is also helpful to establish knowledge of how extreme outburst floods impact mountain landscapes over decadal timescales in order to mitigate the long term hazard chain and its consequences for mountainous river and hillslope management credit authorship

3112,hydrological processes in slopes play an important role in the evaluation of slope stability at the catchment scale this study investigated the dynamic variations of interception loss infiltration runoff in three land use types bare slope and slopes with c dactylon and i amblyantha cover for incident rainfall and their influence on slope stability gross rainfall surface runoff and subsurface flow were measured during the rainy season in 2020 and the influences of rainfall characteristics rainfall amount and intensity and slope gradients on canopy interception loss water infiltration and surface runoff were evaluated on this basis a model considering infiltration zonation was adopted to estimate slope stability under the influence of infiltration modified by vegetation field test results showed that runoff on bare slope generally occurred following rainfall events with amounts of 6 1 mm or intensities of 7 2 mm h 1 for slopes covered by c dactylon and i amblyantha the thresholds of rainfall intensity for runoff generation were 25 mm h 1 and 36 mm h 1 respectively the calculated relative interception loss for the slope with c dactylon cover stabilized at 0 05 0 10 when the rainfall amount was 18 mm while that for the slope with i amblyantha cover stabilized at 0 10 0 15 when the rainfall amount was 30 mm moreover the slope with c dactylon cover appeared to have a higher proportion of infiltration than that with i amblyantha cover the stable infiltration rate in the three land use types decreased gradually with increasing slope gradient whereas an opposite pattern was exhibited for the stable runoff intensity the influence of the morphological features of plant species on the variation of interception loss infiltration runoff weakened as slope gradient increased the modeling results demonstrated that the depth of the wetting front was negatively correlated with slope gradient and followed a quadratic function with rainfall intensity based on the computed safety factor at the wetting front the critical times of slope instability follow the order of bare slope 46 2 min i amblyantha slope 34 8 min c dactylon slope 30 5 min the modification of infiltration by plants accelerated slope instability with potential reductions in the safety factor by 15 9 53 1 slope gradient plays a dominant role in slope stability and the influence of modified infiltration on slope stability weakens with increasing slope gradient those findings provide valuable information for the decision makers concerned with planting i amblyantha in the subtropical region to reduce peak flood discharge and prevent slope instability keywords ecosystem water balance canopy interception loss water infiltration surface runoff slope stability data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction rainfall partitioning plays an important role in ecological hydrological and biogeochemical functions of ecosystems martinez meza and whitford 1996 dunkerley 2015 plant canopy serves as the top interface for rainwater transport in the ecosystem partitioning rainfall into three parts 1 interception loss in which rainwater is captured by plant canopy and directly evaporated back to the atmosphere 2 throughfall which reaches the ground by freely falling through canopy gaps and dripping from stems branches and leaves and 3 stemflow which flows to the ground along the stems after precipitation is intercepted by plant canopy martinez meza and whitford 1996 dunkerley 2015 zhang et al 2015 rainfall partitioning by plant canopy weakens the kinetic energy of raindrops del campo et al 2019 das et al 2021 thereby mitigating the formation of the physical crust of soil under the canopy foley and silburn 2002 alleviating soil erosion assouline and ben hur 2006 delaying runoff generation and reducing peak flood discharge romkens et al 1986 as the first hydrological process of rainwater circulation rainfall partitioning in mountain ecosystems must be considered because it directly determines the amount of net rainfall reaching the ground zhang et al 2015 zheng et al 2018 and the potential of water infiltration or surface runoff has adverse geological effects loáiciga and johnson 2018 del campo et al 2019 previous studies have demonstrated that the characteristics of partitioned rainfall are very sensitive to variations in rainfall characteristics vegetation morphological structure and meteorological conditions martinez meza and whitford 1996 owens et al 2006 crockford and richardson 2015 zhang et al 2015 jian et al 2019 and each variable can significantly impact the behavior of plant communities particularly net rainfall serrato and diaz 1998 crockford and richardson 2015 zhang et al 2015 for instance regarding maize the relative interception loss increases from 3 1 at the seedling stage to 17 3 at the tasseling stage and then declines to 16 5 at the maturity stage zheng et al 2018 in arid areas with sparse canopy the maximum canopy interception loss is only 0 3 6 5 mm with the interception loss accounts for approximately 25 15 11 30 of the total rainfall dunkerley 2015 therefore although there are numerous studies on rainfall partitioning it remains difficult to draw general conclusions and compare studies on rainfall partitioning in different ecosystems the net rainfall reaching the ground consisting of throughfall and stemflow is subject to the subsequent hydrological processes and redistributing into soil moisture replenishment and related flows zheng et al 2018 del campo et al 2019 net rainfall is the main source of water for ground under the canopy and rainwater infiltration is an important hydrological process directly affecting the evolution of mountain hazards such as landslides and debris flow murielle et al 2011 loáiciga and johnson 2018 water infiltration is mainly controlled by rainfall characteristics assouline and ben hur 2006 li and shao 2006 slope gradient fox et al 1997 huang et al 2013 vegetation cover fohrer et al 1999 leung et al 2015 soil properties leung et al 2015 deb et al 2019 and slope surface features roughness and crusting janeau et al 2003 poesen et al 2010 these factors affect water distribution in the soil profile during the infiltration process and the temporal spatial variation of runoff generation mechanisms water infiltration is highly dependent on rainfall characteristics such as the amount duration intensity and variability foley and silbum 2002 huang et al 2013 in general water infiltration exhibits a positive correlation with individual rainfall amount li and shao 2006 but shows a complex relationship with individual rainfall intensity romkens et al 1986 huang et al 2013 light rainfall intensity is conducive to water infiltration in contrast during rainfall events of excessive intensity raindrops with strong kinetic energy destroy the surface soil structure and detached particles seal the pores of surface soil thus significantly reduced the infiltration rate romkens et al 1986 li and shao 2006 in addition fohrer et al 1999 observed that intermittent rainfall events resulted in a rapid decrease in the infiltration rate than continuous rainfall events slope gradient can significantly affect water infiltration but experimental studies have yielded contradictory results some studies have observed a decrease in the stable infiltration rate with increasing slope gradient fox et al 1997 chaplot and bissonnais 2015 while others claimed that the stable infiltration rate increased with increasing slope gradient assouline and ben hur 2006 poesen 2010 loáiciga and johnson 2018 both phenomena are commonly ascribed to the following two aspects 1 increases in slope gradient significantly accelerate the velocity and reduce the depth of overland flow which reduces the maximum storage amount and the standing time of surface runoff fox et al 1997 chaplot and bissonnais 2015 2 increases in slope gradient reduce the raindrop density per unit of surface area due to which a weak crust develops on steep slopes owing to the inverse relationship between slope gradient and the kinetic energy of raindrops resulting in an increase in water infiltration janeau et al 2003 assouline and ben hur 2006 poesen 2010 at present some contradictions have been reported in the literature regarding the effect of vegetation cover on water infiltration with infiltration rates measured in natural ground covered by vegetation being either lower during active root growth ng et al 2014 leung et al 2015 or higher during the decay of mature roots murielle et al 2011 huang et al 2013 the results reveal that plant roots could affect water infiltration through two mechanisms 1 modification of soil permeability by the development of a macro pore system as a consequence of root growth murielle et al 2011 del campo et al 2019 2 alteration of the soil water characteristic curve by the root occupancy of soil pore spaces ng et al 2014 leung et al 2015 in addition some studies have also concluded that water infiltration strongly depends on soil properties ng et al 2014 deb et al 2019 del campo et al 2019 soil antecedent moisture content significantly affects the initial infiltration rate whereas total soil porosity soil mean weight diameter and soil organic matter determine the stable infiltration rate li and shao 2006 murielle et al 2011 cui et al 2019 as mentioned above rainfall partitioning by plant canopy directly determines the amount of net rainfall and the modification of soil permeability due to the presence of roots also significantly alters the infiltration runoff process on slopes since these processes exist simultaneously a relevant question is how the coupling of those processes affects the evolution of geological disasters although the importance of rainfall partitioning by plant canopy is widely recognized however few studies attempted to consider the interception effect of canopy on the dynamic process of infiltration runoff on slopes with vegetation cover for individual rainfall events which is crucial for assessing slope stability at the catchment scale this study attempts to analyze the comprehensive hydrological effects of vegetation on water distribution for incident rainfall and relate it with the evaluation of slope stability in the field of geological hazards water distribution in slopes is described as surface runoff and water infiltration during rainfall considering the canopy interception effect therefore water distribution in slopes covered by vegetation is classified as canopy interception loss surface runoff and water infiltration for incident rainfall in this study the following three objectives were set 1 quantify water distribution into interception loss runoff and infiltration on bare slope and slopes covered by a single herb and shrubs 2 validate the effects of rainfall characteristics plant morphological features and slope gradients on water distribution in slopes and 3 evaluate the influence of variations in water distribution on slope stability the results are expected to provide new insights into the evaluation of water infiltration considering the comprehensive hydrological effects of vegetation and a theoretical basis for the prevention of mountain disasters 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and slope model information the eastern margin of the tibetan plateau located between the tibetan plateau and the sichuan basin is one of the most geologically active regions in the world zhang et al 2021 the climate in this region has been found to be extremely sensitive to global warming with an increasing warming rate of 0 104 c decade in the 20th century kuang and jiao 2016 this significant climate warming coincides with an increased potential of extreme weather events in this region with such changes the critical conditions for slope failures or other disasters are altered thus aggravating disaster risks specifically changes in temperature and precipitation have been observed to significantly affect the performance of plant communities kueppers et al 2017 bachelot et al 2020 leading to shifts in water distribution in ecosystems yang et al 2015 kueppers et al 2017 thus understanding the variations in the hydrological processes in slopes in the eastern region of the tibetan plateau is of high significance for predicting the development process of mountain disasters longchi national forest park in china e103 34 21 n31 8 19 which is located in the eastern margin of the tibetan plateau was taken as the study area the local climate of longchi national forest park elevation of 1800 3280 m is sub humid with mean annual precipitation of 1240 mm mean annual temperature of 12 c and mean annual sunshine hours of 1020 h zhang et al 2021 according to field investigation the topography of the study region is gentle at higher elevations and pebbly clay landslides are mainly developed on slopes with 10 40 based on the available literature the size of slope slot for lab experiments were l w d 1 2 m 0 5 1 m 0 22 0 5 m fox et al 1997 fohrer et al 1999 assouline and ben hur 2006 huang et al 2013 thus the slope model was established at the study area and the dimension of each slope slot was 2 m 0 5 m 0 5 m two outlets were located at heights of 0 0 m and 0 4 m on the front of the slope slot for collecting subsurface flow and surface runoff fig 1 a three slope gradients 10 20 and 30 were set in the slope model and four slots were set at each gradient 2 2 test materials and sample preparation the soil sample used for testing was obtained from a large landslide site in longchi national forest park and was representative of the typical soil in the region the soil sample was collected below the surface of 0 2 m and large gravels were eliminated then the soil was dried crushed and sieved through a 5 mm sieve finally the sieved soil was evenly mixed with moderate amount of gravels to prepare the tested soil the designed proportion of gravel volume is 15 according to the local gravel distribution and the term gravel is used here as a general term for all coarse particles 5 mm in diameter for the purposes of this study the maximum particle size in the tested soil was 40 mm based on the particle size distribution obtained from vibrating screens and malvern spray particle size analysis astm standard d 2487 2011 the tested soil was composed of 15 87 gravel 4 75 40 mm 15 77 sand 0 075 4 75 mm 49 52 silt 0 005 0 075 mm and 18 84 clay 0 005 mm fig 2 table 1 presents the index properties of the tested soil determined using laboratory tests the dominant species of cynodon dactylon and indigofera amblyantha along the eastern margin of the tibetan plateau especially the altitude 3000 m were chosen as the tested plants c dactylon is a perennial herb that possesses rhizomes and stolon it thrives in light sand and lightly acidic alkaline soil and is strongly drought resistant ng et al 2014 liang 2016 i amblyantha is a perennial deciduous shrub and possesses excellent drought resistance and barren resistance liang 2016 both plants are also widely used in re vegetation along the eastern margin of the tibetan plateau fig 3 shows an overview of the slope model including 12 slope slots set in a natural condition as shown in fig 3 tested soil with a thickness of 400 mm was compacted in each slope slot to ensure uniformity of the soil profile each slope slot was filled with four layers of tested soil and each layer of 100 mm thick was compacted soil surfaces between two soil layers were subjected to manual roughing and the bulk density of the compacted soil was 1 55 g cm 3 the deviation of bulk density from the target density was found to be 3 along the depth of slope slot the plants were cultivated in the slope slots with a seeding density of 10 g m 2 four slope slots of the same gradient were configured with c dactylon i amblyantha a combination of c dactylon i amblyantha and bare soil fig 3a the slope slots were covered and watered weekly at the initial stage of the planting experiment including those without plants after the soil particles on the slope surface stabilized all slope slots were exposed to the weather and 100 coverage was maintained the plants were planted in june 2019 and the first flowering occurred in january and march 2020 respectively indicating that the plants had reached maturity soil moisture sensors ss trs401 with a resolution of 0 02 m3 m 3 were installed at two locations at distances of 50 cm from the top wall and bottom wall of the slope slot respectively fig 1a three soil moisture sensors were installed at soil depths of 10 cm 20 cm and 30 cm at each location fig 1b the first test was carried out when the plants were slightly over one year old 2 3 gross rainfall plant biophysical and additional meteorological variables precipitation temperature humidity wind speed wind direction atmospheric pressure and solar radiation at the height of 2 m were measured every 1 min and 10 min means were recorded by an automatic micro meteorological instrument ryq 2 fig 3b individual rainfall events were separated by at least 5 h without rainfall zhang et al 2015 zheng et al 2018 the rainfall intensity ri mm h 1 for individual rainfall event was established by the weighted mean 10 min rainfall intensity zheng et al 2018 1 ri i 1 n r i g ri i where n is the number of 10 min recorded during a rainfall event r i is the rainfall amount mm at the ith 10 min ri i is the rainfall intensity mm h 1 at the ith 10 min and g is gross rainfall mm during a rainfall event plant height and litter depth were measured with a straightedge and leaf area index lai was estimated by using a plant canopy analyzer top 2000 canopy height was measured at the horizontal central position of the canopy and canopy area was calculated by taking the length and width of the largest part of the canopy in the vertical direction the volume of canopy was estimated by the product of canopy area and canopy height 2 4 measurements and calculation of surface runoff water infiltration and interception loss surface runoff and subsurface flow were collected using buckets placed under the outlets of the slope slots the volumes of surface runoff and subsurface flow of each slope slot were measured using a graduated cylinder and summarized for individual conditions soil moisture content was automatically monitored every 30 s by the soil moisture sensors soil moisture content was assumed to be consistent within 10 cm depth when pre rainfall processes occurred before the measurements the mean value of soil moisture content recorded by two sensors at the top and bottom locations was used as the increment of soil moisture content with 10 cm of soil layer for each slope slot in individual rainfall events the increment of soil moisture volume was calculated as follows 2 im i 1 n v m i s v where im is the increment of soil moisture volume mm vm is the variation in mean moisture content mm mm 1 sv is soil volume mm for each 10 cm depth and n is the number of soil stratifications in each slope slot based on the principle of water balance canopy interception loss for individual conditions can be obtained as follows 3 il p i m s r s f e p where p is precipitation mm in the open area im is the increment of soil moisture volume mm sr is surface runoff depth mm sf is subsurface flow depth mm and ep is evapotranspiration depth mm among them im sf is water infiltration depth mm due to the low air temperature soil heat flux and vapor pressure deficit during the rainfall process the rainfall duration is generally short resulting in low evapotranspiration which is negligible compared to the amount of incident rainfall thus ep was assumed to be 0 during rainfall in the present study 2 5 analysis of slope stability considering infiltration zonation considering that the green ampt model overestimates water infiltration wang et al 2003 analyzed the variation characteristics of moisture profile based on loess infiltration and proposed the division of the distribution of soil moisture content in the wetting zone into three layers including the saturated layer transitional layer and natural layer as shown in fig 4 a furthermore most cases have confirmed that the distribution of soil moisture content in the wetting zone can be represented by an elliptic curve fig 4b in which the length of the long semi axis of a fitted ellipse is the difference between the saturated moisture content and initial moisture content and the length of the short semi axis is the vertical depth of the wetting zone wang et al 2003 zhang et al 2014 hence the distribution of soil moisture content is assumed to be expressed by the following function 4 θ h θ h θ s 0 h h s θ h θ i θ s θ i 1 h h s h w 2 h s h h d θ h θ i h h d where h s h d h w 1 λ h d λ is the vertical depth ratio of the transitional layer to the wetting zone h s h w and h d denote the vertical depth of the saturated layer the transitional layer and the wetting zone respectively θ s and θ i represent the saturated moisture content and initial moisture content respectively and h is the soil depth based on eq 4 and the mass conservation equation in the cumulative water infiltration variations of moisture content in the saturated layer and the transitional layer should be comprehensively considered and it can be written as follows 5 i 0 h θ h θ i d h i s i t θ s θ i h s π 4 θ s θ i h w where i s and i t represent the cumulative water infiltration in the saturated layer and the transitional layer respectively experimental and theoretical works have verified that the thickness of the saturated layer is approximately half of the vertical depth of the wetting zone fig 4b wang et al 2003 zhang et al 2014 namely λ 0 5 thus eq 5 can be represented as the following function 6 i 4 π θ s θ i h d 8 for an inclined slope fig 4a based on the darcy s law the infiltration rate on the slope can be expressed as follows 7 i s k s s f h d h d where k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of soil and s f denotes the suction head of the wetting front on the slope the increment of soil moisture content can be expressed as the derivative of the cumulative rainfall infiltration 8 i s d t d i the vertical depth of the wetting front at time t can be derived using eqs 6 7 and 8 9 t 4 π θ s θ i 16 k s 2 h d 4 s f l n 1 h d s f the failure mode of unsaturated soil slopes is usually characterized by shallow depth and parallel positioning with the slope surface in the case of rainfall infiltration yao et al 2019 therefore rainfall induced slope instability is usually studied in the infinite slope model as shown in fig 5 in this study some assumptions were made for slope stability analysis 1 ponding does not occur on the slope during rainfall processes 2 the analysis object is an infinite slope 3 the slip surface is an approximate plane parallel to the slope surface and 4 the influence of horizontal forces between adjacent soil strips was not considered safety factor was selected as a determinant index to evaluate slope stability based on the mohr coulomb criterion and the limit equilibrium method the safety factor at the wetting front is defined as the ratio of the total anti sliding force to the sliding force of the wetting zone according to the conceptual model in fig 5 the anti sliding force at the wetting front was estimated by the shear strength formula of unsaturated soil and the sliding force is the component of the gravity of the soil mass in the wetting zone along the slope thus the safety factor of the infinite slope can be calculated according to the following function 10 f s τ f τ m c σ n t a n φ γ w s f t a n φ b τ m where τ f is the shear strength of unsaturated soil τ m is the sliding force of the wetting zone c and φ are the effective cohesion and effective friction angle of the soil respectively and φ b denotes the suction friction angle of shear strength varying with matric suction a linear relationship was assumed between soil gravity and moisture content in the unsaturated zone and the following expression of the unit gravity of soil in the transitional layer was derived 11 γ h γ t 2 γ t γ 0 h d h d h h s h h d where γ t and γ 0 represent soil saturated gravity and soil initial gravity respectively and h s h d 2 according to the conceptual model in fig 5 the normal effective stress and sliding force at the sliding surface can be expressed as follows 12 σ n 1 2 γ t h d h d 2 h d γ h d h cos 2 β 13 τ m 1 2 γ t h d h d 2 h d γ h d h s i n β c o s β where l 2 l γ z d z l 4 γ 0 γ t and β is slope gradient in this study the moisture content at the wetting front was assumed to be the initial moisture content thus the safety factor of slope at the wetting front can be expressed as follows 14 f s c 1 2 γ t h d h d 2 h d γ h d h cos 2 β t a n φ γ w s f t a n φ b 1 2 γ t h d h d 2 h d γ h d h s i n β c o s β where γ w is the unit gravity of water 3 results 3 1 rainfall characteristics and dynamic variation of interception loss infiltration runoff fig 6 presents the daily precipitation characteristics including rainfall amount fig 6a rainfall intensity fig 6b and rainfall duration fig 6c a total of 122 rainfall events were recorded with the cumulative rainfall amount of 1107 68 mm the maximum value of individual rainfall events was 136 5 mm and the minimum value was 0 4 mm the mean rainfall amount was 9 47 mm with the standard deviation and coefficient of variation were 8 68 mm and 91 66 respectively the frequency distributions of incident rainfall amount rainfall intensity and rainfall duration during the experimental period are illustrated in fig 7 individual rainfall events of 30 mm were rare accounting for only 19 5 of total rainfall events but 63 5 of the total rainfall amount fig 7a during the experimental period individual rainfall events with intensity 30 mm h 1 accounted for 77 6 of the total rainfall events and 42 8 of the cumulative rainfall amount fig 7b fig 7c reveals that rainfall events with a duration of 5 h account for 52 1 of all rainfall events and 30 8 of the total rainfall amount fig 8 shows 30 individual rainfall events expressed as interception loss runoff and infiltration and their association with incident rainfall amount in three land use types the amounts of the 30 rainfall events ranged from 2 1 mm to 132 6 mm with an average of 34 6 mm and their intensities ranged from 6 3 mm h 1 to 128 7 mm h 1 including three extreme rainfall events with amounts of 130 0 118 7 and 132 6 mm in the slopes with c dactylon and i amblyantha cover 13 and 17 runoff events occurred respectively accounting for 43 3 and 56 7 of the total rainfall events for the bare slope runoff generally occurred following rainfall events with amounts 6 1 mm or with intensities 7 2 mm h 1 fig 8a the observed critical rainfall intensities for runoff generation in the c dactylon and i amblyantha slopes were 25 mm h 1 and 36 mm h 1 respectively fig 8b c the relative interception loss in the c dactylon slope stabilized at 0 06 when the rainfall amount was 18 mm while in the i amblyantha slope it stabilized at 0 14 when the rainfall amount was 30 mm fig 8b c with the variation of antecedent moisture content 16 40 the infiltration amount in the bare slope accounts for 10 15 21 93 coefficient of variation 31 95 of corresponding incident rainfall amount the relative infiltration ranged from 18 64 to 36 48 cv 53 27 for the c dactylon slope and the corresponding values were 15 42 31 87 cv 48 65 for the i amblyantha slope when antecedent moisture content varied from 18 to 30 3 2 effects of rainfall characteristics on dynamic variation of interception loss infiltration runoff interception loss in both slopes covered by vegetation increased with increasing incident rainfall amount which were fitted by a linear function and a power function respectively fig 9 a the relationship between the relative interception loss and rainfall amount follows an exponential function for both the c dactylon and i amblyantha slopes fig 9b runoff exhibited a linear correlation with incident rainfall amount fig 9c while relative runoff showed an exponential relationship with rainfall amount for the three land use types fig 9d infiltration increased with increasing rainfall amount following a power function for the three land use types fig 9e relative infiltration first increased dramatically with increasing rainfall amount and then decreased gradually after the threshold values of 21 6 mm for the c dactylon slope and 14 2 mm for i amblyantha slope both of which followed an exponential function in the bare slope relative infiltration remained constant 100 with increasing rainfall amount up to a threshold of 6 0 mm after which it decreased exponentially fig 9f fig 10 a shows that interception loss increased with increasing rainfall intensity and then tended to be quasi constant for both the c dactylon and i amblyantha slopes the relative interception loss in both slopes first decreased with increasing rainfall intensity and then stabilized when rainfall intensity exceeded 21 38 mm h 1 c dactylon slope and 44 27 mm h 1 i amblyantha slope fig 10b significant positive relationships were observed between runoff and rainfall intensity in both the c dactylon and i amblyantha slopes p 0 01 fig 10c relative runoff first increased and then became quasi constant in the c dactylon slope following an exponential function whereas it showed a linear increase with rainfall intensity in the i amblyantha slope fig 10d based on the fitted curves of runoff and rainfall intensity the rainfall intensity threshold values for runoff generation were 6 63 24 67 and 35 34 mm h 1 for the bare c dactylon and i amblyantha slopes respectively relative runoff was lower in the c dactylon slope than in the i amblyantha slope when rainfall intensity was below 52 49 mm h 1 but this trend was reversed when the threshold was exceeded fig 10d the relationship between infiltration and rainfall intensity follows a quadratic function for the three land use types fig 10e relative infiltration had an increasing trend followed by a reduction with increasing rainfall intensity in the bare and i amblyantha slopes while it decreased in power function in the c dactylon slope fig 10f 3 3 effects of slope gradients on dynamic variation of interception loss infiltration runoff fig 11 depicts the variations in interception loss with rainfall intensity on the slopes with c dactylon and i amblyantha cover the interception loss in both slopes first increased and then tended to be constant as rainfall intensity increased along different slope gradients runoff intensity gradually increased and then became stable with increasing rainfall duration in the three land use types fig 12 in all slopes infiltration rate declined with increasing rainfall duration until reaching a minimum after which it leveled off fig 13 fig 14 a shows that the constant value of interception loss was negatively correlated with slope gradients in the i amblyantha slope p 0 05 while the relationships were not significant in the c dactylon slope p 0 23 the stable runoff intensity had a significant positive correlation with slope gradients in the three land use types p 0 05 fig 14b inversely the stable infiltration rate showed a significant negative correlation with slope gradients in the three land use types p 0 05 fig 14c the interception loss stable runoff intensity and stable infiltration rate of each land use type are quite different and differences in these indexes declined as slope gradient continuously increased moreover there were significant differences in morphological features between the two tested species p 0 05 table 2 3 4 effects of dynamic variation of interception loss infiltration runoff on slope stability the entire soil water characteristic curves and the hydraulic parameters of the three land use types were obtained using the van genuchten 1980 model fig 15 and the physical parameters of the tested soil are listed in table 3 with a rainfall intensity of 30 mm h 1 and a slope gradient of 30 we computed the infiltration process and safety factor by the mentioned model the theoretical infiltration process in the three land use types is presented in fig 16 a the computed safety factor at the wetting front in all slopes decreased nonlinearly with increasing rainfall duration and then tended to stabilize fig 16b based on the calculated safety factor at the wetting front the critical times of slope instability follow the order of bare slope 46 2 min i amblyantha slope 34 8 min c dactylon slope 30 5 min the depth of the wetting front increased nonlinearly with infiltration duration and a negative relationship was found between the wetting front depth and slope gradients fig 17 a fig 17b shows that infinite slope instability did not appear at slope gradients of 10 and 20 in addition we also analyzed the stability states of the infinite slope with the variation of rainfall intensity fig 18 the depth of the wetting front and rainfall intensity presented a complex relationship and slope stability exhibited a declining trend followed by an increment with increasing rainfall intensity in addition a rainfall intensity of 15 mm h 1 would not induce slope instability in slopes covered by i amblyantha fig 18b the critical time of slope instability is negatively and exponentially correlated to rainfall intensity for the i amblyantha slope whereas they exhibit a quadratic function relationship for bare slope and the c dactylon slope fig 19 except for the cases of low intensity rainfall events water infiltration modified by plants can accelerate slope instability with potential reductions of the safety factor by 15 9 51 3 4 discussion 4 1 dynamic variation of interception loss infiltration runoff in relation to rainfall characteristics it is well known that rainfall characteristics can affect the dynamic processes of interception loss infiltration runoff in different land use types assouline and ben hur 2006 huang et al 2013 crockford and richardson 2015 jian et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 in the present study the experiment was conducted in the rainy season june 20 to october 20 of 2020 the cumulative rainfall amount 1107 68 mm accounting for 83 80 of the annual precipitation 1321 81 mm in 2020 based on the rainfall distribution rainfall events of high intensity large amount and long duration mainly occurred in august fig 6 the frequency of short duration light rainfall events is higher than that of long duration heavy rainfall events during the experimental period fig 7 as the three land use types experienced the same meteorological conditions during the experimental period differences in water distribution among the three land use types fig 8 were mainly attributed to the structural characteristics of plants and morphological features of slope surface c dactylon is a perennial herb with smooth rhizomes and stolons and has open canopy ng et al 2014 liang 2016 which would allow it to accept more rainfall thereby increasing the possibility of stemflow generation these characteristics are beneficial for increasing infiltration and reducing canopy interception loss in the ecosystem in contrast i amblyantha has one rough stem slender branches with numerous tilt directions and ovate small leaves with a high rainwater storage capacity liang 2016 implying higher canopy interception loss due to the dense canopy previous studies have also confirmed that antecedent moisture content plays an vital role in affecting soil infiltration runoff process in slopes and a low initial moisture content means a large infiltration potential huang et al 2013 cui et al 2019 del campo et al 2019 antecedent moisture content significantly affected the initial infiltration rate however no significant relationship was found between antecedent moisture content and stable infiltration rate cui et al 2019 in this study we analyzed the dynamic variations of interception loss infiltration runoff in three land use types with random antecedent moisture content for 122 natural rainfall events then regression analysis was conducted to determine the variation trends for interception loss surface runoff and water infiltration and drew general conclusions about the dynamic variations of interception loss infiltration runoff and rainfall characteristics slope gradients in different land use types the antecedent moisture content for individual rainfall event does not affect the results of this study thus antecedent moisture content is not discussed separately relative interception loss decreased exponentially with increasing rainfall amount and rainfall intensity for both the c dactylon and i amblyantha slopes this was consistent with some studies for maize zheng et al 2018 and trees owens et al 2006 in addition we collected the rainfall partitioning of the individual shrubs on the available literatures table 4 and there were significant differences in rainfall partitioning among different shrubs p 0 05 the rainfall partitioning of shrubs was studied in the literature was mainly located in arid and desert regions with sparse canopy where the cumulative rainfall amounts were significantly lower than that we observed in the present study the high relative interception loss of shrubs in the arid and desert areas was mostly attributed to the frequent light rainfall events and the high evaporation rate during rainfall although the individual density was low this confirmed the conclusion that the interception loss of plants was controlled by crown architectures rainfall properties and planting density owens et al 2006 crockford and richardson 2015 zhang et al 2015 zheng et al 2018 jian et al 2019 relative runoff of bare slope 74 83 was significantly higher than that of the c dactylon slope 42 98 and i amblyantha slope 45 37 p 0 05 and a significant difference was observed between the both slopes with vegetation cover p 0 05 fig 9d fig 9e revealed that below a threshold of rainfall amount rainfall on the bare slope entirely infiltrates the slope with a larger infiltration amount than that on the vegetated slopes which are affected by canopy interception the critical rainfall amount for runoff generation is low for the bare slope 5 6 mm intermediate for the i amblyantha slope 14 2 mm and the highest for the c dactylon slope 21 6 mm the stable infiltration proportion of the slopes with c dactylon 45 67 and i amblyantha 33 78 cover exceeded that of the bare slope 23 82 and a marked difference was observed between the two slopes covered by vegetation p 0 05 the phenomenon may be explained by the following factors 1 the kinetic energy of net rainfall reaching the ground is significantly reduced by canopy which is conducive to water infiltration in the vegetated slopes whitford et al 1997 foley and silburn 2002 2 the stolons of cynodon dactylon blocked the migration of soil particles and reduced the velocity of overland flow thus increasing water infiltration liang 2016 3 the slope surface is cloudy and damp because of the upright stems and flat closed leaves of i amblyantha leading to the formation of a thin biological crust which is not favorable for water infiltration romkens et al 1986 janeau et al 2003 table 4 also showed the canopy saturated rainfall amounts of the individual shrubs the canopy saturated rainfall amount in the present study is larger than that in the literature due to the plants were cultivated in the slope slots with a seeding density of 10 g m 2 compared with low rainfall intensity high intensity rainfall can effectively saturate plant canopy and the kinetic energy of the raindrops directly impact plant canopy which is conducive to net rainfall this has also been corroborated by owens et al 2006 and zhang et al 2015 that high intensity short duration rainfall events yield a higher net precipitation input into the soil in the ecosystem the proportions of runoff and infiltration exhibited complex trends with increasing rainfall intensity in the three land use types fig 10 this could be explained by the difference in the process of runoff generation the ovate leaves of i amblyantha form a denser canopy than that by the linear leaves of c dactylon leading to differences in canopy structure between the corresponding slopes fig 3 mostof the rainfall is captured by the canopy when the i amblyantha slope is subjected to light rainfall intensity and the intercepted rainwater is directly evaporated back to the atmosphere meanwhile the oblique twigs and ovate leaves lean around the stem under the effect of rainwater gravity and overlap to form a special drainage channel also causing part of the intercepted rainwater to flow directly to the outside of slope slot and not pass the slope surface in contrast with the relative open canopy system of c dactylon most of the rainfall is accepted by the canopy and then drops from the leaves under gravity which is expressed as released rainfall the released rainfall is entirely converted to infiltration due to the reduction in its kinetic energy when rainfall intensity exceeds the threshold values the canopies of both plants become saturated following which free rainfall not flowing through leaves becomes the dominant form of precipitation for c dactylon and released rainfall for i amblyantha the relative runoff for c dactylon sharply increased with increasing rainfall intensity whereas i amblyantha exhibited a trend of linear increase the reasons for the trends of relative infiltration with rainfall intensity largely mirrored those analyzed for relative runoff thus the explanation for relative infiltration is not presented separately 4 2 dynamic variation of interception infiltration runoff in relation to slope gradients the constant value of interception loss was significantly negatively correlated with slope gradients in the i amblyantha slope p 0 05 while the relationships were not significant in the c dactylon slope p 0 23 the observation could be explained by differences in aboveground biomass at each slope gradient table 2 c dactylon is a perennial herb with smooth rhizomes and stolons and micro barriers develop at the junction of plant roots and stems to prevent soil particles from migrating which leads to the deposition of soil particles at the junctions the deposited soil particles act as micro filter dams and block overland flow decrease runoff velocity and increase water retention on the slope surface facilitating relatively uniform plant growth at the top and bottom of each slope slot i amblyantha has only one rough stem due to which its interception effect on overland flow is weak this can be confirmed by the lower relative infiltration observed for incident rainfall fig 9f abundant water is required for shrub growth as i amblyantha does not retard overland flow water flows to the bottom of slope resulting in significantly better growth of plants at the bottom of slope than at the top of steep slopes therefore the aboveground biomass of the shrub showed significant differences with increasing slope gradient field data showed that the cumulative volume of infiltrated water in the three land use types increased at a decreasing rate with increasing rainfall duration after continuous rainfall for 70 min the volume of infiltrated water in the three land use types appeared to increase linearly over time the infiltration rate was determined by fitting ordinary least square regression to the calculated variation in the cumulative volume of water infiltrated over time fox et al 1997 huang et al 2013 cui et al 2019 similarly the measured runoff amount per unit time increased at a decreasing rate as rainfall duration increased and then tended to be quasi constant when the measured runoff amount per unit time remains constant with increasing rainfall duration the value is the stable runoff intensity liang 2016 the stable infiltration rates of the three land use types decreased gradually with increasing slope gradient whereas the stable runoff intensity exhibited an opposite pattern fig 14 in addition the influence of the structural characteristics of plant species on these indexes also decreased as slope gradient increased these results are consistent with those of previous studies huang et al 2013 liang 2016 as previously mentioned the differences in water distribution among the three land use types may be attributable to most of the precipitation being lost as runoff in the bare slope while the presence of plants reduced surface runoff by increasing interception loss and enhancing soil permeability the bare slope does not include any measures of interception and short term storage which increased the probability of rainwater being converted into runoff and thus the infiltration amount declined for the slopes covered by vegetation plant roots could alter the soil structure and increase capillary pore channels for water infiltration which enhanced the process of water infiltration murielle et al 2011 huang et al 2013 del campo et al 2019 in addition the stolons of c dactylon also increased slope roughness which are not conducive to the formation and development of surface runoff liang 2016 thus promoting infiltration compared to the c dactylon slope the overlapped and interlocked leaves of i amblyantha intercepted more precipitation and the upright stems had a weaker blocking effect on overland flow resulting in a lower relative infiltration on the i amblyantha slope the complicated infiltration runoff process with slope gradients may be explained by changes in the stress state of raindrops reaching the slope surface the distance of overland flows and the area of slope slot subjected to net rainfall fox et al 1997 huang et al 2013 chaplot and bissonnais 2015 in this study the length and width of each slope slot were constant therefore the relationship between the actual area of slope subjected to net rainfall and slope gradient followed the cosine function the projected area of the slope on the horizontal plane decreased with increasing slope gradient which reduced the amount of net rainfall reaching the slope surface further resulting in the decline of overland flow in a unit time chaplot and bissonnais 2015 in addition the increase in slope gradient increased the component force of the weight of water along the slope direction which significantly accelerated the velocity of overland flow fox et al 1997 janeau et al 2003 poesen 2010 the increase in flow velocity reduced the standing time of surface water infiltrating deep soil along a certain slope length thus increasing runoff intensity therefore as the slope gradient increased its influence on the characteristics of runoff and infiltration also became stronger clearly there may be a critical slope gradient for balancing the effect of increasing runoff velocity with the decrease in slope area subjected to rainfall slight physical and biological crusting was also observed on the bare slope and the i amblyantha slope but not on the c dactylon slope previous studies have confirmed that soil physical and biological crusting can significantly inhibit rainwater infiltration and increase runoff generation in the slopes constituted with clay xiao and hu 2017 xiao and bowker 2020 gabriel et al 2021 and the degree of soil physical crusting gradually decreases with increasing slope gradient due to the reduction in raindrop density per unit of surface area janeau et al 2003 assouline and ben hur 2006 poesen 2010 in the present study three slope gradients were set with the largest slope at 30 on the bare slope physical crusting showed no significant difference among the three slope gradients p 0 33 on the i amblyantha slope slight biological crusting formed due to the upright stems and flat closed leaves of i amblyantha but there was no significant relationship between the degree of biological crusting and slope gradients therefore the effect of differences in soil crusting on the infiltration runoff process is negligible for individual land use types 4 3 dynamic variation of interception loss infiltration runoff in relation to slope stability in the present study soil moisture content was monitored at only three depths in each slope slot and the maximum depth of the monitored sites was 0 3 m fig 1 to evaluate the influence of variation in interception loss infiltration runoff on slope stability as mentioned in section 2 5 an infinite slope model was selected as an example to analyze the water infiltration process the calculated infiltration amounts on the three land use types under different rainfall conditions fig 9e fig 10e and slope gradients fig 13 were substituted into eqs 6 and 9 to obtain the theoretical process of water infiltration at the infinite slope which was then applied in the analysis of the safety factor at the wetting front considering a rainfall intensity of 30 mm h 1 and a slope gradient of 30 we monitored the movement of wetting front at the slope slots and computed the theoretical infiltration process at the infinite slope fig 16 when the monitored depth was 0 3 m the wetting front appeared at 25 73 10 81 and 13 74 min on the bare c dactylon and i amblyantha slopes respectively the corresponding times computed by the model were 26 62 12 60 and 14 98 min the maximum deviation of the wetting front at 0 3 m depth was 1 79 min 16 56 on the c dactylon slope in the present study the slope slot was filled with homogeneous soil and the effect of plant roots on the hydraulic characteristics of the tested soil was considered in the calculation of slope stability fig 15 the modeling results were basically consistent with the monitored results which proved that the adopted model can be used to accurately and reliably evaluate slope stability based on rainfall infiltration ulteriorly the computed safety factor at the wetting front ranked in order of higher to lower were bare slope i amblyantha slope and c dactylon slope the result is consistent with the water distribution modified by c dactylon and i amblyantha in other words incident rainfall generates a higher amount of runoff in bare slope than in the c dactylon and i amblyantha slopes in contrast slopes with vegetation cover facilitate higher infiltration with the c dactylon slope exhibiting the maximum value whereas the bare slope exhibited the minimum value fig 9 in addition to soil properties the water infiltration process on the slope is also affected by slope gradient and rainfall intensity which are presented in eq 14 and figs 10 14 the wetting front depth decreased with increasing slope gradient fig 17a this was also confirmed by assouline and ben hur 2006 and huang et al 2013 the failure of infinite slope did not appear at slope gradients of 10 and 20 fig 17b thus it may be concluded that slope gradient plays a dominant role in slope stability although the hydrological effects of plants can significantly affect the water infiltration process moreover the influence of water distribution on slope stability weakens with increasing slope gradient based on fitted equations of infiltration amount and rainfall intensity fig 10 variations in the stability states of the infinite slope with rainfall intensity were analyzed slope stability first decreased then increased with increasing rainfall intensity this was consistent with huang et al 2013 who found that the water storage across the soil profile initially increased and then decreased as rainfall intensity increased rainfall events with low rainfall intensity would not induce slope instability in slopes covered by i amblyantha fig 19 owing to the strong interception ability of the canopy except for the cases of low intensity rainfall events water distribution modified by plants can increase the potential of slope instability the potential of extreme weather events is increasing in the eastern margin of the tibetan plateau kuang and jiao 2016 it is clear that vegetation plays a beneficial role in controlling soil and water loss ng et al 2014 leung et al 2015 liang 2016 das et al 2021 from the perspective of disaster prevention i amblyantha shows better performance in water distribution than c dactylon which can increase interception loss resulting in a decrease in net precipitation i amblyantha could prevent significantly more rainwater from infiltrating to the deep soil which is crucial in the prevention of slope failure associated with rainfall events of long duration and low intensity this may have profound implications in the application of our tested species the findings could verify the excellent interception capacity of i amblyantha could be recognized as an important element of mountain hydrology and offer valuable information for the decision makers concerned with planting i amblyantha in soil water conservation geological disaster prevention and ecological environment construction in the subtropical region the methodology adopted in the present study could reasonably realize the evaluation of slope stability based on the dynamic variation of interception loss infiltration runoff under different rainfall events however there are some limitations to the broader applicability of the experimental results 1 considering the special canopy structure and root morphology of c dactylon and i amblyantha and the special meteorological conditions in the eastern margin of the tibetan plateau the variations in water distribution in this study may significantly differ from those associated with other ecosystems or regions 2 the observed water distribution in the three land use types on the slope slots filled with homogeneous soil and the computational results are not applicable to natural slopes with undulating terrain uncertain slip surfaces and multiple strata 3 canopy interception loss was calculated based on the principle of water balance and water evapotranspiration during rainfall was not considered because it is negligible in the incident rainfall amount in this region 4 the present study adopted the concept of soil moisture stratification to analytically estimate slope stability based on the modified amounts of water infiltration for incident rainfall and the mechanical aspect of plant roots affecting slope stability was not considered 5 conclusions the three land use types were subjected to identical initial soil density and meteorological conditions with only the vegetation cover modified field date shows that rainfall characteristics slope gradients and morphological features of plant species obviously affect variations in interception loss water infiltration surface runoff the modeling results present that modified processes of infiltration runoff by plants accelerate slope instability and indigofera amblyantha shows better performance in the prevention of slope failure moreover the hydrological effect of plants on slope stability weakens with increasing grade overall the present study is the first attempt to consider the interception effect of plant canopy in the evaluation of slope stability for incident rainfall although some simplifications and assumptions were applied in the derivation of the calculation model the findings further enrich our understanding of the hydrological mechanism of vegetation in slope stability credit authorship contribution statement

3112,hydrological processes in slopes play an important role in the evaluation of slope stability at the catchment scale this study investigated the dynamic variations of interception loss infiltration runoff in three land use types bare slope and slopes with c dactylon and i amblyantha cover for incident rainfall and their influence on slope stability gross rainfall surface runoff and subsurface flow were measured during the rainy season in 2020 and the influences of rainfall characteristics rainfall amount and intensity and slope gradients on canopy interception loss water infiltration and surface runoff were evaluated on this basis a model considering infiltration zonation was adopted to estimate slope stability under the influence of infiltration modified by vegetation field test results showed that runoff on bare slope generally occurred following rainfall events with amounts of 6 1 mm or intensities of 7 2 mm h 1 for slopes covered by c dactylon and i amblyantha the thresholds of rainfall intensity for runoff generation were 25 mm h 1 and 36 mm h 1 respectively the calculated relative interception loss for the slope with c dactylon cover stabilized at 0 05 0 10 when the rainfall amount was 18 mm while that for the slope with i amblyantha cover stabilized at 0 10 0 15 when the rainfall amount was 30 mm moreover the slope with c dactylon cover appeared to have a higher proportion of infiltration than that with i amblyantha cover the stable infiltration rate in the three land use types decreased gradually with increasing slope gradient whereas an opposite pattern was exhibited for the stable runoff intensity the influence of the morphological features of plant species on the variation of interception loss infiltration runoff weakened as slope gradient increased the modeling results demonstrated that the depth of the wetting front was negatively correlated with slope gradient and followed a quadratic function with rainfall intensity based on the computed safety factor at the wetting front the critical times of slope instability follow the order of bare slope 46 2 min i amblyantha slope 34 8 min c dactylon slope 30 5 min the modification of infiltration by plants accelerated slope instability with potential reductions in the safety factor by 15 9 53 1 slope gradient plays a dominant role in slope stability and the influence of modified infiltration on slope stability weakens with increasing slope gradient those findings provide valuable information for the decision makers concerned with planting i amblyantha in

martinez meza and whitford 1996 dunkerley 2015 plant canopy serves as the top interface for rainwater transport in the ecosystem partitioning rainfall into three parts 1 interception loss in which rainwater is captured by plant canopy and directly evaporated back to the atmosphere 2 throughfall which reaches the ground by freely falling through canopy gaps and dripping from stems branches and leaves and 3 stemflow which flows to the ground along the stems after precipitation is intercepted by plant canopy martinez meza and whitford 1996 dunkerley 2015 zhang et al 2015 rainfall partitioning by plant canopy weakens the kinetic energy of raindrops del campo et al 2019 das et al 2021 thereby mitigating the formation of the physical crust of soil under the canopy foley and silburn 2002 alleviating soil erosion assouline and ben hur 2006 delaying runoff generation and reducing peak flood discharge romkens et al 1986 as the first hydrological process of rainwater circulation rainfall partitioning in mountain ecosystems must be considered because it directly determines the amount of net rainfall reaching the ground zhang et al 2015 zheng et al 2018 and the potential of water infiltration or surface runoff has adverse geological effects loáiciga and johnson 2018 del campo et al 2019 previous studies have demonstrated that the characteristics of partitioned rainfall are very sensitive to variations in rainfall characteristics vegetation morphological structure and meteorological conditions martinez meza and whitford 1996 owens et al 2006 crockford and richardson 2015 zhang et al 2015 jian et al 2019 and each variable can significantly impact the behavior of plant communities particularly net rainfall serrato and diaz 1998 crockford and richardson 2015 zhang et al 2015 for instance regarding maize the relative interception loss increases from 3 1 at the seedling stage to 17 3 at the tasseling stage and then declines to 16 5 at the maturity stage zheng et al 2018 in arid areas with sparse canopy the maximum canopy interception loss is only 0 3 6 5 mm with the interception loss accounts for approximately 25 15 11 30 of the total rainfall dunkerley 2015 therefore although there are numerous studies on rainfall partitioning it remains difficult to draw general conclusions and compare studies on rainfall partitioning in different ecosystems the net rainfall reaching the ground consisting of throughfall and stemflow is subject to the subsequent hydrological processes and redistributing into soil moisture replenishment and related flows zheng et al 2018 del campo et al 2019 net rainfall is the main source of water for ground under the canopy and rainwater infiltration is an important hydrological process directly affecting the evolution of mountain hazards such as landslides and debris flow murielle et al 2011 loáiciga and johnson 2018 water infiltration is mainly controlled by rainfall characteristics assouline and ben hur 2006 li and shao 2006 slope gradient fox et al 1997 huang et al 2013 vegetation cover fohrer et al 1999 leung et al 2015 soil properties leung et al 2015 deb et al 2019 and slope surface features roughness and crusting janeau et al 2003 poesen et al 2010 these factors affect water distribution in the soil profile during the infiltration process and the temporal spatial variation of runoff generation mechanisms water infiltration is highly dependent on rainfall characteristics such as the amount duration intensity and variability foley and silbum 2002 huang et al 2013 in general water infiltration exhibits a positive correlation with individual rainfall amount li and shao 2006 but shows a complex relationship with individual rainfall intensity romkens et al 1986 huang et al 2013 light rainfall intensity is conducive to water infiltration in contrast during rainfall events of excessive intensity raindrops with strong kinetic energy destroy the surface soil structure and detached particles seal the pores of surface soil thus significantly reduced the infiltration rate romkens et al 1986 li and shao 2006 in addition fohrer et al 1999 observed that intermittent rainfall events resulted in a rapid decrease in the infiltration rate than continuous rainfall events slope gradient can significantly affect water infiltration but experimental studies have yielded contradictory results some studies have observed a decrease in the stable infiltration rate with increasing slope gradient fox et al 1997 chaplot and bissonnais 2015 while others claimed that the stable infiltration rate increased with increasing slope gradient assouline and ben hur 2006 poesen 2010 loáiciga and johnson 2018 both phenomena are commonly ascribed to the following two aspects 1 increases in slope gradient significantly accelerate the velocity and reduce the depth of overland flow which reduces the maximum storage amount and the standing time of surface runoff fox et al 1997 chaplot and bissonnais 2015 2 increases in slope gradient reduce the raindrop density per unit of surface area due to which a weak crust develops on steep slopes owing to the inverse relationship between slope gradient and the kinetic energy of raindrops resulting in an increase in water infiltration janeau et al 2003 assouline and ben hur 2006 poesen 2010 at present some contradictions have been reported in the literature regarding the effect of vegetation cover on water infiltration with infiltration rates measured in natural ground covered by vegetation being either lower during active root growth ng et al 2014 leung et al 2015 or higher during the decay of mature roots murielle et al 2011 huang et al 2013 the results reveal that plant roots could affect water infiltration through two mechanisms 1 modification of soil permeability by the development of a macro pore system as a consequence of root growth murielle et al 2011 del campo et al 2019 2 alteration of the soil water characteristic curve by the root occupancy of soil pore spaces ng et al 2014 leung et al 2015 in addition some studies have also concluded that water infiltration strongly depends on soil properties ng et al 2014 deb et al 2019 del campo et al 2019 soil antecedent moisture content significantly affects the initial infiltration rate whereas total soil porosity soil mean weight diameter and soil organic matter determine the stable infiltration rate li and shao 2006 murielle et al 2011 cui et al 2019 as mentioned above rainfall partitioning by plant canopy directly determines the amount of net rainfall and the modification of soil permeability due to the presence of roots also significantly alters the infiltration runoff process on slopes since these processes exist simultaneously a relevant question is how the coupling of those processes affects the evolution of geological disasters although the importance of rainfall partitioning by plant canopy is widely recognized however few studies attempted to consider the interception effect of canopy on the dynamic process of infiltration runoff on slopes with vegetation cover for individual rainfall events which is crucial for assessing slope stability at the catchment scale this study attempts to analyze the comprehensive hydrological effects of vegetation on water distribution for incident rainfall and relate it with the evaluation of slope stability in the field of geological hazards water distribution in slopes is described as surface runoff and water infiltration during rainfall considering the canopy interception effect therefore water distribution in slopes covered by vegetation is classified as canopy interception loss surface runoff and water infiltration for incident rainfall in this study the following three objectives were set 1 quantify water distribution into interception loss runoff and infiltration on bare slope and slopes covered by a single herb and shrubs 2 validate the effects of rainfall characteristics plant morphological features and slope gradients on water distribution in slopes and 3 evaluate the influence of variations in water distribution on slope stability the results are expected to provide new insights into the evaluation of water infiltration considering the comprehensive hydrological effects of vegetation and a theoretical basis for the prevention of mountain disasters 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and slope model information the eastern margin of the tibetan plateau located between the tibetan plateau and the sichuan basin is one of the most geologically active regions in the world zhang et al 2021 the climate in this region has been found to be extremely sensitive to global warming with an increasing warming rate of 0 104 c decade in the 20th century kuang and jiao 2016 this significant climate warming coincides with an increased potential of extreme weather events in this region with such changes the critical conditions for slope failures or other disasters are altered thus aggravating disaster risks specifically changes in temperature and precipitation have been observed to significantly affect the performance of plant communities kueppers et al 2017 bachelot et al 2020 leading to shifts in water distribution in ecosystems yang et al 2015 kueppers et al 2017 thus understanding the variations in the hydrological processes in slopes in the eastern region of the tibetan plateau is of high significance for predicting the development process of mountain disasters longchi national forest park in china e103 34 21 n31 8 19 which is located in the eastern margin of the tibetan plateau was taken as the study area the local climate of longchi national forest park elevation of 1800 3280 m is sub humid with mean annual precipitation of 1240 mm mean annual temperature of 12 c and mean annual sunshine hours of 1020 h zhang et al 2021 according to field investigation the topography of the study region is gentle at higher elevations and pebbly clay landslides are mainly developed on slopes with 10 40 based on the available literature the size of slope slot for lab experiments were l w d 1 2 m 0 5 1 m 0 22 0 5 m fox et al 1997 fohrer et al 1999 assouline and ben hur 2006 huang et al 2013 thus the slope model was established at the study area and the dimension of each slope slot was 2 m 0 5 m 0 5 m two outlets were located at heights of 0 0 m and 0 4 m on the front of the slope slot for collecting subsurface flow and surface runoff fig 1 a three slope gradients 10 20 and 30 were set in the slope model and four slots were set at each gradient 2 2 test materials and sample preparation the soil sample used for testing was obtained from a large landslide site in longchi national forest park and was representative of the typical soil in the region the soil sample was collected below the surface of 0 2 m and large gravels were eliminated then the soil was dried crushed and sieved through a 5 mm sieve finally the sieved soil was evenly mixed with moderate amount of gravels to prepare the tested soil the designed proportion of gravel volume is 15 according to the local gravel distribution and the term gravel is used here as a general term for all coarse particles 5 mm in diameter for the purposes of this study the maximum particle size in the tested soil was 40 mm based on the particle size distribution obtained from vibrating screens and malvern spray particle size analysis astm standard d 2487 2011 the tested soil was composed of 15 87 gravel 4 75 40 mm 15 77 sand 0 075 4 75 mm 49 52 silt 0 005 0 075 mm and 18 84 clay 0 005 mm fig 2 table 1 presents the index properties of the tested soil determined using laboratory tests the dominant species of cynodon dactylon and indigofera amblyantha along the eastern margin of the tibetan plateau especially the altitude 3000 m were chosen as the tested plants c dactylon is a perennial herb that possesses rhizomes and stolon it thrives in light sand and lightly acidic alkaline soil and is strongly drought resistant ng et al 2014 liang 2016 i amblyantha is a perennial deciduous shrub and possesses excellent drought resistance and barren resistance liang 2016 both plants are also widely used in re vegetation along the eastern margin of the tibetan plateau fig 3 shows an overview of the slope model including 12 slope slots set in a natural condition as shown in fig 3 tested soil with a thickness of 400 mm was compacted in each slope slot to ensure uniformity of the soil profile each slope slot was filled with four layers of tested soil and each layer of 100 mm thick was compacted soil surfaces between two soil layers were subjected to manual roughing and the bulk density of the compacted soil was 1 55 g cm 3 the deviation of bulk density from the target density was found to be 3 along the depth of slope slot the plants were cultivated in the slope slots with a seeding density of 10 g m 2 four slope slots of the same gradient were configured with c dactylon i amblyantha a combination of c dactylon i amblyantha and bare soil fig 3a the slope slots were covered and watered weekly at the initial stage of the planting experiment including those without plants after the soil particles on the slope surface stabilized all slope slots were exposed to the weather and 100 coverage was maintained the plants were planted in june 2019 and the first flowering occurred in january and march 2020 respectively indicating that the plants had reached maturity soil moisture sensors ss trs401 with a resolution of 0 02 m3 m 3 were installed at two locations at distances of 50 cm from the top wall and bottom wall of the slope slot respectively fig 1a three soil moisture sensors were installed at soil depths of 10 cm 20 cm and 30 cm at each location fig 1b the first test was carried out when the plants were slightly over one year old 2 3 gross rainfall plant biophysical and additional meteorological variables precipitation temperature humidity wind speed wind direction atmospheric pressure and solar radiation at the height of 2 m were measured every 1 min and 10 min means were recorded by an automatic micro meteorological instrument ryq 2 fig 3b individual rainfall events were separated by at least 5 h without rainfall zhang et al 2015 zheng et al 2018 the rainfall intensity ri mm h 1 for individual rainfall event was established by the weighted mean 10 min rainfall intensity zheng et al 2018 1 ri i 1 n r i g ri i where n is the number of 10 min recorded during a rainfall event r i is the rainfall amount mm at the ith 10 min ri i is the rainfall intensity mm h 1 at the ith 10 min and g is gross rainfall mm during a rainfall event plant height and litter depth were measured with a straightedge and leaf area index lai was estimated by using a plant canopy analyzer top 2000 canopy height was measured at the horizontal central position of the canopy and canopy area was calculated by taking the length and width of the largest part of the canopy in the vertical direction the volume of canopy was estimated by the product of canopy area and canopy height 2 4 measurements and calculation of surface runoff water infiltration and interception loss surface runoff and subsurface flow were collected using buckets placed under the outlets of the slope slots the volumes of surface runoff and subsurface flow of each slope slot were measured using a graduated cylinder and summarized for individual conditions soil moisture content was automatically monitored every 30 s by the soil moisture sensors soil moisture content was assumed to be consistent within 10 cm depth when pre rainfall processes occurred before the measurements the mean value of soil moisture content recorded by two sensors at the top and bottom locations was used as the increment of soil moisture content with 10 cm of soil layer for each slope slot in individual rainfall events the increment of soil moisture volume was calculated as follows 2 im i 1 n v m i s v where im is the increment of soil moisture volume mm vm is the variation in mean moisture content mm mm 1 sv is soil volume mm for each 10 cm depth and n is the number of soil stratifications in each slope slot based on the principle of water balance canopy interception loss for individual conditions can be obtained as follows 3 il p i m s r s f e p where p is precipitation mm in the open area im is the increment of soil moisture volume mm sr is surface runoff depth mm sf is subsurface flow depth mm and ep is evapotranspiration depth mm among them im sf is water infiltration depth mm due to the low air temperature soil heat flux and vapor pressure deficit during the rainfall process the rainfall duration is generally short resulting in low evapotranspiration which is negligible compared to the amount of incident rainfall thus ep was assumed to be 0 during rainfall in the present study 2 5 analysis of slope stability considering infiltration zonation considering that the green ampt model overestimates water infiltration wang et al 2003 analyzed the variation characteristics of moisture profile based on loess infiltration and proposed the division of the distribution of soil moisture content in the wetting zone into three layers including the saturated layer transitional layer and natural layer as shown in fig 4 a furthermore most cases have confirmed that the distribution of soil moisture content in the wetting zone can be represented by an elliptic curve fig 4b in which the length of the long semi axis of a fitted ellipse is the difference between the saturated moisture content and initial moisture content and the length of the short semi axis is the vertical depth of the wetting zone wang et al 2003 zhang et al 2014 hence the distribution of soil moisture content is assumed to be expressed by the following function 4 θ h θ h θ s 0 h h s θ h θ i θ s θ i 1 h h s h w 2 h s h h d θ h θ i h h d where h s h d h w 1 λ h d λ is the vertical depth ratio of the transitional layer to the wetting zone h s h w and h d denote the vertical depth of the saturated layer the transitional layer and the wetting zone respectively θ s and θ i represent the saturated moisture content and initial moisture content respectively and h is the soil depth based on eq 4 and the mass conservation equation in the cumulative water infiltration variations of moisture content in the saturated layer and the transitional layer should be comprehensively considered and it can be written as follows 5 i 0 h θ h θ i d h i s i t θ s θ i h s π 4 θ s θ i h w where i s and i t represent the cumulative water infiltration in the saturated layer and the transitional layer respectively experimental and theoretical works have verified that the thickness of the saturated layer is approximately half of the vertical depth of the wetting zone fig 4b wang et al 2003 zhang et al 2014 namely λ 0 5 thus eq 5 can be represented as the following function 6 i 4 π θ s θ i h d 8 for an inclined slope fig 4a based on the darcy s law the infiltration rate on the slope can be expressed as follows 7 i s k s s f h d h d where k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of soil and s f denotes the suction head of the wetting front on the slope the increment of soil moisture content can be expressed as the derivative of the cumulative rainfall infiltration 8 i s d t d i the vertical depth of the wetting front at time t can be derived using eqs 6 7 and 8 9 t 4 π θ s θ i 16 k s 2 h d 4 s f l n 1 h d s f the failure mode of unsaturated soil slopes is usually characterized by shallow depth and parallel positioning with the slope surface in the case of rainfall infiltration yao et al 2019 therefore rainfall induced slope instability is usually studied in the infinite slope model as shown in fig 5 in this study some assumptions were made for slope stability analysis 1 ponding does not occur on the slope during rainfall processes 2 the analysis object is an infinite slope 3 the slip surface is an approximate plane parallel to the slope surface and 4 the influence of horizontal forces between adjacent soil strips was not considered safety factor was selected as a determinant index to evaluate slope stability based on the mohr coulomb criterion and the limit equilibrium method the safety factor at the wetting front is defined as the ratio of the total anti sliding force to the sliding force of the wetting zone according to the conceptual model in fig 5 the anti sliding force at the wetting front was estimated by the shear strength formula of unsaturated soil and the sliding force is the component of the gravity of the soil mass in the wetting zone along the slope thus the safety factor of the infinite slope can be calculated according to the following function 10 f s τ f τ m c σ n t a n φ γ w s f t a n φ b τ m where τ f is the shear strength of unsaturated soil τ m is the sliding force of the wetting zone c and φ are the effective cohesion and effective friction angle of the soil respectively and φ b denotes the suction friction angle of shear strength varying with matric suction a linear relationship was assumed between soil gravity and moisture content in the unsaturated zone and the following expression of the unit gravity of soil in the transitional layer was derived 11 γ h γ t 2 γ t γ 0 h d h d h h s h h d where γ t and γ 0 represent soil saturated gravity and soil initial gravity respectively and h s h d 2 according to the conceptual model in fig 5 the normal effective stress and sliding force at the sliding surface can be expressed as follows 12 σ n 1 2 γ t h d h d 2 h d γ h d h cos 2 β 13 τ m 1 2 γ t h d h d 2 h d γ h d h s i n β c o s β where l 2 l γ z d z l 4 γ 0 γ t and β is slope gradient in this study the moisture content at the wetting front was assumed to be the initial moisture content thus the safety factor of slope at the wetting front can be expressed as follows 14 f s c 1 2 γ t h d h d 2 h d γ h d h cos 2 β t a n φ γ w s f t a n φ b 1 2 γ t h d h d 2 h d γ h d h s i n β c o s β where γ w is the unit gravity of water 3 results 3 1 rainfall characteristics and dynamic variation of interception loss infiltration runoff fig 6 presents the daily precipitation characteristics including rainfall amount fig 6a rainfall intensity fig 6b and rainfall duration fig 6c a total of 122 rainfall events were recorded with the cumulative rainfall amount of 1107 68 mm the maximum value of individual rainfall events was 136 5 mm and the minimum value was 0 4 mm the mean rainfall amount was 9 47 mm with the standard deviation and coefficient of variation were 8 68 mm and 91 66 respectively the frequency distributions of incident rainfall amount rainfall intensity and rainfall duration during the experimental period are illustrated in fig 7 individual rainfall events of 30 mm were rare accounting for only 19 5 of total rainfall events but 63 5 of the total rainfall amount fig 7a during the experimental period individual rainfall events with intensity 30 mm h 1 accounted for 77 6 of the total rainfall events and 42 8 of the cumulative rainfall amount fig 7b fig 7c reveals that rainfall events with a duration of 5 h account for 52 1 of all rainfall events and 30 8 of the total rainfall amount fig 8 shows 30 individual rainfall events expressed as interception loss runoff and infiltration and their association with incident rainfall amount in three land use types the amounts of the 30 rainfall events ranged from 2 1 mm to 132 6 mm with an average of 34 6 mm and their intensities ranged from 6 3 mm h 1 to 128 7 mm h 1 including three extreme rainfall events with amounts of 130 0 118 7 and 132 6 mm in the slopes with c dactylon and i amblyantha cover 13 and 17 runoff events occurred respectively accounting for 43 3 and 56 7 of the total rainfall events for the bare slope runoff generally occurred following rainfall events with amounts 6 1 mm or with intensities 7 2 mm h 1 fig 8a the observed critical rainfall intensities for runoff generation in the c dactylon and i amblyantha slopes were 25 mm h 1 and 36 mm h 1 respectively fig 8b c the relative interception loss in the c dactylon slope stabilized at 0 06 when the rainfall amount was 18 mm while in the i amblyantha slope it stabilized at 0 14 when the rainfall amount was 30 mm fig 8b c with the variation of antecedent moisture content 16 40 the infiltration amount in the bare slope accounts for 10 15 21 93 coefficient of variation 31 95 of corresponding incident rainfall amount the relative infiltration ranged from 18 64 to 36 48 cv 53 27 for the c dactylon slope and the corresponding values were 15 42 31 87 cv 48 65 for the i amblyantha slope when antecedent moisture content varied from 18 to 30 3 2 effects of rainfall characteristics on dynamic variation of interception loss infiltration runoff interception loss in both slopes covered by vegetation increased with increasing incident rainfall amount which were fitted by a linear function and a power function respectively fig 9 a the relationship between the relative interception loss and rainfall amount follows an exponential function for both the c dactylon and i amblyantha slopes fig 9b runoff exhibited a linear correlation with incident rainfall amount fig 9c while relative runoff showed an exponential relationship with rainfall amount for the three land use types fig 9d infiltration increased with increasing rainfall amount following a power function for the three land use types fig 9e relative infiltration first increased dramatically with increasing rainfall amount and then decreased gradually after the threshold values of 21 6 mm for the c dactylon slope and 14 2 mm for i amblyantha slope both of which followed an exponential function in the bare slope relative infiltration remained constant 100 with increasing rainfall amount up to a threshold of 6 0 mm after which it decreased exponentially fig 9f fig 10 a shows that interception loss increased with increasing rainfall intensity and then tended to be quasi constant for both the c dactylon and i amblyantha slopes the relative interception loss in both slopes first decreased with increasing rainfall intensity and then stabilized when rainfall intensity exceeded 21 38 mm h 1 c dactylon slope and 44 27 mm h 1 i amblyantha slope fig 10b significant positive relationships were observed between runoff and rainfall intensity in both the c dactylon and i amblyantha slopes p 0 01 fig 10c relative runoff first increased and then became quasi constant in the c dactylon slope following an exponential function whereas it showed a linear increase with rainfall intensity in the i amblyantha slope fig 10d based on the fitted curves of runoff and rainfall intensity the rainfall intensity threshold values for runoff generation were 6 63 24 67 and 35 34 mm h 1 for the bare c dactylon and i amblyantha slopes respectively relative runoff was lower in the c dactylon slope than in the i amblyantha slope when rainfall intensity was below 52 49 mm h 1 but this trend was reversed when the threshold was exceeded fig 10d the relationship between infiltration and rainfall intensity follows a quadratic function for the three land use types fig 10e relative infiltration had an increasing trend followed by a reduction with increasing rainfall intensity in the bare and i amblyantha slopes while it decreased in power function in the c dactylon slope fig 10f 3 3 effects of slope gradients on dynamic variation of interception loss infiltration runoff fig 11 depicts the variations in interception loss with rainfall intensity on the slopes with c dactylon and i amblyantha cover the interception loss in both slopes first increased and then tended to be constant as rainfall intensity increased along different slope gradients runoff intensity gradually increased and then became stable with increasing rainfall duration in the three land use types fig 12 in all slopes infiltration rate declined with increasing rainfall duration until reaching a minimum after which it leveled off fig 13 fig 14 a shows that the constant value of interception loss was negatively correlated with slope gradients in the i amblyantha slope p 0 05 while the relationships were not significant in the c dactylon slope p 0 23 the stable runoff intensity had a significant positive correlation with slope gradients in the three land use types p 0 05 fig 14b inversely the stable infiltration rate showed a significant negative correlation with slope gradients in the three land use types p 0 05 fig 14c the interception loss stable runoff intensity and stable infiltration rate of each land use type are quite different and differences in these indexes declined as slope gradient continuously increased moreover there were significant differences in morphological features between the two tested species p 0 05 table 2 3 4 effects of dynamic variation of interception loss infiltration runoff on slope stability the entire soil water characteristic curves and the hydraulic parameters of the three land use types were obtained using the van genuchten 1980 model fig 15 and the physical parameters of the tested soil are listed in table 3 with a rainfall intensity of 30 mm h 1 and a slope gradient of 30 we computed the infiltration process and safety factor by the mentioned model the theoretical infiltration process in the three land use types is presented in fig 16 a the computed safety factor at the wetting front in all slopes decreased nonlinearly with increasing rainfall duration and then tended to stabilize fig 16b based on the calculated safety factor at the wetting front the critical times of slope instability follow the order of bare slope 46 2 min i amblyantha slope 34 8 min c dactylon slope 30 5 min the depth of the wetting front increased nonlinearly with infiltration duration and a negative relationship was found between the wetting front depth and slope gradients fig 17 a fig 17b shows that infinite slope instability did not appear at slope gradients of 10 and 20 in addition we also analyzed the stability states of the infinite slope with the variation of rainfall intensity fig 18 the depth of the wetting front and rainfall intensity presented a complex relationship and slope stability exhibited a declining trend followed by an increment with increasing rainfall intensity in addition a rainfall intensity of 15 mm h 1 would not induce slope instability in slopes covered by i amblyantha fig 18b the critical time of slope instability is negatively and exponentially correlated to rainfall intensity for the i amblyantha slope whereas they exhibit a quadratic function relationship for bare slope and the c dactylon slope fig 19 except for the cases of low intensity rainfall events water infiltration modified by plants can accelerate slope instability with potential reductions of the safety factor by 15 9 51 3 4 discussion 4 1 dynamic variation of interception loss infiltration runoff in relation to rainfall characteristics it is well known that rainfall characteristics can affect the dynamic processes of interception loss infiltration runoff in different land use types assouline and ben hur 2006 huang et al 2013 crockford and richardson 2015 jian et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 in the present study the experiment was conducted in the rainy season june 20 to october 20 of 2020 the cumulative rainfall amount 1107 68 mm accounting for 83 80 of the annual precipitation 1321 81 mm in 2020 based on the rainfall distribution rainfall events of high intensity large amount and long duration mainly occurred in august fig 6 the frequency of short duration light rainfall events is higher than that of long duration heavy rainfall events during the experimental period fig 7 as the three land use types experienced the same meteorological conditions during the experimental period differences in water distribution among the three land use types fig 8 were mainly attributed to the structural characteristics of plants and morphological features of slope surface c dactylon is a perennial herb with smooth rhizomes and stolons and has open canopy ng et al 2014 liang 2016 which would allow it to accept more rainfall thereby increasing the possibility of stemflow generation these characteristics are beneficial for increasing infiltration and reducing canopy interception loss in the ecosystem in contrast i amblyantha has one rough stem slender branches with numerous tilt directions and ovate small leaves with a high rainwater storage capacity liang 2016 implying higher canopy interception loss due to the dense canopy previous studies have also confirmed that antecedent moisture content plays an vital role in affecting soil infiltration runoff process in slopes and a low initial moisture content means a large infiltration potential huang et al 2013 cui et al 2019 del campo et al 2019 antecedent moisture content significantly affected the initial infiltration rate however no significant relationship was found between antecedent moisture content and stable infiltration rate cui et al 2019 in this study we analyzed the dynamic variations of interception loss infiltration runoff in three land use types with random antecedent moisture content for 122 natural rainfall events then regression analysis was conducted to determine the variation trends for interception loss surface runoff and water infiltration and drew general conclusions about the dynamic variations of interception loss infiltration runoff and rainfall characteristics slope gradients in different land use types the antecedent moisture content for individual rainfall event does not affect the results of this study thus antecedent moisture content is not discussed separately relative interception loss decreased exponentially with increasing rainfall amount and rainfall intensity for both the c dactylon and i amblyantha slopes this was consistent with some studies for maize zheng et al 2018 and trees owens et al 2006 in addition we collected the rainfall partitioning of the individual shrubs on the available literatures table 4 and there were significant differences in rainfall partitioning among different shrubs p 0 05 the rainfall partitioning of shrubs was studied in the literature was mainly located in arid and desert regions with sparse canopy where the cumulative rainfall amounts were significantly lower than that we observed in the present study the high relative interception loss of shrubs in the arid and desert areas was mostly attributed to the frequent light rainfall events and the high evaporation rate during rainfall although the individual density was low this confirmed the conclusion that the interception loss of plants was controlled by crown architectures rainfall properties and planting density owens et al 2006 crockford and richardson 2015 zhang et al 2015 zheng et al 2018 jian et al 2019 relative runoff of bare slope 74 83 was significantly higher than that of the c dactylon slope 42 98 and i amblyantha slope 45 37 p 0 05 and a significant difference was observed between the both slopes with vegetation cover p 0 05 fig 9d fig 9e revealed that below a threshold of rainfall amount rainfall on the bare slope entirely infiltrates the slope with a larger infiltration amount than that on the vegetated slopes which are affected by canopy interception the critical rainfall amount for runoff generation is low for the bare slope 5 6 mm intermediate for the i amblyantha slope 14 2 mm and the highest for the c dactylon slope 21 6 mm the stable infiltration proportion of the slopes with c dactylon 45 67 and i amblyantha 33 78 cover exceeded that of the bare slope 23 82 and a marked difference was observed between the two slopes covered by vegetation p 0 05 the phenomenon may be explained by the following factors 1 the kinetic energy of net rainfall reaching the ground is significantly reduced by canopy which is conducive to water infiltration in the vegetated slopes whitford et al 1997 foley and silburn 2002 2 the stolons of cynodon dactylon blocked the migration of soil particles and reduced the velocity of overland flow thus increasing water infiltration liang 2016 3 the slope surface is cloudy and damp because of the upright stems and flat closed leaves of i amblyantha leading to the formation of a thin biological crust which is not favorable for water infiltration romkens et al 1986 janeau et al 2003 table 4 also showed the canopy saturated rainfall amounts of the individual shrubs the canopy saturated rainfall amount in the present study is larger than that in the literature due to the plants were cultivated in the slope slots with a seeding density of 10 g m 2 compared with low rainfall intensity high intensity rainfall can effectively saturate plant canopy and the kinetic energy of the raindrops directly impact plant canopy which is conducive to net rainfall this has also been corroborated by owens et al 2006 and zhang et al 2015 that high intensity short duration rainfall events yield a higher net precipitation input into the soil in the ecosystem the proportions of runoff and infiltration exhibited complex trends with increasing rainfall intensity in the three land use types fig 10 this could be explained by the difference in the process of runoff generation the ovate leaves of i amblyantha form a denser canopy than that by the linear leaves of c dactylon leading to differences in canopy structure between the corresponding slopes fig 3 mostof the rainfall is captured by the canopy when the i amblyantha slope is subjected to light rainfall intensity and the intercepted rainwater is directly evaporated back to the atmosphere meanwhile the oblique twigs and ovate leaves lean around the stem under the effect of rainwater gravity and overlap to form a special drainage channel also causing part of the intercepted rainwater to flow directly to the outside of slope slot and not pass the slope surface in contrast with the relative open canopy system of c dactylon most of the rainfall is accepted by the canopy and then drops from the leaves under gravity which is expressed as released rainfall the released rainfall is entirely converted to infiltration due to the reduction in its kinetic energy when rainfall intensity exceeds the threshold values the canopies of both plants become saturated following which free rainfall not flowing through leaves becomes the dominant form of precipitation for c dactylon and released rainfall for i amblyantha the relative runoff for c dactylon sharply increased with increasing rainfall intensity whereas i amblyantha exhibited a trend of linear increase the reasons for the trends of relative infiltration with rainfall intensity largely mirrored those analyzed for relative runoff thus the explanation for relative infiltration is not presented separately 4 2 dynamic variation of interception infiltration runoff in relation to slope gradients the constant value of interception loss was significantly negatively correlated with slope gradients in the i amblyantha slope p 0 05 while the relationships were not significant in the c dactylon slope p 0 23 the observation could be explained by differences in aboveground biomass at each slope gradient table 2 c dactylon is a perennial herb with smooth rhizomes and stolons and micro barriers develop at the junction of plant roots and stems to prevent soil particles from migrating which leads to the deposition of soil particles at the junctions the deposited soil particles act as micro filter dams and block overland flow decrease runoff velocity and increase water retention on the slope surface facilitating relatively uniform plant growth at the top and bottom of each slope slot i amblyantha has only one rough stem due to which its interception effect on overland flow is weak this can be confirmed by the lower relative infiltration observed for incident rainfall fig 9f abundant water is required for shrub growth as i amblyantha does not retard overland flow water flows to the bottom of slope resulting in significantly better growth of plants at the bottom of slope than at the top of steep slopes therefore the aboveground biomass of the shrub showed significant differences with increasing slope gradient field data showed that the cumulative volume of infiltrated water in the three land use types increased at a decreasing rate with increasing rainfall duration after continuous rainfall for 70 min the volume of infiltrated water in the three land use types appeared to increase linearly over time the infiltration rate was determined by fitting ordinary least square regression to the calculated variation in the cumulative volume of water infiltrated over time fox et al 1997 huang et al 2013 cui et al 2019 similarly the measured runoff amount per unit time increased at a decreasing rate as rainfall duration increased and then tended to be quasi constant when the measured runoff amount per unit time remains constant with increasing rainfall duration the value is the stable runoff intensity liang 2016 the stable infiltration rates of the three land use types decreased gradually with increasing slope gradient whereas the stable runoff intensity exhibited an opposite pattern fig 14 in addition the influence of the structural characteristics of plant species on these indexes also decreased as slope gradient increased these results are consistent with those of previous studies huang et al 2013 liang 2016 as previously mentioned the differences in water distribution among the three land use types may be attributable to most of the precipitation being lost as runoff in the bare slope while the presence of plants reduced surface runoff by increasing interception loss and enhancing soil permeability the bare slope does not include any measures of interception and short term storage which increased the probability of rainwater being converted into runoff and thus the infiltration amount declined for the slopes covered by vegetation plant roots could alter the soil structure and increase capillary pore channels for water infiltration which enhanced the process of water infiltration murielle et al 2011 huang et al 2013 del campo et al 2019 in addition the stolons of c dactylon also increased slope roughness which are not conducive to the formation and development of surface runoff liang 2016 thus promoting infiltration compared to the c dactylon slope the overlapped and interlocked leaves of i amblyantha intercepted more precipitation and the upright stems had a weaker blocking effect on overland flow resulting in a lower relative infiltration on the i amblyantha slope the complicated infiltration runoff process with slope gradients may be explained by changes in the stress state of raindrops reaching the slope surface the distance of overland flows and the area of slope slot subjected to net rainfall fox et al 1997 huang et al 2013 chaplot and bissonnais 2015 in this study the length and width of each slope slot were constant therefore the relationship between the actual area of slope subjected to net rainfall and slope gradient followed the cosine function the projected area of the slope on the horizontal plane decreased with increasing slope gradient which reduced the amount of net rainfall reaching the slope surface further resulting in the decline of overland flow in a unit time chaplot and bissonnais 2015 in addition the increase in slope gradient increased the component force of the weight of water along the slope direction which significantly accelerated the velocity of overland flow fox et al 1997 janeau et al 2003 poesen 2010 the increase in flow velocity reduced the standing time of surface water infiltrating deep soil along a certain slope length thus increasing runoff intensity therefore as the slope gradient increased its influence on the characteristics of runoff and infiltration also became stronger clearly there may be a critical slope gradient for balancing the effect of increasing runoff velocity with the decrease in slope area subjected to rainfall slight physical and biological crusting was also observed on the bare slope and the i amblyantha slope but not on the c dactylon slope previous studies have confirmed that soil physical and biological crusting can significantly inhibit rainwater infiltration and increase runoff generation in the slopes constituted with clay xiao and hu 2017 xiao and bowker 2020 gabriel et al 2021 and the degree of soil physical crusting gradually decreases with increasing slope gradient due to the reduction in raindrop density per unit of surface area janeau et al 2003 assouline and ben hur 2006 poesen 2010 in the present study three slope gradients were set with the largest slope at 30 on the bare slope physical crusting showed no significant difference among the three slope gradients p 0 33 on the i amblyantha slope slight biological crusting formed due to the upright stems and flat closed leaves of i amblyantha but there was no significant relationship between the degree of biological crusting and slope gradients therefore the effect of differences in soil crusting on the infiltration runoff process is negligible for individual land use types 4 3 dynamic variation of interception loss infiltration runoff in relation to slope stability in the present study soil moisture content was monitored at only three depths in each slope slot and the maximum depth of the monitored sites was 0 3 m fig 1 to evaluate the influence of variation in interception loss infiltration runoff on slope stability as mentioned in section 2 5 an infinite slope model was selected as an example to analyze the water infiltration process the calculated infiltration amounts on the three land use types under different rainfall conditions fig 9e fig 10e and slope gradients fig 13 were substituted into eqs 6 and 9 to obtain the theoretical process of water infiltration at the infinite slope which was then applied in the analysis of the safety factor at the wetting front considering a rainfall intensity of 30 mm h 1 and a slope gradient of 30 we monitored the movement of wetting front at the slope slots and computed the theoretical infiltration process at the infinite slope fig 16 when the monitored depth was 0 3 m the wetting front appeared at 25 73 10 81 and 13 74 min on the bare c dactylon and i amblyantha slopes respectively the corresponding times computed by the model were 26 62 12 60 and 14 98 min the maximum deviation of the wetting front at 0 3 m depth was 1 79 min 16 56 on the c dactylon slope in the present study the slope slot was filled with homogeneous soil and the effect of plant roots on the hydraulic characteristics of the tested soil was considered in the calculation of slope stability fig 15 the modeling results were basically consistent with the monitored results which proved that the adopted model can be used to accurately and reliably evaluate slope stability based on rainfall infiltration ulteriorly the computed safety factor at the wetting front ranked in order of higher to lower were bare slope i amblyantha slope and c dactylon slope the result is consistent with the water distribution modified by c dactylon and i amblyantha in other words incident rainfall generates a higher amount of runoff in bare slope than in the c dactylon and i amblyantha slopes in contrast slopes with vegetation cover facilitate higher infiltration with the c dactylon slope exhibiting the maximum value whereas the bare slope exhibited the minimum value fig 9 in addition to soil properties the water infiltration process on the slope is also affected by slope gradient and rainfall intensity which are presented in eq 14 and figs 10 14 the wetting front depth decreased with increasing slope gradient fig 17a this was also confirmed by assouline and ben hur 2006 and huang et al 2013 the failure of infinite slope did not appear at slope gradients of 10 and 20 fig 17b thus it may be concluded that slope gradient plays a dominant role in slope stability although the hydrological effects of plants can significantly affect the water infiltration process moreover the influence of water distribution on slope stability weakens with increasing slope gradient based on fitted equations of infiltration amount and rainfall intensity fig 10 variations in the stability states of the infinite slope with rainfall intensity were analyzed slope stability first decreased then increased with increasing rainfall intensity this was consistent with huang et al 2013 who found that the water storage across the soil profile initially increased and then decreased as rainfall intensity increased rainfall events with low rainfall intensity would not induce slope instability in slopes covered by i amblyantha fig 19 owing to the strong interception ability of the canopy except for the cases of low intensity rainfall events water distribution modified by plants can increase the potential of slope instability the potential of extreme weather events is increasing in the eastern margin of the tibetan plateau kuang and jiao 2016 it is clear that vegetation plays a beneficial role in controlling soil and water loss ng et al 2014 leung et al 2015 liang 2016 das et al 2021 from the perspective of disaster prevention i amblyantha shows better performance in water distribution than c dactylon which can increase interception loss resulting in a decrease in net precipitation i amblyantha could prevent significantly more rainwater from infiltrating to the deep soil which is crucial in the prevention of slope failure associated with rainfall events of long duration and low intensity this may have profound implications in the application of our tested species the findings could verify the excellent interception capacity of i amblyantha could be recognized as an important element of mountain hydrology and offer valuable information for the decision makers concerned with planting i amblyantha in soil water conservation geological disaster prevention and ecological environment construction in the subtropical region the methodology adopted in the present study could reasonably realize the evaluation of slope stability based on the dynamic variation of interception loss infiltration runoff under different rainfall events however there are some limitations to the broader applicability of the experimental results 1 considering the special canopy structure and root morphology of c dactylon and i amblyantha and the special meteorological conditions in the eastern margin of the tibetan plateau the variations in water distribution in this study may significantly differ from those associated with other ecosystems or regions 2 the observed water distribution in the three land use types on the slope slots filled with homogeneous soil and the computational results are not applicable to natural slopes with undulating terrain uncertain slip surfaces and multiple strata 3 canopy interception loss was calculated based on the principle of water balance and water evapotranspiration during rainfall was not considered because it is negligible in the incident rainfall amount in this region 4 the present study adopted the concept of soil moisture stratification to analytically estimate slope stability based on the modified amounts of water infiltration for incident rainfall and the mechanical aspect of plant roots affecting slope stability was not considered 5 conclusions the three land use types were subjected to identical initial soil density and meteorological conditions with only the vegetation cover modified field date shows that rainfall characteristics slope gradients and morphological features of plant species obviously affect variations in interception loss water infiltration surface runoff the modeling results present that modified processes of infiltration runoff by plants accelerate slope instability and indigofera amblyantha shows better performance in the prevention of slope failure moreover the hydrological effect of plants on slope stability weakens with increasing grade overall the present study is the first attempt to consider the interception effect of plant canopy in the evaluation of slope stability for incident rainfall although some simplifications and assumptions were applied in the derivation of the calculation model the findings further enrich our understanding of the hydrological mechanism of vegetation in slope stability credit authorship contribution statement

complex runoff drainage system tehran s flood management system has been divided into four catchments each having an independent drainage network the edc has an area of 220 square kilometers and covers the eastern northeastern and some central parts of tehran city as edc has a low time of concentration 115 min it needs a rainfall nowcasting system for real time flood control mahab ghodss consulting engineering company 2011 the average annual rainfall in the region is about 500 mm the considerable variations in the elevation and rainfall values in the catchment make it an appropriate study area for evaluating the performance of different deep learning nwp and ensemble models for rainfall nowcasting fig 1 shows the location of the niavaran rain gauge in the study area the ground based data i e the reference dataset have been recorded at the niavaran rain gauge station with five minute time steps the iran water resource management company recorded the rainfall data with an accuracy of 0 01 mm the forecasts of ecmwf ncep and ukmo centers with 6 hour temporal and 50 km spatial resolution were selected as nwps temporal downscaling of this 6 hour data to 5 minute sequences is performed based on the temporal distribution of the reference data the main characteristics of these centers are presented in table 1 the kriging method is implemented to interpolate the nwps in the study area 2 2 methodology fig 2 presents a flowchart of the proposed methodology for adaptive i e updated every 5 min rainfall intensity nowcasting using ensemble modeling in the first step observed rainfall time series along with the nwp datasets are acquired in the second step the observed data are pre processed by removing the dry data and normalizing to minimize sequencing depth difference next the outputs of dnns and corrected nwp models are fused using three ensemble techniques in the evaluation phase the performance of the models is assessed using three indices in the end the best nowcasting model is selected to be implemented in the study area the 5 minute adaptive nowcasting is based on gauge observations updated every 5 min and six hour nwp data different components of the flowchart are described in the following sections 2 3 deep learning models in this paper deep learning models are used for rainfall nowcasting utilizing time series of observed rainfall data dnns are usually accompanied by many parameters including the mini batch size the number of hidden units per layer the learning rate etc dnns select and train samples in each mini batches the mini batch size value depends on the computing unit s memory cpu gpu and its value is usually set to be a power of 2 bengio 2012 if the mini batch size is b for each training iteration b samples are randomly selected and trained without replacement until all samples are used 2 3 1 stacked long short term memory stacked lstm in many studies lstm as a special type of recurrent neural networks rnns has indicated acceptable performance due to its ability to learn long term dependencies in time series forecasting hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 shi et al 2015 the amount of incoming information is systematically determined at every time step using gate control mechanisms relu rectified linear unit and its variants such as leaky relu are among the most commonly used activation functions in deep learning the usefulness of this activation function is rooted in fixed derivatives in positive values which allows training to continue despite extreme input values kim and han 2020 furthermore the adam optimizer is used in the backpropagation algorithm to update weights based on the training set iteratively in this paper lstm based rnns are applied to mitigate vanishing gradient and overcome capacity insufficiency of memory stacked lstm is comprised of multiple hidden lstm layers which are stacked together according to fig 3 the lstm has an input layer consisting of a vector with dimensions of 15 1 lag time two lstm layers with 10 hidden units and a dense layer more details about the stacked lstm can be found in kumar 2020 2 3 2 cnn the convolutional neural network includes one convolutional layer followed by a pooling flattening and a block of dense layers the convolution layer is used for interpreting sequences which requires kernel size and several filters to be specified filter size determines the interpretations number of the input sequence which represents a spatial area over the input features furthermore kernel size regulates the time steps number involved in each interpretation of the input sequence finally max pooling is utilized to obtain the maximum values of each filter and effectively downsample the data the max pooling layer is followed by a flattening layer transforming these sequences to a single vector as a single time step output the cnn model shown in fig 4 contains an input layer that consists of a vector with dimensions of 15 1 lag time a one dimensional convolution layer with 64 filters a max pooling layer with a size of 2 a flattening layer and a dense layer more details about the cnns can be found in zhao et al 2017a 2 3 3 bidirectional lstm bi lstm this model has a lstm based architecture that could learn from both forward and backward input time series and concatenate both interpretations in some sequence forecasts problems schuster and paliwal 1997 in fig 5 the bi lstm model has an input layer containing a vector of dimensions 10 1 lag time a bidirectional lstm layer with 20 hidden units an lstm layer with 10 hidden units and a dense layer the corresponding equation can be found in zhao et al 2017a 2 3 4 cnn lstm cnn lstm is a hybrid model comprised of cnn and backend lstm models the cnn model is composed of a convolutional layer and a max pooling layer the max pooling layer is followed by a flattening layer which transforms these sequences into a single vector to be utilized as a single input to the lstm layer the cnn model effectively extracts and learns the features of univariate time series such as rainfall time series this paper uses the historical rainfall data with a few minutes time steps as input data in the convolution neural network initially the input sequence is divided into subsequences that can be processed by the cnn model then the cnn model interprets each subsequence of the rainfall input dataset which are used as the input of the lstm model then the lstm model interprets the input sequence and forecasts the one step ahead rainfall according to fig 6 the cnn lstm model has an input layer containing a vector with dimensions of 6 1 lag time a one dimensional convolutional layer with a filter size 64 a flattening layer an lstm layer with 10 hidden units and a dense layer 2 3 5 convlstm this type of lstm model has been developed for reading two dimensional input data but could be modified for univariate rainfall sequence forecasting comparatively these networks have several advantages over lstms which unfold input data into a 1d vector prior to processing which results in the loss of spatial information for temporal sequence forecasting problems convlstm models utilize an encoding forecasting structure consisting of two encoding and forecasting components as part of the encoding component the previous output of the cell and input in the hidden states lstm s memory unit are compressed and copied to the forecasting component in order to predict the next step of rainfall both of which are formed using convlstm the encoding part in fig 7 is hidden within the internal structure of the convlstm unit while the forecasting part is the arrow extracted from the convlstm2d box more information about encoding and forecasting components can be found in kelotra and pandey 2020 convlstm consists of an input layer a convolutional layer a dropout layer a flattening layer and a dense output layer the convolutional lstm model includes an input layer with dimensions of 3 1 4 n subsequences 3 and lag time 12 a two dimensional convolutional layer with 128 filters a 20 dropout layer a flattening layer and a dense layer fig 7 2 3 6 cnn bi lstm cnn bi lstm combines cnn and bi lstm layers and is built with an input layer a one dimensional time distributed convolutional layer a flattening layer two bi lstm hidden layers a dropout layer and a dense layer that predicts rainfall depth in the next step more information about this model is presented in section 3 1 the appendix provides more details about the mentioned deep learning models the data splitting approach of standard anns differs from rnns in terms of how time ordered datasets are entered into the network the input data are typically presented randomly to train standard anns however in time dependent networks the data is presented in occurrence order to maintain the time dependency structure standard practice to test time dependent networks is out of sample prediction true out of sample prediction is extrapolation beyond the reference dataset razavi 2021 the historical rainfall dataset is divided into three sections in this study training cross validation and test datasets the first 70 of the total data is considered the training dataset the following 20 and 10 of the total data are respectively considered as the cross validation and test datasets the latter dataset is utilized to evaluate the model performance in the out of sample prediction process the generalizability of the model is evaluated through out of sample prediction on the testing dataset 2 4 numerical weather prediction nwp nwps utilize mathematical models of the atmosphere and oceans for predicting the weather based on current weather conditions nwps produce a set of forecasts instead of a single weather forecast this set of forecasts indicates the possible range of future atmospheric states sene 2010 today numerical weather predictions are commonly made at most of the major operational weather prediction facilities worldwide such as ecmwf ncep and ukmo centers table 1 nwps usually have systematic errors biases quantile mapping qm is a well known concept that corrects systematic biases in multiple quantiles of the distribution of a prediction in this regard bias correction in simulated data is accomplished by mapping quantiles at the same cumulative probability from the observed and simulated datasets let p predicted and bc predcited denote raw and bias corrected predictions and cdf predicted and cdf o denote the cumulative distribution function cdf of raw predictions and observations pastén zapata et al 2020 zhao et al 2017b bias corrected qm is formulated as follows 1 b c p r e d i c t e d c d f o 1 c d f p r e d i c t e d p p r e d i c t e d this paper implements qm based bias correction using the qmap package in the r programming language 2 5 ensemble models in ensemble modeling multiple diverse individual models based on different algorithms are created to predict an outcome then ensemble model aggregates the results in prediction models with specific weights the ensemble models can reduce the generalization error of the prediction nourani et al 2020 bagging and boosting are the two most popular ensemble methods bagging is the parallel training of individual models each model is trained using bootstrap sampling boosting is sequential training of individual models which learn from errors made by the prior model in this paper the following ensemble models are used 2 5 1 bagging bagging bootstrap aggregation was proposed by breiman 1996 to improve unstable estimations in regression problems bagging combines the predictions of many base models such as decision trees each model is trained using a random subsample of the original dataset rainfall datasets with bootstrapping or replacement in other words in bagging each tree is formed based on a different bootstrap sample from the training dataset bootstrap is uniformly sampled from the training dataset with replacement replacement allows a sample to be selected again and maybe several times for example as it could be seen from the first bootstrap in fig 8 the 8th component of the original dataset is repeated three times but the 4th and seventh components are not inside the first bootstrap at all in the bagging algorithm shown in fig 9 the final predictions are made by averaging the predictions of the base estimators 2 5 2 random forest random forest is an ensemble model similar to the bagging technique unlike bagging decision trees construction in random forest includes selecting a subset of input features at each split point random forest is an extension of bootstrap aggregation bagging of decision trees and can be used for prediction problems in this method bootstrap is made and enters the corresponding decision tree and the final outputs are produced based on a regression or classification method more details about this method can be found in breiman 2001 and biau and scornet 2016 2 5 3 adaboost boosting is a type of ensemble machine learning algorithm that combines the predictions of some weak learners in the adaboost algorithm stumps a decision tree with one node and two leaves are considered as weak learners and sequentially added to the ensemble in order to correct the predictions made by the previous model it is obtained by allocating higher weights to training data that miscategorized in previous models the main feature of this method is that it prevents over fitting even though it learns from many classes the outputs of dnns are merged with corrected nwps and used as the inputs for ensemble models the ensemble models have several parameters to consider including n estimator max samples n splits and n repeats the definitions of the aforementioned parameters are as follows the number of estimators n estimators represents the number of trees in the forest for the random forest the number of base estimators for bagging and the maximum number of estimators at which boosting is terminated for the adaboost technique the max samples in the bagging technique are the proportion of samples to be taken from the training set to train each base estimator using bootstrap sampling the evaluation of ensemble models reported mean absolute error mae of k fold cross validation with n repeats and n split folds this study took advantage of the bagging random forest and adaboost algorithms using bagging regressor random forest regressor and adaboost regressor in the python package scikit learn the readers are referred to gupta 2015 and xu et al 2020 for further details 2 6 evaluation technique three common criteria namely rmse coefficient of determination r 2 and kling gupta efficiency kge are used for the performance evaluation of the models table 2 3 results and discussion in this section at first the results of each univariate adaptive deep learning model are evaluated and analyzed then the top three dnns are combined with corrected nwp models using the selected ensemble techniques five realizations are used to generate the results presented in figures and tables for dnns and ensemble models the efficiency of prediction models is assessed based on five different rainfall events with various intensities and durations 3 1 training deep learning models all dnns were trained using a python package called keras on the top of the tensorflow backend for running the models we used a computer with geforce gtx 1650 ti gpu and intel r core tm i7 10750h cpu parameter searching prior to model learning is essential for finding the best parameter the values of parameters such as mini batch size number of hidden units filter size learning rate and dropout rate were determined through a sensitivity analysis by changing one parameter at a time in this section the sensitivity analysis results of the cnn bi lstm model s parameters are presented the corresponding results of other models are presented in the appendix for convenience the superior results i e results with higher r 2 and kge and lower rmse are shown using bold characters as demonstrated in fig 10 the cnn bi lstm model is constructed using an input layer a 4 1 input vector including observed rainfall intensity in past 4 lag times a one dimensional time distributed convolutional layer 16 filters a flattening layer two bi lstm hidden layers 20 hidden units a dropout layer 20 dropout rate and a dense layer in the first step the results are generated considering constant values for mini batch size number of hidden units per layer filter size and kernel size as 1024 20 64 and 2 respectively also the parameters lag time time delay and n subsequences subsequence data vary over time as illustrated in table 3 these constant values are selected since they have been recognized as optimal values in individual models next the best results i e n subsequences 4 and lag time 16 are used in the sensitivity analysis of other variables based on the results the observation of the last 16 time steps with n subsequence 4 is utilized in the rest of the analysis the number of extreme events differed between the training validation and test data sets so the rmse of the test data is significantly smaller than that of the training and validation data according to table 3 rmse was not significantly dependent on the lag time as the forecast lead time is very short according to the obtained results table 4 the best value for the mini batch size number of hidden units and filter size are 4096 20 and 16 respectively the optimal values of cnn bi lstm model parameters for five minute rainfall prediction considering the trial and error technique are presented as follows the number of bidirectional hidden layers used for implementing the cnn bi lstm model is 2 with 20 neurons in each hidden layer the optimum value of lag time n subsequences and mini batch size are 16 4 and 4096 respectively the initial learning rate of the adam optimizer is 0 001 and no momentum is set as default the learning rate is expected to decay during the training period the loss and activation functions of the model are the mean squared error and relu respectively the model run time is very important in practical applications such as real time urban flood management regarding the run time of the model the following items are essential increasing the mini batch size efficiently reduces the run time increasing the value of lag time leads to an increase in the run time increasing the number of hidden units per layer increases the run time the learning rate is one of the most critical parameters which determines the rate of weight adjustment based on the loss function gradient there should not be extreme changes in the loss function versus epoch graph to achieve a suitable learning rate fig 11 displays the variations of the training and cross validation losses versus epoch in the cnn bi lstm model for the aforementioned learning rate it can be seen that the loss value smoothly decreases and converges to a global minimum additionally the difference between the losses of the training and cross validation processes is very low indicating that the model prevents overfitting fig 11 illustrates the stability of the proposed model also it can be found that the global minimum value of the loss function is 0 035 according to table 5 the accuracies of all deep learning based rainfall nowcasting models are close together and can be applied to real time rainfall nowcasting in edc 3 2 adaptive prediction of rainfall events in this section five rainfall events are selected to evaluate the forecasting abilities of the top three dnns the features of selected rainfall events are displayed in table 6 these events could illustrate different meteorological characteristics of rainfall the observed and forecasted rainfall hyetographs are shown in fig 12 38 years of previous data were used for training and cross validating the dnns as it can be seen in fig 12 the predicted rainfall hyetographs almost match the observed ones except for peaks in some events the time series of top three models and the statistical metrics of all models are shown for each event in fig 12 as shown in fig 12 stacked lstm is among the top forecasting models in most rainfall events this model does not perform well compared to other models in event d which has a high standard deviation this model has a good performance in predicting peak values cnn model performs better in predicting events with low rainfall duration but its efficiency in predicting peak points is not satisfactory therefore it is not recommended to use this model for nowcasting extreme events the bidirectional lstm model has a good performance in predicting all events with high and low duration the weakness of this model compared to other models is the high run time cnn lstm models perform poorly in predicting events with noisy structures fig 12b e convlstm model is weak in predicting rainfall peaks with low duration however this model has the best performance in predicting events with high duration due to the timely detection of peak points in events finally the cnn bi lstm model performs best in events with low duration and significant changes during rainfall fig 12a this model is ineffective in predicting peak rainfall but its strength is its rapid adaptation to new trends in low duration rainfall events 3 3 nwp and ensemble prediction of rainfall events the predictions of the three selected numerical weather prediction models i e ecmwf ncep and ukmo were extracted for the 5 events with a time step of 6 h as explained in section 2 quantile mapping is utilized for correcting systematic biases corrected nwp models and dnns are fused using ensemble techniques the k fold cross validation method was used to evaluate the ensemble models for each event the standard deviation measures the deviation of rainfall data from the mean value the optimal values of the parameters of the ensemble models are presented in table 7 finally the ensemble models i e bagging random forest adaboost methods are compared with other rainfall nowcasting models in table 8 overall random forest and bagging ensemble models generally produce better results compared to dnns when at least one of the nwps performs well the ensemble models perform well in events a and e while the nwp models have considerable errors it shows that ensemble modeling can improve the accuracy of rainfall forecasts when nwps perform poorly this is due to the formation of weak trees by nwp models which strengthens the overall performance of ensemble models all models perform well in events b and c especially ecmwf and ukmo which outperform ensemble models however the smoothing effect arising from the aggregation of the outputs of individual models in ensemble models reduces the uncertainty of forecasts at all events the mean kge score of the top six models i e dnn nwp and the ensemble models is 0 6 the mean scores of the correlation variability and bias terms of the kge which are expressed as r 1 γ 1 and β 1 are 0 259 0 273 and 0 029 respectively as a result the top six models for all events do not perform well in terms of variability this result can be seen in fig 13 where the variabilities are further away from the optimum value the red line the variability values show the dominant influence on the kge scores these results suggest that variability is the most crucial component in enhancing the kge score based on these results improvements in the distribution of rainfall intensity sequence affecting variability are more valuable than enhancing the timing of predicted rainfall event affecting correlation and total rainfall depth affecting bias score the corresponding bias variability correlation coefficient and kge score of the top 6 models for each event are presented in the appendix according to the results the coefficients of determination of the bagging and random forest ensemble models are at least 10 better than those of dnn models in events 1 3 and 5 the best ensemble techniques for rainfall nowcasting were random forest and bagging the run time of all models is much less than the concentration time of the basin therefore the proposed rainfall nowcasting models can be very useful for real time flood management in the study area 4 conclusion the scope of this study was to use ensemble forecasting techniques i e bagging random forest and adaboost techniques for adaptive rainfall nowcasting these ensemble nowcasts were derived using the outputs of three physically based numerical weather prediction models and six data driven deep learning models in order to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed forecasting methodology it was applied to the edc in tehran city to this aim dnns with higher efficiency were selected to operate in conjunction with nwp models then the performances of dnns nwps and ensemble models were compared using some statistical indices the results illustrated that the proposed ensemble models could improve the accuracy of adaptive rainfall nowcasts at least 10 compared to dnn models in most events the best ensemble technique for adaptive rainfall nowcasting were random forest and bagging a multivariate

complex runoff drainage system tehran s flood management system has been divided into four catchments each having an independent drainage network the edc has an area of 220 square kilometers and covers the eastern northeastern and some central parts of tehran city as edc has a low time of concentration 115 min it needs a rainfall nowcasting system for real time flood control mahab ghodss consulting engineering company 2011 the average annual rainfall in the region is about 500 mm the considerable variations in the elevation and rainfall values in the catchment make it an appropriate study area for evaluating the performance of different deep learning nwp and ensemble models for rainfall nowcasting fig 1 shows the location of the niavaran rain gauge in the study area the ground based data i e the reference dataset have been recorded at the niavaran rain gauge station with five minute time steps the iran water resource management company recorded the rainfall data with an accuracy of 0 01 mm the forecasts of ecmwf ncep and ukmo centers with 6 hour temporal and 50 km spatial resolution were selected as nwps temporal downscaling of this 6 hour data to 5 minute sequences is performed based on the temporal distribution of the reference data the main characteristics of these centers are presented in table 1 the kriging method is implemented to interpolate the nwps in the study area 2 2 methodology fig 2 presents a flowchart of the proposed methodology for adaptive i e updated every 5 min rainfall intensity nowcasting using ensemble modeling in the first step observed rainfall time series along with the nwp datasets are acquired in the second step the observed data are pre processed by removing the dry data and normalizing to minimize sequencing depth

the best nowcasting model is selected to be implemented in the study area the 5 minute adaptive nowcasting is based on gauge observations updated every 5 min and six hour nwp data different components of the flowchart are described in the following sections 2 3 deep learning models in this paper deep learning models are used for rainfall nowcasting utilizing time series of observed rainfall data dnns are usually accompanied by many parameters including the mini batch size the number of hidden units per layer the learning rate etc dnns select and train samples in each mini batches the mini batch size value depends on the computing unit s memory cpu gpu and its value is usually set to be a power of 2 bengio 2012 if the mini batch size is b for each training iteration b samples are randomly selected and trained without replacement until all samples are used 2 3 1 stacked long short term memory stacked lstm in many studies lstm as a special type of recurrent neural networks rnns has indicated acceptable performance due to its ability to learn long term dependencies in time series forecasting hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 shi et al 2015 the amount of incoming information is systematically determined at every time step using gate control mechanisms relu rectified linear unit and its variants such as leaky relu are among the most commonly used activation functions in deep learning the usefulness of this activation function is rooted in fixed derivatives in positive values which allows training to continue despite extreme input values kim and han 2020 furthermore the adam optimizer is used in the backpropagation algorithm to update weights based on the training set iteratively in this paper lstm based rnns are applied to mitigate vanishing gradient and overcome capacity insufficiency of memory stacked lstm is comprised of multiple hidden lstm layers which are stacked together according to fig 3 the lstm has an input layer consisting of a vector with dimensions of 15 1 lag time two lstm layers with 10 hidden units and a dense layer more details about the stacked lstm can be found in kumar 2020 2 3 2 cnn the convolutional neural network includes one convolutional layer followed by a pooling flattening and a block of dense layers the convolution layer is used for interpreting sequences which requires kernel size and several filters to be specified filter size determines the interpretations number of the input sequence which represents a spatial area over the input features furthermore kernel size regulates the time steps number involved in each interpretation of the input sequence finally max pooling is utilized to obtain the maximum values of each filter and effectively downsample the data the max pooling layer is followed by a flattening layer transforming these sequences to a single vector as a single time step output the cnn model shown in fig 4 contains an input layer that consists of a vector with dimensions of 15 1 lag time a one dimensional convolution layer with 64 filters a max pooling layer with a size of 2 a flattening layer and a dense layer more details about the cnns can be found in zhao et al 2017a 2 3 3 bidirectional lstm bi lstm this model has a lstm based architecture that could learn from both forward and backward input time series and concatenate both interpretations in some sequence forecasts problems schuster and paliwal 1997 in fig 5 the bi lstm model has an input layer containing a vector of dimensions 10 1 lag time a bidirectional lstm layer with 20 hidden units an lstm layer with 10 hidden units and a dense layer the corresponding equation can be found in zhao et al 2017a 2 3 4 cnn lstm cnn lstm is a hybrid model comprised of cnn and backend lstm models the cnn model is composed of a convolutional layer and a max pooling layer the max pooling layer is followed by a flattening layer which transforms these sequences into a single vector to be utilized as a single input to the lstm layer the cnn model effectively extracts and learns the features of univariate time series such as rainfall time series this paper uses the historical rainfall data with a few minutes time steps as input data in the convolution neural network initially the input sequence is divided into subsequences that can be processed by the cnn model then the cnn model interprets each subsequence of the rainfall input dataset which are used as the input of the lstm model then the lstm model interprets the input sequence and forecasts the one step ahead rainfall according to fig 6 the cnn lstm model has an input layer containing a vector with dimensions of 6 1 lag time a one dimensional convolutional layer with a filter size 64 a flattening layer an lstm layer with 10 hidden units and a dense layer 2 3 5 convlstm this type of lstm model has been developed for reading two dimensional input data but could be modified for univariate rainfall sequence forecasting comparatively these networks have several advantages over lstms which unfold input data into a 1d vector prior to processing which results in the loss of spatial information for temporal sequence forecasting problems convlstm models utilize an encoding forecasting structure consisting of two encoding and forecasting components as part of the encoding component the previous output of the cell and input in the hidden states lstm s memory unit are compressed and copied to the forecasting component in order to predict the next step of rainfall both of which are formed using convlstm the encoding part in fig 7 is hidden within the internal structure of the convlstm unit while the forecasting part is the arrow extracted from the convlstm2d box more information about encoding and forecasting components can be found in kelotra and pandey 2020 convlstm consists of an input layer a convolutional layer a dropout layer a flattening layer and a dense output layer the convolutional lstm model includes an input layer with dimensions of 3 1 4 n subsequences 3 and lag time 12 a two dimensional convolutional layer with 128 filters a 20 dropout layer a flattening layer and a dense layer fig 7 2 3 6 cnn bi lstm cnn bi lstm combines cnn and bi lstm layers and is built with an input layer a one dimensional time distributed convolutional layer a flattening layer two bi lstm hidden layers a dropout layer and a dense layer that predicts rainfall depth in the next step more information about this model is presented in section 3 1 the appendix provides more details about the mentioned deep learning models the data splitting approach of standard anns differs from rnns in terms of how time ordered datasets are entered into the network the input data are typically presented randomly to train standard anns however in time dependent networks the data is presented in occurrence order to maintain the time dependency structure standard practice to test time dependent networks is out of sample prediction true out of sample prediction is extrapolation beyond the reference dataset razavi 2021 the historical rainfall dataset is divided into three sections in this study training cross validation and test datasets the first 70 of the total data is considered the training dataset the following 20 and 10 of the total data are respectively considered as the cross validation and test datasets the latter dataset is utilized to evaluate the model performance in the out of sample prediction process the generalizability of the model is evaluated through out of sample prediction on the testing dataset 2 4 numerical weather prediction nwp nwps utilize mathematical models of the atmosphere and oceans for predicting the weather based on current weather conditions nwps produce a set of forecasts instead of a single weather forecast this set of forecasts indicates the possible range of future atmospheric states sene 2010 today numerical weather predictions are commonly made at most of the major operational weather prediction facilities worldwide such as ecmwf ncep and ukmo centers table 1 nwps usually have systematic errors biases quantile mapping qm is a well known concept that corrects systematic biases in multiple quantiles of the distribution of a prediction in this regard bias correction in simulated data is accomplished by mapping quantiles at the same cumulative probability from the observed and simulated datasets let p predicted and bc predcited denote raw and bias corrected predictions and cdf predicted and cdf o denote the cumulative distribution function cdf of raw predictions and observations pastén zapata et al 2020 zhao et al 2017b bias corrected qm is formulated as follows 1 b c p r e d i c t e d c d f o 1 c d f p r e d i c t e d p p r e d i c t e d this paper implements qm based bias correction using the qmap package in the r programming language 2 5 ensemble models in ensemble modeling multiple diverse individual models based on different algorithms are created to predict an outcome then ensemble model aggregates the results in prediction models with specific weights the ensemble models can reduce the generalization error of the prediction nourani et al 2020 bagging and boosting are the two most popular ensemble methods bagging is the parallel training of individual models each model is trained using bootstrap sampling boosting is sequential training of individual models which learn from errors made by the prior model in this paper the following ensemble models are used 2 5 1 bagging bagging bootstrap aggregation was proposed by breiman 1996 to improve unstable estimations in regression problems bagging combines the predictions of many base models such as decision trees each model is trained using a random subsample of the original dataset rainfall datasets with bootstrapping or replacement in other words in bagging each tree is formed based on a different bootstrap sample from the training dataset bootstrap is uniformly sampled from the training dataset with replacement replacement allows a sample to be selected again and maybe several times for example as it could be seen from the first bootstrap in fig 8 the 8th component of the original dataset is repeated three times but the 4th and seventh components are not inside the first bootstrap at all in the bagging algorithm shown in fig 9 the final predictions are made by averaging the predictions of the base estimators 2 5 2 random forest random forest is an ensemble model similar to the bagging technique unlike bagging decision trees construction in random forest includes selecting a subset of input features at each split point random forest is an extension of bootstrap aggregation bagging of decision trees and can be used for prediction problems in this method bootstrap is made and enters the corresponding decision tree and the final outputs are produced based on a regression or classification method more details about this method can be found in breiman 2001 and biau and scornet 2016 2 5 3 adaboost boosting is a type of ensemble machine learning algorithm that combines the predictions of some weak learners in the adaboost algorithm stumps a decision tree with one node and two leaves are considered as weak learners and sequentially added to the ensemble in order to correct the predictions made by the previous model it is obtained by allocating higher weights to training data that miscategorized in previous models the main feature of this method is that it prevents over fitting even though it learns from many classes the outputs of dnns are merged with corrected nwps and used as the inputs for ensemble models the ensemble models have several parameters to consider including n estimator max samples n splits and n repeats the definitions of the aforementioned parameters are as follows the number of estimators n estimators represents the number of trees in the forest for the random forest the number of base estimators for bagging and the maximum number of estimators at which boosting is terminated for the adaboost technique the max samples in the bagging technique are the proportion of samples to be taken from the training set to train each base estimator using bootstrap sampling the evaluation of ensemble models reported mean absolute error mae of k fold cross validation with n repeats and n split folds this study took advantage of the bagging random forest and adaboost algorithms using bagging regressor random forest regressor and adaboost regressor in the python package scikit learn the readers are referred to gupta 2015 and xu et al 2020 for further details 2 6 evaluation technique three common criteria namely rmse coefficient of determination r 2 and kling gupta efficiency kge are used for the performance evaluation of the models table 2 3 results and discussion in this section at first the results of each univariate adaptive deep learning model are evaluated and analyzed then the top three dnns are combined with corrected nwp models using the selected ensemble techniques five realizations are used to generate the results presented in figures and tables for dnns and ensemble models the efficiency of prediction models is assessed based on five different rainfall events with various intensities and durations 3 1 training deep learning models all dnns were trained using a python package called keras on the top of the tensorflow backend for running the models we used a computer with geforce gtx 1650 ti gpu and intel r core tm i7 10750h cpu parameter searching prior to model learning is essential for finding the best parameter the values of parameters such as mini batch size number of hidden units filter size learning rate and dropout rate were determined through a sensitivity analysis by changing one parameter at a time in this section the sensitivity analysis results of the cnn bi lstm model s parameters are presented the corresponding results of other models are presented in the appendix for convenience the superior results i e results with higher r 2 and kge and lower rmse are shown using bold characters as demonstrated in fig 10 the cnn bi lstm model is constructed using an input layer a 4 1 input vector including observed rainfall intensity in past 4 lag times a one dimensional time distributed convolutional layer 16 filters a flattening layer two bi lstm hidden layers 20 hidden units a dropout layer 20 dropout rate and a dense layer in the first step the results are generated considering constant values for mini batch size number of hidden units per layer filter size and kernel size as 1024 20 64 and 2 respectively also the parameters lag time time delay and n subsequences subsequence data vary over time as illustrated in table 3 these constant values are selected since they have been recognized as optimal values in individual models next the best results i e n subsequences 4 and lag time 16 are used in the sensitivity analysis of other variables based on the results the observation of the last 16 time steps with n subsequence 4 is utilized in the rest of the analysis the number of extreme events differed between the training validation and test data sets so the rmse of the test data is significantly smaller than that of the training and validation data according to table 3 rmse was not significantly dependent on the lag time as the forecast lead time is very short according to the obtained results table 4 the best value for the mini batch size number of hidden units and filter size are 4096 20 and 16 respectively the optimal values of cnn bi lstm model parameters for five minute rainfall prediction considering the trial and error technique are presented as follows the number of bidirectional hidden layers used for implementing the cnn bi lstm model is 2 with 20 neurons in each hidden layer the optimum value of lag time n subsequences and mini batch size are 16 4 and 4096 respectively the initial learning rate of the adam optimizer is 0 001 and no momentum is set as default the learning rate is expected to decay during the training period the loss and activation functions of the model are the mean squared error and relu respectively the model run time is very important in practical applications such as real time urban flood management regarding the run time of the model the following items are essential increasing the mini batch size efficiently reduces the run time increasing the value of lag time leads to an increase in the run time increasing the number of hidden units per layer increases the run time the learning rate is one of the most critical parameters which determines the rate of weight adjustment based on the loss function gradient there should not be extreme changes in the loss function versus epoch graph to achieve a suitable learning rate fig 11 displays the variations of the training and cross validation losses versus epoch in the cnn bi lstm model for the aforementioned learning rate it can be seen that the loss value smoothly decreases and converges to a global minimum additionally the difference between the losses of the training and cross validation processes is very low indicating that the model prevents overfitting fig 11 illustrates the stability of the proposed model also it can be found that the global minimum value of the loss function is 0 035 according to table 5 the accuracies of all deep learning based rainfall nowcasting models are close together and can be applied to real time rainfall nowcasting in edc 3 2 adaptive prediction of rainfall events in this section five rainfall events are selected to evaluate the forecasting abilities of the top three dnns the features of selected rainfall events are displayed in table 6 these events could illustrate different meteorological characteristics of rainfall the observed and forecasted rainfall hyetographs are shown in fig 12 38 years of previous data were used for training and cross validating the dnns as it can be seen in fig 12 the predicted rainfall hyetographs almost match the observed ones except for peaks in some events the time series of top three models and the statistical metrics of all models are shown for each event in fig 12 as shown in fig 12 stacked lstm is among the top forecasting models in most rainfall events this model does not perform well compared to other models in event d which has a high standard deviation this model has a good performance in predicting peak values cnn model performs better in predicting events with low rainfall duration but its efficiency in predicting peak points is not satisfactory therefore it is not recommended to use this model for nowcasting extreme events the bidirectional lstm model has a good performance in predicting all events with high and low duration the weakness of this model compared to other models is the high run time cnn lstm models perform poorly in predicting events with noisy structures fig 12b e convlstm model is weak in predicting rainfall peaks with low duration however this model has the best performance in predicting events with high duration due to the timely detection of peak points in events finally the cnn bi lstm model performs best in events with low duration and significant changes during rainfall fig 12a this model is ineffective in predicting peak rainfall but its strength is its rapid adaptation to new trends in low duration rainfall events 3 3 nwp and ensemble prediction of rainfall events the predictions of the three selected numerical weather prediction models i e ecmwf ncep and ukmo were extracted for the 5 events with a time step of 6 h as explained in section 2 quantile mapping is utilized for correcting systematic biases corrected nwp models and dnns are fused using ensemble techniques the k fold cross validation method was used to evaluate the ensemble models for each event the standard deviation measures the deviation of rainfall data from the mean value the optimal values of the parameters of the ensemble models are presented in table 7 finally the ensemble models i e bagging random forest adaboost methods are compared with other rainfall nowcasting models in table 8 overall random forest and bagging ensemble models generally produce better results compared to dnns when at least one of the nwps performs well the ensemble models perform well in events a and e while the nwp models have considerable errors it shows that ensemble modeling can improve the accuracy of rainfall forecasts when nwps perform poorly this is due to the formation of weak trees by nwp models which strengthens the overall performance of ensemble models all models perform well in events b and c especially ecmwf and ukmo which outperform ensemble models however the smoothing effect arising from the aggregation of the outputs of individual models in ensemble models reduces the uncertainty of forecasts at all events the mean kge score of the top six models i e dnn nwp and the ensemble models is 0 6 the mean scores of the correlation variability and bias terms of the kge which are expressed as r 1 γ 1 and β 1 are 0 259 0 273 and 0 029 respectively as a result the top six models for all events do not perform well in terms of variability this result can be seen in fig 13 where the variabilities are further away from the optimum value the red line the variability values show the dominant influence on the kge scores these results suggest that variability is the most crucial component in enhancing the kge score based on these results improvements in the distribution of rainfall intensity sequence affecting variability are more valuable than enhancing the timing of predicted rainfall event affecting correlation and total rainfall depth affecting bias score the corresponding bias variability correlation coefficient and kge score of the top 6 models for each event are presented in the appendix according to the results the coefficients of determination of the bagging and random forest ensemble models are at least 10 better than those of dnn models in events 1 3 and 5 the best ensemble techniques for rainfall nowcasting were random forest and bagging the run time of all models is much less than the concentration time of the basin therefore the proposed rainfall nowcasting models can be very useful for real time flood management in the study area 4 conclusion the scope of this study was to use ensemble forecasting techniques i e bagging random forest and adaboost techniques for adaptive rainfall nowcasting these ensemble nowcasts were derived using the outputs of three physically based numerical weather prediction models and six data driven deep learning models in order to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed forecasting methodology it was applied to the edc in tehran city to this aim dnns with higher efficiency were selected to operate in conjunction with nwp models then the performances of dnns nwps and ensemble models were compared using some statistical indices the results illustrated that the proposed ensemble models could improve the accuracy of adaptive rainfall nowcasts at least 10 compared to dnn models in most events the best ensemble technique for adaptive rainfall nowcasting were random forest and bagging a multivariate version of the proposed methodology could be developed and evaluated in future works also the uncertainty of dnns and ensemble models and their parameters could be taken into account credit authorship

3114,as an important property of loess permeability has a significant impact on the durability and safety of engineering construction in loess areas to explore the response mechanism of permeability change of remolded loess to temperature hydraulic gradient and initial moisture content a series of permeability tests scanning electron microscopy tests and leaching tests were designed and conducted the results show that the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat increases with seepage time at 10 and 20 while it decreases at 30 which is mainly controlled by the comprehensive effect of temperature on the fluid viscosity bound water film and chemical leaching in addition the hydraulic gradient affects the permeability of soil by controlling the transformation of water type on the particle surface the fundamental determinant of the inconsistency in ksat with the hydraulic gradient under different dry densities is the microstructure of the soil furthermore the initial ksat decreases with the increase in the water content ksat decreases in the process of seepage when the water content is lower than the optimal amount attributed to the poor structural stability with the continuous increase in the water content the lubrication makes the particles to arrange more closely and form a relatively stable structure thus ksat increases with time these findings would help explain the permeability behavior of remolded loess and serve as a basis for engineering geological construction in loess areas keywords saturated permeability temperature hydraulic gradient initial moisture content remolded loess data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction loess is a quaternary deposit formed in arid and semi arid climate environments and has important engineering geological significance chen et al 2021a xu et al 2020a it is distributed worldwide such as in north america europe asia and south america accounting for approximately 10 of the global land area li et al 2019 luo et al 2018 peng et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 china has loess with the widest distribution the thickest deposition and the most complete strata forming the well known chinese loess plateau clp which covers an area of approximately 640 000 km2 over seven provinces derbyshire 2001 hou et al 2021 leng et al 2018 zhang et al 2020a loess has great potential for development and construction and its engineering application value cannot be underestimated xu et al 2021a b zhang et al 2021 however under the influence of extreme climate and increasing engineering activities leakage and impervious core failure have been frequent in earth dams dikes and reservoirs therefore understanding the flow behavior of water in soil is of great significance for engineering construction and geological disaster prevention cheng et al 2021 lee and ho 2009 permeability which is an important geotechnical property of soil is used to characterize the passage of fluid through soil chapuis 2012 lu et al 2021 xu et al 2021c the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat is an important parameter that can help describe the permeability of soil chen et al 2021b han et al 2020 mügler et al 2019 thus far researchers have extensively studied the saturated hydraulic conductivity of soil and the influence of various factors on this parameter including particle size hydraulic gradient microorganism moisture content temperature and fluid chemical properties chen et al 2021a gao et al 2018 hong et al 2016 song et al 2018 wang et al 2020 xu et al 2021b xu et al 2021d ye et al 2009 zhang et al 2021 historically the saturated hydraulic conductivity is considered a constant under given conditions chen et al 2020 sanchez vila et al 2006 existing research has shown that ksat of remolded loess varies with time under different conditions such as the soil dry density and solution ph xu et al 2021c d however under the following three influencing factors the variation of saturated hydraulic conductivity with time is only understood in a macroscopic sense and are not recognized in terms of mechanisms the first issue discussed is the effect of temperature on soil permeability the loess region in northwest china is a typical seasonally frozen soil region and the temperature has a significant impact on the engineering properties of loess for example the permeability of soil increases with the increase of temperature which has been widely concerned by domestic and international scholars abuel naga et al 2006 cho et al 1999 delage et al 2011 zhang et al 2021 ye et al 2013 increasing the temperature has been found to reduce the viscosity of water flow and thus enhance the permeability however the research of ye et al 2013 shows that the calculated value of ksat deviates greatly from the measured value only considering viscosity in addition another explanation is that the increase of temperature leads to the conversion of bound water into gravity water and the thickness of bound water film decreases in short although there are different opinions on the influence mechanism of temperature on soil permeability it lays a foundation for the research of remolded loess in this regard zhang et al 2021 found that ksat of remolded loess increases with the increase in temperature by designing a series of saturated permeability tests at various temperatures 0 40 the growth rate of ksat after 4 is significantly greater than that before 4 and reaches the maximum at 25 which is mainly due to the influence of high or low temperature on the soil structure the effect of temperature on the permeability of remolded loess is well explained while there is a lack of research on the variation in ksat with time and its mechanism the second topic closely related to soil permeability is the hydraulic gradient which is also focused by researchers in the field of engineering geology and hydrogeology al taie et al 2014 hansbo 2001 song et al 2018 wang et al 2020 wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2020b as the hydraulic gradient increases the infiltration force makes the fine particles transport along the direction of water flow changing the homogeneity of the original structure of the soil and resulting in irreversible changes in its permeability for instance wang et al 2021 studied the loss rate of fine particles in sandy soils under seepage and the critical starting slope of their migration movement zhang et al 2020b found that the critical hydraulic gradient of vertical seepage of chalk sand is higher than that of horizontal direction for low permeability soils particularly those rich in clay particles or clay minerals ksat also varies with the hydraulic gradient al taie et al 2014 wang et al 2020 studied the influence of hydraulic gradient on the permeability of remolded loess and found that with the increase in the hydraulic gradient ksat first increases and then gradually stabilizes under a dry density 1 30 g cm3 while showing a change trend of first increasing and then decreasing under a dry density of 1 20 g cm3 the hydraulic gradient affects the transport of particles and the thickness of the bound water film through infiltration force which in turn changes the permeability of the soil although considerable progress has been made in studies on the effect of increasing the hydraulic gradient the relationship between ksat of remolded loess and the decrease in the hydraulic gradient has not been established the third issue is the initial moisture content of the soil which also has a considerable impact on the permeability numerous scholars are keen on studying the relationship between initial moisture content and permeability of unsaturated soils and rich research results have been obtained haeri et al 2012 jiang et al 2017 lu et al 2019 yao et al 2021 at the same time the influence mechanism of initial water content on the gas permeability of soils has also been explored liu et al 2021 however there are few studies on the effect of initial water content on soil saturated permeability hong et al 2016 examined ksat of remolded loess differing in terms of the initial water content using tst 55 permeameters with an experimental cycle of only a few hours they found that ksat decreases with the increase in the initial water content and that the change trend with time is inconsistent the occurrence and state of cement were different because of the different initial water contents which affects the compaction effect of soil and consequently its microstructure however there is a lack of research on how the permeability of remodeled loess changes during a long term seepage hence it is worth exploring the response of the permeability of remolded loess to the initial water content in this regard in this study the authors analyzed the above three factors that significantly affect the permeability of remolded loess including the temperature hydraulic gradient and initial water content and combined with existing research results to provide a deeper understanding of the related issues of permeability change in remolded loess during the seepage process to meet the research objectives a series of saturated permeability tests under different conditions were designed and conducted on remolded loess samples the microstructure characteristics of the samples were characterized using scanning electron microscopy sem and the leaching effect was evaluated the three related factors affecting the permeability change of the remolded loess were thoroughly discussed based on the test results 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the sampling site is located in the south of the chinese loess plateau malan loess from the southern platform of jingyang shaanxi province was used as the material to explore several related issues of permeability change of remolded loess fig 1 the soil materials were sampled from a depth of 3 m below the ground surface after sampling the loess was sealed in bags and transported back to the laboratory dried naturally and crushed the wjl 602 laser particle size analyzer was used to test the particle size distribution as shown in fig 2 a the loess contained 13 21 clay 2 μm 86 63 silt 2 50 μm and 0 16 sand 50 2000 μm the uniformity coefficient and gradation coefficient of the loess particles were 9 70 and 1 58 respectively indicating a well graded soil its specific gravity was determined using the pycnometer method and the corresponding value was 2 71 the liquid and plastic limits of the loess were 34 5 and 20 1 respectively the compaction curve of malan loess was determined through indoor compaction test as shown in fig 2b the maximum dry density and optimum moisture content of the loess were 1 74 g cm 3 and 17 07 respectively 2 2 experimental scheme considering some of the problems related to the permeability change of remolded loess the experimental scheme designed in this study is as follows 1 influence of temperature on permeability the standard temperature defined in the standard for geotechnical testing method sgtm 2019 is 20 therefore taking 10 as the temperature interval the environmental temperature for the permeability test was set to 10 20 and 30 to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the temperature conditions the entire test was conducted in an shh c3000 constant temperature controller this type of instrument has a temperature range of 0 60 with a controlling accuracy of 0 1 xu et al 2021c when the hydraulic gradient is not 3 the velocity of remolded loess with a dry density of 1 20 1 80 g cm3 shows a good positive correlation with the hydraulic gradient i e it is consistent with the darcy seepage characteristics wang et al 2020 considering the damage of high hydraulic gradient to loess structure the hydraulic gradient was set as to 3 in this study the test period was seven days taking the remolded loess with a dry density of 1 45 g cm3 as an example the permeability change with time under different temperatures was studied in addition combined with the leaching characteristics and microstructure evolution at different temperatures the influence mechanism of temperature on the permeability of remolded loess would be revealed 2 influence of hydraulic gradient on permeability it has been shown that since loess is a low permeability soil the permeability of the soil is extremely unstable when the hydraulic gradient is 1 and the ksat hardly changes significantly with the hydraulic gradient 6 wang et al 2020 therefore to explore the change in the permeability of remolded loess under pressure increasing and pressure reducing conditions the saturated permeability tests with different hydraulic gradients were conducted with designed values of 1 1 5 2 3 4 6 4 3 2 1 5 and 1 by adjusting the head to achieve the desired hydraulic gradient and until it stabilizes the volume of the exudate was started to be recorded after continuously recording three sets of data the hydraulic gradient was adjusted to the next value and above process was repeated the ambient temperature of the permeability test was maintained at a standard temperature of 20 using the shh c3000 constant temperature controller the dry density of the samples was set to 1 35 1 45 and 1 55 g cm3 and the influence of hydraulic gradient on the permeability of the remolded loess was determined 3 influence of initial moisture content on permeability to investigate the variation trend in the permeability of remolded loess with time under different initial moisture contents the interval of the moisture content was set to approximately 2 and the design range of the initial moisture content was between 11 and 22 the values of the six water contents in this study were 11 16 13 24 15 18 17 03 19 26 and 21 66 the hydraulic gradient was set to 3 and the test period was seven days the environmental temperature was controlled at the standard temperature i e 20 the hydraulic conductivity of the remolded loess sample with a dry density of 1 45 g cm3 was obtained through a saturated permeability test additionally the change mechanism of the hydraulic conductivity of the remolded loess was revealed by the response of the microstructure to the initial moisture content 2 3 test methods 2 3 1 specimen preparation the loess sieved by a 2 mm sieve was dried at 105 for 8 h to achieve complete dehydration subsequently the wet soil with the required moisture content was prepared by deionized water and sealed for 24 h to achieve water homogenization gao et al 2018 xu et al 2020b following this the actual moisture content was calculated using the weighing method finally the remolded loess samples with a diameter of 6 18 cm and a height of 4 cm were prepared using a three axis compactor and they were ready for the saturated permeability tests 2 3 2 saturated permeability test the formula for calculating saturated hydraulic conductivity of remolded loess by constant head method is as follow chen et al 2021a xu et al 2021a zhang et al 2021 1 k sat q l a t δ h where ksat is the saturated hydraulic conductivity cm s q is the amount of water overflow cm3 a is the cross sectional area of sample cm2 t is the time s required for q to be discharged δh is the hydraulic head drop across the soil sample cm and l is height of sample cm in the process of the seepage the testing method and accuracy of each parameter has been stated in the research of xu et al 2021c fig 3 shows the structure of the saturated permeability test device including a water supply system a regulating system and a seepage system the water supply system was composed of a water supply tank and tube which was responsible for providing water for the entire test device the regulating system was composed of a constant head tank a screw regulator a piezometer tube and a catchment tank which was responsible for adjusting the dynamic balance of the water flow to ensure the stability of the head as for the seepage system it was mainly composed of tst 55 permeameter and a conical flask the function of each part in the device has been described in detail in existing literature xu et al 2021b 2 3 3 microstructure test soil microstructure testing is a process of quantifying the information reflected in a microimage and realizing the statistics and corresponding analysis based on the advantages of geometric visualization of sem imaging al mukhtar et al 2012 rabot et al 2018 xu et al 2021c the microstructure observation of the thin sections mainly included six steps sample dehumidification vacuum treatment of samples preparation of soaking solution impregnation of the samples polishing and gold plating of the samples and sample observation xu et al 2021e the details of the operation have been described in detail in existing literature li and li 2017 xu et al 2021b in addition the thin sections were sprayed with gold using a scd 005 ion sputtering instrument and the samples were observed using a fei quanta 200 scanning electron microscope ipp 6 0 software was used to extract the microstructure information of the sem images because this software integrates the functions of acquisition processing and measurement ni et al 2020 xu et al 2021c yang et al 2019 furthermore for micromorphology investigations of the remolded loess samples the fresh surface specimens were also coated with gold using a scd 005 ion sputtering instrument and observed under a fei quanta 200 scanning electron microscope xu et al 2021d xu et al 2021f 2 3 4 evaluation of leaching effect to reveal the temperature effect on the leaching of remolded loess in the seepage process the mass of the total dissolved solids tds in the leachate should be introduced to characterize the leaching effect which is defined as follows xu et al 2021d 2 m t i 1 n v i m i where mt is the total dissolved solids mass in leachate mg vi is the volume of leachate recorded each time l mi is the content of total dissolved solids tds in leachate mg l n is the number of times to record the volume of leachate the test period was seven days and the recording was done every 12 h therefore the maximum n value was 14 it should be emphasized that after recording the leachate volume the tds value was immediately measured using a az86505 multifunctional water quality analyzer with an accuracy of 1 to prevent the long time contact with air from affecting the test results 3 results 3 1 relationship between temperature and permeability fig 4 shows the variation characteristics and distribution range of ksat of the remolded loess samples with a dry density of 1 45 g cm3 at different temperatures as shown ksat of the samples increases with time at 10 and 20 while there is a significant decrease in ksat with the seepage time at 30 the distribution ranges of ksat were 1 05e 5 1 29e 5 1 45e 5 1 56e 5 and 1 04e 5 2 01e 5 cm s at 10 20 and 30 and the corresponding mean values were 1 13e 5 1 50e 5 and 1 35e 5 cm s respectively therefore compared with the standard temperature of 20 increasing temperature 30 or decreasing temperature 10 could have a significant impact on ksat of the remolded loess thereby enhancing the variation degree of the saturated permeability in order to quantitatively evaluate the change degree of ksat the increment and relative increment of saturated hydraulic conductivity are introduced the calculation formulas are as follows 3 δ k k f k i 4 δ k δ k k i 100 where k is the increment of saturated hydraulic conductivity cm s δk is relative increment of saturated hydraulic conductivity ki and kf was initial and final saturated hydraulic conductivity cm s respectively table 1 lists the statistical parameters of the change degree of ksat at different temperatures the k values were 2 16e 6 1 11e 6 and 8 76e 6 cm s at 10 20 and 30 and the corresponding δk values were 19 94 7 66 and 43 21 respectively indicating that the temperature of the experimental environment had an evident influence on the saturated permeability of the remolded loess in addition the initial ksat increased with the increase in the temperature consistent with the conclusion reported by zhang et al 2021 however the change in the ksat with the seepage time is contrary to this law it can be inferred that the interaction between water and soil changes the soil structure in the seepage process and then causes a variation in the permeability of the remolded loess 3 2 relationship between hydraulic gradient and permeability fig 5 shows the relationship between the saturated hydraulic conductivity of remolded loess and the hydraulic gradient with the increase in the hydraulic gradient from 1 to 6 ksat of the sample with a dry density of 1 35 g cm3 decreased by 56 89 changing from 6 68e 5 cm s to 2 88 e 5 cm s whereas ksat of the samples with dry densities of 1 45 and 1 55 g cm3 increased first and then tended to be stable from a hydraulic gradient of 2 the corresponding values ranged from 1 43e 5 cm s to 1 50e 5 cm s and from 3 43e 6 cm s to 3 45e 6 cm s respectively however with the decrease in the hydraulic gradient the corresponding ksat decreased in the ranges of 2 88e 5 2 43e 5 1 50e 5 1 26e 5 and 3 60e 6 2 84e 6 cm s with variations of 15 63 16 00 and 21 11 respectively it can be inferred that the change in ksat with the hydraulic gradient is related to soil compactness which is the result of the effect of dry density on the microstructure of remolded loess 3 3 relationship between initial moisture content and permeability to explore the influence of initial moisture content on ksat of remolded loess a series of saturated permeability tests were conducted on remolded loess samples fig 6 shows the results from fig 6a when the initial moisture content is lower than the optimal moisture content such as 11 16 13 24 and 15 18 ksat decreases with the seepage time correspondingly the relative increment in the saturated hydraulic conductivity are 46 63 45 37 and 42 52 respectively table 2 however when the initial moisture contents are 17 03 19 26 and 21 66 ksat increases with the seepage time by 7 66 21 86 and 49 65 respectively in addition in region i the initial ksat decreases significantly with the initial moisture content and their correlation coefficient is 0 963 fig 7 fig 6b shows the distribution characteristics of ksat with time under different initial moisture contents for samples with an initial moisture content 17 the distribution range of ksat is wider which means that its change with time is more evident the coefficient of variation cv is introduced to characterize the change degree in ksat of remolded loess samples with different initial moisture contents and its calculation formula is as follows 5 c v δ μ 100 where μ is the mean of ksat and δ is the standard deviation of ksat the statistical results are presented in table 3 which are consistent with the phenomenon shown in fig 6b in addition cv of ksat is the lowest under an initial water content of 17 03 and its value is 2 67 when it is greater than the optimal water content cv increases with increasing initial water content which indicates that the change degree of ksat with time is also enhanced the series of variation characteristics of the above ksat should be due to the evolution of the soil microstructure under different initial water contents 4 discussion 4 1 mechanism of temperature effect on ksat as one of the most important factors affecting the soil permeability the primary reason widely recognized is the influence of temperature on the viscosity coefficient of the fluid delage et al 2011 zhang et al 2021 considering the variation in the free water viscosity with temperature the following method was used to modify the saturated hydraulic conductivity in accordance with the sgtm 2019 and the majority of scholars chen et al 2021a gao et al 2018 hou et al 2020 wang et al 2020 the saturated hydraulic conductivity measured at an ambient temperature of 20 c is called the k 20 in order to eliminate the influence of temperature on the saturated hydraulic conductivity all values measured at other temperatures need to be converted to the values at the standard temperature of 20 c through the relationship of the dynamic viscosity coefficient thus enabling the comparison and analysis of soil permeability the calculation formula is as follows zhang et al 2015 xu et al 2020a 6 k 20 k t η t η 20 where t is the temperature of the actual test environment kt is the test value of saturated hydraulic conductivity at t c ηt and η 20 are the coefficients of the dynamic viscosity of free water at t and 20 c respectively hence based on above equation 6 ksat at different temperatures can be corrected to the values at the standard temperature of 20 c and a comparison between the two can be performed as shown in fig 8 the correction values of k 10 were in general agreement with the test values at 20 and their deviation rates i e the relative errors of the two were between 8 05 and 7 16 during the entire seepage period as shown in region i of fig 8 however the correction value of ksat at 30 was different from that at 20 which showed that the effect of high temperature on the permeability of the remolded loess was extremely significant meanwhile it was more rational to use equation 6 to correct the saturated hydraulic conductivity at a low temperature 10 than that at a high temperature 30 moreover existing research has shown that there is a significant deviation between the test value of ksat of the remolded loess and the value calculated using the above correction method at temperatures above 25 zhang et al 2021 in region ii the corrected values of ksat at these two temperatures had little difference with the test ksat values at the standard temperature in the first 1 5 days of the seepage period and ksat conformed to an increasing law with the increase in temperature in view of this the initial ksat was selected for comparison at different temperatures as shown in region iii at 30 the test and correction values were 2 01e 5 and 1 61e 5 cm s respectively and the correction value was reduced by 19 90 at 10 the test and correction values were 1 08e 5 and 1 41e 5 cm s respectively and the correction value was increased by 30 56 generally in addition to considering the change in the viscosity of free water with temperature the change in ksat is associated with other factors such as the thickness of the bound water and the chemical interaction between water and soil fig 9 shows the distribution of the different types of water in the pores of the loess samples in the schematic of the soil specimen structure fig 9a the layer of water adsorbed onto the surface of clay particles is called bound water and its thickness evidently affects the soil permeability li et al 2015 singh and wallender 2008 bound water is generally divided into tightly bound water and loosely bound water and the outer layer of the loosely bound water belongs to free gravity water xu et al 2021d temperature changes the movement space of free water by affecting the thickness of the bound water film thus changing the saturated hydraulic conductivity of remolded loess as reported by zhang et al 2021 when the temperature is above 4 the increase in the temperature can cause the bound water on the surface of the clay particles to transform into free water forming more abundant water passage channels therefore the correction value of the initial ksat increases with increasing temperature fig 8 however there are significant differences in the variation in ksat with time at different temperatures and the chemical interaction between water and soil which causes different degrees of changes in the soil structure should also be considered to reveal the temperature effect on the leaching of remolded loess in the seepage process fig 10 shows the evaluation of the dissolution effect at different temperatures the tds content in the leachate decreased significantly at first and then tended to be relatively stable with time fig 10a indicating that chemical leaching gradually weakened in the seepage process of remolded loess at any temperature the cumulative leaching masses of the tds were highest at a temperature of 30 followed by 20 and 10 fig 10b the higher the temperature the more significant the leaching effect and the stronger the interaction between water and soil correspondingly the microstructure of the loess sample should have different responses during the seepage fig 11 shows the micromorphological changes in the remolded loess samples after seepage at different temperatures compared with the microstructure before seepage fig 11a the fine clastic particles of the remolded loess samples after seepage at 10 increased and dispersed and the coarse skeleton particles were wrapped by the fine particles fig 11b after seepage at 20 a large number of fine clastic particles in the remolded loess gathered to form larger aggregates and larger pore spaces fig 11c which helped enhance the permeability the thickness of the diffuse double layer can be equivalent to the thickness of the bound water film xu et al 2021d the higher the temperature the thinner the film that is the thinner the diffuse double layer therefore the evident difference in the microstructure after seepage at the above two temperatures is mainly due to physicochemical forces osmotic repulsion and van der waals s attractive forces between the clays which change the shape of the soil skeleton particles and pore structure thus affecting the permeability of the remolded loess wen and he 2012 xu et al 2020b zhang et al 2013 after seepage at 30 the soil particles and aggregates were in a uniform dispersion state and the development of large scale pores was weak fig 11d indicating that the overall soil structure may be reorganized combined with fig 10 the strong chemical leaching at high temperatures makes the components to leave the soil weakens the stability of the structure and leads to a collapse of the soil to sum up the influence mechanism of temperature on the permeability of remolded loess is summarized as follows because of the change in the fluid viscosity and bound water film thickness the permeability at 20 is higher than that at 10 meanwhile chemical leaching helps develop pores and enhances the permeability thus ksat increases with the seepage time however at a high temperature 30 the strong dissolution between the water and soil destroys the soil stability and then causes the deterioration and collapse of the soil structure this improves the initial permeability but it then decreases significantly with the seepage time furthermore the ksat is mainly influenced by the dynamic viscosity of the water when the temperature is between 10 and 20 and it is reasonable to use equation 6 to correct the ksat when the temperature is higher than 20 the thickness of the bound water film and the chemical interaction between water and soil especially the leaching effect are gradually dominant and equation 6 is no longer applicable 4 2 mechanism of hydraulic gradient effect on ksat exploring the soil microstructure can help explain the changes in the engineering properties and establish a relationship with its macrobehavior li et al 2016 romero 2013 shao et al 2018 xu et al 2021c the variation trend in the saturated hydraulic conductivity of remolded loess with the hydraulic gradient under different dry densities mainly depends on its microstructure to express the overall microstructure characteristics of the samples more vividly the original sem images were transformed into 3d simulation images as presented in fig 12 a in the remolded sample with a dry density of 1 35 g cm3 evident pores were visible i e free water passages the 1 45 g cm3 and 1 55 g cm3 remolded samples had a denser structure with the increase in the dry density the pore area between the particles decreased significantly to further quantitatively analyze the pore distribution characteristics of loess the classification method proposed by lei 1987 was adopted in this study micropores diameter 2 μm small pores 2 μm diameter 8 μm mesopores 8 μm diameter 32 μm and macropores diameter 32 μm fig 12b shows the pore area distribution of the remolded loess with different dry densities the 1 35 g cm3 sample contains 13 01 of macropore area 13 64 of mesopore area 6 30 of small pore area and 1 83 of micropore area indicating that macropores and mesopores are the main types of pores as for the remolded loess samples with dry densities of 1 45 and 1 55 g cm3 the macropores disappear and the mesopore content evidently decreases meanwhile the small pores and micropores are the main pore types for the remolded loess sample with a dry density of 1 35 g cm3 macropores and mesopores are dominant and the pore space is rich this provides necessary conditions for the migration of fine particles xu et al 2021c in the process of increasing the hydraulic gradient the increase in the permeability force promotes the migration effect of particles the movement and accumulation of particles in the pore channels lead to a decrease in the water passing area which further hinders the movement of water in the soil meanwhile the particle skeleton structure of the sample is loose and its stability is poor making the structure prone to collapse when meeting with water burton et al 2015 xu et al 2021b furthermore macropores and mesopores have significant effects on the collapsibility and structural deformation of loess li et al 2016 fig 13 depicts the change pattern in the microstructure of the loess sample with this dry density after soaking because of the instability of the sample itself in the seepage process the original skeleton structure is not strong enough to support its own weight and the soil structure eventually collapses and deteriorates therefore with the increase in the hydraulic gradient ksat decreases significantly by 56 89 it can be considered that the increase in the hydraulic gradient accelerates the deterioration of the soil structure and the attenuation of the saturated hydraulic conductivity as the head pressure decreases ksat also shows a decreasing trend and the reduction is only 15 63 this is mainly because the damage degree of soil particles and pores is weakened in the decompression process and the internal and external loads of the soil gradually enter a rebalancing state ksat of the remolded loess samples with dry densities of 1 45 and 1 55 g cm3 increases first and then tends to be stable upon increasing the hydraulic gradient similar to the findings of this study other researchers have also observed that ksat is not constant but depends on the hydraulic gradient wang et al 2020 as mentioned above with the increase in the hydraulic gradient the migration effect of fine particles is enhanced under the drive of the seepage force however there is no foundation for particle migration without macropores in the soil that is the migration effect is weak or even negligible an et al 2013 xu et al 2021c from the analysis of the microelectric field effect when the hydraulic gradient is 2 the increase in ksat is mainly due to the change in the bound water film thickness as shown in fig 9 because the bound water in the electric double layer has a certain shear strength wang et al 2017 the increase in the hydraulic gradient causes the weakly bound water to flow gradually hence the effective cross section for free water movement increases song et al 2018 wang et al 2020 in addition when the hydraulic gradient is 2 ksat is almost constant this should be because all the bound water capable of flow is in a relatively stable state which leads to the maximum effective cross section furthermore with the decrease in the hydraulic gradient the content of weakly bound water increases and its thickness increases which reduces the effective pore space of the water flow song et al 2018 therefore the decrease in the hydraulic gradient leads to a decrease in ksat 4 3 mechanism of initial moisture content effect on ksat in this study when the dry density of remolded loess is constant the initial ksat decreases with the increase in the initial moisture content with the changes in order of magnitude such as 10e 6 10 e 5 cm s indicating that the initial moisture content has a significant influence on the permeability this phenomenon is mainly attributed to the change in the microstructure due to the state and property of the water in loess pores as shown in fig 14 the minimum moisture content of the remolded loess was designed to be 11 16 and the outline of the particles is clear and easily identifiable meanwhile the aggregation degree of the particles is low the aggregate size is small and the pore space is rich fig 14a therefore the initial permeability of the sample with the lowest moisture content is the highest with the increase in the water content the aggregation effect of water makes the particles to form larger aggregates and the clay particles clay minerals in the loess absorb water and expand compressing the pore space between the loess particles fig 14b thus the initial permeability shows a decreasing trend when the initial water content is greater than the optimal water content for example 22 16 the aggregate structure of the soil is unclear with the overall structure being in the state of flocculation and the porosity and connectivity are reduced fig 14c therefore the initial permeability is significantly reduced in order of magnitude in addition the variation trend in ksat of the remolded loess with the seepage time is inconsistent under different initial moisture contents fig 6a mainly because the initial moisture content affects the compaction effect of soil and then influences its microstructure fig 15 shows the evolution model of the microstructure of remolded loess with the increase in the water content for low water contents less than the optimal water content only firmly adsorbed bound water is formed on the particle surface due to the lack of water in the soil the expansibility of the clay particles and the cementation ability of clay minerals are weak therefore the particles are mainly in overhead contact and the stability of the structure is low fig 15a in the process of saturated seepage the expansion of clay minerals and the dissolution of cementitious materials in the loess lead to the destruction and collapse of the internal microstructure of loess and then blocking of the effective pore channels zou et al 2019 therefore the permeability decreases significantly with time at the optimum moisture content the water film on the surface of the soil particles becomes thicker which lubricates the agglomeration of the particles and makes their arrangement more compact meanwhile the pore channels become narrow forming a relatively stable structure as shown in fig 15b when the initial water content continues to increase and even exceeds the plastic limit the sample contains not only bound water but also free water and the clay particles fully expand which is conducive to the flocculation of the soil as a whole as shown in fig 14c and fig 15c in this case the seepage force can promote more weakly bound water to be transformed into free water wang et al 2020 and the leaching is conducive to pore development xu et al 2021c therefore the permeability of the remolded loess increases with the seepage time in summary the mechanism of initial water content affecting the saturated permeability of remolded loess can be summarized as follows with the increase of initial water content the water film between soil particles becomes thicker making it easier for soil particles to form larger agglomerates and smaller pores hong et al 2016 additionally the clay particles clay minerals in the loess absorb water and expand compressing the pore space thus the initial ksat decreases when the water content is lower than the optimal water content the structural stability is poor under the action of infiltration force the soil structure is highly susceptible to collapse and the large pores change into small pores xu et al 2021c therefore the ksat tends to decrease with time with increasing water content the soil has a stable structure the infiltration force is conducive to the transformation of weakly bound water into free water and the leaching promotes the connectivity and development of pore space wang et al 2020 xu et al 2021c therefore it can be inferred that the extention of pore space is the main factor for the increase of ksat with time 4 4 comparison of the permeability of soil according to this study the underlying mechanism responsible for changes in the saturated permeability of remolded loess subjected to temperature hydraulic gradient and initial moisture content was determined and summarized 1 temperature effect during the short period of time at the beginning of seepage the higher the temperature the stronger the permeability of remolded loess similar laws also exist in the study of other soils such as soft bangkok clay abuel naga et al 2006 compacted bentonite cho et al 1999 and boom clay delage et al 2011 the loess in this study belongs to clay type so the variation law of permeability of remodeled loess with time at different temperatures and its mechanism can be extended to the study of compacted clayey soil 2 hydraulic gradient effect loess is a low permeability soil and there is non darcy flow in the seepage process wang et al 2020 al taie et al 2014 and song et al 2018 also found non darcy phenomenon in the hydraulic gradient effect on clay permeability therefore the response of permeability of remolded loess with different dry densities to pressurization and decompression described in this study should be suitable for the study of seepage characteristics of other clayey soils 3 initial moisture content effect the relationship between initial moisture content and unsaturated permeability of soils have been deeply studied haeri et al 2012 yao et al 2021 however this study focuses on the influence mechanism of initial water content on the saturated permeability of remolded loess and shows that it is achieved by changing the soil structure and the thickness of the bound water film on the particles hong et al 2016 also obtained the similar findings on this aspect suggesting this is also universal in the permeability of other clayey soils 4 5 limitations permeability is an important physical property of loess which has close relationship with other engineering properties bagarello et al 2009 gao et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 xu et al 2021b ksat is an important parameter describing the permeability of soil and has been commonly investigated by researchers chen et al 2021b han et al 2020 wang et al 2020 xu et al 2022 among the factors affecting the ksat of remolded loess this study focuses on temperature hydraulic gradient and initial water content and is hopeful to provide a deeper understanding of the related issues of permeability change in remolded loess during the seepage process due to the wide distribution of loess plateau three loess zones have been identified in china namely the sandy silty and clayey loess zones gao et al 2021 the loess specimens used in this study were retrieved from jing yang area which is the clayey loess zone of the chinese loess plateau the findings of this study are more appropriately generalized to other clayey soils while lack sufficient justification for application in sandy and silty loess thus making the conclusions somewhat limited however this points out the direction for the future research of the regional variability of loess permeability in the chinese loess plateau 5 conclusions in this study a series of constant head permeability tests were designed under different temperatures hydraulic gradients and initial moisture contents to explore the characteristics of saturated permeability of remolded loess the main conclusions are as follows the temperature mainly changes the pore structure by affecting the fluid viscosity bound water film thickness and chemical leaching so as to influence the permeability of remolded loess because of the decrease in the fluid viscosity and the thinning of the bound water film the initial permeability increased with increasing temperature the leaching is conducive to pore development which is the main reason for the increase in ksat with the seepage time at 10 and 20 however the strong chemical interaction between water and soil destroys the soil stability at 30 resulting in the collapse of the soil structure and blocking of the pore channels therefore ksat decreases significantly with time due to the abundant macropores in the samples with a low dry density 1 35 g cm3 the increase in the hydraulic gradient promotes the migration effect of particles and accelerates the collapse of the soil structure therefore ksat decreases significantly as the hydraulic gradient decreases ksat shows a relatively slow decreasing trend which is mainly due to the gradual rebalancing of the internal and external loads for the remolded loess specimens with dry densities of 1 45 and 1 55 g cm3 the increase in the hydraulic gradient makes the weakly bound water to flow gradually thereby increasing the permeability and ksat is stable because the effective flow cross section reaches maximum when the hydraulic gradient is 2 however ksat decreases with decreasing hydraulic gradient which is due to the reduction in the effective pore space of water flow with the increase in the water content the aggregation effect of water makes the particles to form larger aggregates and the clay particles clay minerals in the loess absorb water and expand compressing the pore space between the loess particles thus the initial ksat decreases when the dry density of the remolded loess is constant when the water content is lower than the optimal water content the structural stability is poor therefore ksat decreases during the seepage process with increasing water content the lubrication effect makes the particles to arrange more closely and form a relatively stable structure the effective pore space is expanded by the seepage force and leaching and ksat increases with time the research results provide a new insight into the response model and mechanism of saturated permeability change of remolded loess to temperature hydraulic gradient and initial water content however it should be noted that the response of permeability change of undisturbed loess to these

3114,as an important property of loess permeability has a significant impact on the durability and safety of engineering construction in loess areas to explore the response mechanism of permeability change of remolded loess to temperature hydraulic gradient and initial moisture content a series of permeability tests scanning electron microscopy tests and leaching tests were designed and conducted the results show that the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat increases with seepage time at 10 and 20 while it decreases at 30 which is mainly controlled by the comprehensive effect of temperature on the fluid viscosity bound water film and chemical leaching in addition the hydraulic gradient affects the permeability of soil by controlling the transformation of water type on the particle surface the fundamental determinant of the inconsistency in ksat with the hydraulic gradient under different dry densities is the microstructure of the soil furthermore the initial ksat decreases with the increase in the water content ksat decreases in the process of seepage when the water content is lower than the optimal amount attributed to the poor structural stability with the continuous increase in the water content the lubrication makes the particles to arrange more closely and form a relatively stable structure thus ksat increases with time these findings would help explain the permeability behavior of remolded loess and serve as a basis for engineering geological construction in loess areas keywords saturated permeability temperature hydraulic gradient initial moisture content remolded loess data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction loess is a quaternary deposit formed in arid and semi arid climate environments and has important engineering geological significance chen et al 2021a xu et al 2020a it is distributed worldwide such as in north america europe asia and south america accounting for approximately 10 of the global land area li et al 2019 luo et al 2018 peng et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 china has loess with the widest distribution the thickest deposition and the most complete strata forming the well known chinese loess plateau clp which covers an area of approximately 640 000 km2 over seven provinces derbyshire 2001 hou et al 2021 leng et al 2018 zhang et al 2020a loess has great potential for development and construction and its engineering application value cannot be underestimated xu et al 2021a b zhang et al 2021 however under the influence of extreme climate and increasing engineering activities leakage and impervious core failure have been frequent in earth dams dikes and reservoirs therefore understanding the flow behavior of water in soil is of great significance for engineering construction and geological disaster prevention cheng et al 2021 lee and ho 2009 permeability which is an important geotechnical property of soil is used to characterize the passage of fluid through soil chapuis 2012 lu et al 2021 xu et al 2021c the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat is an important parameter that can help describe the permeability of soil chen et al 2021b han et al 2020 mügler et al 2019 thus far researchers have extensively studied the saturated hydraulic conductivity of soil and the influence of various factors on this parameter including particle size hydraulic gradient microorganism moisture content temperature and fluid chemical properties chen et al 2021a gao et al 2018 hong et al 2016 song et al 2018 wang et al 2020 xu et al 2021b xu et al 2021d ye et al 2009 zhang et al 2021 historically the saturated hydraulic conductivity is considered a constant under given conditions chen et al 2020 sanchez vila et al 2006 existing research has shown that ksat of remolded loess varies with time under different conditions such as the soil dry density and solution ph xu et al 2021c d however under the following three influencing factors the variation of saturated hydraulic conductivity with time is only understood in a macroscopic sense and are not recognized in terms of mechanisms the first issue discussed is the effect of temperature on soil permeability the loess region in northwest china is a typical seasonally frozen soil region and the temperature has a significant impact on the engineering properties of loess for example the permeability of soil increases with the increase of temperature which has been widely concerned by domestic and international scholars abuel naga et al 2006 cho et al 1999 delage et al 2011 zhang et al 2021 ye et al 2013 increasing the temperature has been found to reduce the viscosity of water flow and thus enhance the permeability however the research of ye et al 2013 shows that the calculated value of ksat deviates greatly from the measured value only considering viscosity in addition another explanation is that the increase of temperature leads to the conversion of bound water into gravity water and the thickness of bound water film decreases in short although there are different opinions on the influence mechanism of temperature on soil permeability it lays a foundation for the research of remolded loess in this regard zhang et al 2021 found that ksat of remolded loess increases with the increase in temperature by designing a series of saturated permeability tests at various temperatures 0 40 the growth rate of ksat after 4 is significantly greater than that before 4 and reaches the maximum at 25 which is mainly due to the influence of high or low temperature on the soil structure the effect of temperature on the permeability of remolded loess is well explained while there is a lack of research on the variation in ksat with time and its mechanism the second topic closely related to soil permeability is the hydraulic gradient which is also focused by researchers in the field of engineering geology and hydrogeology al taie et al 2014 hansbo 2001 song et al 2018 wang et al 2020 wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2020b as the hydraulic gradient increases the infiltration force makes the fine particles transport along the direction of water flow changing the homogeneity of the original structure of the soil and resulting in irreversible changes in its permeability for instance wang et al 2021 studied the loss rate of fine particles in sandy soils under seepage and the critical starting slope of their migration movement zhang et al 2020b found that the critical hydraulic gradient of vertical seepage of chalk sand is higher than that of horizontal direction for low permeability soils particularly those rich in clay particles or clay minerals ksat also varies with the hydraulic gradient al taie et al 2014 wang et al 2020 studied the influence of hydraulic gradient on the permeability of remolded loess and found that with the increase in the hydraulic gradient ksat first increases and then gradually stabilizes under a dry density 1 30 g cm3 while showing a change trend of first increasing and then decreasing under a dry density of 1 20 g cm3 the hydraulic gradient affects the transport of particles and the thickness of the bound water film through infiltration force which in turn changes the permeability of the soil although considerable progress has been made in studies on the effect of increasing the hydraulic gradient the relationship between ksat of remolded loess and the decrease in the hydraulic gradient has not been established the third issue is the initial moisture content of the soil which also has a considerable impact on the permeability numerous scholars are keen on studying the relationship between initial moisture content and permeability of unsaturated soils and rich research results have been obtained haeri et al 2012 jiang et al 2017 lu et al 2019 yao et al 2021 at the same time the influence mechanism of initial water content on the gas permeability of soils has also been explored liu et al 2021 however there are few studies on the effect of initial water content on soil saturated permeability hong et al 2016 examined ksat of remolded loess differing in terms of the initial water content using tst 55 permeameters with an experimental cycle of only a few hours they found that ksat decreases with the increase in the initial water content and that the change trend with time is inconsistent the occurrence and state of cement were different because of the different initial water contents which affects the compaction effect of soil and consequently its microstructure however there is a lack of research on how the permeability of remodeled loess changes during a long term seepage hence it is worth exploring the response of the permeability of remolded loess to the initial water content in this regard in this study the authors analyzed the above three factors that significantly affect the permeability of remolded loess including the temperature hydraulic gradient and initial water content and combined with existing research results to provide a deeper understanding of the related issues of permeability change in remolded loess during the seepage process to meet the research objectives a series of saturated permeability tests under different conditions were designed and conducted on remolded loess samples the microstructure characteristics of the samples were characterized using scanning electron microscopy sem and the leaching effect was evaluated the three related factors affecting the permeability change of the remolded loess were thoroughly discussed based on the test results 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the sampling site is located in the south of the chinese loess plateau malan loess from the southern platform of jingyang shaanxi province was used as the material to explore several related issues of permeability change of remolded loess fig 1 the soil materials were sampled from a depth of 3 m below the ground surface after sampling the loess was sealed in bags and transported back to the laboratory dried naturally and crushed the wjl 602 laser particle size analyzer was used to test the particle size distribution as shown in fig 2 a the loess contained 13 21 clay 2 μm 86 63 silt 2 50 μm and 0 16 sand 50 2000 μm the uniformity coefficient and gradation coefficient of the loess particles were 9 70 and 1 58 respectively indicating a well graded soil its specific gravity was determined using the pycnometer method and the corresponding value was 2 71 the liquid and plastic limits of the loess were 34 5 and 20 1 respectively the compaction curve of malan loess was determined through indoor compaction test as shown in fig 2b the maximum dry density and optimum moisture content of the loess were 1 74 g cm 3 and 17 07 respectively 2 2 experimental scheme considering some of the problems related to the permeability change of remolded loess the experimental scheme designed in this study is as follows 1 influence of temperature on permeability the standard temperature defined in the standard for geotechnical testing method sgtm 2019 is 20 therefore taking 10 as the temperature interval the environmental temperature for the permeability test was set to 10 20 and 30 to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the temperature conditions the entire test was conducted in an shh c3000 constant temperature controller this type of instrument has a temperature range of 0 60 with a controlling accuracy of 0 1 xu et al 2021c when the hydraulic gradient is not 3 the velocity of remolded loess with a dry density of 1 20 1 80 g cm3 shows a good positive correlation with the hydraulic gradient i e it is consistent with the darcy seepage characteristics wang et al 2020 considering the damage of high hydraulic gradient to loess structure the hydraulic gradient was set as to 3 in this study the test period was seven days taking the remolded loess with a dry density of 1 45 g cm3 as an example the permeability change with time under different temperatures was studied in addition combined with the leaching characteristics and microstructure evolution at different temperatures the influence mechanism of temperature on the permeability of remolded loess would be revealed 2 influence of hydraulic gradient on permeability it has been shown that since loess is a low permeability soil the permeability of the soil is extremely unstable when the hydraulic gradient is 1 and the ksat hardly changes significantly with the hydraulic gradient 6 wang et al 2020 therefore to explore the change in the permeability of remolded loess under pressure increasing and pressure reducing conditions the saturated permeability tests with different hydraulic gradients were conducted with designed values of 1 1 5 2 3 4 6 4 3 2 1 5 and 1 by adjusting the head to achieve the desired hydraulic gradient and until it stabilizes the volume of the exudate was started to be recorded after continuously recording three sets of data the hydraulic gradient was adjusted to the next value and above process was repeated the ambient temperature of the permeability test was maintained at a standard temperature of 20 using the shh c3000 constant temperature controller the dry density of the samples was set to 1 35 1 45 and 1 55 g cm3 and the influence of hydraulic gradient on the permeability of the remolded loess was determined 3 influence of initial moisture content on permeability to investigate the variation trend in the permeability of remolded loess with time under different initial moisture contents the interval of the moisture content was set to approximately 2 and the design range of the initial moisture content was between 11 and 22 the values of the six water contents in this study were 11 16 13 24 15 18 17 03 19 26 and 21 66 the hydraulic gradient was set to 3 and the test period was seven days the environmental temperature was controlled at the standard temperature i e 20 the hydraulic conductivity of the remolded loess sample with a dry density of 1 45 g cm3 was obtained through a saturated permeability test additionally the change mechanism of the hydraulic conductivity of the remolded loess was revealed by the response of the microstructure to the initial moisture content 2 3 test methods 2 3 1 specimen preparation the loess sieved by a 2 mm sieve was dried at 105 for 8 h to achieve complete dehydration subsequently the wet soil with the required moisture content was prepared by deionized water and sealed for 24 h to achieve water homogenization gao et al 2018 xu et al 2020b following this the actual moisture content was calculated using the weighing method finally the remolded loess samples with a diameter of 6 18 cm and a height of 4 cm were prepared using a three axis compactor and they were ready for the saturated permeability tests 2 3 2 saturated permeability test the formula for calculating saturated hydraulic conductivity of remolded loess by constant head method is as follow chen et al 2021a xu et al 2021a zhang et al 2021 1 k sat q l a t δ h where ksat is the saturated hydraulic conductivity cm s q is the amount of water overflow cm3 a is the cross sectional area of sample cm2 t is the time s required for q to be discharged δh is the hydraulic head drop across the soil sample cm and l is height of sample cm in the process of the seepage the testing method and accuracy of each parameter has been stated in the research of xu et al 2021c fig 3 shows the structure of the saturated permeability test device including a water supply system a regulating system and a seepage system the water supply system was composed of a water supply tank and tube which was responsible for providing water for the entire test device the regulating system was composed of a constant head tank a screw regulator a piezometer tube and a catchment tank which was responsible for adjusting the dynamic balance of the water flow to ensure the stability of the head as for the seepage system it was mainly composed of tst 55 permeameter and a conical flask the function of each part in the device has been described in detail in existing literature xu et al 2021b 2 3 3 microstructure test soil microstructure testing is a process of quantifying the information reflected in a microimage and realizing the statistics and corresponding analysis based on the advantages of geometric visualization of sem imaging al mukhtar et al 2012 rabot et al 2018 xu et al 2021c the microstructure observation of the thin sections mainly included six steps sample dehumidification vacuum treatment of samples preparation of soaking solution impregnation of the samples polishing and gold plating of the samples and sample observation xu et al 2021e the details of the operation have been described in detail in existing literature li and li 2017 xu et al 2021b in addition the thin sections were sprayed with gold using a scd 005 ion sputtering instrument and the samples were observed using a fei quanta 200 scanning electron microscope ipp 6 0 software was used to extract the microstructure information of the sem images because this software integrates the functions of acquisition processing and measurement ni et al 2020 xu et al 2021c yang et al 2019 furthermore for micromorphology investigations of the remolded loess samples the fresh surface specimens were also coated with gold using a scd 005 ion sputtering instrument and observed under a fei quanta 200 scanning electron microscope xu et al 2021d xu et al 2021f 2 3 4 evaluation of leaching effect to reveal the temperature effect on the leaching of remolded loess in the seepage process the mass of the total dissolved solids tds in the leachate should be introduced to characterize the leaching effect which is defined as follows xu et al 2021d 2 m t i 1 n v i m i where mt is the total dissolved solids mass in leachate mg vi is the volume of leachate recorded each time l mi is the content of total dissolved solids tds in leachate mg l n is the number of times to record the volume of leachate the test period was seven days and the recording was done every 12 h therefore the maximum n value was 14 it should be emphasized that after recording the leachate volume the tds value was immediately measured using a az86505 multifunctional water quality analyzer with an accuracy of 1 to prevent the long time contact with air from affecting the test results 3 results 3 1 relationship between temperature and permeability fig 4 shows the variation characteristics and distribution range of ksat of the remolded loess samples with a dry density of 1 45 g cm3 at different temperatures as shown ksat of the samples increases with time at 10 and 20 while there is a significant decrease in ksat with the seepage time at 30 the distribution ranges of ksat were 1 05e 5 1 29e 5 1 45e 5 1 56e 5 and 1 04e 5 2 01e 5 cm s at 10 20 and 30 and the corresponding mean values were 1 13e 5 1 50e 5 and 1 35e 5 cm s respectively therefore compared with the standard temperature of 20 increasing temperature 30 or decreasing temperature 10 could have a significant impact on ksat of the remolded loess thereby enhancing the variation degree of the saturated permeability in order to quantitatively evaluate the change degree of ksat the increment and relative increment of saturated hydraulic conductivity are introduced the calculation formulas are as follows 3 δ k k f k i 4 δ k δ k k i 100 where k is the increment of saturated hydraulic conductivity cm s δk is relative increment of saturated hydraulic conductivity ki and kf was initial and final saturated hydraulic conductivity cm s respectively table 1 lists the statistical parameters of the change degree of ksat at different temperatures the k values were 2 16e 6 1 11e 6 and 8 76e 6 cm s at 10 20 and 30 and the corresponding δk values were 19 94 7 66 and 43 21 respectively indicating that the temperature of the experimental environment had an evident influence on the saturated permeability of the remolded loess in addition the initial ksat increased with the increase in the temperature consistent with the conclusion reported by zhang et al 2021 however the change in the ksat with the seepage time is contrary to this law it can be inferred that the interaction between water and soil changes the soil structure in the seepage process and then causes a variation in the permeability of the remolded loess 3 2 relationship between hydraulic gradient and permeability fig 5 shows the relationship between the saturated hydraulic conductivity of remolded loess and the hydraulic gradient with the increase in the hydraulic gradient from 1 to 6 ksat of the sample with a dry density of 1 35 g cm3 decreased by 56 89 changing from 6 68e 5 cm s to 2 88 e 5 cm s whereas ksat of the samples with dry densities of 1 45 and 1 55 g cm3 increased first and then tended to be stable from a hydraulic gradient of 2 the corresponding values ranged from 1 43e 5 cm s to 1 50e 5 cm s and from 3 43e 6 cm s to 3 45e 6 cm s respectively however with the decrease in the hydraulic gradient the corresponding ksat decreased in the ranges of 2 88e 5 2 43e 5 1 50e 5 1 26e 5 and 3 60e 6 2 84e 6 cm s with variations of 15 63 16 00 and 21 11 respectively it can be inferred that the change in ksat with the hydraulic gradient is related to soil compactness which is the result of the effect of dry density on the microstructure of remolded loess 3 3 relationship between initial moisture content and permeability to explore the influence of initial moisture content on ksat of remolded loess a series of saturated permeability tests were conducted on remolded loess samples fig 6 shows the results from fig 6a when the initial moisture content is lower than the optimal moisture content such as 11 16 13 24 and 15 18 ksat decreases with the seepage time correspondingly the relative increment in the saturated hydraulic conductivity are 46 63 45 37 and 42 52 respectively table 2 however when the initial moisture contents are 17 03 19 26 and 21 66 ksat increases with the seepage time by 7 66 21 86 and 49 65 respectively in addition in region i the initial ksat decreases significantly with the initial moisture content and their correlation coefficient is 0 963 fig 7 fig 6b shows the distribution characteristics of ksat with time under different initial moisture contents for samples with an initial moisture content 17 the distribution range of ksat is wider which means that its change with time is more evident the coefficient of variation cv is introduced to characterize the change degree in ksat of remolded loess samples with different initial moisture contents and its calculation formula is as follows 5 c v δ μ 100 where μ is the mean of ksat and δ is the standard deviation of ksat the statistical results are presented in table 3 which are consistent with the phenomenon shown in fig 6b in addition cv of ksat is the lowest under an initial water content of 17 03 and its value is 2 67 when it is greater than the optimal water content cv increases with increasing initial water content which indicates that the change degree of ksat with time is also enhanced the series of variation characteristics of the above ksat should be due to the evolution of the soil microstructure under different initial water contents 4 discussion 4 1 mechanism of temperature effect on ksat as one of the most important factors affecting the soil permeability the primary reason widely recognized is the influence of temperature on the viscosity coefficient of the fluid delage et al 2011 zhang et al 2021 considering the variation in the free water viscosity with temperature the following method was used to modify the saturated hydraulic conductivity in accordance with the sgtm 2019 and the majority of scholars chen et al 2021a gao et al 2018 hou et al 2020 wang et al 2020 the saturated hydraulic conductivity measured at an ambient temperature of 20 c is called the k 20 in order to eliminate the influence of temperature on the saturated hydraulic conductivity all values measured at other temperatures need to be converted to the values at the standard temperature of 20 c through the relationship of the dynamic viscosity coefficient thus enabling the comparison and analysis of soil permeability the calculation formula is as follows zhang et al 2015 xu et al 2020a 6 k 20 k t η t η 20 where t is the temperature of the actual test environment kt is the test value of saturated hydraulic conductivity at t c ηt and η 20 are the coefficients of the dynamic viscosity of free water at t and 20 c respectively hence based on above equation 6 ksat at different temperatures can be corrected to the values at the standard temperature of 20 c and a comparison between the two can be performed as shown in fig 8 the correction values of k 10 were in general agreement with the test values at 20 and their deviation rates i e the relative errors of the two were between 8 05 and 7 16 during the entire seepage period as shown in region i of fig 8 however the correction value of ksat at 30 was different from that at 20 which showed that the effect of high temperature on the permeability of the remolded loess was extremely significant meanwhile it was more rational to use equation 6 to correct the saturated hydraulic conductivity at a low temperature 10 than that at a high temperature 30 moreover existing research has shown that there is a significant deviation between the test value of ksat of the remolded loess and the value calculated using the above correction method at temperatures above 25 zhang et al 2021 in region ii the corrected values of ksat at these two temperatures had little difference with the test ksat values at the standard temperature in the first 1 5 days of the seepage period and ksat conformed to an increasing law with the increase in temperature in view of this the initial ksat was selected for comparison at different temperatures as shown in region iii at 30 the test and correction values were 2 01e 5 and 1 61e 5 cm s respectively and the correction value was reduced by 19 90 at 10 the test and correction values were 1 08e 5 and 1 41e 5 cm s respectively and the correction value was increased by 30 56 generally in addition to considering the change in the viscosity of free water with temperature the change in ksat is associated with other factors such as the thickness of the bound water and the chemical interaction between water and soil fig 9 shows the distribution of the different types of water in the pores of the loess samples in the schematic of the soil specimen structure fig 9a the layer of water adsorbed onto the surface of clay particles is called bound water and its thickness evidently affects the soil permeability li et al 2015 singh and wallender 2008 bound water is generally divided into tightly bound water and loosely bound water and the outer layer of the loosely bound water belongs to free gravity water xu et al 2021d temperature changes the movement space of free water by affecting the thickness of the bound water film thus changing the saturated hydraulic conductivity of remolded loess as reported by zhang et al 2021 when the temperature is above 4 the increase in the temperature can cause the bound water on the surface of the clay particles to transform into free water forming more abundant water passage channels therefore the correction value of the initial ksat increases with increasing temperature fig 8 however there are significant differences in the variation in ksat with time at different temperatures and the chemical interaction between water and soil which causes different degrees of changes in the soil structure should also be considered to reveal the temperature effect on the leaching of remolded loess in the seepage process fig 10 shows the evaluation of the dissolution effect at different temperatures the tds content in the leachate decreased significantly at first and then tended to be relatively stable with time fig 10a indicating that chemical leaching gradually weakened in the seepage process of remolded loess at any temperature the cumulative leaching masses of the tds were highest at a temperature of 30 followed by 20 and 10 fig 10b the higher the temperature the more significant the leaching effect and the stronger the interaction between water and soil correspondingly the microstructure of the loess sample should have different responses during the seepage fig 11 shows the micromorphological changes in the remolded loess samples after seepage at different temperatures compared with the microstructure before seepage fig 11a the fine clastic particles of the remolded loess samples after seepage at 10 increased and dispersed and the coarse skeleton particles were wrapped by the fine particles fig 11b after seepage at 20 a large number of fine clastic particles in the remolded loess gathered to form larger aggregates and larger pore spaces fig 11c which helped enhance the permeability the thickness of the diffuse double layer can be equivalent to the thickness of the bound water film xu et al 2021d the higher the temperature the thinner the film that is the thinner the diffuse double layer therefore the evident difference in the microstructure after seepage at the above two temperatures is mainly due to physicochemical forces osmotic repulsion and van der waals s attractive forces between the clays which change the shape of the soil skeleton particles and pore structure thus affecting the permeability of the remolded loess wen and he 2012 xu et al 2020b zhang et al 2013 after seepage at 30 the soil particles and aggregates were in a uniform dispersion state and the development of large scale pores was weak fig 11d indicating that the overall soil structure may be reorganized combined with fig 10 the strong chemical leaching at high temperatures makes the components to leave the soil weakens the stability of the structure and leads to a collapse of the soil to sum up the influence mechanism of temperature on the permeability of remolded loess is summarized as follows because of the change in the fluid viscosity and bound water film thickness the permeability at 20 is higher than that at 10 meanwhile chemical leaching helps develop pores and enhances the permeability thus ksat increases with the seepage time however at a high temperature 30 the strong dissolution between the water and soil destroys the soil stability and then causes the deterioration and collapse of the soil structure this improves the initial permeability but it then decreases significantly with the seepage time furthermore the ksat is mainly influenced by the dynamic viscosity of the water when the temperature is between 10 and 20 and it is reasonable to use equation 6 to correct the ksat when the temperature is higher than 20 the thickness of the bound water film and the chemical interaction between water and soil especially the leaching effect are gradually dominant and equation 6 is no longer applicable 4 2 mechanism of hydraulic gradient effect on ksat exploring the soil microstructure can help explain the changes in the engineering properties and establish a relationship with its macrobehavior li et al 2016 romero 2013 shao et al 2018 xu et al 2021c the variation trend in the saturated hydraulic conductivity of remolded loess with the hydraulic gradient under different dry densities mainly depends on its microstructure to express the overall microstructure characteristics of the samples more vividly the original sem images were transformed into 3d simulation images as presented in fig 12 a in the remolded sample with a dry density of 1 35 g cm3 evident pores were visible i e free water passages the 1 45 g cm3 and 1 55 g cm3 remolded samples had a denser structure with the increase in the dry density the pore area between the particles decreased significantly to further quantitatively analyze the pore distribution characteristics of loess the classification method proposed by lei 1987 was adopted in this study micropores diameter 2 μm small pores 2 μm diameter 8 μm mesopores 8 μm diameter 32 μm and macropores diameter 32 μm fig 12b shows the pore area distribution of the remolded loess with different dry densities the 1 35 g cm3 sample contains 13 01 of macropore area 13 64 of mesopore area 6 30 of small pore area and 1 83 of micropore area indicating that macropores and mesopores are the main types of pores as for the remolded loess samples with dry densities of 1 45 and 1 55 g cm3 the macropores disappear and the mesopore content evidently decreases meanwhile the small pores and micropores are the main pore types for the remolded loess sample with a dry density of 1 35 g cm3 macropores and mesopores are dominant and the pore space is rich this provides necessary conditions for the migration of fine particles xu et al 2021c in the process of increasing the hydraulic gradient the increase in the permeability force promotes the migration effect of particles the movement and accumulation of particles in the pore channels lead to a decrease in the water passing area which further hinders the movement of water in the soil meanwhile the particle skeleton structure of the sample is loose and its stability is poor making the structure prone to collapse when meeting with water burton et al 2015 xu et al 2021b furthermore macropores and mesopores have significant effects on the collapsibility and structural deformation of loess li et al 2016 fig 13 depicts the change pattern in the microstructure of the loess sample with this dry density after soaking because of the instability of the sample itself in the seepage process the original skeleton structure is not strong enough to support its own weight and the soil structure eventually collapses and deteriorates therefore with the increase in the hydraulic gradient ksat decreases significantly by 56 89 it can be considered that the increase in the hydraulic gradient accelerates the deterioration of the soil structure and the attenuation of the saturated hydraulic conductivity as the head pressure decreases ksat also shows a decreasing trend and the reduction is only 15 63 this is mainly because the damage degree of soil particles and pores is weakened in the decompression process and the internal and external loads of the soil gradually enter a rebalancing state ksat of the remolded loess samples with dry densities of 1 45 and 1 55 g cm3 increases first and then tends to be stable upon increasing the hydraulic gradient similar to the findings of this study other researchers have also observed that ksat is not constant but depends on the hydraulic gradient wang et al 2020 as mentioned above with the increase in the hydraulic gradient the migration effect of fine particles is enhanced under the drive of the seepage force however there is no foundation for particle migration without macropores in the soil that is the migration effect is weak or even negligible an et al 2013 xu et al 2021c from the analysis of the microelectric field effect when the hydraulic gradient is 2 the increase in ksat is mainly due to the change in the bound water film thickness as shown in fig 9 because the bound water in the electric double layer has a certain shear strength wang et al 2017 the increase in the hydraulic gradient causes the weakly bound water to flow gradually hence the effective cross section for free water movement increases song et al 2018 wang et al 2020 in addition when the hydraulic gradient is 2 ksat is almost constant this should be because all the bound water capable of flow is in a relatively stable state which leads to the maximum effective cross section furthermore with the decrease in the hydraulic gradient the content of weakly bound water increases and its thickness increases which reduces the effective pore space of the water flow song et al 2018 therefore the decrease in the hydraulic gradient leads to a decrease in ksat 4 3 mechanism of initial moisture content effect on ksat in this study when the dry density of remolded loess is constant the initial ksat decreases with the increase in the initial moisture content with the changes in order of magnitude such as 10e 6 10 e 5 cm s indicating that the initial moisture content has a significant influence on the permeability this phenomenon is mainly attributed to the change in the microstructure due to the state and property of the water in loess pores as shown in fig 14 the minimum moisture content of the remolded loess was designed to be 11 16 and the outline of the particles is clear and easily identifiable meanwhile the aggregation degree of the particles is low the aggregate size is small and the pore space is rich fig 14a therefore the initial permeability of the sample with the lowest moisture content is the highest with the increase in the water content the aggregation effect of water makes the particles to form larger aggregates and the clay particles clay minerals in the loess absorb water and expand compressing the pore space between the loess particles fig 14b thus the initial permeability shows a decreasing trend when the initial water content is greater than the optimal water content for example 22 16 the aggregate structure of the soil is unclear with the overall structure being in the state of flocculation and the porosity and connectivity are reduced fig 14c therefore the initial permeability is significantly reduced in order of magnitude in addition the variation trend in ksat of the remolded loess with the seepage time is inconsistent under different initial moisture contents fig 6a mainly because the initial moisture content affects the compaction effect of soil and then influences its microstructure fig 15 shows the evolution model of the microstructure of remolded loess with the increase in the water content for low water contents less than the optimal water content only firmly adsorbed bound water is formed on the particle surface due to the lack of water in the soil the expansibility of the clay particles and the cementation ability of clay minerals are weak therefore the particles are mainly in overhead contact and the stability of the structure is low fig 15a in the process of saturated seepage the expansion of clay minerals and the dissolution of cementitious materials in the loess lead to the destruction and collapse of the internal microstructure of loess and then blocking of the effective pore channels zou et al 2019 therefore the permeability decreases significantly with time at the optimum moisture content the water film on the surface of the soil particles becomes thicker which lubricates the agglomeration of the particles and makes their arrangement more compact meanwhile the pore channels become narrow forming a relatively stable structure as shown in fig 15b when the initial water content continues to increase and even exceeds the plastic limit the sample contains not only bound water but also free water and the clay particles fully expand which is conducive to the flocculation of the soil as a whole as shown in fig 14c and fig 15c in this case the seepage force can promote more weakly bound water to be transformed into free water wang et al 2020 and the leaching is conducive to pore development xu et al 2021c therefore the permeability of the remolded loess increases with the seepage time in summary the mechanism of initial water content affecting the saturated permeability of remolded loess can be summarized as follows with the increase of initial water content the water film between soil particles becomes thicker making it easier for soil particles to form larger agglomerates and smaller pores hong et al 2016 additionally the clay particles clay minerals in the loess absorb water and expand compressing the pore space thus the initial ksat decreases when the water content is lower than the optimal water content the structural stability is poor under the action of infiltration force the soil structure is highly susceptible to collapse and the large pores change into small pores xu et al 2021c therefore the ksat tends to decrease with time with increasing water content the soil has a stable structure the infiltration force is conducive to the transformation of weakly bound water into free water and the leaching promotes the connectivity and development of pore space wang et al 2020 xu et al 2021c therefore it can be inferred that the extention of pore space is the main factor for the increase of ksat with time 4 4 comparison of the permeability of soil according to this study the underlying mechanism responsible for changes in the saturated permeability of remolded loess subjected to temperature hydraulic gradient and initial moisture content was determined and summarized 1 temperature effect during the short period of time at the beginning of seepage the higher the temperature the stronger the permeability of remolded loess similar laws also exist in the study of other soils such as soft bangkok clay abuel naga et al 2006 compacted bentonite cho et al 1999 and boom clay delage et al 2011 the loess in this study belongs to clay type so the variation law of permeability of remodeled loess with time at different temperatures and its mechanism can be extended to the study of compacted clayey soil 2 hydraulic gradient effect loess is a low permeability soil and there is non darcy flow in the seepage process wang et al 2020 al taie et al 2014 and song et al 2018 also found non darcy phenomenon in the hydraulic gradient effect on clay permeability therefore the response of permeability of remolded loess with different dry densities to pressurization and decompression described in this study should be suitable for the study of seepage characteristics of other clayey soils 3 initial moisture content effect the relationship between initial moisture content and unsaturated permeability of soils have been deeply studied haeri et al 2012 yao et al 2021 however this study focuses on the influence mechanism of initial water content on the saturated permeability of remolded loess and shows that it is achieved by changing the soil structure and the thickness of the bound water film on the particles hong et al 2016 also obtained the similar findings on this aspect suggesting this is also universal in the permeability of other clayey soils 4 5 limitations permeability is an important physical property of loess which has close relationship with other engineering properties bagarello et al 2009 gao et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 xu et al 2021b ksat is an important parameter describing the permeability of soil and has been commonly investigated by researchers chen et al 2021b han et al 2020 wang et al 2020 xu et al 2022 among the factors affecting the ksat of remolded loess this study focuses on temperature hydraulic gradient and initial water content and is hopeful to provide a deeper understanding of the related issues of permeability change in remolded loess during the seepage process due to the wide distribution of loess plateau three loess zones have been identified in china namely the sandy silty and clayey loess zones gao et al 2021 the loess specimens used in this study were retrieved from jing yang area which is the clayey loess zone of the chinese loess plateau the findings of this study are more appropriately generalized to other clayey soils while lack sufficient justification for application in sandy and silty loess thus making the conclusions somewhat limited however this points out the direction for the future research of the regional variability of loess permeability in the chinese loess plateau 5 conclusions in this study a series of constant head permeability tests were designed under different temperatures hydraulic gradients and initial moisture contents to explore the characteristics of saturated permeability of remolded loess the main conclusions are as follows the temperature mainly changes the pore structure by affecting the fluid viscosity bound water film thickness and chemical leaching so as to influence the permeability of remolded loess because of the decrease in the fluid viscosity and the thinning of the bound water film the initial permeability increased with increasing temperature the leaching is conducive to pore development which is the main reason for the increase in ksat with the seepage time at 10 and 20 however the strong chemical interaction between water and soil destroys the soil stability at 30 resulting in the collapse of the soil structure and blocking of the pore channels therefore ksat decreases significantly with time due to the abundant macropores in the samples with a low dry density 1 35 g cm3 the increase in the hydraulic gradient promotes the migration effect of particles and accelerates the collapse of the soil structure therefore ksat decreases significantly as the hydraulic gradient decreases ksat shows a relatively slow decreasing trend which is mainly due to the gradual rebalancing of the internal and external loads for the remolded loess specimens with dry densities of 1 45 and 1 55 g cm3 the increase in the hydraulic gradient makes the weakly bound water to flow gradually thereby increasing the permeability and ksat is stable because the effective flow cross section reaches maximum when the hydraulic gradient is 2 however ksat decreases with decreasing hydraulic gradient which is due to the reduction in the effective pore space of water flow with the increase in the water content the aggregation effect of water makes the particles to form larger aggregates and the clay particles clay minerals in the loess absorb water and expand compressing the pore space between the loess particles thus the initial ksat decreases when the dry density of the remolded loess is constant when the water content is lower than the optimal water content the structural stability is poor therefore ksat decreases during the seepage process with increasing water content the lubrication effect makes the particles to arrange more closely and form a relatively stable structure the effective pore space is expanded by the seepage force and leaching and ksat increases with time the research results provide a new insight into the response model and mechanism of saturated permeability change of remolded loess to temperature hydraulic gradient and initial water content however it should be noted that the response of permeability change of undisturbed loess to these factors for safe construction in loess areas needs to be further verified in future work credit authorship contribution statement panpan xu conceptualization funding acquisition writing original draft
