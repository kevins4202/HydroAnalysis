6850,net primary production npp is one of the most important components in the carbon cycle of terrestrial ecosystems climatic and hydrologic elements are among the primary factors controlling the dynamics of npp at global and regional scales thus understanding the interactions between them is of great importance for optimal ecosystem management this study aimed to investigate the spatiotemporal change in npp and its responses to both climatic and hydrologic factors in a semiarid watershed the upper reach of the wei river basin uwrb on the loess plateau china to this end an integrated hydro biogeochemical model swat daycent was applied to examine npp during the period 1987 2016 the results show that the swat daycent performed well in simulating both the hydrologic and the biogeochemical components in this typical loess watershed though the basin average npp increased slightly during the recent 30 years 1987 2016 the spatial distribution varied significantly in the region with a relatively higher level in the southeastern and western parts and a lower level in the northern part the strongly positive responses of major vegetations to precipitation indicate that precipitation was the dominant factor driving the ecosystem production whereas warming may exert negative effects especially in the southeastern part of the uwrb further the strongly positive relationships between npp and soil water et also suggest that the ecosystem production relied heavily on the water availability indicating a tightly coupled water carbon cycle in this region overall our findings are of great importance for identifying the key driving forces of the ecosystem production and the interaction between water and carbon cycles the study may also aid policymakers in seeking better eco environmental management when facing the climate change on the loess plateau keywords biogeochemical modeling hydrological modeling net primary production swat daycent water carbon cycle 1 introduction net primary production npp the net gain in biomass by vegetation through photosynthesis is a fundamental ecological variable in the carbon cycle of terrestrial ecosystem because it reflects not only the production capability of vegetation but also the condition of a wide range of ecological processes gao et al 2013 li et al 2014 wu et al 2014a spatiotemporal changes in npp are controlled by complex factors such as climate land use change and hydrologic variability gao et al 2013 pei et al 2015 xu et al 2017 among these influencing factors the climatic and hydrologic changes are two prominent and interacting ones mccluney et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 changes in climatic factors particularly changes in precipitation and increasing air temperature control the terrestrial carbon cycle mainly by regulating plant physiological processes liu et al 2015 fu et al 2017 hydrologic variability affects the terrestrial ecosystem production primarily through controlling the water availability because water is an important driver for biological processes such as species reordering community assembly and biogeochemical cycling noy meir 1973 in water limited regions water is the most dominant limiting resource for ecosystems because of its decisive effects on dynamics of plants and thus the hydrologic cycle has a profound influence on the terrestrial ecosystem production lohse et al 2009 reyer et al 2013 therefore it is critical to investigate the dynamics of npp and its dependence on climatic and hydrologic factors to achieve sustainable ecosystem management at global and regional scales investigating the npp change and its controlling factors is however not an easy task although npp can be calculated based on some measurable variables such as tree breadth biomass and grain yield such in situ measurements and subsequent calculations are limited to small scale e g plot scale or field scale and time consuming lauenroth et al 2006 remote sensing based approaches can estimate npp variations and spatial patterns but it can hardly analyze complicated ecosystem processes and underlying internal control mechanisms and thus cannot quantify the responses of the npp to various environmental factors zhang and ren 2017 ecosystem models are important tools that can be used to compute npp and associated control mechanisms at site regional or global scales gao et al 2013 gu et al 2017 wang et al 2017b popular models such as carnegie ames stanford approach casa potter et al 1993 century parton et al 1994 and biogeochemical cycle bgc running and coughlan 1988 usually have been applied to analyze the climatic controls on npp gao et al 2013 li et al 2014 liu et al 2015 wang et al 2017b as we understand the npp cannot be decided by a single factor other terms such as the hydrologic cycles would play an important role in controlling the spatiotemporal patterns of npp which has not been investigated due to model deficiencies in handling both biogeochemical and hydrologic processes gramig et al 2013 based on soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 wu et al 2016 developed an integrated hydro biogeochemical model by embedding the daycent model into swat swat daycent the model can simultaneously simulate hydrologic and biogeochemical cycles at the watershed scale and thus can overcome the defects of traditional hydrologic biogeochemical models that focused on either water or carbon cycle thus it could be encouraging to investigate the water and carbon cycles and their interactions using swat daycent actually our motivation was to investigate the spatiotemporal change in npp and its responses to both climatic and hydrologic factors in a semi arid loess watershed the wei river basin on the chinese loess plateau the wei river basin located in the south of the loess plateau region is a typical watershed that is characterized by loess hills and gullies and severe soil erosion wang et al 2017a to restore the ecological environment and prevent soil from erosion the chinese government has implemented a series of engineering measures including forestation planting of grass and terraces at a large scale since the 1980s zuo et al 2014 wang et al 2017a as expected these measures have significantly increased the vegetation cover and reduced the soil erosion but the eco environment in most areas of the basin is still vulnerable due to the loosened land surface and changing environments particularly the newly planted vegetations would consume more water compared to the original ones which may complicate the relationships between the water and carbon cycles and exacerbate conflicting demands for water between plants and humans in such semi arid area feng et al 2016 so far it has been acknowledged that the implemented ecological restoration measures changed the regional carbon cycle and its interactions with the environmental factors sun et al 2014 zhang et al 2016a in addition although there is convincing evidence as to the impacts of climate change there still exist large uncertainties e g increasing temperature change in precipitation and extreme climate events which can exert uncertain influences on the terrestrial carbon cycle in this sense it is necessary to investigate the carbon cycle and its responses to the controlling factors to enhance the understanding of the water carbon interactions in this ecologically vulnerable region especially in the context of climate change the overall goal of this study was to investigate the spatiotemporal distribution of npp and its responses to climatic and hydrologic factors precipitation air temperature soil water and et in the upper reach of the wei river basin uwrb using swat daycent the specific objectives were to 1 examine the applicability of the swat daycent model in simulating the water and carbon dynamics in the uwrb 2 investigate the spatiotemporal variations of the npp and climatic and hydrologic components 3 explore the responses of npp to both climatic and hydrologic variability on annual scale of all hydrologic response units hrus that are defined by swat over the 30 year study period 1987 2016 the outcomes could contribute to both the applicability of swat daycent and the understanding of interactions between water and carbon in such semi arid loess watershed 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the wei river is the largest tributary of the yellow river and originates in the niaoshu mountain and flows through gansu and shaanxi provinces with a length of 818 km in this study we focused on the uwrb i e the region above the linjiacun gaging station 104 e 107 e 34 2 n 36 2 n 30 540 km2 fig 1 the uwrb lies in the continental monsoon climate zoon with relatively more precipitation and high temperature in summer and less precipitation and low temperature in winter the annual precipitation ranges from 500 to 800 mm and the annual mean temperature ranges between 7 8 and 13 5 c liu et al 2012 zhao et al 2016 topographically the altitude decreases from the highest northwestern mountain areas to the lowest southeastern plain areas 2 2 land use and soil types the land use and soil types were obtained from the ecological and environmental science data center for west china http westdc westgis ac cn with a resolution of 30 m 30 m and 1 km 1 km respectively and the details are shown in fig 2 the land use types were divided into 7 types and a further 10 subtypes the seven types mainly include forest grassland cropland shrubland residential area water and bare land as shown in fig 2 the forest type includes forest mixed frst forest deciduous frsd and forest evergreen frse the grassland includes pasture past and range grasses rnge the cropland means agricultural land agrr shrubland means the range brush rngb the residential area means urbn water means water bodies watr and the bare land is barr cropland is the major land use type accounting for 66 and continuous wheat or maize and corn wheat rotation are the most common cropping systems in the region as seen from fig 2 there are 27 groups of soil types and the cambisols is the dominant one accounting for 50 of the area 2 3 swat daycent coupler to achieve a comprehensive evaluation of environmental issues wu et al 2016 developed a model coupling tool swat daycent for simultaneous hydro biogeochemical modeling using swat soil and water assessment tool arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2011 and daycent parton et al 1998 the swat model developed by the u s department of agriculture usda agricultural research service ars is a watershed scale continuous distributed hydrologic model for predicting the impacts of climate and land management practices on hydrologic and water quality at the watershed scale arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2011 this physically based model has been increasingly applied to study the impacts of environmental change on hydrologic cycle in many large watersheds including those with limited observations arnold et al 2000 neitsch et al 2011 panagopoulos et al 2015 daycent is the daily time version of century a biogeochemical model that simulates major processes associated with flows and cycling of carbon c nitrogen n phosphorus p and sulfur s among the atmosphere vegetation and soil pools at the site scale parton et al 1998 del grosso et al 2006 daycent has been proven to be capable of simulating the carbon dynamics with a high accuracy del grosso et al 2006 in the coupling of swat and daycent the swat was set as the basic framework and the daycent was embedded into swat with some new functions whose aim is to take each hru as a single site and write daycent required input files to drive daycent automatically the hru is generated in the swat running process and its configuration is required for the daycent simulation each hru has the unique soil and land cover type and can be used as a specific site in daycent daycent then obtains the specific variables in hru to simulate the carbon cycle across all hrus through a loop in the coupling simulation processes the hydrologic cycle is simulated by swat and the biogeochemical cycle is mainly dependent on daycent see table 2 major outputs of swat daycent include the hydrologic components e g surface runoff baseflow et soil water and water yield and the biogeochemical components e g npp soil organic carbon soc biomass grain yield and soil respiration further details about swat daycent can be found in wu et al 2016 2 4 model input and setup besides the land use 30 m 30 m and soil type 1 km 1 km data the swat model also requires inputs on weather and topography data arnold et al 2000 the daily meteorological data were collected from the data center of china meteorological administration http data cma cn covering the study period during 1987 to 2016 consisting of precipitation maximum minimum air temperature relative humidity and wind speed the solar radiation was derived based on the sunshine duration the digital elevation model dem was from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm with a 90 m resolution jarvis et al 2006 the land use and soil data were obtained from the ecological and environmental science data center for west china http westdc westgis ac cn the geographic information system gis interface arcswat version 2012 was used to delineate the watershed resulting in 95 sub basins and 2605 hrus the monthly streamflow data of linjiacun hydrologic station see fig 1 obtained from the hydrological yearbooks of yellow river were used to calibrate validate the swat model the remotely sensed npp data were used for the daycent calibration validation we collected the npp data from two sources one was the modis net primary production yearly l4 global 1 km products modis17a3 https lpdaac usgs gov the other was from the resources and environment science data center of the chinese academy of sciences resdc http www resdc cn considering the complexity of the ecosystems and the data reliability we compared these two data products with previous literature feng et al 2013 peng et al 2015 zhang et al 2016a wei et al 2017 including the specific npp value in each land cover type we found that the cropland npp produced by modis was acceptable for our study region and that the grassland npp and forest npp produced by resdc were also relatively reasonable therefore we combined these two datasets for the daycent verification 2 5 model calibration and validation both swat and daycent contain parameters that need to be determined for a specific region through comparison with the observed data for swat based on previous publications wu et al 2012 wang et al 2017a yan et al 2017 zhao et al 2018b and our own experience we selected eight parameters that are sensitive to runoff simulation we implemented the calibration and validation by using the daily and monthly observed streamflow from 1973 to 1993 the calibrated parameters are listed in table 1 for daycent based on the literature review wu et al 2014b wu et al 2014c rafiqu et al 2015 qiu et al 2017 and our own modeling experience we selected the most sensitive parameter prdx we used the model r coupler wu et al 2014d to derive the optimal parameter value by comparing the simulated npp with the remotely sensed npp that were available for 11 years 2000 2010 and the optimized prdx parameter for forest crop and grass is 8 6 0 42 and 0 48 g c m 2 month 1 langley 1 respectively the model performance was mainly evaluated in terms of the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 r2 percentage bias pb and root mean square error rmse a brief description of these measures is presented in appendix a 2 6 trend and correlation analyses we used the least square method to obtain the linear fitting lines and trends in npp at the hru level the equation for calculation of slope is presented in appendix b the t test was applied to determine the significant levels p 0 05 of the trends in npp to analyze the relationships of npp with soil water and et we employed the simple linear regression model and calculated the pearson correlation coefficients at the hru level over the study period of 30 years to establish the relationships of npp with precipitation and temperature the partial correlation analysis was used to detect whether one climatic element i e precipitation temperature affects npp variability independent of the other i e temperature precipitation the equations for calculation of these are presented in appendix c 3 results 3 1 model examination fig 3 shows the scatterplots and the evaluation measures for both the daily and monthly streamflow simulation in the 8 year calibration and the 12 year validation period for the daily simulation the model performed well in the calibration period 1973 1980 with nse r2 and pb values of 0 64 0 64 and 1 8 respectively in the 12 year 1981 1993 validation period the model performance was satisfactory though the criteria with nse r2 and pb values of 0 52 0 58 and 2 9 were not as good as those in calibration for the monthly simulation the simulated streamflow matched well with the observations from fig 3c and fig 3d and according to moriasi et al 2007 who reported that the model performance should be very good when nse 0 75 and pb 10 and good when nse 0 65 and pb 10 the model performance can be rated as very good in calibration and good in validation for the monthly simulation overall the swat model performance was acceptable for simulating the hydrological processes in the uwrb fig 4 shows the scatterplots of the annual npp simulations for the period 2000 2010 for the three major land cover types i e forest cropland and grassland as well as the total ecosystem the statistical evaluation measures also presented in fig 4 illustrate that the pb were less than 2 r2 ranged from 0 36 to 0 63 and the rmse varied from 19 1 to 41 8 g c m2 yr considering all the above four cases i e three land cover types and the total ecosystem indicating the daycent simulated npp with very small bias and high precision therefore the daycent can also be applicable in the uwrb 3 2 inter annual variations of npp and controlling factors fig 5 shows the inter annual variations of npp and its four controlling factors considered in this study i e precipitation air temperature et and soil water for the period 1987 2016 the mean annual npp was 311 g c m2 yr with a range from 213 g c m2 yr in 1997 to 352 g c m2 yr in 2012 see fig 5a although the npp changed sometimes significantly between years during the 30 year period it showed only a slightly increasing trend at a rate of 0 69 g c m2 yr which was not statistically significant the annual air temperature showed a significant rising trend of 0 04 c yr p 0 001 with an average of 9 1 c and a range of 8 1 10 3 c the overall trend of the precipitation was relatively stable especially when compared with the air temperature though the fluctuation was obvious among years fig 5a particularly we can see that the trends of npp generally matched the temporal variation of precipitation the et showed a very slight tendency during the whole study period with the highest value 560 mm in 1990 and the lowest value 336 mm in 1997 across the whole study period fig 5b the soil water content increased slightly over the whole study period with some significant changes during 2002 2004 an increase of 97 mm from 2002 to 2003 followed by a reduction of 72 mm from 2003 to 2004 3 3 spatial pattern and changing trend of npp fig 6 shows the distributions of the average annual npp and its changing trend in uwrb during the period 1987 2016 overall the npp exhibited large spatial variability with a gradually decreasing trend moving from the south to the north across the region specifically higher npp was found in the western and southeastern parts of the region whereas lower npp was in the northern and northeastern parts fig 6a the areas where the npp had a significant increasing trend were mainly distributed in the central north and some parts of the northwestern and southeastern areas while the decrease in npp was mainly distributed in the central south and northeastern portion fig 6b among the major land cover types the increases in npp were larger in cropland and grassland fig 6c accounting for as high as 92 of the areas contributing to an increased npp in contrast the forest had a relatively larger area 65 of decreased npp fig 6c 3 4 response of npp to climatic factors the spatiotemporal partial correlation coefficients of npp with the two climatic factors precipitation and air temperature calculated for each hru from 1987 to 2016 are shown in fig 7 spatially the correlation coefficients between npp and precipitation were all positive with a significant level p 0 05 fig 7a fig 7b indicates that the partial correlations between npp and precipitation among hrus were also generally positive with the value being larger than 0 4 for most areas suggesting strong control from precipitation on the regional npp dynamics the average value of the coefficient was positive in all the three major land cover types see the inserted boxplot in fig 7b as seen from fig 7c there existed negative and insignificant relationships between npp and temperature in space indicating higher temperature may generate adverse effects on plant production in some areas of this region in addition there was also a relatively larger variation of the partial correlation between npp and air temperature fig 7d the negative correlations were mainly found in the southeastern part and some areas of the northeastern and far northwestern region while the positive correlation was mainly found in the southwestern part and central to northern part the average value of the coefficient was positive in the forest whereas the values for cropland and grassland were negative see the boxplot in fig 7d this indicates that warming may exert negative effects on the npp of the local ecosystems especially in the southeastern part of the basin 3 5 response of npp to hydrologic factors fig 8 shows the linear relationships of npp with soil water and et for the three major land cover types over the period 1987 2016 together with the distribution of pearson correlation coefficients between them at the hru level as seen the npp in grassland and cropland were significantly positive with the soil water p 0 05 while the forest showed no significant relationship with soil water fig 8a as can be seen from fig 8b most areas of this region showed positive correlation between npp and soil water indicating that the ecosystem production relied heavily on the soil water the annual npp was also positively correlated with the annual et for the three major land covers p 0 001 fig 8c from fig 8d it can be seen that the northeastern and western parts had stronger positive correlations between npp and et compared with that in the other parts the strong relationship between npp and et suggests that the water and carbon cycles in this region were tightly coupled 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainty in swat daycent simulations uncertainty in model simulations which is mainly caused by the limitations of model parameters and algorithms is a major challenge in analyzing modeling results in our study the swat model performed well in both simulating the daily and monthly streamflow with nse ranging from 0 52 to 0 78 and r2 ranging from 0 58 to 0 81 however the model also overestimated some peak flows not shown and the possible reasons may be the coarse resolution of rainfall and or the limitations of the model in catching the hydrologic response to high intensity of rainfall zhou et al 2011 besides the observed streamflow was the only variable used to calibrate and validate the swat model in our study which may also lead to uncertainties in other output elements no matter how well a model is calibrated using one specific variable the other model outputs such as et soil water and water yield might have a certain bias due to the lack of accurate identification of the key parameters related to their simulation calibrating the swat model using multiple variables e g et soil water and lateral flow can be an effective way to reduce the uncertainty as more variables related to water balance such as the remote sensing et and remote sensing soil moisture have been becoming available the multi variable calibration would be an important step towards reducing the uncertainty in swat and other land surface models in the future research another source leading to uncertainty in swat simulations is the size of the target region basin qiao et al 2015 reported that the swat model performed much better in a relatively small watershed than that in a larger one because the meteorological data could not accurately represent the spatial heterogeneity in the chosen parameters over large basins while the area of uwrb considered in our study exceeds 30 000 km2 only eight meteorological stations were available this may have contributed to bias in streamflow simulation it is important to recognize that compared with hydrologic modeling it is more difficult to simulate npp on the one hand as a site scale model the simulation of daycent should be better in the spot simulation when compared to the one that scales up for large areas and long time scale due to the spatial heterogeneity of data on the other hand although the remote sensing techniques can reflect the features of the npp at regional scale it can also predict npp with bias due to multiple influencing factors e g meteorological conditions topography sensors zhao et al 2005 zhao et al 2006 moreover the npp measurement in reality is also difficult because it is hard to partition the respiration of ecosystems into autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration gao et al 2013 in our study we combined two remote sensing npp products and the comparison between the simulated and remotely sensed npp indeed indicated that the daycent simulation was acceptable 4 2 spatiotemporal change of npp the npp showed obvious spatial variability with higher npp in the southeastern and western parts but lower npp in the northern part across the uwrb region fig 6a this distribution is consistent with the vegetation cover as well as the rainfall distribution for example the cropland and productive forest were densely distributed in the southeastern and western areas leading to higher npp in those regions from fig 6a b the areas with higher npp tended to decrease over the study period while the areas with lower npp showed an increasing tendency this phenomenon may suggest that the carbon uptake in this region tended to be balanced spatially our analysis of the 30 year simulation revealed an overall increasing rate of 0 69 g c m2 yr in the uwrb fig 5a however this estimated increasing rate is less than the estimated increasing rate 9 4 g c m2 yr over the whole loess plateau region from 2000 to 2008 feng et al 2013 this discrepancy can be mainly explained by the difference in study period and area our results were also consistent with the finding by a number of studies su and fu 2013 wang et al 2013 liu et al 2015 that the terrestrial vegetation npp of the loess plateau region has increased during the past several decades suggesting the potential carbon gain in this region 4 3 climatic and hydrologic controls on npp in most areas of the uwrb region the npp displayed a positive correlation with precipitation fig 7a suggesting that the precipitation is the dominant factor driving the vegetation growth in this region the loess plateau region is becoming warmer and drier xin et al 2010 since precipitation is the only water supply for the rain fed ecosystems of the region the vegetation growth depends heavily on the precipitation however the areas where npp was positively correlated with temperature accounted for only 44 of the whole basin traditionally high temperature can stimulate the vegetation growth however the temperature control on npp is mainly distributed in the humid and semi humid region where the water availability is not a limiting factor for vegetation growth liang et al 2015 high temperature and combined rainfall deficit can reduce plant production to some extent ciais et al 2005 huang et al 2017 especially in the water deficient regions interestingly the air temperature increased significantly p 0 001 together with a slight increase in npp while more than fifty percent of the area negatively correlated with the temperature fig 7b this indicates that the positive effect of precipitation offset at least partly the negative effect of temperature demonstrating the key role of precipitation in the ecosystem production of this region we also found that npp in the three major land cover types was positively correlated with soil water and et which is also supported by other reports french et al 2009 lima et al 2013 chen et al 2016 tang et al 2016 zhao et al 2018a soil water is a crucial factor determining the production because higher soil moisture content will lead to higher photosynthesis through controlling the stomatal morphology and thus higher production liu et al 2013 the strong correlation between npp and soil water suggested that the carbon gain depends heavily on the water availability in this region however the soil in the loess plateau is drying due to the widespread overplanting zhang et al 2018 suggesting that the vegetation production might be suppressed under the drier condition this phenomenon may alert the managers to make more efficient measures when implementing the revegetation to maintain a sustainable ecohydrological environment in this region the plant growth rate and transpiration are usually tightly related to each other vicente serrano et al 2015 barkaoui et al 2017 and higher et usually reflects higher plant transpiration indicating stronger plant canopies and thus higher plant production the strong correlation between npp and et demonstrated that carbon and water cycles were tightly linked in this region and thus the magnitude of et can reflect the ecosystem healthy condition in fact the slope of the relationship between npp and et can also be an indicator for evaluating water use efficiency and ecosystem services in a certain ecosystem in addition the strong positive relationship between et and npp implied that higher et corresponded to a higher carbon uptake of npp which may help estimate npp using et 4 4 comparison of the current and globe wide studies in order to frame the study findings in a broader context we compared our results with the globe wide relationships between npp and the climatic hydrologic components table 3 our results are well within the findings obtained with mechanism models and observations at different sites worldwide in the arid semi arid regions the central asia and inner mongolia steppe grasses the npp exhibits significant positive relationship with precipitation but a moderate significant negative relationship with air temperature wang et al 2014 zhang and ren 2017 our study area uwrb is semi arid region and we not surprisingly found that the npp showed significant positive correlation with precipitation and almost no relationship with air temperature thus in this sense our study findings further strengthen the evidence that the vegetation production would be more sensitive to precipitation in such water limited regions hsu et al 2012 differently in high elevation and cold regions the three river source region trsr and tibetan plateau the npp showed a relatively stronger positive relationship with air temperature compared to precipitation gao et al 2013 zhang et al 2016b high air temperature in the cold regions may accelerate the permafrost melt and lead to increment in soil water content indirectly this then contributes to the vegetation growth to some extent gao et al 2013 because the soil water content plays a key role in determining the vegetation growth especially in the arid semi arid region liu et al 2013 cleverly et al 2016 and our study finding also fits rather well for this phenomenon the model simulation in situ measurement and flux observation at different sites worldwide also demonstrate that the et and npp are positively correlated indicating the tightly coupled relationship between water and carbon cycles scott et al 2014 wang et al 2014 xiao et al 2014 scott et al 2015 in this study we also found that the carbon and water cycles were closely coupled in the semi arid loess region using our newly developed swat daycent model and the correlation coefficient between npp and et is somewhat larger than those in north america this phenomenon may imply that the semi arid loess region could use more water for sequestrating a given amount of carbon compared to others overall these study results have important implications in terms of predictability of the vegetation growth and water loss in the semi arid loess region nonetheless we admitted that the model simulation should be applied to broader ranges and more varied climate conditions to verify these findings 5 implications climatic and hydrologic variability are among the primary controlling factors for terrestrial ecosystem production therefore accurate prediction of their impacts on npp would be valuable for decision making related to vegetation growth food production and the overall ecosystem management this study indicates that the modeling approach such as the one attempted here based on swat daycent coupler can help quantify responses of ecosystem production to climatic and hydrologic variability at the regional scale although we recognize that uncertainties do exist in the modeling results our spatial maps of the climatic controls can help policy makers identify the dominant climatic factor s over the local ecosystem production and develop appropriate adaptive strategies the strong dependence of npp on the water availability may also alert the watershed managers for such water controlled basins to take more precautions for coping with the upcoming challenges of water resources scarcity on the other hand the climate warming which is characterized by the increase in global mean temperature has been regarded as an undoubted fact and could further exert adverse effects on the vegetation growth in this sense the watershed managers should also be aware of the impacts induced by climate warming including droughts through a scientific utilization and allocation of the water resource for example we suggest that the managers make more effective strategies such as conservation tillage and improvement in irrigation system of the cropland reasonable planning of cultivating season scientific regulation of forest planting density and reduction in the grazing intensity of the grassland to improve the water use efficiency in such regions our modeling study also provided a proper perspective for investigating the main controlling environmental factors of the ecosystem production using a coupled model this is certainly informative and valuable for people who are interested in the modeling research related to water and carbon cycles and their coupling process for instance the swat daycent coupler employed in our study can allow the users to simulate the hydrologic e g streamflow and biogeochemical processes e g npp simultaneously and automatically this can greatly facilitate the investigation of the water and carbon dynamics and their complex interactions therefore it could be particularly beneficial to pay far more attention to approaches that involve coupling of models especially when dealing with broader environmental issues and comprehensive assessments towards ensuring the sustainability of ecology hydrology economy and society in addition to the factors considered in the present study the ecosystem production is also influenced by human intervention such as the land use land cover change we will examine the effects of anthropogenic influences in the future 6 limitations it is essential to point out that only two representative climatic factors precipitation and air temperature and two hydrological factors et and soil water were considered when investigating the control factors of npp it is true that other factors such as management practices and irrigated water supplies may also play important roles in the ecosystem production besides the partial correlation analyses between npp and the control factors were examined using a linear method while the natural systems are quite complex and the responses may be nonlinear thus multi factorial analysis such as principal component analysis pca might be a good method for future study 7 conclusions in this study we employed the swat daycent model to investigate the spatiotemporal change in npp and its responses to climatic precipitation and temperature and hydrologic soil water and evapotranspiration factors the swat daycent was proved to be an efficient tool for simulating the water and carbon cycles in the uwrb region from 1987 to 2016 the regional npp increased slightly but with no statistically significant trend spatially the npp exhibited a substantial variability over the region with high npp in the southeastern and western parts and low npp in the northern part of the region the correlation analysis showed that the precipitation was the main factor driving the ecosystem production and the average precipitation increase would have positive effects on npp however the results also showed that higher temperature might exert negative effects on the production especially in the southeastern part of the region furthermore the npp was positively correlated with the soil water and et indicating that the carbon gain relied heavily on the water availability and that the carbon and water cycles were tightly coupled in the loess region overall the present study and the outcomes are useful for effective prediction of the response of terrestrial ecosystem carbon to the future climatic and hydrologic variability the findings can also be helpful for making decisions related to ecosystem managements in such basins on the loess plateau and even beyond declaration of interest statement the authors declare that they have no

model performance compared to observations the following popular criteria were used in this study i percentage bias pb it measures the average tendency of the simulated values to be larger or smaller than the observed ones and is given by a 1 pb 1 n i 1 n q i s i m q i o b s q i o b s 100 where q i o b s and q i s i m are the observed and the simulated data respectively and n is the total number of data the optimal value of pb is 0 0 with low magnitude values indicating accurate model simulation while positive or negative values indicate over prediction or under prediction of bias respectively ii nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 it describes the explained variance for the observed values over time that is accounted for by the model it is given by a 2 nse 1 i 1 n q i s i m q i o b s 2 i 1 n q i o b s q obs 2 the nse ranges from a negative value to 1 and essentially the closer to 1 the more accurate the model is iii correlation coefficient r2 it describes

6850,net primary production npp is one of the most important components in the carbon cycle of terrestrial ecosystems climatic and hydrologic elements are among the primary factors controlling the dynamics of npp at global and regional scales thus understanding the interactions between them is of great importance for optimal ecosystem management this study aimed to investigate the spatiotemporal change in npp and its responses to both climatic and hydrologic factors in a semiarid watershed the upper reach of the wei river basin uwrb on the loess plateau china to this end an integrated hydro biogeochemical model swat daycent was applied to examine npp during the period 1987 2016 the results show that the swat daycent performed well in simulating both the hydrologic and the biogeochemical components in this typical loess watershed though the basin average npp increased slightly during the recent 30 years 1987 2016 the spatial distribution varied significantly in the region with a relatively higher level in the southeastern and western parts and a lower level in the northern part the strongly positive responses of major vegetations to precipitation indicate that precipitation was the dominant factor driving the ecosystem production whereas warming may exert negative effects especially in the southeastern part of the uwrb further the strongly positive relationships between npp and soil water et also suggest that the ecosystem production relied heavily on the water availability indicating a tightly coupled water carbon cycle in this region overall our findings are of great importance for identifying the key driving forces of the ecosystem production and the interaction between water and carbon cycles the study may also aid policymakers in seeking better eco environmental management when facing the climate change on the loess plateau keywords biogeochemical modeling hydrological modeling net primary production swat daycent water carbon cycle 1 introduction net primary production npp the net gain in biomass by vegetation through photosynthesis is a fundamental ecological variable in the carbon cycle of terrestrial ecosystem because it reflects not only the production capability of vegetation but also the condition of a wide range of ecological processes gao et al 2013 li et al 2014 wu et al 2014a spatiotemporal changes in npp are controlled by complex factors such as climate land use change and hydrologic variability gao et al 2013 pei et al 2015 xu et al 2017 among these influencing factors the climatic and hydrologic changes are two prominent and interacting ones mccluney et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 changes in climatic factors particularly changes in precipitation and increasing air temperature control the terrestrial carbon cycle mainly by regulating plant physiological processes liu et al 2015 fu et al 2017 hydrologic variability affects the terrestrial ecosystem production primarily through controlling the water availability because water is an important driver for biological processes such as species reordering community assembly and biogeochemical cycling noy meir 1973 in water limited regions water is the most dominant limiting resource for ecosystems because of its decisive effects on dynamics of plants and thus the hydrologic cycle has a profound influence on the terrestrial ecosystem production lohse et al 2009 reyer et al 2013 therefore it is critical to investigate the dynamics of npp and its dependence on climatic and hydrologic factors to achieve sustainable ecosystem management at global and regional scales investigating the npp change and its controlling factors is however not an easy task although npp can be calculated based on some measurable variables such as tree breadth biomass and grain yield such in situ measurements and subsequent calculations are limited to small scale e g plot scale or field scale and time consuming lauenroth et al 2006 remote sensing based approaches can estimate npp variations and spatial patterns but it can hardly analyze complicated ecosystem processes and underlying internal control mechanisms and thus cannot quantify the responses of the npp to various environmental factors zhang and ren 2017 ecosystem models are important tools that can be used to compute npp and associated control mechanisms at site regional or global scales gao et al 2013 gu et al 2017 wang et al 2017b popular models such as carnegie ames stanford approach casa potter et al 1993 century parton et al 1994 and biogeochemical cycle bgc running and coughlan 1988 usually have been applied to analyze the climatic controls on npp gao et al 2013 li et al 2014 liu et al 2015 wang et al 2017b as we understand the npp cannot be decided by a single factor other terms such as the hydrologic cycles would play an important role in controlling the spatiotemporal patterns of npp which has not been investigated due to model deficiencies in handling both biogeochemical and hydrologic processes gramig et al 2013 based on soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 wu et al 2016 developed an integrated hydro biogeochemical model by embedding the daycent model into swat swat daycent the model can simultaneously simulate hydrologic and biogeochemical cycles at the watershed scale and thus can overcome the defects of traditional hydrologic biogeochemical models that focused on either water or carbon cycle thus it could be encouraging to investigate the water and carbon cycles and their interactions using swat daycent actually our motivation was to investigate the spatiotemporal change in npp and its responses to both climatic and hydrologic factors in a semi arid loess watershed the wei river basin on the chinese loess plateau the wei river basin located in the south of the loess plateau region is a typical watershed that is characterized by loess hills and gullies and severe soil erosion wang et al 2017a to restore the ecological environment and prevent soil from erosion the chinese government has implemented a series of engineering measures including forestation planting of grass and terraces at a large scale since the 1980s zuo et al 2014 wang et al 2017a as expected these measures have significantly increased the vegetation cover and reduced the soil erosion but the eco environment in most areas of the basin is still vulnerable due to the loosened land surface and changing environments particularly the newly planted vegetations would consume more water compared to the original ones which may complicate the relationships between the water and carbon cycles and exacerbate conflicting demands for water between plants and humans in such semi arid area feng et al 2016 so far it has been acknowledged that the implemented ecological restoration measures changed the regional carbon cycle and its interactions with the environmental factors sun et al 2014 zhang et al 2016a in addition although there is convincing evidence as to the impacts of climate change there still exist large uncertainties e g increasing temperature change in precipitation and extreme climate events which can exert uncertain influences on the terrestrial carbon cycle in this sense it is necessary to investigate the carbon cycle and its responses to the controlling factors to enhance the understanding of the water carbon interactions in this ecologically vulnerable region especially in the context of climate change the overall goal of this study was to investigate the spatiotemporal distribution of npp and its responses to climatic and hydrologic factors precipitation air temperature soil water and et in the upper reach of the wei river basin uwrb using swat daycent the specific objectives were to 1 examine the applicability of the swat daycent model in simulating the water and carbon dynamics in the uwrb 2 investigate the spatiotemporal variations of the npp and climatic and hydrologic components 3 explore the responses of npp to both climatic and hydrologic variability on annual scale of all hydrologic response units hrus that are defined by swat over the 30 year study period 1987 2016 the outcomes could contribute to both the applicability of swat daycent and the understanding of interactions between water and carbon in such semi arid loess watershed 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the wei river is the largest tributary of the yellow river and originates in the niaoshu mountain and flows through gansu and shaanxi provinces with a length of 818 km in this study we focused on the uwrb i e the region above the linjiacun gaging station 104 e 107 e 34 2 n 36 2 n 30 540 km2 fig 1 the uwrb lies in the continental monsoon climate zoon with relatively more precipitation and high temperature in summer and less precipitation and low temperature in winter the annual precipitation ranges from 500 to 800 mm and the annual mean temperature ranges between 7 8 and 13 5 c liu et al 2012 zhao et al 2016 topographically the altitude decreases from the highest northwestern mountain areas to the lowest southeastern plain areas 2 2 land use and soil types the land use and soil types were obtained from the ecological and environmental science data center for west china http westdc westgis ac cn with a resolution of 30 m 30 m and 1 km 1 km respectively and the details are shown in fig 2 the land use types were divided into 7 types and a further 10 subtypes the seven types mainly include forest grassland cropland shrubland residential area water and bare land as shown in fig 2 the forest type includes forest mixed frst forest deciduous frsd and forest evergreen frse the grassland includes pasture past and range grasses rnge the cropland means agricultural land agrr shrubland means the range brush rngb the residential area means urbn water means water bodies watr and the bare land is barr cropland is the major land use type accounting for 66 and continuous wheat or maize and corn wheat rotation are the most common cropping systems in the region as seen from fig 2 there are 27 groups of soil types and the cambisols is the dominant one accounting for 50 of the area 2 3 swat daycent coupler to achieve a comprehensive evaluation of environmental issues wu et al 2016 developed a model coupling tool swat daycent for simultaneous hydro biogeochemical modeling using swat soil and water assessment tool arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2011 and daycent parton et al 1998 the swat model developed by the u s department of agriculture usda agricultural research service ars is a watershed scale continuous distributed hydrologic model for predicting the impacts of climate and land management practices on hydrologic and water quality at the watershed scale arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2011 this physically based model has been increasingly applied to study the impacts of environmental change on hydrologic cycle in many large watersheds including those with limited observations arnold et al 2000 neitsch et al 2011 panagopoulos et al 2015 daycent is the daily time version of century a biogeochemical model that simulates major processes associated with flows and cycling of carbon c nitrogen n phosphorus p and sulfur s among the atmosphere vegetation and soil pools at the site scale parton et al 1998 del grosso et al 2006 daycent has been proven to be capable of simulating the carbon dynamics with a high accuracy del grosso et al 2006 in the coupling of swat and daycent the swat was set as the basic framework and the daycent was embedded into swat with some new functions whose aim is to take each hru as a single site and write daycent required input files to drive daycent automatically the hru is generated in the swat running process and its configuration is required for the daycent simulation each hru has the unique soil and land cover type and can be used as a specific site in daycent daycent then obtains the specific variables in hru to simulate the carbon cycle across all hrus through a loop in the coupling simulation processes the hydrologic cycle is simulated by swat and the biogeochemical cycle is mainly dependent on daycent see table 2 major outputs of swat daycent include the hydrologic components e g surface runoff baseflow et soil water and water yield and the biogeochemical components e g npp soil organic carbon soc biomass grain yield and soil respiration further details about swat daycent can be found in wu et al 2016 2 4 model input and setup besides the land use 30 m 30 m and soil type 1 km 1 km data the swat model also requires inputs on weather and topography data arnold et al 2000 the daily meteorological data were collected from the data center of china meteorological administration http data cma cn covering the study period during 1987 to 2016 consisting of precipitation maximum minimum air temperature relative humidity and wind speed the solar radiation was derived based on the sunshine duration the digital elevation model dem was from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm with a 90 m resolution jarvis et al 2006 the land use and soil data were obtained from the ecological and environmental science data center for west china http westdc westgis ac cn the geographic information system gis interface arcswat version 2012 was used to delineate the watershed resulting in 95 sub basins and 2605 hrus the monthly streamflow data of linjiacun hydrologic station see fig 1 obtained from the hydrological yearbooks of yellow river were used to calibrate validate the swat model the remotely sensed npp data were used for the daycent calibration validation we collected the npp data from two sources one was the modis net primary production yearly l4 global 1 km products modis17a3 https lpdaac usgs gov the other was from the resources and environment science data center of the chinese academy of sciences resdc http www resdc cn considering the complexity of the ecosystems and the data reliability we compared these two data products with previous literature feng et al 2013 peng et al 2015 zhang et al 2016a wei et al 2017 including the specific npp value in each land cover type we found that the cropland npp produced by modis was acceptable for our study region and that the grassland npp and forest npp produced by resdc were also relatively reasonable therefore we combined these two datasets for the daycent verification 2 5 model calibration and validation both swat and daycent contain parameters that need to be determined for a specific region through comparison with the observed data for swat based on previous publications wu et al 2012 wang et al 2017a yan et al 2017 zhao et al 2018b and our own experience we selected eight parameters that are sensitive to runoff simulation we implemented the calibration and validation by using the daily and monthly observed streamflow from 1973 to 1993 the calibrated parameters are listed in table 1 for daycent based on the literature review wu et al 2014b wu et al 2014c rafiqu et al 2015 qiu et al 2017 and our own modeling experience we selected the most sensitive parameter prdx we used the model r coupler wu et al 2014d to derive the optimal parameter value by comparing the simulated npp with the remotely sensed npp that were available for 11 years 2000 2010 and the optimized prdx parameter for forest crop and grass is 8 6 0 42 and 0 48 g c m 2 month 1 langley 1 respectively the model performance was mainly evaluated in terms of the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 r2 percentage bias pb and root mean square error rmse a brief description of these measures is presented in appendix a 2 6 trend and correlation analyses we used the least square method to obtain the linear fitting lines and trends in npp at the hru level the equation for calculation of slope is presented in appendix b the t test was applied to determine the significant levels p 0 05 of the trends in npp to analyze the relationships of npp with soil water and et we employed the simple linear regression model and calculated the pearson correlation coefficients at the hru level over the study period of 30 years to establish the relationships of npp with precipitation and temperature the partial correlation analysis was used to detect whether one climatic element i e precipitation temperature affects npp variability independent of the other i e temperature precipitation the equations for calculation of these are presented in appendix c 3 results 3 1 model examination fig 3 shows the scatterplots and the evaluation measures for both the daily and monthly streamflow simulation in the 8 year calibration and the 12 year validation period for the daily simulation the model performed well in the calibration period 1973 1980 with nse r2 and pb values of 0 64 0 64 and 1 8 respectively in the 12 year 1981 1993 validation period the model performance was satisfactory though the criteria with nse r2 and pb values of 0 52 0 58 and 2 9 were not as good as those in calibration for the monthly simulation the simulated streamflow matched well with the observations from fig 3c and fig 3d and according to moriasi et al 2007 who reported that the model performance should be very good when nse 0 75 and pb 10 and good when nse 0 65 and pb 10 the model performance can be rated as very good in calibration and good in validation for the monthly simulation overall the swat model performance was acceptable for simulating the hydrological processes in the uwrb fig 4 shows the scatterplots of the annual npp simulations for the period 2000 2010 for the three major land cover types i e forest cropland and grassland as well as the total ecosystem the statistical evaluation measures also presented in fig 4 illustrate that the pb were less than 2 r2 ranged from 0 36 to 0 63 and the rmse varied from 19 1 to 41 8 g c m2 yr considering all the above four cases i e three land cover types and the total ecosystem indicating the daycent simulated npp with very small bias and high precision therefore the daycent can also be applicable in the uwrb 3 2 inter annual variations of npp and controlling factors fig 5 shows the inter annual variations of npp and its four controlling factors considered in this study i e precipitation air temperature et and soil water for the period 1987 2016 the mean annual npp was 311 g c m2 yr with a range from 213 g c m2 yr in 1997 to 352 g c m2 yr in 2012 see fig 5a although the npp changed sometimes significantly between years during the 30 year period it showed only a slightly increasing trend at a rate of 0 69 g c m2 yr which was not statistically significant the annual air temperature showed a significant rising trend of 0 04 c yr p 0 001 with an average of 9 1 c and a range of 8 1 10 3 c the overall trend of the precipitation was relatively stable especially when compared with the air temperature though the fluctuation was obvious among years fig 5a particularly we can see that the trends of npp generally matched the temporal variation of precipitation the et showed a very slight tendency during the whole study period with the highest value 560 mm in 1990 and the lowest value 336 mm in 1997 across the whole study period fig 5b the soil water content increased slightly over the whole study period with some significant changes during 2002 2004 an increase of 97 mm from 2002 to 2003 followed by a reduction of 72 mm from 2003 to 2004 3 3 spatial pattern and changing trend of npp fig 6 shows the distributions of the average annual npp and its changing trend in uwrb during the period 1987 2016 overall the npp exhibited large spatial variability with a gradually decreasing trend moving from the south to the north across the region specifically higher npp was found in the western and southeastern parts of the region whereas lower npp was in the northern and northeastern parts fig 6a the areas where the npp had a significant increasing trend were mainly distributed in the central north and some parts of the northwestern and southeastern areas while the decrease in npp was mainly distributed in the central south and northeastern portion fig 6b among the major land cover types the increases in npp were larger in cropland and grassland fig 6c accounting for as high as 92 of the areas contributing to an increased npp in contrast the forest had a relatively larger area 65 of decreased npp fig 6c 3 4 response of npp to climatic factors the spatiotemporal partial correlation coefficients of npp with the two climatic factors precipitation and air temperature calculated for each hru from 1987 to 2016 are shown in fig 7 spatially the correlation coefficients between npp and precipitation were all positive with a significant level p 0 05 fig 7a fig 7b indicates that the partial correlations between npp and precipitation among hrus were also generally positive with the value being larger than 0 4 for most areas suggesting strong control from precipitation on the regional npp dynamics the average value of the coefficient was positive in all the three major land cover types see the inserted boxplot in fig 7b as seen from fig 7c there existed negative and insignificant relationships between npp and temperature in space indicating higher temperature may generate adverse effects on plant production in some areas of this region in addition there was also a relatively larger variation of the partial correlation between npp and air temperature fig 7d the negative correlations were mainly found in the southeastern part and some areas of the northeastern and far northwestern region while the positive correlation was mainly found in the southwestern part and central to northern part the average value of the coefficient was positive in the forest whereas the values for cropland and grassland were negative see the boxplot in fig 7d this indicates that warming may exert negative effects on the npp of the local ecosystems especially in the southeastern part of the basin 3 5 response of npp to hydrologic factors fig 8 shows the linear relationships of npp with soil water and et for the three major land cover types over the period 1987 2016 together with the distribution of pearson correlation coefficients between them at the hru level as seen the npp in grassland and cropland were significantly positive with the soil water p 0 05 while the forest showed no significant relationship with soil water fig 8a as can be seen from fig 8b most areas of this region showed positive correlation between npp and soil water indicating that the ecosystem production relied heavily on the soil water the annual npp was also positively correlated with the annual et for the three major land covers p 0 001 fig 8c from fig 8d it can be seen that the northeastern and western parts had stronger positive correlations between npp and et compared with that in the other parts the strong relationship between npp and et suggests that the water and carbon cycles in this region were tightly coupled 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainty in swat daycent simulations uncertainty in model simulations which is mainly caused by the limitations of model parameters and algorithms is a major challenge in analyzing modeling results in our study the swat model performed well in both simulating the daily and monthly streamflow with nse ranging from 0 52 to 0 78 and r2 ranging from 0 58 to 0 81 however the model also overestimated some peak flows not shown and the possible reasons may be the coarse resolution of rainfall and or the limitations of the model in catching the hydrologic response to high intensity of rainfall zhou et al 2011 besides the observed streamflow was the only variable used to calibrate and validate the swat model in our study which may also lead to uncertainties in other output elements no matter how well a model is calibrated using one specific variable the other model outputs such as et soil water and water yield might have a certain bias due to the lack of accurate identification of the key parameters related to their simulation calibrating the swat model using multiple variables e g et soil water and lateral flow can be an effective way to reduce the uncertainty as more variables related to water balance such as the remote sensing et and remote sensing soil moisture have been becoming available the multi variable calibration would be an important step towards reducing the uncertainty in swat and other land surface models in the future research another source leading to uncertainty in swat simulations is the size of the target region basin qiao et al 2015 reported that the swat model performed much better in a relatively small watershed than that in a larger one because the meteorological data could not accurately represent the spatial heterogeneity in the chosen parameters over large basins while the area of uwrb considered in our study exceeds 30 000 km2 only eight meteorological stations were available this may have contributed to bias in streamflow simulation it is important to recognize that compared with hydrologic modeling it is more difficult to simulate npp on the one hand as a site scale model the simulation of daycent should be better in the spot simulation when compared to the one that scales up for large areas and long time scale due to the spatial heterogeneity of data on the other hand although the remote sensing techniques can reflect the features of the npp at regional scale it can also predict npp with bias due to multiple influencing factors e g meteorological conditions topography sensors zhao et al 2005 zhao et al 2006 moreover the npp measurement in reality is also difficult because it is hard to partition the respiration of ecosystems into autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration gao et al 2013 in our study we combined two remote sensing npp products and the comparison between the simulated and remotely sensed npp indeed indicated that the daycent simulation was acceptable 4 2 spatiotemporal change of npp the npp showed obvious spatial variability with higher npp in the southeastern and western parts but lower npp in the northern part across the uwrb region fig 6a this distribution is consistent with the vegetation cover as well as the rainfall distribution for example the cropland and productive forest were densely distributed in the southeastern and western areas leading to higher npp in those regions from fig 6a b the areas with higher npp tended to decrease over the study period while the areas with lower npp showed an increasing tendency this phenomenon may suggest that the carbon uptake in this region tended to be balanced spatially our analysis of the 30 year simulation revealed an overall increasing rate of 0 69 g c m2 yr in the uwrb fig 5a however this estimated increasing rate is less than the estimated increasing rate 9 4 g c m2 yr over the whole loess plateau region from 2000 to 2008 feng et al 2013 this discrepancy can be mainly explained by the difference in study period and area our results were also consistent with the finding by a number of studies su and fu 2013 wang et al 2013 liu et al 2015 that the terrestrial vegetation npp of the loess plateau region has increased during the past several decades suggesting the potential carbon gain in this region 4 3 climatic and hydrologic controls on npp in most areas of the uwrb region the npp displayed a positive correlation with precipitation fig 7a suggesting that the precipitation is the dominant factor driving the vegetation growth in this region the loess plateau region is becoming warmer and drier xin et al 2010 since precipitation is the only water supply for the rain fed ecosystems of the region the vegetation growth depends heavily on the precipitation however the areas where npp was positively correlated with temperature accounted for only 44 of the whole basin traditionally high temperature can stimulate the vegetation growth however the temperature control on npp is mainly distributed in the humid and semi humid region where the water availability is not a limiting factor for vegetation growth liang et al 2015 high temperature and combined rainfall deficit can reduce plant production to some extent ciais et al 2005 huang et al 2017 especially in the water deficient regions interestingly the air temperature increased significantly p 0 001 together with a slight increase in npp while more than fifty percent of the area negatively correlated with the temperature fig 7b this indicates that the positive effect of precipitation offset at least partly the negative effect of temperature demonstrating the key role of precipitation in the ecosystem production of this region we also found that npp in the three major land cover types was positively correlated with soil water and et which is also supported by other reports french et al 2009 lima et al 2013 chen et al 2016 tang et al 2016 zhao et al 2018a soil water is a crucial factor determining the production because higher soil moisture content will lead to higher photosynthesis through controlling the stomatal morphology and thus higher production liu et al 2013 the strong correlation between npp and soil water suggested that the carbon gain depends heavily on the water availability in this region however the soil in the loess plateau is drying due to the widespread overplanting zhang et al 2018 suggesting that the vegetation production might be suppressed under the drier condition this phenomenon may alert the managers to make more efficient measures when implementing the revegetation to maintain a sustainable ecohydrological environment in this region the plant growth rate and transpiration are usually tightly related to each other vicente serrano et al 2015 barkaoui et al 2017 and higher et usually reflects higher plant transpiration indicating stronger plant canopies and thus higher plant production the strong correlation between npp and et demonstrated that carbon and water cycles were tightly linked in this region and thus the magnitude of et can reflect the ecosystem healthy condition in fact the slope of the relationship between npp and et can also be an indicator for evaluating water use efficiency and ecosystem services in a certain ecosystem in addition the strong positive relationship between et and npp implied that higher et corresponded to a higher carbon uptake of npp which may help estimate npp using et 4 4 comparison of the current and globe wide studies in order to frame the study findings in a broader context we compared our results with the globe wide relationships between npp and the climatic hydrologic components table 3 our results are well within the findings obtained with mechanism models and observations at different sites worldwide in the arid semi arid regions the central asia and inner mongolia steppe grasses the npp exhibits significant positive relationship with precipitation but a moderate significant negative relationship with air temperature wang et al 2014 zhang and ren 2017 our study area uwrb is semi arid region and we not surprisingly found that the npp showed significant positive correlation with precipitation and almost no relationship with air temperature thus in this sense our study findings further strengthen the evidence that the vegetation production would be more sensitive to precipitation in such water limited regions hsu et al 2012 differently in high elevation and cold regions the three river source region trsr and tibetan plateau the npp showed a relatively stronger positive relationship with air temperature compared to precipitation gao et al 2013 zhang et al 2016b high air temperature in the cold regions may accelerate the permafrost melt and lead to increment in soil water content indirectly this then contributes to the vegetation growth to some extent gao et al 2013 because the soil water content plays a key role in determining the vegetation growth especially in the arid semi arid region liu et al 2013 cleverly et al 2016 and our study finding also fits rather well for this phenomenon the model simulation in situ measurement and flux observation at different sites worldwide also demonstrate that the et and npp are positively correlated indicating the tightly coupled relationship between water and carbon cycles scott et al 2014 wang et al 2014 xiao et al 2014 scott et al 2015 in this study we also found that the carbon and water cycles were closely coupled in the semi arid loess region using our newly developed swat daycent model and the correlation coefficient between npp and et is somewhat larger than those in north america this phenomenon may imply that the semi arid loess region could use more water for sequestrating a given amount of carbon compared to others overall these study results have important implications in terms of predictability of the vegetation growth and water loss in the semi arid loess region nonetheless we admitted that the model simulation should be applied to broader ranges and more varied climate conditions to verify these findings 5 implications climatic and hydrologic variability are among the primary controlling factors for terrestrial ecosystem production therefore accurate prediction of their impacts on npp would be valuable for decision making related to vegetation growth food production and the overall ecosystem management this study indicates that the modeling approach such as the one attempted here based on swat daycent coupler can help quantify responses of ecosystem production to climatic and hydrologic variability at the regional scale although we recognize that uncertainties do exist in the modeling results our spatial maps of the climatic controls can help policy makers identify the dominant climatic factor s over the local ecosystem production and develop appropriate adaptive strategies the strong dependence of npp on the water availability may also alert the watershed managers for such water controlled basins to take more precautions for coping with the upcoming challenges of water resources scarcity on the other hand the climate warming which is characterized by the increase in global mean temperature has been regarded as an undoubted fact and could further exert adverse effects on the vegetation growth in this sense the watershed managers should also be aware of the impacts induced by climate warming including droughts through a scientific utilization and allocation of the water resource for example we suggest that the managers make more effective strategies such as conservation tillage and improvement in irrigation system of the cropland reasonable planning of cultivating season scientific regulation of forest planting density and reduction in the grazing intensity of the grassland to improve the water use efficiency in such regions our modeling study also provided a proper perspective for investigating the main controlling environmental factors of the ecosystem production using a coupled model this is certainly informative and valuable for people who are interested in the modeling research related to water and carbon cycles and their coupling process for instance the swat daycent coupler employed in our study can allow the users to simulate the hydrologic e g streamflow and biogeochemical processes e g npp simultaneously and automatically this can greatly facilitate the investigation of the water and carbon dynamics and their complex interactions therefore it could be particularly beneficial to pay far more attention to approaches that involve coupling of models especially when dealing with broader environmental issues and comprehensive assessments towards ensuring the sustainability of ecology hydrology economy and society in addition to the factors considered in the present study the ecosystem production is also influenced by human intervention such as the land use land cover change we will examine the effects of anthropogenic influences in the future 6 limitations it is essential to point out that only two representative climatic factors precipitation and air temperature and two hydrological factors et and soil water were considered when investigating the control factors of npp it is true that other factors such as management practices and irrigated water supplies may also play important roles in the ecosystem production besides the partial correlation analyses between npp and the control factors were examined using a linear method while the natural systems are quite complex and the responses may be nonlinear thus multi factorial analysis such as principal component analysis pca might be a good method for future study 7 conclusions in this study we employed the swat daycent model to investigate the spatiotemporal change in npp and its responses to climatic precipitation and temperature and hydrologic soil water and evapotranspiration factors the swat daycent was proved to be an efficient tool for simulating the water and carbon cycles in the uwrb region from 1987 to 2016 the regional npp increased slightly but with no statistically significant trend spatially the npp exhibited a substantial variability over the region with high npp in the southeastern and western parts and low npp in the northern part of the region the correlation analysis showed that the precipitation was the main factor driving the ecosystem production and the average precipitation increase would have positive effects on npp however the results also showed that higher temperature might exert negative effects on the production especially in the southeastern part of the region furthermore the npp was positively correlated with the soil water and et indicating that the carbon gain relied heavily on the water availability and that the carbon and water cycles were tightly coupled in the loess region overall the present study and the outcomes are useful for effective prediction of the response of terrestrial ecosystem carbon to the future climatic and hydrologic variability the findings can also be helpful for making decisions related to ecosystem managements in such basins on the loess plateau and even beyond declaration of interest statement the authors declare that they have no

model performance compared to observations the following popular criteria were used in this study i percentage bias pb it measures the average tendency of the simulated values to be larger or smaller than the observed ones and is given by a 1 pb 1 n i 1 n q i s i m q i o b s q i o b s 100 where q i o b s and q i s i m are the observed and the simulated data respectively and n is the total number of data the optimal value of pb is 0 0 with low magnitude values indicating accurate model simulation while positive or negative values indicate over prediction or under prediction of bias respectively ii nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 it describes the explained variance for the observed values over time that is accounted for by the model it is given by a 2 nse 1 i 1 n q i s i m q i o b s 2 i 1 n q i o b s q obs 2 the nse ranges from a negative value to 1 and essentially the closer to 1 the more accurate the model is iii correlation coefficient r2 it describes the proportion of the variance in the measured data explained by the model or the linear relationship between the simulated and observed values it is given by a 3 r 2 i 1 n q i o b s q obs q i s i m q

simulated highly accurately whereas an r2 value nearer to 0 0 means that the model simulated very poorly iv root mean square error rmse it measures the degree of deviation between measurements and model simulations a 4 r m s e i 1 n q i s i m q i o b s 2 n the rmse varies from the optimal value to a large positive value the lower the rmse the better the model performance b trend analysis for

6851,for both physical and economic reasons water scarcity has become a worldwide concern to meet regional water demands and improve water resource optimization management a multi objective water resource allocation model was developed for a sustainable future in which equity efficiency and sustainability were taken as the allocation principles to equitably maximize subarea economic and social welfare and coordinate social development and water management without compromising water ecosystem sustainability to meet the water resource needs of both present and future generations intra and intergenerational equities were integrated using a gini coefficient and a modified bentham rawls criterion to allow for time and space social equity trade offs for sustainable water allocation to coordinate social development and water management for water sustainability mean economic benefit efficiency was considered in the multi objective water resource allocation model by factoring in the competition between present and future generations the ecological water requirements and the fuzzy random water resource parameters the optimal strategy better depicts a pattern of water inter temporal configuration than current strategies a case study from the upper reaches of the minjiang river basin in china is given to demonstrate the practicality and rationality of the proposed model compared with previous models the intergenerational allocation model was found to effectively consider sustainable water resource utilization had a higher total social welfare value and guaranteed equitable intra generational water allocation based on the results and discussion some management recommendations for water resource allocation strategies integrated intergenerational equity and policy support are given keywords intergenerational equity intra generational equity social welfare sustainability water allocation 1 introduction as populations increase and economies grow fresh water availability has become a serious problem in some areas leading to potential conflicts between water users therefore water resource allocation strategies can have a significant impact on economic development social stability and aquatic ecosystems eliasson 2015 larsen et al 2016 huang et al 2016 liu and yang 2012 in the past few decades in an effort to ensure equity efficiency and sustainable water use water resource allocation research has attracted increased research attention efficient water allocation can balance supply and demand and ensure an equitable share between the needs of the domestic industrial agricultural and ecological water sectors divakar et al 2011 daubert and young 1981 proposed a contingent valuation approach to estimate the marginal economic value of efficient water allocation and griffin 2006 examined the economic problems associated with estimating aggregate economic efficiency from water resource allocations that maximized the sum of the agent net benefits as an equitable access to water resources is closely related to social stability several qualitative and indirect methods have been developed to assess water allocation equality cai 2008 hu and eheart 2013 patrick et al 2014 after cullis and koppen 2007 determined that the gini coefficient was a viable quantitative approach for measuring water allocation inequalities it has been widely used to determine equitable sustainable water allocations gunasekara et al 2014 hu et al 2016 xu et al 2017 because available fresh water sources are being rapidly depleted there has been an increased research focus on sustainable water resource developments for example sun et al 2017 and xi and poh 2013 demonstrated the usefulness of system dynamics as a decision support tool to achieve sustainable water management zhang et al 2017 developed a hierarchical water cycle health evaluation system based on nature society water cycle theory for optimal water allocation and xue et al 2015 highlighted the importance of developing system based tools and metrics to holistically evaluate water service systems based on integrated resource management concepts generally these methods have proved effective in providing sustainable water resource allocation however most of these studies only viewed water resource allocation from an intra generational perspective how to deal with water competition in present and future generations is still a barrier to deploying the sustainable water allocation methods as far as the time dimension is concerned sustainable water use needs to consider the needs of both present and future generations bithas 2008 it is vital that intergenerational equity considerations be included in water allocation decision making so that the present generation s water risk judgments include a consideration of the possible outcomes for their children syme et al 2006 syme and nancarrow 2006 syme and nancarrow 2013 intergenerational equity theory which is implicit in international commitments to sustainability embodies fairness for the future generations weiss 1989 therefore attitudinal water resource management research has included strong support for intergenerational equity for example syme et al 2006 developed a perceptions model based on intergenerational issues and environmental policy compliance that considered the use and contamination of natural resources such as the allocation and reallocation of water syme 2014 later exemplified intergenerational water planning issues in the current water allocation problems in the murray darling basin australia gleeson et al 2012 examined groundwater sustainability as a value driven process for intra and intergenerational equity that balanced the environment society and the economy while it is evident that all water use by the present generation has an impact on the potential water availability for future generations to date no definitive criterion has been developed to resolve the water access competition between present and future generations economic theory characterizes sustainability using sustainability criteria krautkraemer 1998 which had been proposed to avoid the drawbacks of the usual discounted utility criterion chichilnisky 1996 chichilnisky 1996 proposed the notion of sustainable preferences that were sensitive to the welfare of all generations and which required intergenerational equity with neither the present nor the future being favored alvarez cuadrado and van long 2009 further refined this and proposed a modified bentham rawls criterion with the payoff of the generation which is worst off for global warming and climate change being the most critical intergenerational equity issues tol 2013 investigated the implications of the bentham rawls criterion on climate policy unfortunately while water resource management plays a significant role in ensuring sustainable development for future generations the sustainability criteria required for intergenerational equity has not yet been integrated into water allocation issues therefore as insufficient water supplies and increasing water demands intensify water resource utilization competition and conflicts within and between current and future generations this paper develops an intergenerational equity theory based water allocation optimization model that integrates equity efficiency and sustainability to meet the water resource needs of both the present and future generations the intra and intergenerational equities are integrated using a gini coefficient and a modified bentham rawls criterion to allow for time and space social equity trade offs for sustainable water allocation mean economic benefit efficiency is also considered in the multi objective water resource allocation model to coordinate social development and water management with ecological water requirements being the constraint to guarantee environmental sustainability further as water resource changes resulting from climate change and social development are uncertain fuzzy random variables are employed to deal with the uncertain parameters this paper contributes to the literature in the following ways first based on intergenerational equity theory precepts the bentham rawls criterion is incorporated into the water allocation strategy to ensure sustainable utilization second intra and intergenerational equities are integrated to meet sustainable water resource needs both time and space dimensions finally a water allocation optimization model is proposed that can guarantee efficiency equality and sustainability and achieve reasonable comprehensive solutions for each water use area the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the problem and study motivation the mathematical model is formulated in section 3 section 4 gives a numerical example from the upper reaches of minjiang river to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods and gives some management recommendations and section 5 concludes the paper 2 key problem statement the key water sustainability priorities are the provision of safe drinking water wastewater handling for public health and reasonable water distribution however as rapidly aging infrastructure population growth and global warming all call into question current water management strategies there is an urgent research need to develop policy and practice alternatives for water and aquatic ecosystem sustainability with intergenerational equity as the main driver this paper focuses on an optimal water allocation strategy that ensures sustainable development for future generations a flowchart of the proposed methodology is shown in fig 1 after which some key problems are introduced 2 1 integrating intra and intergenerational equity requirements social equity is an integral part of sustainable development and has two intra and intergenerational time and space dimensions kverndokk et al 2014 intragenerational equity is focused on the equitable distribution of resources either within the current generation or within future generations kverndokk and rose 2008 while intragenerational equity is also important most equity debates on renewable resources have been focused on intergenerational issues vojnovic 1995 holden et al 2014 intergenerational equity implies that the present generation must meet its current needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs although these future needs are not known it is unlikely that they can be met without access to natural resources holden et al 2014 intragenerational equity is fundamental to many environmental concerns this is especially true for water as it is a common pool multiple use unidirectional resource therefore intragenerational water equity is central to any water resource allocation decisions lele 2017 in this paper the gini coefficient is used as an intragenerational equity indicator holden et al 2014 the gini coefficient is a popular inequality measure gini 1921 and has therefore been widely used to measure water resource allocation inequalities lopes et al 2015 nishi et al 2015 to assess intragenerational water allocation equity the relative mean difference the mean difference between every possible pair of subarea water consumption for one unit of economic benefits divided by the mean size of water consumption for one unit of economic benefits in all subareas is used to estimate the water allocation gini coefficient fig 1 a intergenerational equity is implicit in international commitments to sustainability if ecological economic and social sustainability is to be achieved it is necessary for intergenerational equity considerations to be included in water resource allocation decision making syme et al 1999 2006 from contributions by chichilnisky 1996 and alvarez cuadrado and van long 2009 a new social welfare criterion as an indicator of intergenerational equity is proposed to balance the development needs and concerns of the least advantaged generations this criterion permits some degree of trade off in the inter temporal water allocation maximizes the social welfare function to achieve a sustainable water resource allocation path in addition the utility function in this criterion only depends on the total water consumption allocated to each subarea each year the optimal growth program for inter temporal water allocations under the weighted average of a two term welfare criterion to ensure intergenerational equity is shown in fig 1 c to guarantee optimal water resource allocations between the current and future generations in this paper intra and intergenerational equity are integrated to ensure sustainable water management however as intra and intergenerational equity conflicts associated with water resource use and associated services may arise in the design and implementation of sustainability policies this study also analyzes the sustainable water resource development trade offs required in the inter temporal water allocations between the two social equity dimensions and the various intra and intergenerational equity policy preferences 2 2 optimal water allocation to coordinate conflicting objectives to respond to the threats that water shortages bring to human health economic activities and future generations water resource allocations must be appropriate and at the right time to ensure sustainability the economic theory of scarce resource allocation states that water resource allocations must achieve economic efficiency social equity and environmental sustainability bithas 2008 scientific and efficient water allocations based on economic efficiency assist in balancing the water resource demand and supply divakar et al 2011 fig 1 b diagrammatically shows the conditions necessary for efficient water allocation economic efficiency is the ratio of total economic value sum of the products of the allocated water and the subareas economic returns to the maximum achievable total economic value product of total available water and maximum net economic return in a subarea from the considered subareas although the efficiency and sustainability objectives in the use of natural resources differ substantially and in some cases are even in competition bromley 1990 bithas 2008 proposed that efficient water use was a necessary instrument for the sustainable use of water and an instrument for promoting social equity in the long run therefore increasing the water sustainable utilization is vital for system operators from the objectives of economic efficiency and social equity multi objective methods have been proven to be effective in solving the trade offs between different objectives for instance hu et al 2016 proposed a multi objective model that involved water allocation equality and economic efficiency risk control to solve economic inefficiency risks while considering extreme weather uncertainties yao et al 2017 proposed a novel combined cooling heating and power based compressed air energy storage system and then used a multi objective method to optimize the trade off between the thermodynamic and economic objectives encouraged by these successful studies a multi objective method that highlights the necessary trade offs and potential complementarities between equity efficiency and sustainability and promotes coordinated water development and management to maximize equitable social welfare is developed to ensure sustainable water use that meets the social economic and environmental objectives 2 3 adaptation strategies for achieving a sustainable path when viewing environmental policy problems through the sustainability lens several attributes need to be considered such as pervasive risk and uncertainty and a lack of or poor quality information dovers 1996 natural river runoff changes for example are influenced by global climate change and increased human activities brown et al 2010 plummer et al 2010 the manner and extent to which water is exploited contributes to climate change and the systems that provide water are also highly vulnerable to climate changes howells et al 2013 stevens and bony 2013 there are also significant social influences affecting water quality and flow which have caused water shortages water pollution and ecological degradation in many countries and regions and particularly in densely populated areas elłas maxil et al 2014 liu and yang 2012 therefore river flow and water allocation need to be viewed as a decision making system with significant uncertainty in each node and across the overall system due to the random features of a water body syme 2014 some previous studies have considered water flow in a fuzzy random environment and fuzzy random variable can be judged using three different scenarios low level medium level and high level with corresponding probability distributions for example xu et al 2013 applied fuzzy random variables to express the water demand and stream flow uncertainties for many meteorological and hydrological factors such as rainfall changes temperature increases and other uncertain features xu et al 2015 applied fuzzy random variables to express the uncertainties in various water quality management system components encouraged by these successful applications fuzzy random variables are used in this paper to deal with the probabilistic and discrete interval uncertainties in the water resource allocation problem therefore based on sustainability insights and to respond to environmental changes this paper presents several scenarios and adaptation strategies to support sustainable water resource use based on sustainable preferences that are sensitive to the welfare of all generations through intergenerational equity chichilnisky 1996 beltratti et al 1998 3 modeling before constructing the mathematical model in this paper some fundamental assumptions are given 1 all available water for distribution is provided by a single river basin 2 the minimal volume of available water that should be allocated to each subarea the minimal ecological water requirement in the river basin and the maximal and minimal water withdrawal values in each subarea are all known 3 the available water the water transfer loss ratio from river basin to subarea and the other water resources in the subareas in every year are considered to be fuzzy random variables with the attributes determined using historical statistical data and professional experience 4 water pollution is not considered as the available water is assumed to be of good quality 3 1 notations index i subarea i i 1 2 n t every year

decision variables q ti water from the river allocated to subarea i in year t 3 2 multi objective optimization for water allocation taking the minimum and normal demand for water into consideration the river basin authorities need to optimally allocate water to each subarea by maximizing the economic benefit and intra and intergenerational equity to guarantee sustainable water use to find the optimal water allocation path a multiple overall planning process for a total of t years is considered as the water allocated by the river basin authorities is stored in the respective subarea reservoirs the amount allocated each year may be different details for the achievement of these objectives are discussed in the following 3 2 1 maximization of mean economic benefit efficiency the economic benefits of domestic sector water use can be established using a demand function diaz and brown 1997 griffin 2006 divakar et al 2011 and booker and young 1994 divakar et al 2011 applied a residual imputation of a linear programming model to compute the net economic return from the irrigation water in the agricultural sector to efficiently obtain the net economic benefits for the different water users the mean economic efficiency for total t is described as the annual average ratio of the entire economic benefit the sum of the multiplication of each subarea s average economic benefits and used water to the maximal achievable economic benefit the multiplication of the maximal average economic benefits in a subarea and the available water let α ti loss be the water transfer loss ratio from the river basin to subarea i in year t and ws ti be the other water resources in subarea i in year t due to varying conditions such as weather technology and other objective factors the parameters α ti loss and ws ti cannot be exactly valued therefore in this paper the expected value operator method is used to deal with this situation using trapezoidal fuzzy sets e α ti loss and e ws ti with three levels low medium and high and their corresponding probability distributions xu and zhou 2011 to determine the net economic benefits for the different water users the mean annual economic benefit per unit of water consumed in each year is used 1 eb ti 1 e α ti loss q ti aeb ti 1 e α ti loss q ti t i therefore the economic efficiency in t years is described as a ratio the sum of the multiplication of each subarea s average economic benefits and used water to the multiplication of the maximal average economic benefits of a subarea and the available water as follows 2 ebe t i 1 n aeb ti 1 e α ti loss q ti i 1 n aeb tmax 1 e α ti loss q ti e ws ti where aeb tmax is the economic benefit of a subarea with a maximum average value in year t the aim is to realize mean economic benefit efficiency maximization in t years which can be expressed as 3 maxebe 1 t t 1 t i 1 n aeb ti q ti i 1 n aeb tmax 1 e α ti loss q ti e ws ti 3 2 2 cumulative intragenerational equity maximization as equitable water allocation can ensure stable development in all subareas river basin authorities need to include equity as part of the water allocation process the gini coefficient has been effectively applied to measure resource allocation inequality lopes et al 2015 nishi et al 2015 the relative mean difference the mean difference between every possible pair of subarea water consumption for one unit of economic benefits divided by the mean size of the water consumption for one unit of economic benefit for all subareas is used to estimate the water allocation gini coefficient to measure water allocation equity that is water allocation equity is measured by the equitable sharing of the used water quantity for each unit of economic benefits with the initial definition being as follows cullis and koppen 2007 gini 1921 4 gini 1 2 n 2 y i 1 n j 1 n y i y j where n is the number of individuals and the gini coefficient is defined as the mean difference between every possible pair of individuals y i y j divided by the mean size y accordingly if the y axis shows the cumulative share of the total water and the x axis shows the cumulative share of the economic benefits the gini coefficient effectively measures the water allocation equity that is minimizing the gini coefficient indicates water equity allocation maximization in this paper to consider water allocation equity within t years the cumulative equity maximization is 5 min gini 1 t t 1 t 1 2 n i 1 n q ti eb ti l 1 n s 1 n q tl eb tl q ts eb ts 3 2 3 maximization of the social welfare function for sustainability based on the work of chichilnisky 1996 a welfare criterion is proposed that balances the need for development and concern for the least advantaged generations alvarez cuadrado and van long 2009 while this criterion moderates the discounting effect some degree of inter temporal trade off is permitted the weighted average of a the sum of the discounted utilities and b the utility level of the least advantaged generation let c t denote the consumption vector allocated to the representative individual from generation t assume that the utility function depends only on the total consumption allocated to each generation that is u t u c t is the utility of the individual u t is a real number and u is a real valued function the resulting social welfare function given by alvarez cuadrado and van long 2009 was denoted w 6 w u 1 θ t 0 β t u t θ inf u 0 u 1 u t 0 β 1 where u u 0 u 1 u t is an infinite stream of utilities following valuable previous contributions chichilnisky 1996 bergh and hofkes 1998 alvarez cuadrado and van long 2009 the aim of this paper is to find a sustainable path for inter temporal water allocation within t years it is therefore assumed that c t denotes the vector for the water consumption allocated to a representative individual in year t and the utility function is assumed to depend only on the total annual water consumption allocated to each subarea u u c t c t i 1 n 1 e α ti loss q ti e ws ti wec ti min t 1 2 t similar to the sustainability path proposed in alvarez cuadrado and van long 2009 the sustainable water inter temporal allocation path is maxw u and 7 w u 1 θ t 1 t u c t 1 ρ t 1 θ u where ρ is the discount rate and a positive constant the first function 8 t 1 t u c t 1 ρ t 1 u c 1 u c 2 1 ρ u c 3 1 ρ 2 u c t 1 ρ t 1 is the sum of the discounted utilities the second function 9 u inf u c 1 u c 2 u c t is the maximin welfare function therefore 10 maxw u 1 θ t 1 t u i 1 n 1 e α ti loss q ti e ws

allocation goal satisfies two conditions to realize optimal water resource allocation between the current generation and future generations and to maximize overall utility 3 3 model constraints for water allocation planning water availability constraint the annual available water in a river basin system varies therefore in this paper let aw t be the conversion parameter for the available water in year t therefore e aw t is the expected value for the trapezoidal fuzzy number aw t accordingly as the allocation cannot exceed the initial available water we have 11 i 1 n q ti e aw t t water supply constraints the sum of the allocated water and any other water sources ws ti such as self provided water sources i e groundwater precipitation and rainfall etc in the i th subarea should between the minimum water use demand and the maximum water use demand therefore we have 12 d ti min 1 e α ti loss q ti e ws ti d ti max t i ecological water requirements ecological water is essential for fish wildlife water recreation and other related environmental resources therefore ecological water demand must be guaranteed in the water allocation process accordingly the ecological water constraint is 13 1 e α ti loss q ti e ws ti wec ti min t i where wec ti min denotes the minimum ecological water requirements for the i th subarea in the t th year technical constraints the water from the origin to destination i should range between the minimum water capacity and the maximum water capacity therefore we have 14 z i min q ti z i max i t 3 4 global model rapidly aging infrastructure population growth global warming and water resource access competition between present and future generations all call into question current water management strategies in this study the optimal allocation of regional water resources refers to the scientific deployment of different water resources within a generation or between current and future generations to ensure sustainability effectiveness and equity within the complex water resource ecological economic system to meet the water resource needs of both the present and future generations intra and intergenerational equities are integrated using the gini coefficient and a modified bentham rawls criterion as the social equity indicators that allows for time and space trade offs to ensure sustained sustainable water allocations as a necessary instrument for sustainable water use mean economic benefit efficiency is considered in the multi objective water resource allocation model to coordinate social development and water management by factoring in the competition between the present and future generations the ecological water requirements and the random water resource parameters the optimal strategy depicts a inter temporal water configuration pattern by integrating the above objective functions and constraints the multi objective programming model is formulated as shown in eq 15 compared with previous optimal water allocation strategies this model has a more comprehensive more systematic structure first based on intergenerational equity theory precepts the bentham rawls criterion which seeks the optimal economic path is incorporated into the water allocation strategy to ensure sustainable water utilization second intra and intergenerational equities are integrated to meet the sustainable water resource needs in both time and space dimensions after which a water allocation optimization model is proposed that guarantees efficiency equality and sustainability to determine reasonable comprehensive solutions for each water use area finally to ensure scientific and accurate assessments fuzzy random variables are adopted to describe the available water the water transfer loss ratio and the other water resource parameter uncertainties max ebe 1 t t 1 t i 1 n aeb ti 1 e α ti loss q ti i 1 n aeb tmax 1 e α ti loss q ti e ws ti min gini 1 t t 1 t 1 2 n i 1 n q ti eb ti l 1 n s 1 n q

integrate the multi objective function into a single objective problem eum and simonovic 2010 li et al 2010 zhou and guo 2013 zhou et al 2015 let g 1 be the economic benefit efficiency function g 2 be the intra generational equity function and let g 3 represent the social welfare function g 1 g 2 and g 3 are standardized before being utilized in the weighting method to eliminate any effect of scale on the objective values therefore the equality objective function is 16 f x min ω 1 g 1 g 1 g 1 g 1 ω 2 g 2 g 2 g 2 g 2 ω 3 g 3 g 3 g 3 g 3 where f is the equality objective function for the river basin authority x is the vector for the decision variables ω 1 ω 2 and ω 3 are the weighting factors to measure the importance of g 1 g 2 andg 3 respectively and clearly ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 1 the objective g represents the worst values for g and g represents the optimum values for g when optimized separately 4 case study the proposed model was utilized in a case study on the upper reaches of the minjiang river the results for which are discussed in the following 4 1 study site as shown in fig 2 the upper regions of the minjiang river covers five counties in the ngawa tibetan and qiang autonomous prefecture in sichuan province songpan heishui maoxian lixian and wenchuan and has a basin area of 25 426 km 2 the upper regions of the minjiang river have an annual surface water average of 1 58 10 10 m 3 accounting for 1 7 of the surface water resources in the yangtze river basin and 0 6 in the whole of china the upper reaches of minjiang river has a sparse population across a wide area of mostly agricultural and pastoral areas a large area of underdeveloped industry small waste water discharges and a grade ii and above water quality sichuan province environmental status bulletin 2015 therefore the upper reaches of the minjiang river is an important water source for life industry and agricultural production on the chengdu plain and in the sichuan basin although the upper reaches of the minjiang river are relatively rich in water resources more than 90 of the total water is supplied to the dujiangyan irrigation area with less than 10 being supplied to the five water use subareas sichuan province water resource department 2017 further as the economic and social development water resource demands in the sichuan basin has been increasing year on year the water diversions to the dujiangyan irrigation area have been commensurately increasing therefore the water supply pressure has been increasing in addition due to the 2008 wenchuan and 2013 lushan earthquakes the ecosystem of the minjiang river upper reaches is very vulnerable as the frequent geological disasters have caused significant vegetation and water bearing soil damage greatly reducing the surface and groundwater reserves the decrease in water coming from the minjiang river and the increase in the dujiangyan irrigation area water consumption is predicted to result in water shortages in the five water use subareas in the upper reaches of the minjiang river which would have significant negative influences on the local agriculture and manufacturing industries and impede economic growth therefore as the minjiang river basin authority must ensure both water supply safety and food production security they must scientifically and reasonably allocate water to each subarea to realize sustainable economic societal and ecological development 4 2 data sources and collection the mean ecological water demand wec i the minimum d i min and maximum d i max water demands and the economic benefits per unit volume of water aeb ti for the five water use subareas over five years were calculated based on 2010 2014 data from the sichuan province statistical yearbook regional public information sichuan statistical yearbook 2015 and the minjiang river basin comprehensive planning report sichuan province water resource department 2017 table 1 other vital parameters such as α ti loss the water transfer loss ratio from river basin to subarea i in year t ws ti the other water resource in subarea i in year t and aw t the available water in year t were uncertain because of climatic factors growing populations river bed seepage and water transfer techniques therefore they were very difficult to estimate accurately based on historical data these levels were vaguely defined using three different scenarios low level medium level and high level with the probabilities for these three levels being p 1 p 2 and p 3 the data analysis determined the available water in each year that could be allocated to the five water use subareas in the upper reaches of the minjiang river after guaranteeing the water diversion to the dujiangyan irrigation area the water transfer loss ratio other water resources and available water were calculated based on 2010 2014 data from the minjiang river basin comprehensive planning report table 2 4 3 results and discussion a comprehensive discussion from the calculation results is given in this section including related propositions comparative study and management recommendations 4 3 1 related propositions 4 3 1 1 scenario 1 scenario analysis under several sets of weights to conduct the sensitivity analysis for the optimal paths under the welfare function criterion eq 7 the following logarithmic preferences were assumed u c t ln 1 α ti loss q ti ws ti t 1 2 5 with the standard value for the rate of time preference being ρ 0 05 for convenience for this welfare function criterion equal weights at θ 0 5 were assigned to the sum of the discounted utilities and the utility level in the least advantaged year for the equality objective function eq 15 thirty six sets of possible weights were considered for the three weights ω 1 ω 2 and ω 3 all three were valued at 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 and 1 on the condition that ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 1 the results of the model for the various sets of weights are shown in fig 3 fig 4 and fig 5 1 equity efficiency sustainability value analysis according to gini 1921 the distribution has high equality when the gini coefficients are below 0 2 and have a relative average of between 0 2 and 0 3 consequently most of the gini value results shown in fig 3 were considered reasonable as they were between 0 0894 and 0 3660 from fig 3 the mean ebe is 0 8184 0 8843 which signified that the allocation and the water resource use efficiency was relatively high alvarez cuadrado and van long 2009 defined the golden rule stock level as the stock level that maximized the long run sustainable utility maxw u in this study maxw u 30 42 fig 3 shows that the value of w was between 28 7 and 29 8 indicating that the water resource allocation was close to the maximum sustainable yield 2 inter temporal water allocation strategies analysis fig 4 shows the water allocation strategies for the various sets in the different subareas for each year based on their dependence on each objective function weight these subareas were classified as insensitive or sensitive regardless of the objective function weights the water allocated to the insensitive subareas maoxian and wenchuan fluctuated below 10 in all five years while in the more sensitive subareas songpan heishui and lixian this fluctuation was more than 10 indicating that the water conflicts in the upper minjiang river basin regions were greater between the sensitive areas songpan heishui and lixian the greatest variance in each year was the water allocated to songpan through the model with the various weight sets being 151 30 1 10 190 90 183 41 and 6 97 10 7 m 3 respectively followed by heishui with 67 26 4 12 161 36 154 43 and 20 09 10 7 m 3 respectively and lixian with 0 6 57 49 81 0 and 45 96 10 7 m 3 respectively further confirming that songpan had the highest sensitivity to the objective function weights in songpan it was also found that when the sustainability was more heavily weighted the basin authorities allocated more water to this area to achieve the sustainability objective when the weight of the equity and economic benefit efficiency gradually increased the water allocated to this area decreased therefore the outcome of the water allocation in the model depended on the river basin authorities equity efficiency and sustainability preferences 3 total economic benefits analysis fig 5 illustrates the total economic benefit with the different sets of objective weights for the five areas in the five years as can be seen wenchuan had the highest total economic benefit followed by lixian maoxian heishui and songpan over the five years the economic benefits in wenchuan and lixian were stable at 14 16 10 10 and 13 26 10 10 cny under the different sets of weights however in other areas with the different sets of weights the total economic benefits fluctuated especially in songpan and heishui taking the combinations 0 1 0 8 0 1 0 8 0 1 0 1 0 2 0 6 0 2 0 6 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 5 0 3 0 5 0 2 0 3 0 2 0 4 0 4 and 0 5 0 1 0 4 for example in fig 4 songpan and heishui would receive the maximum economic benefit of 3 76 10 10 and 2 07 10 10 when the river basin authorities had a greater preference for sustainability if the river basin authorities set a lower sustainability weight such as 0 1 they would tend to choose an efficiency measure with a higher weight than equity to achieve greater total economic benefits 4 3 1 2 scenario 2 scenario analysis under balanced weights ω 1 1 3 ω 2 1 3 ω 3 1 3 seasonal runoffs in the upper regions of the minjiang river basin were significantly changed by the 2008 wenchuan and the 2013 lushan earthquakes along the longmenshan fault as there is always a dry season and a wet season the developed model needs to be applied to various available water quantities and consider the water diversion loss rate α ti loss for which η is defined as the changing rate on the basis of the original parameters and and denote the increase and decrease percentages as stated earlier here balanced weights ω 1 1 3 ω 2 1 3 ω 3 1 3 were taken as the basis for the scenario analysis the data for the equal weight water allocations are shown in table 3 in the following discussion three scenarios are discussed that indicate the influence of the changes on some key parameters 1 different levels of total available water as the total available water in the upper regions of the minjiang river basin varies with the geological conditions it is vital that this be considered in the water allocations as shown in table 4 where the words in bold font denote the water allocation changes in the five subareas the allocations change with a variation in the available water if the available water increases by 10 the results of the gini coefficient and the efficiency and social welfare functions are similar to the previous situation and only the five year total benefit increases by 0 87 however if the available water is less than 10 of the present quantity the gini coefficient has no obvious change which indicates that the water allocation equity in the upper regions of the minjiang river basin is significantly enhanced and the subareas are balanced when both the economic benefit efficiency and the social welfare function dropped a little the total benefit decreased by 4 5 therefore to tackle water scarcity various measures need to be developed for example ground water needs to be used wisely and cloud seeding could also be applied to increase the total available water from fig 6 regardless of whether the available water increased or decreased the obtained water in songpan heishui and wenchuan did not change which indicated that songpan heishui and wenchuan had reached their maximum demand or these three areas were able to obtain water from other water resources to satisfy minimum water demand to achieve balanced equity efficiency and sustainability across all five years the upper regions of the minjiang river basin authorities adjusted the water allocation to songpan heishui and maoxian in the first four years with the water allocation in the fifth year having not changed indicating that the water allocation reached a steady state in the fifth year as a result in years when there is less available water to obtain balanced economic benefits efficiency and sustainability the river basin authorities could reduce the water allocations to subareas with a lower water supply ratio in some years and allocate additional water to the subareas with relatively higher average economic benefits as long as they have not reached maximum demand in this year 2 different water diversion loss rates the water diversion loss rate which is an important factor when the river basin authorities consider water allocation to the subareas each year is the loss rate when the water is diverted from the basin to the subarea the higher the rate the greater the water loss table 5 shows the water allocation strategies for five years when the rate changes if the loss rate decreases the subarea is allocated more water and seeks greater benefits when the loss rates in all subareas decrease by 15 from the present level the benefit improves by 0 3 the equity increases by 8 0 the economic benefit efficiency has no obvious change and the social welfare function value is slightly enhanced when the loss rate decreases by 50 the benefits improve by 1 2 equity increases by 19 3 the economic benefit efficiency still has no obvious change and the social welfare function value increases by 0 3 the water course also needs to maintain a reasonable level to guarantee water discharge and it is also essential to enhance water resource protection on the upper regions of the minjiang river basin to achieve higher equity and economic benefits and to maintain sustainability levels the river authorities need to improve the waterway to decrease the water diversion loss rate the subareas could also construct more water conservancy projects to regulate water storage and guarantee available water 4 3 1 3 scenario 3 different weights for the social welfare function the social welfare function in this multi objective model is a weighted average of two functions the standard sum for discounted utilities and the rawlsian part which places a special emphasis on the utility for the least advantaged the positive weight 1 θ for the discounted utilitarianism implies a non dictatorship in the future the positive weight θ for the rawlsian part ensures a non dictatorship in the present therefore different weights produce different water allocation strategies which is another important factor when the river basin authorities consider the annual water allocations to the subareas table 6 shows the sensitivity analysis as the river basin authorities increase the weight on the rawlsian component of the social welfare objective function such as to θ 0 8 this reduces total water consumption over the whole five years 3824 66 4083 41 10 7 m 3 reduces the benefit by 9 3 decreases the equity by 8 3 reduces the economic benefit efficiency by 1 7 with the social welfare function value dropping sharply by 39 2 when θ 0 2 the initial water resources increase 4315 58 4083 41 10 7 m 3 the benefit increases by 3 9 the gini value is 0 386 indicated that the distribution has low equality the economic benefit efficiency reduces by 1 6 with the social welfare function value being 31 24 an increase of 5 4 therefore in water allocation decision making ensuring satisfaction of water needs for both the present and future generations showed higher equality of the allocation within a generation higher economic benefit efficiency and larger value of social welfare function to guarantee sustainable use of water resources 4 3 1 4 scenario 4 results that consider and do not consider intergenerational equity for conducting a comparative discussion from the optimization results that consider and do not consider intergenerational equity eleven sets of possible weights are considered for the economic benefit efficiency function and intra generational equity function with ω 1 ω 2 ω being given the following values 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 and 1 on the condition that ω 1 ω 2 1 for the modified bentham rawls criterion control constraints equal weights θ 0 5 were assigned to the sum of the discounted utilities and the utility level in the least advantaged year as shown in fig 7 the gini coefficient that did not consider the intergenerational equity were between 0 1287 and 0 4255 while the results that considered the intergenerational equity were between 0 0864 and 0 2864 moreover for any set of weights the gini coefficient that considered the intergenerational equity was smaller than the gini coefficient that did not consider the intergenerational equity which indicated a higher intra generational equity further when intergenerational equity was considered there was no significant change in the economic efficiency the total social welfare value was higher and the total social welfare function value was between 28 96 and 29 51 indicating that the water resource allocation was close to the maximum sustainable yield maxw u 30 42 these results show that the proposed model minimize the gini coefficient to ensure intra generational equity and maximize the social welfare function goal to ensure intergenerational equity therefore sustainable water resource utilization can be comprehensively included all of which shows that the proposed water allocation model that considers intergenerational equity provides a significantly better solution for the river basin authority 4 3 2 model uncertainty analysis the model uncertainty in the river water allocation model primarily arises from uncertainties associated with the parameter estimations input data and model structure yi ping et al 2012 blumberg et al 2008 in the intergenerational water allocation model levels of total available water water diversion loss rates and the weight for the social welfare function can result in model uncertainty because of monitoring methodology and subjective judgments the sensitivity analysis revealed that 1 regardless of whether the available water increased or decreased to achieve balanced equity efficiency and sustainability across all five years the minjiang river basin authorities needed to adjust the water allocations to songpan heishui and maoxian in the first four years with the water allocation in the fifth year remaining unchanged which indicated that the water allocation reached a steady state in the fifth year 2 if the water diversion loss rate decreased the subarea was allocated additional water and sought greater benefits indicating that the waterway needed to be improved to decrease the water diversion loss rate and 3 ensuring water needs satisfaction for both present and future generations required a higher allocation equality within a generation higher economic benefit efficiency and larger social welfare function values to guarantee sustainable water resource use therefore the sensitivity analysis results from the model were deemed to be acceptable the comparative analysis proved that the proposed model that considered intergenerational equity had a higher intra generational equity and higher total social welfare value than the current allocation model in summary the proposed intergenerational water allocation model was able to provide a better solution for the river basin authority 4 3 3 management recommendations based on the above analysis and discussion some management recommendations are given in this section as to how this intergenerational equity water allocation model could be used in a real application for the river basin authority as far as the time dimension is concerned the water allocation strategy should enable future generations to have water resource availability that has not been compromised by the activities of the current generation however as most existing water resource allocation strategies are unable to achieve inter temporal allocations it is difficult to ensure sustainable water resource use this paper proposed a social welfare criterion as an indicator of intergenerational equity which employed inter temporal water allocation to balance development needs and concern for the least advantaged generations and achieve a sustainable water resource allocation path for the space dimension as water is a common pool multiple use unidirectional flowing resource questions regarding intra generational equity are central to any decisions regarding water resource allocations this paper used the gini coefficient as an indicator of intra generational equity to measure the equitable share of the consumed water for each economic benefit unit moreover efficient water use was seen as a necessary instrument for sustainable water use and an instrument for long run social equity from above analysis and discussion the multi objective water allocation strategy proposed in this paper was shown to be able to achieve equilibrium between equity efficiency and sustainability as well as promote intra and intergenerational coordinated water allocation to achieve sustainable water use for present and future generations for the government focused policies need to be developed to encourage the establishment of intergenerational equity based water allocation systems so as to achieve sustainable water resource utilization the strategy proposed in this paper supports water conservation now for the wellbeing of the next generation and develops a long term water consumption path however even though water use by the present generation has been recognized as affecting the potential accessibility by future generations corresponding policies and regulations to resolve the water access competition between present and future generations are inefficient and ineffective therefore the government needs to develop focused policies and regulations that encourage the establishment of sustainable water resource use for present and future generations to avoid welfare losses in the use of water resources 5 conclusions to develop a sustainable water resource use pattern that ensures the needs of both the present and future generations this paper proposed a multi objective model that considered equity efficiency and sustainability in the proposed model two social equity time and space dimensions were integrated a gini coefficient was applied as an indicator of intra generational equity and a modified bentham rawls criterion was used as an indicator to ensure intergenerational equity mean economic benefit efficiency was seen as necessary for sustainable water use and social equity over the long run and the uncertainties associated with available water and water transfer loss ratios were treated using fuzzy random variables a case study from the upper reaches of the minjiang river basin china was then conducted the results from which demonstrated that the multi objective optimal allocation strategy was able to achieve intra and intergenerational equity and increase sustainable water utilization therefore the river basin authorities should ensure that higher initial stocks are fairly distributed across the years to ensure long term availability and that the steady state level of consumption increases to ensure future years enjoy higher welfare levels unlike previous studies the proposed optimal model that considered intergenerational equity was conducted from a sustainable water use perspective the comparative analyses from which showed higher intra generational equity and total social welfare values indicating that the allocation strategy proposed in this paper guarantees the satisfaction of water needs for both the present and future generations and avoids any welfare losses in the water resource use management recommendations were given for the application of water allocation strategies based on intergenerational equity and the associated policy support for future studies the intergenerational equity model could be improved to include water pollution from degraded water ecosystems and water resource quality deterioration from an intergenerational point of view the stock of tomorrow s water pollution is partially dependent on today s pollution stock and is increased by water consumption and reduced by abatement therefore water pollution accumulation over the long run could be determined from the water pollution absorption rate the water pollution emissions rate from a unit of water consumption and the effectiveness of pollution abatement efforts however this paper only considered an intergenerational water allocation strategy based on quantity not quality therefore in the future a more comprehensive intergenerational resource management methodology that integrates both water quantity and water quality is to be developed acknowledgments the work is supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant

6851,for both physical and economic reasons water scarcity has become a worldwide concern to meet regional water demands and improve water resource optimization management a multi objective water resource allocation model was developed for a sustainable future in which equity efficiency and sustainability were taken as the allocation principles to equitably maximize subarea economic and social welfare and coordinate social development and water management without compromising water ecosystem sustainability to meet the water resource needs of both present and future generations intra and intergenerational equities were integrated using a gini coefficient and a modified bentham rawls criterion to allow for time and space social equity trade offs for sustainable water allocation to coordinate social development and water management for water sustainability mean economic benefit efficiency was considered in the multi objective water resource allocation model by factoring in the competition between present and future generations the ecological water requirements and the fuzzy random water resource parameters the optimal strategy better depicts a pattern of water inter temporal configuration than current strategies a case study from the upper reaches of the minjiang river basin in china is given to demonstrate the practicality and rationality of the proposed model compared with previous models the intergenerational allocation model was found to effectively consider sustainable water resource utilization had a higher total social welfare value and guaranteed equitable intra generational water allocation based on the results and discussion some management recommendations for water resource allocation strategies integrated intergenerational equity and policy support are given keywords intergenerational equity intra generational equity social welfare sustainability water allocation 1 introduction as populations increase and economies grow fresh water availability has become a serious problem in some areas leading to potential conflicts between water users therefore water resource allocation strategies can have a significant impact on economic development social stability and aquatic ecosystems eliasson 2015 larsen et al 2016 huang et al 2016 liu and yang 2012 in the past few decades in an effort to ensure equity efficiency and sustainable water use water resource allocation research has attracted increased research attention efficient water allocation can balance supply and demand and ensure an equitable share between the needs of the domestic industrial agricultural and ecological water sectors divakar et al 2011 daubert and young 1981 proposed a contingent valuation approach to estimate the marginal economic value of efficient water allocation and griffin 2006 examined the economic problems associated with estimating aggregate economic efficiency from water resource allocations that maximized the sum of the agent net benefits as an equitable access to water resources is closely related to social stability several qualitative and indirect methods have been developed to assess water allocation equality cai 2008 hu and eheart 2013 patrick et al 2014 after cullis and koppen 2007 determined that the gini coefficient was a viable quantitative approach for measuring water allocation inequalities it has been widely used to determine equitable sustainable water allocations gunasekara et al 2014 hu et al 2016 xu et al 2017 because available fresh water sources are being rapidly depleted there has been an increased research focus on sustainable water resource developments for example sun et al 2017 and xi and poh 2013 demonstrated the usefulness of system dynamics as a decision support tool to achieve sustainable water management zhang et al 2017 developed a hierarchical water cycle health evaluation system based on nature society water cycle theory for optimal water allocation and xue et al 2015 highlighted the importance of developing system based tools and metrics to holistically evaluate water service systems based on integrated resource management concepts generally these methods have proved effective in providing sustainable water resource allocation however most of these studies only viewed water resource allocation from an intra generational perspective how to deal with water competition in present and future generations is still a barrier to deploying the sustainable water allocation methods as far as the time dimension is concerned sustainable water use needs to consider the needs of both present and future generations bithas 2008 it is vital that intergenerational equity considerations be included in water allocation decision making so that the present generation s water risk judgments include a consideration of the possible outcomes for their children syme et al 2006 syme and nancarrow 2006 syme and nancarrow 2013 intergenerational equity theory which is implicit in international commitments to sustainability embodies fairness for the future generations weiss 1989 therefore attitudinal water resource management research has included strong support for intergenerational equity for example syme et al 2006 developed a perceptions model based on intergenerational issues and environmental policy compliance that considered the use and contamination of natural resources such as the allocation and reallocation of water syme 2014 later exemplified intergenerational water planning issues in the current water allocation problems in the murray darling basin australia gleeson et al 2012 examined groundwater sustainability as a value driven process for intra and intergenerational equity that balanced the environment society and the economy while it is evident that all water use by the present generation has an impact on the potential water availability for future generations to date no definitive criterion has been developed to resolve the water access competition between present and future generations economic theory characterizes sustainability using sustainability criteria krautkraemer 1998 which had been proposed to avoid the drawbacks of the usual discounted utility criterion chichilnisky 1996 chichilnisky 1996 proposed the notion of sustainable preferences that were sensitive to the welfare of all generations and which required intergenerational equity with neither the present nor the future being favored alvarez cuadrado and van long 2009 further refined this and proposed a modified bentham rawls criterion with the payoff of the generation which is worst off for global warming and climate change being the most critical intergenerational equity issues tol 2013 investigated the implications of the bentham rawls criterion on climate policy unfortunately while water resource management plays a significant role in ensuring sustainable development for future generations the sustainability criteria required for intergenerational equity has not yet been integrated into water allocation issues therefore as insufficient water supplies and increasing water demands intensify water resource utilization competition and conflicts within and between current and future generations this paper develops an intergenerational equity theory based water allocation optimization model that integrates equity efficiency and sustainability to meet the water resource needs of both the present and future generations the intra and intergenerational equities are integrated using a gini coefficient and a modified bentham rawls criterion to allow for time and space social equity trade offs for sustainable water allocation mean economic benefit efficiency is also considered in the multi objective water resource allocation model to coordinate social development and water management with ecological water requirements being the constraint to guarantee environmental sustainability further as water resource changes resulting from climate change and social development are uncertain fuzzy random variables are employed to deal with the uncertain parameters this paper contributes to the literature in the following ways first based on intergenerational equity theory precepts the bentham rawls criterion is incorporated into the water allocation strategy to ensure sustainable utilization second intra and intergenerational equities are integrated to meet sustainable water resource needs both time and space dimensions finally a water allocation optimization model is proposed that can guarantee efficiency equality and sustainability and achieve reasonable comprehensive solutions for each water use area the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the problem and study motivation the mathematical model is formulated in section 3 section 4 gives a numerical example from the upper reaches of minjiang river to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods and gives some management recommendations and section 5 concludes the paper 2 key problem statement the key water sustainability priorities are the provision of safe drinking water wastewater handling for public health and reasonable water distribution however as rapidly aging infrastructure population growth and global warming all call into question current water management strategies there is an urgent research need to develop policy and practice alternatives for water and aquatic ecosystem sustainability with intergenerational equity as the main driver this paper focuses on an optimal water allocation strategy that ensures sustainable development for future generations a flowchart of the proposed methodology is shown in fig 1 after which some key problems are introduced 2 1 integrating intra and intergenerational equity requirements social equity is an integral part of sustainable development and has two intra and intergenerational time and space dimensions kverndokk et al 2014 intragenerational equity is focused on the equitable distribution of resources either within the current generation or within future generations kverndokk and rose 2008 while intragenerational equity is also important most equity debates on renewable resources have been focused on intergenerational issues vojnovic 1995 holden et al 2014 intergenerational equity implies that the present generation must meet its current needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs although these future needs are not known it is unlikely that they can be met without access to natural resources holden et al 2014 intragenerational equity is fundamental to many environmental concerns this is especially true for water as it is a common pool multiple use unidirectional resource therefore intragenerational water equity is central to any water resource allocation decisions lele 2017 in this paper the gini coefficient is used as an intragenerational equity indicator holden et al 2014 the gini coefficient is a popular inequality measure gini 1921 and has therefore been widely used to measure water resource allocation inequalities lopes et al 2015 nishi et al 2015 to assess intragenerational water allocation equity the relative mean difference the mean difference between every possible pair of subarea water consumption for one unit of economic benefits divided by the mean size of water consumption for one unit of economic benefits in all subareas is used to estimate the water allocation gini coefficient fig 1 a intergenerational equity is implicit in international commitments to sustainability if ecological economic and social sustainability is to be achieved it is necessary for intergenerational equity considerations to be included in water resource allocation decision making syme et al 1999 2006 from contributions by chichilnisky 1996 and alvarez cuadrado and van long 2009 a new social welfare criterion as an indicator of intergenerational equity is proposed to balance the development needs and concerns of the least advantaged generations this criterion permits some degree of trade off in the inter temporal water allocation maximizes the social welfare function to achieve a sustainable water resource allocation path in addition the utility function in this criterion only depends on the total water consumption allocated to each subarea each year the optimal growth program for inter temporal water allocations under the weighted average of a two term welfare criterion to ensure intergenerational equity is shown in fig 1 c to guarantee optimal water resource allocations between the current and future generations in this paper intra and intergenerational equity are integrated to ensure sustainable water management however as intra and intergenerational equity conflicts associated with water resource use and associated services may arise in the design and implementation of sustainability policies this study also analyzes the sustainable water resource development trade offs required in the inter temporal water allocations between the two social equity dimensions and the various intra and intergenerational equity policy preferences 2 2 optimal water allocation to coordinate conflicting objectives to respond to the threats that water shortages bring to human health economic activities and future generations water resource allocations must be appropriate and at the right time to ensure sustainability the economic theory of scarce resource allocation states that water resource allocations must achieve economic efficiency social equity and environmental sustainability bithas 2008 scientific and efficient water allocations based on economic efficiency assist in balancing the water resource demand and supply divakar et al 2011 fig 1 b diagrammatically shows the conditions necessary for efficient water allocation economic efficiency is the ratio of total economic value sum of the products of the allocated water and the subareas economic returns to the maximum achievable total economic value product of total available water and maximum net economic return in a subarea from the considered subareas although the efficiency and sustainability objectives in the use of natural resources differ substantially and in some cases are even in competition bromley 1990 bithas 2008 proposed that efficient water use was a necessary instrument for the sustainable use of water and an instrument for promoting social equity in the long run therefore increasing the water sustainable utilization is vital for system operators from the objectives of economic efficiency and social equity multi objective methods have been proven to be effective in solving the trade offs between different objectives for instance hu et al 2016 proposed a multi objective model that involved water allocation equality and economic efficiency risk control to solve economic inefficiency risks while considering extreme weather uncertainties yao et al 2017 proposed a novel combined cooling heating and power based compressed air energy storage system and then used a multi objective method to optimize the trade off between the thermodynamic and economic objectives encouraged by these successful studies a multi objective method that highlights the necessary trade offs and potential complementarities between equity efficiency and sustainability and promotes coordinated water development and management to maximize equitable social welfare is developed to ensure sustainable water use that meets the social economic and environmental objectives 2 3 adaptation strategies for achieving a sustainable path when viewing environmental policy problems through the sustainability lens several attributes need to be considered such as pervasive risk and uncertainty and a lack of or poor quality information dovers 1996 natural river runoff changes for example are influenced by global climate change and increased human activities brown et al 2010 plummer et al 2010 the manner and extent to which water is exploited contributes to climate change and the systems that provide water are also highly vulnerable to climate changes howells et al 2013 stevens and bony 2013 there are also significant social influences affecting water quality and flow which have caused water shortages water pollution and ecological degradation in many countries and regions and particularly in densely populated areas elłas maxil et al 2014 liu and yang 2012 therefore river flow and water allocation need to be viewed as a decision making system with significant uncertainty in each node and across the overall system due to the random features of a water body syme 2014 some previous studies have considered water flow in a fuzzy random environment and fuzzy random variable can be judged using three different scenarios low level medium level and high level with corresponding probability distributions for example xu et al 2013 applied fuzzy random variables to express the water demand and stream flow uncertainties for many meteorological and hydrological factors such as rainfall changes temperature increases and other uncertain features xu et al 2015 applied fuzzy random variables to express the uncertainties in various water quality management system components encouraged by these successful applications fuzzy random variables are used in this paper to deal with the probabilistic and discrete interval uncertainties in the water resource allocation problem therefore based on sustainability insights and to respond to environmental changes this paper presents several scenarios and adaptation strategies to support sustainable water resource use based on sustainable preferences that are sensitive to the welfare of all generations through intergenerational equity chichilnisky 1996 beltratti et al 1998 3 modeling before constructing the mathematical model in this paper some fundamental assumptions are given 1 all available water for distribution is provided by a single river basin 2 the minimal volume of available water that should be allocated to each subarea the minimal ecological water requirement in the river basin and the maximal and minimal water withdrawal values in each subarea are all known 3 the available water the water transfer loss ratio from river basin to subarea and the other water resources in the subareas in every year are considered to be fuzzy random variables with the attributes determined using historical statistical data and professional experience 4 water pollution is not considered as the available water is assumed to be of good quality 3 1 notations index i subarea i i 1 2 n t every year

the river basin authorities need to optimally allocate water to each subarea by maximizing the economic benefit and intra and intergenerational equity to guarantee sustainable water use to find the optimal water allocation path a multiple overall planning process for a total of t years is considered as the water allocated by the river basin authorities is stored in the respective subarea reservoirs the amount allocated each year may be different details for the achievement of these objectives are discussed in the following 3 2 1 maximization of mean economic benefit efficiency the economic benefits of domestic sector water use can be established using a demand function diaz and brown 1997 griffin 2006 divakar et al 2011 and booker and young 1994 divakar et al 2011 applied a residual imputation of a linear programming model to compute the net economic return from the irrigation water in the agricultural sector to efficiently obtain the net economic benefits for the different water users the mean economic efficiency for total t is described as the annual average ratio of the entire economic benefit the sum of the multiplication of each subarea s average economic benefits and used water to the maximal achievable economic benefit the multiplication of the maximal average economic benefits in a subarea and the available water let α ti loss be the water transfer loss ratio from the river basin to subarea i in year t and ws ti be the other water resources in subarea i in year t due to varying conditions such as weather technology and other objective factors the parameters α ti loss and ws ti cannot be exactly valued therefore in this paper the expected value operator method is used to deal with this situation using trapezoidal fuzzy sets e α ti loss and e ws ti with three levels low medium and high and their corresponding probability distributions xu and zhou 2011 to determine the net economic benefits for the different water users the mean annual economic benefit per unit of water consumed in each year is used 1 eb ti 1 e α ti loss q ti aeb ti 1 e α ti loss q ti t i therefore the economic efficiency in t years is described as a ratio the sum of the multiplication of each subarea s average economic benefits and used water to the multiplication of the maximal average economic benefits of a subarea and the available water as follows 2 ebe t i 1 n aeb ti 1 e α ti loss q ti i 1 n aeb tmax 1 e α ti loss q ti e ws ti where aeb tmax is the economic benefit of a subarea with a maximum average value in year t the aim is to realize mean economic benefit efficiency maximization in t years which can be expressed as 3 maxebe 1 t t 1 t i 1 n aeb ti q ti i 1 n aeb tmax 1 e α ti loss q ti e ws ti 3 2 2 cumulative intragenerational equity maximization as equitable water allocation can ensure stable development in all subareas river basin authorities need to include equity as part of the water allocation process the gini coefficient has been effectively applied to measure resource allocation inequality lopes et al 2015 nishi et al 2015 the relative mean difference the mean difference between every possible pair of subarea water consumption for one unit of economic benefits divided by the mean size of the water consumption for one unit of economic benefit for all subareas is used to estimate the water allocation gini coefficient to measure water allocation equity that is water allocation equity is measured by the equitable sharing of the used water quantity for each unit of economic benefits with the initial definition being as follows cullis and koppen 2007 gini 1921 4 gini 1 2 n 2 y i 1 n j 1 n y i y j where n is the number of individuals and the gini coefficient is defined as the mean difference between every possible pair of individuals y i y j divided by the mean size y accordingly if the y axis shows the cumulative share of the total water and the x axis shows the cumulative share of the economic benefits the gini coefficient effectively measures the water allocation equity that is minimizing the gini coefficient indicates water equity allocation maximization in this paper to consider water allocation equity within t years the cumulative equity maximization is 5 min gini 1 t t 1 t 1 2 n i 1 n q ti eb ti l 1 n s 1 n q tl eb tl q ts eb ts 3 2 3 maximization of the social welfare function for sustainability based on the work of chichilnisky 1996 a welfare criterion is proposed that balances the need for development and concern for the least advantaged generations alvarez cuadrado and van long 2009 while this criterion moderates the discounting effect some degree of inter temporal trade off is permitted the weighted average of a the sum of the discounted utilities and b the utility level of the least advantaged generation let c t denote the consumption vector allocated to the representative individual from generation t assume that the utility function depends only on the total consumption allocated to each generation that is u t u c t is the utility of the individual u t is a real number and u is a real valued function the resulting social welfare function given by alvarez cuadrado and van long 2009 was denoted w 6 w u 1 θ t 0 β t u t θ inf u 0 u 1 u t 0 β 1 where u u 0 u 1 u t is an infinite stream of utilities following valuable previous contributions chichilnisky 1996 bergh and hofkes 1998 alvarez cuadrado and van long 2009 the aim of this paper is to find a sustainable path for inter temporal water allocation within t years it is therefore assumed that c t denotes the vector for the water consumption allocated to a representative individual in year t and the utility function is assumed to depend only on the total annual water consumption allocated to each subarea u u c t c t i 1 n 1 e α ti loss q ti e ws ti wec ti min t 1 2 t similar to the sustainability path proposed in alvarez cuadrado and van long 2009 the sustainable water inter temporal allocation path is maxw u and 7 w u 1 θ t 1 t u c t 1 ρ t 1 θ u where ρ is the discount rate and a positive constant the first function 8 t 1 t u c t 1 ρ t 1 u c 1 u c 2 1 ρ u c 3 1 ρ 2 u c t 1 ρ t 1 is the sum of the discounted utilities the second function 9 u inf u c 1 u c 2 u c t is the maximin welfare function therefore 10 maxw u 1 θ t 1 t u i 1 n 1 e α ti loss q ti e ws

allocation goal satisfies two conditions to realize optimal water resource allocation between the current generation and future generations and to maximize overall utility 3 3 model constraints for water allocation planning water availability constraint the annual available water in a river basin system varies therefore in this paper let aw t be the conversion parameter for the available water in year t therefore e aw t is the expected value for the trapezoidal fuzzy number aw t accordingly as the allocation cannot exceed the initial available water we have 11 i 1 n q ti e aw t t water supply constraints the sum of the allocated water and any other water sources ws ti such as self provided water sources i e groundwater precipitation and rainfall etc in the i th subarea should between the minimum water use demand and the maximum water use demand therefore we have 12 d ti min 1 e α ti loss q ti e ws ti d ti max t i ecological water requirements ecological water is essential for fish wildlife water recreation and other related environmental resources therefore ecological water demand must be guaranteed in the water allocation process accordingly the ecological water constraint is 13 1 e α ti loss q ti e ws ti wec ti min t i where wec ti min denotes the minimum ecological water requirements for the i th subarea in the t th year technical constraints the water from the origin to destination i should range between the minimum water capacity and the maximum water capacity therefore we have 14 z i min q ti z i max i t 3 4 global model rapidly aging infrastructure population growth global warming and water resource access competition between present and future generations all call into question current water management strategies in this study the optimal allocation of regional water resources refers to the scientific deployment of different water resources within a generation or between current and future generations to ensure sustainability effectiveness and equity within the complex water resource ecological economic system to meet the water resource needs of both the present and future generations intra and intergenerational equities are integrated using the gini coefficient and a modified bentham rawls criterion as the social equity indicators that allows for time and space trade offs to ensure sustained sustainable water allocations as a necessary instrument for sustainable water use mean economic benefit efficiency is considered in the multi objective water resource allocation model to coordinate social development and water management by factoring in the competition between the present and future generations the ecological water requirements and the random water resource parameters the optimal strategy depicts a inter temporal water configuration pattern by integrating the above objective functions and constraints the multi objective programming model is formulated as shown in eq 15 compared with previous optimal water allocation strategies this model has a more comprehensive more systematic structure first based on intergenerational equity theory precepts the bentham rawls criterion which seeks the optimal economic path is incorporated into the water allocation strategy to ensure sustainable water utilization second intra and intergenerational equities are integrated to meet the sustainable water resource needs in both time and space dimensions after which a water allocation optimization model is proposed that guarantees efficiency equality and sustainability to determine reasonable comprehensive solutions for each water use area finally to ensure scientific and accurate assessments fuzzy random variables are adopted to describe the available water the water transfer loss ratio and the other water resource parameter uncertainties max ebe 1 t t 1 t i 1 n aeb ti 1 e α ti loss q ti i 1 n aeb tmax 1 e α ti loss q ti e ws ti min gini 1 t t 1 t 1 2 n i 1 n q ti eb ti l 1 n s 1 n q

integrate the multi objective function into a single objective problem eum and simonovic 2010 li et al 2010 zhou and guo 2013 zhou et al 2015 let g 1 be the economic benefit efficiency function g 2 be the intra generational equity function and let g 3 represent the social welfare function g 1 g 2 and g 3 are standardized before being utilized in the weighting method to eliminate any effect of scale on the objective values therefore the equality objective function is 16 f x min ω 1 g 1 g 1 g 1 g 1 ω 2 g 2 g 2 g 2 g 2 ω 3 g 3 g 3 g 3 g 3 where f is the equality objective function for the river basin authority x is the vector for the decision variables ω 1 ω 2 and ω 3 are the weighting factors to measure the importance of g 1 g 2 andg 3 respectively and clearly ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 1 the objective g represents the worst values for g and g represents the optimum values for g when optimized separately 4 case study the proposed model was utilized in a case study on the upper reaches of the minjiang river the results for which are discussed in the following 4 1 study site as shown in fig 2 the upper regions of the minjiang river covers five counties in the ngawa tibetan and qiang autonomous prefecture in sichuan province songpan heishui maoxian lixian and wenchuan and has a basin area of 25 426 km 2 the upper regions of the minjiang river have an annual surface water average of 1 58 10 10 m 3 accounting for 1 7 of the surface water resources in the yangtze river basin and 0 6 in the whole of china the upper reaches of minjiang river has a sparse population across a wide area of mostly agricultural and pastoral areas a large area of underdeveloped industry small waste water discharges and a grade ii and above water quality sichuan province environmental status bulletin 2015 therefore the upper reaches of the minjiang river is an important water source for life industry and agricultural production on the chengdu plain and in the sichuan basin although the upper reaches of the minjiang river are relatively rich in water resources more than 90 of the total water is supplied to the dujiangyan irrigation area with less than 10 being supplied to the five water use subareas sichuan province water resource department 2017 further as the economic and social development water resource demands in the sichuan basin has been increasing year on year the water diversions to the dujiangyan irrigation area have been commensurately increasing therefore the water supply pressure has been increasing in addition due to the 2008 wenchuan and 2013 lushan earthquakes the ecosystem of the minjiang river upper reaches is very vulnerable as the frequent geological disasters have caused significant vegetation and water bearing soil damage greatly reducing the surface and groundwater reserves the decrease in water coming from the minjiang river and the increase in the dujiangyan irrigation area water consumption is predicted to result in water shortages in the five water use subareas in the upper reaches of the minjiang river which would have significant negative influences on the local agriculture and manufacturing industries and impede economic growth therefore as the minjiang river basin authority must ensure both water supply safety and food production security they must scientifically and reasonably allocate water to each subarea to realize sustainable economic societal and ecological development 4 2 data sources and collection the mean ecological water demand wec i the minimum d i min and maximum d i max water demands and the economic benefits per unit volume of water aeb ti for the five water use subareas over five years were calculated based on 2010 2014 data from the sichuan province statistical yearbook regional public information sichuan statistical yearbook 2015 and the minjiang river basin comprehensive planning report sichuan province water resource department 2017 table 1 other vital parameters such as α ti loss the water transfer loss ratio from river basin to subarea i in year t ws ti the other water resource in subarea i in year t and aw t the available water in year t were uncertain because of climatic factors growing populations river bed seepage and water transfer techniques therefore they were very difficult to estimate accurately based on historical data these levels were vaguely defined using three different scenarios low level medium level and high level with the probabilities for these three levels being p 1 p 2 and p 3 the data analysis determined the available water in each year that could be allocated to the five water use subareas in the upper reaches of the minjiang river after guaranteeing the water diversion to the dujiangyan irrigation area the water transfer loss ratio other water resources and available water were calculated based on 2010 2014 data from the minjiang river basin comprehensive planning report table 2 4 3 results and discussion a comprehensive discussion from the calculation results is given in this section including related propositions comparative study and management recommendations 4 3 1 related propositions 4 3 1 1 scenario 1 scenario analysis under several sets of weights to conduct the sensitivity analysis for the optimal paths under the welfare function criterion eq 7 the following logarithmic preferences were assumed u c t ln 1 α ti loss q ti ws ti t 1 2 5 with the standard value for the rate of time preference being ρ 0 05 for convenience for this welfare function criterion equal weights at θ 0 5 were assigned to the sum of the discounted utilities and the utility level in the least advantaged year for the equality objective function eq 15 thirty six sets of possible weights were considered for the three weights ω 1 ω 2 and ω 3 all three were valued at 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 and 1 on the condition that ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 1 the results of the model for the various sets of weights are shown in fig 3 fig 4 and fig 5 1 equity efficiency sustainability value analysis according to gini 1921 the distribution has high equality when the gini coefficients are below 0 2 and have a relative average of between 0 2 and 0 3 consequently most of the gini value results shown in fig 3 were considered reasonable as they were between 0 0894 and 0 3660 from fig 3 the mean ebe is 0 8184 0 8843 which signified that the allocation and the water resource use efficiency was relatively high alvarez cuadrado and van long 2009 defined the golden rule stock level as the stock level that maximized the long run sustainable utility maxw u in this study maxw u 30 42 fig 3 shows that the value of w was between 28 7 and 29 8 indicating that the water resource allocation was close to the maximum sustainable yield 2 inter temporal water allocation strategies analysis fig 4 shows the water allocation strategies for the various sets in the different subareas for each year based on their dependence on each objective function weight these subareas were classified as insensitive or sensitive regardless of the objective function weights the water allocated to the insensitive subareas maoxian and wenchuan fluctuated below 10 in all five years while in the more sensitive subareas songpan heishui and lixian this fluctuation was more than 10 indicating that the water conflicts in the upper minjiang river basin regions were greater between the sensitive areas songpan heishui and lixian the greatest variance in each year was the water allocated to songpan through the model with the various weight sets being 151 30 1 10 190 90 183 41 and 6 97 10 7 m 3 respectively followed by heishui with 67 26 4 12 161 36 154 43 and 20 09 10 7 m 3 respectively and lixian with 0 6 57 49 81 0 and 45 96 10 7 m 3 respectively further confirming that songpan had the highest sensitivity to the objective function weights in songpan it was also found that when the sustainability was more heavily weighted the basin authorities allocated more water to this area to achieve the sustainability objective when the weight of the equity and economic benefit efficiency gradually increased the water allocated to this area decreased therefore the outcome of the water allocation in the model depended on the river basin authorities equity efficiency and sustainability preferences 3 total economic benefits analysis fig 5 illustrates the total economic benefit with the different sets of objective weights for the five areas in the five years as can be seen wenchuan had the highest total economic benefit followed by lixian maoxian heishui and songpan over the five years the economic benefits in wenchuan and lixian were stable at 14 16 10 10 and 13 26 10 10 cny under the different sets of weights however in other areas with the different sets of weights the total economic benefits fluctuated especially in songpan and heishui taking the combinations 0 1 0 8 0 1 0 8 0 1 0 1 0 2 0 6 0 2 0 6 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 5 0 3 0 5 0 2 0 3 0 2 0 4 0 4 and 0 5 0 1 0 4 for example in fig 4 songpan and heishui would receive the maximum economic benefit of 3 76 10 10 and 2 07 10 10 when the river basin authorities had a greater preference for sustainability if the river basin authorities set a lower sustainability weight such as 0 1 they would tend to choose an efficiency measure with a higher weight than equity to achieve greater total economic benefits 4 3 1 2 scenario 2 scenario analysis under balanced weights ω 1 1 3 ω 2 1 3 ω 3 1 3 seasonal runoffs in the upper regions of the minjiang river basin were significantly changed by the 2008 wenchuan and the 2013 lushan earthquakes along the longmenshan fault as there is always a dry season and a wet season the developed model needs to be applied to various available water quantities and consider the water diversion loss rate α ti loss for which η is defined as the changing rate on the basis of the original parameters and and denote the increase and decrease percentages as stated earlier here balanced weights ω 1 1 3 ω 2 1 3 ω 3 1 3 were taken as the basis for the scenario analysis the data for the equal weight water allocations are shown in table 3 in the following discussion three scenarios are discussed that indicate the influence of the changes on some key parameters 1 different levels of total available water as the total available water in the upper regions of the minjiang river basin varies with the geological conditions it is vital that this be considered in the water allocations as shown in table 4 where the words in bold font denote the water allocation changes in the five subareas the allocations change with a variation in the available water if the available water increases by 10 the results of the gini coefficient and the efficiency and social welfare functions are similar to the previous situation and only the five year total benefit increases by 0 87 however if the available water is less than 10 of the present quantity the gini coefficient has no obvious change which indicates that the water allocation equity in the upper regions of the minjiang river basin is significantly enhanced and the subareas are balanced when both the economic benefit efficiency and the social welfare function dropped a little the total benefit decreased by 4 5 therefore to tackle water scarcity various measures need to be developed for example ground water needs to be used wisely and cloud seeding could also be applied to increase the total available water from fig 6 regardless of whether the available water increased or decreased the obtained water in songpan heishui and wenchuan did not change which indicated that songpan heishui and wenchuan had reached their maximum demand or these three areas were able to obtain water from other water resources to satisfy minimum water demand to achieve balanced equity efficiency and sustainability across all five years the upper regions of the minjiang river basin authorities adjusted the water allocation to songpan heishui and maoxian in the first four years with the water allocation in the fifth year having not changed indicating that the water allocation reached a steady state in the fifth year as a result in years when there is less available water to obtain balanced economic benefits efficiency and sustainability the river basin authorities could reduce the water allocations to subareas with a lower water supply ratio in some years and allocate additional water to the subareas with relatively higher average economic benefits as long as they have not reached maximum demand in this year 2 different water diversion loss rates the water diversion loss rate which is an important factor when the river basin authorities consider water allocation to the subareas each year is the loss rate when the water is diverted from the basin to the subarea the higher the rate the greater the water loss table 5 shows the water allocation strategies for five years when the rate changes if the loss rate decreases the subarea is allocated more water and seeks greater benefits when the loss rates in all subareas decrease by 15 from the present level the benefit improves by 0 3 the equity increases by 8 0 the economic benefit efficiency has no obvious change and the social welfare function value is slightly enhanced when the loss rate decreases by 50 the benefits improve by 1 2 equity increases by 19 3 the economic benefit efficiency still has no obvious change and the social welfare function value increases by 0 3 the water course also needs to maintain a reasonable level to guarantee water discharge and it is also essential to enhance water resource protection on the upper regions of the minjiang river basin to achieve higher equity and economic benefits and to maintain sustainability levels the river authorities need to improve the waterway to decrease the water diversion loss rate the subareas could also construct more water conservancy projects to regulate water storage and guarantee available water 4 3 1 3 scenario 3 different weights for the social welfare function the social welfare function in this multi objective model is a weighted average of two functions the standard sum for discounted utilities and the rawlsian part which places a special emphasis on the utility for the least advantaged the positive weight 1 θ for the discounted utilitarianism implies a non dictatorship in the future the positive weight θ for the rawlsian part ensures a non dictatorship in the present therefore different weights produce different water allocation strategies which is another important factor when the river basin authorities consider the annual water allocations to the subareas table 6 shows the sensitivity analysis as the river basin authorities increase the weight on the rawlsian component of the social welfare objective function such as to θ 0 8 this reduces total water consumption over the whole five years 3824 66 4083 41 10 7 m 3 reduces the benefit by 9 3 decreases the equity by 8 3 reduces the economic benefit efficiency by 1 7 with the social welfare function value dropping sharply by 39 2 when θ 0 2 the initial water resources increase 4315 58 4083 41 10 7 m 3 the benefit increases by 3 9 the gini value is 0 386 indicated that the distribution has low equality the economic benefit efficiency reduces by 1 6 with the social welfare function value being 31 24 an increase of 5 4 therefore in water allocation decision making ensuring satisfaction of water needs for both the present and future generations showed higher equality of the allocation within a generation higher economic benefit efficiency and larger value of social welfare function to guarantee sustainable use of water resources 4 3 1 4 scenario 4 results that consider and do not consider intergenerational equity for conducting a comparative discussion from the optimization results that consider and do not consider intergenerational equity eleven sets of possible weights are considered for the economic benefit efficiency function and intra generational equity function with ω 1 ω 2 ω being given the following values 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 and 1 on the condition that ω 1 ω 2 1 for the modified bentham rawls criterion control constraints equal weights θ 0 5 were assigned to the sum of the discounted utilities and the utility level in the least advantaged year as shown in fig 7 the gini coefficient that did not consider the intergenerational equity were between 0 1287 and 0 4255 while the results that considered the intergenerational equity were between 0 0864 and 0 2864 moreover for any set of weights the gini coefficient that considered the intergenerational equity was smaller than the gini coefficient that did not consider the intergenerational equity which indicated a higher intra generational equity further when intergenerational equity was considered there was no significant change in the economic efficiency the total social welfare value was higher and the total social welfare function value was between 28 96 and 29 51 indicating that the water resource allocation was close to the maximum sustainable yield maxw u 30 42 these results show that the proposed model minimize the gini coefficient to ensure intra generational equity and maximize the social welfare function goal to ensure intergenerational equity therefore sustainable water resource utilization can be comprehensively included all of which shows that the proposed water allocation model that considers intergenerational equity provides a significantly better solution for the river basin authority 4 3 2 model uncertainty analysis the model uncertainty in the river water allocation model primarily arises from uncertainties associated with the parameter estimations input data and model structure yi ping et al 2012 blumberg et al 2008 in the intergenerational water allocation model levels of total available water water diversion loss rates and the weight for the social welfare function can result in model uncertainty because of monitoring methodology and subjective judgments the sensitivity analysis revealed that 1 regardless of whether the available water increased or decreased to achieve balanced equity efficiency and sustainability across all five years the minjiang river basin authorities needed to adjust the water allocations to songpan heishui and maoxian in the first four years with the water allocation in the fifth year remaining unchanged which indicated that the water allocation reached a steady state in the fifth year 2 if the water diversion loss rate decreased the subarea was allocated additional water and sought greater benefits indicating that the waterway needed to be improved to decrease the water diversion loss rate and 3 ensuring water needs satisfaction for both present and future generations required a higher allocation equality within a generation higher economic benefit efficiency and larger social welfare function values to guarantee sustainable water resource use therefore the sensitivity analysis results from the model were deemed to be acceptable the comparative analysis proved that the proposed model that considered intergenerational equity had a higher intra generational equity and higher total social welfare value than the current allocation model in summary the proposed intergenerational water allocation model was able to provide a better solution for the river basin authority 4 3 3 management recommendations based on the above analysis and discussion some management recommendations are given in this section as to how this intergenerational equity water allocation model could be used in a real application for the river basin authority as far as the time dimension is concerned the water allocation strategy should enable future generations to have water resource availability that has not been compromised by the activities of the current generation however as most existing water resource allocation strategies are unable to achieve inter temporal allocations it is difficult to ensure sustainable water resource use this paper proposed a social welfare criterion as an indicator of intergenerational equity which employed inter temporal water allocation to balance development needs and concern for the least advantaged generations and achieve a sustainable water resource allocation path for the space dimension as water is a common pool multiple use unidirectional flowing resource questions regarding intra generational equity are central to any decisions regarding water resource allocations this paper used the gini coefficient as an indicator of intra generational equity to measure the equitable share of the consumed water for each economic benefit unit moreover efficient water use was seen as a necessary instrument for sustainable water use and an instrument for long run social equity from above analysis and discussion the multi objective water allocation strategy proposed in this paper was shown to be able to achieve equilibrium between equity efficiency and sustainability as well as promote intra and intergenerational coordinated water allocation to achieve sustainable water use for present and future generations for the government focused policies need to be developed to encourage the establishment of intergenerational equity based water allocation systems so as to achieve sustainable water resource utilization the strategy proposed in this paper supports water conservation now for the wellbeing of the next generation and develops a long term water consumption path however even though water use by the present generation has been recognized as affecting the potential accessibility by future generations corresponding policies and regulations to resolve the water access competition between present and future generations are inefficient and ineffective therefore the government needs to develop focused policies and regulations that encourage the establishment of sustainable water resource use for present and future generations to avoid welfare losses in the use of water resources 5 conclusions to develop a sustainable water resource use pattern that ensures the needs of both the present and future generations this paper proposed a multi objective model that considered equity efficiency and sustainability in the proposed model two social equity time and space dimensions were integrated a gini coefficient was applied as an indicator of intra generational equity and a modified bentham rawls criterion was used as an indicator to ensure intergenerational equity mean economic benefit efficiency was seen as necessary for sustainable water use and social equity over the long run and the uncertainties associated with available water and water transfer loss ratios were treated using fuzzy random variables a case study from the upper reaches of the minjiang river basin china was then conducted the results from which demonstrated that the multi objective optimal allocation strategy was able to achieve intra and intergenerational equity and increase sustainable water utilization therefore the river basin authorities should ensure that higher initial stocks are fairly distributed across the years to ensure long term availability and that the steady state level of consumption increases to ensure future years enjoy higher welfare levels unlike previous studies the proposed optimal model that considered intergenerational equity was conducted from a sustainable water use perspective the comparative analyses from which showed higher intra generational equity and total social welfare values indicating that the allocation strategy proposed in this paper guarantees the satisfaction of water needs for both the present and future generations and avoids any welfare losses in the water resource use management recommendations were given for the application of water allocation strategies based on intergenerational equity and the associated policy support for future studies the intergenerational equity model could be improved to include water pollution from degraded water ecosystems and water resource quality deterioration from an intergenerational point of view the stock of tomorrow s water pollution is partially dependent on today s pollution stock and is increased by water consumption and reduced by abatement therefore water pollution accumulation over the long run could be determined from the water pollution absorption rate the water pollution emissions rate from a unit of water consumption and the effectiveness of pollution abatement efforts however this paper only considered an intergenerational water allocation strategy based on quantity not quality therefore in the future a more comprehensive intergenerational resource management methodology that integrates both water quantity and water quality is to be developed acknowledgments the work is supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant

6852,to improve understanding of spatial seasonal and inter annual variations in nitrate sources and in stream processes in the illinois river system nitrate concentrations and isotopic compositions were measured in 445 water samples collected over a four year period 2004 2008 from the upper illinois river basin uirb samples included surface water in the river and major tributaries effluent samples from chicago s largest wastewater treatment plant wtp and representative groundwater from shallow wells in agricultural land two principal nitrate endmember sources within the uirb had distinctive isotopic compositions wtp effluent with δ15n 8 6 1 7 and δ18o 0 8 1 4 and agricultural groundwater with δ15n no3 3 4 0 6 and δ18o 3 7 0 5 when minimally affected by nitrate reduction isotopic data indicated that the large pulse of nitrate exported from the river basin during the spring was mostly derived from agricultural land drainage while nitrate from large wtp effluent point sources was predominant in the upper reaches of the river near chicago during low base flow conditions in late summer and fall the agricultural nitrate source was greatly diminished and the headwater wtp source was predominant in the river basin export our results indicated biogeochemical nitrate reduction and isotopic fractionation occurred within the river network affecting both agricultural and urban sources during surface water transport in addition diminished agricultural nitrate export was attributable to preferential discharge of biogeochemically reduced groundwater during low base flow isotopic indicators of spatial and seasonal variations in the relative importance of different nitrate sources and their relative susceptibility to natural attenuation might be useful for guiding

in plant growth and food production but excess nitrate no3 introduced to the environment can cause enhancement of primary production in fresh water and marine ecosystems leading to noxious phytoplankton blooms and bottom water hypoxia in lakes and coastal waters and release of greenhouse gases through denitrification sobota et al 2015 van grinsven et al 2013 high riverine nitrate export to the gulf of mexico has contributed to the formation of summertime hypoxia off the coast and was found to be related to land use patterns in the mississippi river basin including widespread cultivation of row crops such as corn and soybeans along with substantial contributions from treated wastewater effluent in urban areas with high population density david et al 1997 david et al 2010 goolsby et al 1999 royer et al 2006 donner et al 2004 alexander et al 2008 because of the magnitude and complexity of the problem the mississippi river gulf of mexico hypoxia task force extended the target date for reducing the gulf hypoxic zone from 2015 to 2035 with an intermediate goal of a 20 reduction in nutrient loads by 2025 u s environmental protection agency usepa 2015 the illinois river is a major tributary of the mississippi river and flows through one of the most productive farming regions in the us some of its tributaries also flow through the most populated and urbanized region in the midwestern us the chicago metropolitan region arnold et al 1999 the illinois river basin has been identified as one of the principal watersheds contributing nutrients to the mississippi river markus et al 2013 terrio 2006 although n also occurs in the form of ammonium and organic compounds nitrate is the major dissolved n species under most conditions in streams and rivers draining the upper mississippi river watershed goolsby and battaglin 2001 thus it is critical to understand the sources and behavior of nitrate in watersheds such as the illinois river basin in order to control and reduce nitrate flux to the gulf recent long term trend work showed either little change or even a slight decline in the flow normalized nitrate flux between the late 20th century and early 21st century in the illinois river mcisaac et al 2016 murphy et al 2013 sprague et al 2011 regression studies also found the flow normalized nitrate concentration declined significantly during the same period in the illinois river markus et al 2013 mcisaac et al 2016 such changes were attributed to the increase in agricultural nitrogen use efficiency a possible depletion of legacy nitrogen and or improvements in the urban sewage system garcía et al 2016 mcisaac et al 2016 however there is no declining trend in the actual nitrate flux not flow normalized from the watershed markus et al 2013 and nitrate load of the illinois river remains high identifying nitrate sources and understanding its transport mechanisms are still challenging because of mixing and complex biogeochemical n transformation processes alexander et al 2009 groffman et al 2006 nestler et al 2011 stable isotope ratios of n and o in nitrate δ15n no3 δ18o no3 can provide information about nitrate sources and transport in rivers e g deutsch et al 2009 groffman et al 2006 kendall et al 2007 li et al 2010 mayer et al 2002 panno et al 2008 xue et al 2009 but isotopic interpretations can be complicated by competing n cycle processes and changing spatial and temporal patterns of streamflow and nitrate concentration isotopic discrimination of nitrate sources e g fertilizer n versus wastewater n is possible in some situations whereas net microbial nitrate reduction processes typically cause isotopic fractionation with increases in both the δ18o no3 and δ15n no3 values of residual nitrate producing data arrays on δ18o no3 vs δ15n no3 plots with slopes between approximately 0 5 and 1 0 granger and wankel 2016 in complex systems such as large watersheds nitrate source mixing and microbial reactions occur with varying effects depending on flow conditions and other environmental controls previous isotopic studies indicated that nitrate in the illinois river came from a mixture of urban and agricultural sources and there was evidence of seasonal variability in the dominant nitrate sources panno et al 2008 in agricultural watersheds of the illinois river basin nearly all nitrate export occurred between january and june and artificial tile drainage was an important mechanism for nitrate delivery from groundwater to streams kelly et al 2015 panno et al 2008 royer et al 2006 studies in this region and elsewhere indicate positive seasonal correlations between nitrate concentration and stream flow in agricultural watersheds can be related in part to stratified redox conditions and nitrate concentration of discharging groundwater e g fenelon and moore 1998 böhlke et al 2007 and may also reflect variation in the relative efficiency of in stream nitrate reduction alexander et al 2009 böhlke et al 2009 royer et al 2004 the goal of the current study was to use a relatively large comprehensive isotopic dataset to explore seasonal and spatial variability in nitrate sources urban vs agricultural and nitrate losses in the upper illinois river basin uirb we applied monthly measurements of nitrate concentration and its dual stable isotope ratios δ15n no3 δ18o no3 over four years to investigate links between hydrologic conditions and intra annual e g seasonal and inter annual variations in nitrate sources and export fluxes to the basin outlet we included tributary sampling to determine the roles of different subbasin land uses and tributary discharges in augmenting or diluting nitrate concentrations and altering nitrate isotopic composition in the uirb our study has general implications for understanding how nitrate sources and processes interact at various time scales in complex watersheds and it illustrates how isotopic data could be used to guide nutrient management strategies expectations and monitoring in midwestern u s and elsewhere 2 study area the uirb drains a total area of 37 353 km2 covering 38 counties in 4 states fig 1 72 of the basin area is in illinois 21 in indiana 7 in wisconsin and 0 1 in southeastern michigan 0 1 of the basin the river reach extends 214 5 km from lockport lock upstream on the des plaines river to peoria downstream on the illinois river tributaries and the associated subbasins are classified into three categories based on land use 1 the des plaines dupage chicago sanitary and ship canal river drains predominantly urban land 50 drainage area and receives discharge from major chicago wastewater treatment plants therefore is considered as an urban tributary 2 the agricultural tributaries are those draining predominantly agricultural land 75 of drainage area including aux sable creek mazon river vermilion river and big bureau creek 3 subbasins with 10 urban land and 75 agricultural land are defined as mixed land tributaries draining mixed land are two major tributaries of the uirb the kankakee river and the fox river agricultural land use accounted for about 75 of the land area in the entire uirb and urban land use accounted for about 17 of land area fig 1 the land use proportions were calculated based on the crop data layer 2008 of the national agricultural statistics service nass for the agricultural land area increasing demands for corn and soybeans have caused intensified cultivation of these crops which are the two principal row crops in the uirb in 2008 about 36 9 of the total uirb area was planted with corn and 21 6 with soybeans according to nass point sources in the chicago area are a major source of nutrients and other contaminants in the uirb panno et al 2008 there were about 196 wastewater treatment plants wtps discharging wastewater to streams in the basin in 2008 and most of them were located in the greater chicago area including the five largest wtps of the metropolitan water reclamation district of greater chicago mwrdgc namely stickney calumet northside kirie and egan in the order of decreasing capacity the stickney water reclamation plant swrp is the world s largest wtp it serves over 2 4 million people with a treatment capacity of about 4 5 million m3 per day thus its treated effluent plays an important role in the nitrate inventory of the uirb the stickney plant was built in the 1930 s and was not designed for nitrate removal however in 2016 new technology for phosphorus removal in the form of crystalline struvite magnesium ammonium phosphate was put into service at the plant the mwrdgc serves more than five million residents and thousands of industries of cook county illinois about 5 3 million m3 of wastewater is generated each day within this district all mwrdgc wastewater effluent drains into the chicago sanitary and ship canal which joins the des plaines river at lockport fig 1 during dry periods wtp effluent can make up large portion of flow in the sanitary and ship canal 3 methods 3 1 sample collection the illinois waterway monitoring project of the mwrdgc has conducted annual water quality surveys along the illinois waterway from the lockport lock to the peoria lock since 1984 to monitor water quality under the impact of the large and continuous amount of treated wastewater effluent released to the illinois waterway in the chicago region although stable isotope ratios of nitrogen and oxygen δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values in nitrate can provide important insights into nitrate sources transformations and mixing processes they were not routinely measured during monitoring surveys from october 2004 to december 2008 the mwrdgc surveys included sampling for nitrate isotope analyses in the upper illinois river and its tributaries fig 2 these samples represent a range of streamflow conditions fig 3 mostly related to seasonal base flow cycles high base flow in late fall and spring low base flow in summer and early fall relatively few samples were from short lived precipitation event related flow peaks and none were collected in the coldest winter months the stream water sample set was augmented with wtp effluent and shallow groundwater samples locations and names of sampling stations are reported in lin et al 2018 and their locations are shown in fig 2 three stream sampling programs were conducted for this study by mwrdgc personnel from 2004 to 2008 figs 2 and 3 1 quarterly water samples were collected from 49 stations along a 222 km reach of the illinois waterway which includes the chicago sanitary and ship canal and the des plaines river along with the illinois river downstream of the confluence of the des plaines and kankakee rivers in october of 2004 and may august and october of 2005 this sampling program occurred during a water year with its annual discharge 20 lower than the 35 year average 2 monthly samples were collected at seven of the illinois waterway stations from april to november in 2005 and from march to october in 2006 no winter sampling the selected stations were chicago sanitary and ship canal 1 des plaines river 4 and 8 and illinois river 20 23 30 and 39 3 monthly samples were collected from march through october 2008 from eight of the illinois waterway stations 1 4 8 20 30 39 45 plus nine stations on major tributaries just upstream of their outlets to the illinois river the sampled tributaries were des plaines river dp dupage river dr kankakee river kr aux sable creek ac mazon river mr fox river fr vermilion river vr and big bureau creek bc as well as senachwine lake sl a backwater lake fed by big bureau creek and connected to the illinois river the 2008 monthly samples were collected during a water year with its annual discharge 33 higher than the 35 year average august sampling was cancelled because of high water two collections were conducted in october one early and one late treated effluent samples were taken from the swrp also by mwrdgc personnel during all three of the regular sampling programs in addition groundwater samples were collected by university of illinois at chicago environmental isotope geochemistry lab personnel two shallow groundwater wells were sampled multiple times at the dixon waterfowl refuse near hennepin illinois one was a domestic water supply for a farmhouse on the property and one was at an outbuilding used for farm machinery storage and repair all stream water samples were collected at a depth of one meter below the surface in the center of the river channel with a submersible pump groundwater samples were collected from well discharge after thorough purging water was filtered on site through a 0 45 µm filter sealed in a hdpe bottle and then chilled during transport to the laboratory where it was stored frozen until thawed for analysis of nitrate concentration and isotopic composition 3 2 chemical analyses nitrogen and oxygen isotope ratios of nitrate were measured at the usgs reston stable isotope laboratory rsil using the bacterial denitrification method with pseudomonas aureofaciens casciotti et al 2002 coplen et al 2004 sigman et al 2001 denitrifying bacteria cultures were dispersed into vials from which atmospheric gases were then removed by flushing with helium gas water samples containing nitrate were added to the vials where the bacteria converted nitrate to nitrous oxide gas the produced nitrous oxide gas was then stripped from each vial by flushing again with helium gas and analyzed for isotopic compositions using a thermo finnigan delta series isotope ratio mass spectrometer the measurements were calibrated by analyzing nitrate isotopic reference materials along with the samples and then normalizing all data to reported reference values böhlke et al 2003 böhlke and coplen 1995 all isotope ratios are reported in the delta notation nitrogen isotope ratios of nitrate δ15n no3 are reported in per mil relative to atmospheric nitrogen gas which is defined as having a δ15n no3 value of 0 oxygen isotope ratios of nitrate δ18o no3 are reported in per mil relative to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow data reported in this study are consistent with the following values for nitrate isotopic reference materials for usgs34 δ15n 1 8 and δ18o 27 9 for usgs32 δ15n 180 and δ 18o 25 7 estimated uncertainties 2 sigma of normalized data are approximately 0 5 for δ15n and 1 0 for δ18o concentration of nitrate was measured at the mwrdgc laboratory using the automated colorimetry method established by the u s environmental protection agency usepa 2001 wasik and minarik 2009 with estimated uncertainties 2 sigma of approximately 2 5 percent other dissolved constituents sulfate and chloride concentration and the isotopic composition of water δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o were also measured with methods and results presented in supplemental information si and lin et al 2018 nitrate flux values were calculated at multiple locations in the watershed based on measured concentrations and daily mean discharge data lin et al 2018 obtained from u s geological survey national water information system daily mean discharge values of the illinois river at henry illinois during the study period are compared with the long term average values for the 35 year period from 1982 to 2016 in fig 3 3 3 statistical analyses since the measured water quality datasets of the uirb samples were moderately deviated from normal distribution the friedman test was carried out as the non parametric alternative to the repeated measures anova to test the respective impact of seasonal factor and location or land use factor on nitrate concentrations and isotopic ratios significance was determined at the 95 percent level p 0 05 for all tests post hoc analyses were carried out when friedman test results indicated a significant difference p 0 05 all statistical analyses were performed in r 3 2 2 r development core team 2017 4 results nitrate concentration and isotopic data for all samples are listed along with sample locations collection dates stream flows and other chemical and isotopic data in table s1 si and lin et al 2018 4 1 sampling program 1 quarterly sampling in 2004 and 2005 quarterly variations in no3 n concentration vs downstream distance in the illinois waterway are presented in fig 4 the friedman test and post hoc analyses results showed that river samples of may high base flow month 2005 had significantly p 0 05 higher no3 n concentrations median 5 4 mg l compared to those of low base flow months october 2004 median 4 4 mg l august 2005 median 2 9 mg l and october 2005 median 3 1 mg l overall higher no3 n concentrations were found in the upstream portion of the river and stickney wtp effluent samples representing the wtp effluent endmember had the highest measured no3 n concentrations a shift in no3 n concentration was observed at the confluence of the kankakee river and the des plaines river on the upstream side of the confluence no3 n concentrations were high at stations 1 through 10 including the chicago sanitary and ship canal and the des plaines river whereas on the downstream side of the confluence in the illinois river proper samples had lower no3 n concentrations the δ15n no3 values are plotted against δ18o no3 values in fig 5 observed δ18o no3 and δ15n no3 values generally increased downstream in both august and october however δ15n no3 values stayed relatively constant or decreased slightly along the illinois waterway in may 2005 indicating differences in nitrate sources and processes between spring march may and later seasons the friedman test and post hoc analyses results also supported the seasonal variation the δ15n no3 values of all river samples from may 2005 median 9 2 were significantly p 0 05 lower than the median values in other months 11 3 in august 2005 9 9 in october 2005 and 11 1 in october 2004 a corresponding shift in δ18o no3 values also can be observed with relatively low upstream δ18o no3 values at stations 1 through 10 and relatively high δ18o no3 values downstream of station 10 in contrast to δ15n no3 the median δ18o no3 value of river samples from may 2005 4 5 was higher than that in other months 3 1 in august 2005 1 2 in october 2005 and 2 6 in october 2004 the location and timing of the lowest no3 n concentrations corresponded to those of the highest δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values consistent with increasing effects of nitrate loss and isotopic fractionation in the downstream direction 4 2 sampling program 2 monthly sampling in 2005 and 2006 this sampling program occurred during two consecutive water years having below normal annual discharge fig 3 the swrp effluent chicago sanitary and ship canal and des plaines river 4 and 8 sites had variable no3 n concentrations over the year fig 6 a and b whereas the illinois river sites 20 23 30 and 39 had significantly p 0 05 higher concentrations in spring than in fall and summer the overall mean no3 n concentrations in chicago sanitary and ship canal and des plaines river samples were higher than those in illinois river samples for illinois river samples δ15n no3 values increased downstream in summer june august and fall september november but stayed relatively constant or decreased slightly along the illinois waterway in spring months spring δ15n no3 values ranging between 4 2 and 10 4 were also found to be significantly p 0 05 lower than summer ranging between 7 2 and 14 7 and fall values ranging between 7 9 and 15 3 fig 7 a and b a general increase of δ18o no3 with distance downstream in all seasons was observed in these monthly samples fig 7 in addition statistical analyses revealed significant seasonal variations p 0 05 in δ18o no3 values for example average δ18o no3 values of chicago sanitary and ship canal and des plaines river samples were 5 3 in spring 1 0 in summer and 0 2 in fall illinois river samples also exhibited a similar seasonal trend in average δ18o no3 values highest in spring 5 2 lower in summer 4 5 and lowest in fall 2 9 4 3 sampling program 3 monthly sampling in 2008 including tributary sampling in 2008 significant seasonal variation in nitrate concentration was observed in all stream samples between spring and fall p 0 05 the mean no3 n concentrations of all main stem main course of the upper illinois river samples were 4 6 mg l in spring 4 0 mg l in summer and 3 6 mg l in fall no3 n concentrations in some tributaries were higher than in the main stem year round except in september fig 6c tributaries with the highest mean no3 n concentrations were aux sable creek ac 5 7 mg l mazon river mr 5 6 mg l vermilion river vr 7 3 mg l and big bureau creek bc 9 8 mg l even though the seasonal contrast was not as evident in 2008 as in 2005 δ15n no3 values of main stem samples exhibited significant seasonal differences between spring and other seasons which generally increased downstream in summer and fall and decreased downstream in spring fig 7c the spring averages of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values of main stem samples in 2008 were 8 1 and 3 4 respectively while the summer averages were 9 4 and 3 3 and the fall averages were 9 4 and 1 3 respectively combined data in figs 7d and 8 indicate δ18o no3 values were elevated in agricultural tributaries in summer and fall 6 samples from urban tributaries and the main stem had lower δ18o no3 values than agricultural tributaries year round 4 4 relations with discharge combining all the measurements we found nitrate flux was well correlated with discharge r2 0 84 fig 9 a highest export fluxes of nitrate occurred at downstream illinois river main stem red and purple circles during high base flow discharge months agricultural tributaries triangles had lower nitrate fluxes compared to urban tributaries squares or tributaries with mixed land use diamonds nonetheless the highest nitrate concentrations were observed in some agricultural tributary samples fig 9b in these agricultural tributaries concentration was positively correlated with discharge resulting in high flux in high base flow period a similar trend was found in illinois river samples however concentration exhibited a negative correlation with discharge in urban tributary and in swrp samples indicating a different input and transport mechanisms in these systems δ15n no3 values were inversely related to discharge regardless of stream type and land use fig 9c δ18o no3 values were inversely related to discharge in urban tributaries swrp black circles and most agricultural tributaries but they were positively or poorly related to discharge in illinois river and tributaries with mixed land use fig 9d these contrasting correlations provided key information for identifying sources and transport processes of nitrate in the stream network 4 5 monthly and seasonal nitrate flux computed fluxes of nitrate for monthly sample dates in 2008 are shown in table 1 in the order of river distance downstream they were closely related to flow condition but land use also affected variability and timing of fluxes average flux values for spring summer and fall sample dates were also computed tributaries with urban dr and mixed land use kr fr had nitrate export fluxes in all months in comparison there was almost no export in september and low export in october from agricultural tributaries ac mr vr and bc unlike other sites the highest export in bc occurred in july and june monthly export at two illinois river stations 39 at henry and 20 at marseilles was relatively constant year round with the downstream site 39 exporting twice as much nitrate as the upstream site 20 and the highest export occurring in march seasonal ratios summer to spring and fall to spring respectively of nitrate flux were also computed to understand the extent of variation in nitrate export table 1 the urban tributary dr result exhibited higher fall spring ratio of average nitrate flux 0 96 than its summer spring ratio 0 59 the fall nitrate flux almost matched the spring flux while all other tributaries had much higher summer spring ratio ranging between 0 52 and 2 36 than fall spring ratio ranging between 0 12 and 0 49 the main stem results exhibited similar pattern with agricultural tributaries but the seasonal difference between summer and fall was smaller at both main stem sites 20 marseilles and 39 henry fall export of nitrate was 49 of the spring export the downstream site had proportionally higher summer export than the upstream site 5 discussion the nitrate dual isotope approach has been applied in many other watershed studies to identify nitrate sources and mixing relations and to seek evidence of nitrate attenuation in stream networks barnes and raymond 2010 burns et al 2009 hyer et al 2016 kendall et al 2007 li et al 2010 mayer et al 2002 xue et al 2009 chang et al 2002 the current study gives a new perspective on nitrate sources and behavior in the uirb which includes some of the most concentrated sources of nitrate export from both urban and agricultural origins on the north american continent previous studies indicated urban and agricultural nitrate sources and provided evidence of nitrate reduction in parts of the illinois river basin david and gentry 2000 panno et al 2008 our larger dataset provides additional resolution of spatial and temporal patterns of nitrate sources mixing and losses in this important region isotopic characteristics of nitrate are related in part to the isotopic compositions of n and o that were incorporated during nitrate formation isotopic fractionation that occurred during or soon after nitrate formation at the source and subsequent isotopic fractionation largely related to microbial nitrate reduction during transport through groundwater and streams in the current study isotopic characteristics of the major nitrate sources were inferred from limited analyses of prospective sources analyses of stream samples considered least likely to have been altered by nitrate reduction during transport and limited comparison with published data variable losses due to net microbial nitrate reduction were inferred from correlated arrays of elevated δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values with apparent slopes δδ18o δδ15n between 0 5 and 1 0 granger et al 2008 granger and wankel 2016 it is emphasized that some previously reported δ18o no3 values may be substantially different from recent data including ours because of analytical artifacts and improvements in calibration data böhlke et al 2003 révész and böhlke 2002 thus previously reported data may not be directly comparable to ours unless calibrated similarly 5 1 nitrate sources in the upper illinois river and its tributaries previous studies have identified dominant sources of nitrate in the uirb treated wastewater effluent and discharge from agricultural watersheds david et al 2010 panno et al 2008 agricultural nitrate can be derived from various sources of n fertilizer manure and soil derived from farming activities and animal feeding operations animal manure derived nitrate was identified as a source of elevated nitrate concentrations in some wells panno et al 2009 however manure was not considered a major source of nitrate in the illinois river david et al 2010 panno et al 2008 usgs county level input data indicated the average contribution from manure n in the uirb counties was about 11 of the fertilizer input during 2006 and 2007 gronberg and arnold 2017 gronberg and spahr 2012 in the current study two nitrate end members were identified by their characteristic isotopic compositions and no3 n concentrations in the basin as shown in fig 8 large urban point sources were represented by the swrp effluent black solid circles with mean values of δ15n no3 8 6 1 7 δ18o no3 0 8 1 4 and concentration averaging 8 6 mg l agricultural sources were represented by shallow groundwater sampled in agricultural area green open circles with mean values of δ15n no3 3 4 0 6 δ18o no3 3 7 0 5 concentration averaging 3 4 mg l endmembers were based on limited sampling and may not encompass the range of source characteristics of each type nonetheless the swrp endmember isotopic composition is supported by the fact that it plots near the origin of an apparent isotopic fractionation trend interpreted to represent nitrate subjected to variable microbial reduction in river samples most likely to be dominated by urban sources fig 8 similarly the groundwater samples plot near the origin of an apparent isotopic fractionation trend representing variably reduced nitrate in agricultural tributary streams and in tile drains where tile drains are an important pathway for delivery of agricultural nitrate from shallow groundwater to streams isotopic data indicate nitrate from both major sources was formed predominantly by nitrification of reduced nitrogen the contrast between urban and agricultural δ15n no3 values is consistent with the different nitrogen sources wastewater n versus soil and fertilizer n likely modified slightly in both cases by minor nitrogen losses before or after nitrification the contrast in δ18o no3 values may reflect differences in the nitrifying environments wtp aquatic treatment systems versus agricultural soils that affected isotope fractionation processes during nitrification or subsequent reactions boshers et al 2018 lab and field studies indicate nitrate formed by nitrification in saturated homogeneous systems commonly has δ18o no3 near that of the environmental water boshers et al 2018 buchwald et al 2012 whereas nitrate leached from soils into groundwater and streams typically has δ18o no3 significantly higher than that of local water and commonly similar to that estimated by assuming a 2 1 mixture of water and atmospheric oxygen kendall et al 2007 xue et al 2009 in the uirb given an unaltered atmospheric δ18o o2 value of 24 luz and barkan 2011 and a regional mean meteoric water δ18o h2o of around 7 table s1 the latter assumption would yield a δ18o no3 value of around 3 roughly similar to those of the agricultural groundwater and least fractionated agricultural tributary stream samples in fig 8 the lower and more variable δ18o no3 values of swrp samples could reflect smaller overall influence of o2 o relatively high and variable reaction rates or greater isotopic discrimination effects during nitrification in the wtp the upstream portion of the illinois river system above the confluence of the kankakee and des plaines rivers had higher no3 n concentrations than the downstream portion most of the time except in spring indicating watershed scale seasonal variation in nitrate sources or transport processes there was a higher proportion of agricultural land in the downstream region as opposed to the dominantly urban land use and wtp nitrate sources in the upstream portion large amounts of nitrate were leached from agricultural watersheds in spring when water levels were high soils were exposed and fertilizers were applied causing elevated stream nitrate concentrations in the high base flow months during low base flow seasons summer and fall the illinois river nitrate was diluted by the kankakee river and other agricultural tributaries because of reduced nitrate concentrations and discharges from those watersheds while the upstream wtp input remained relatively constant this seasonal pattern in nitrate concentration was consistent with the nitrate isotopic compositions in illinois river samples in the upstream portion of the river δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values were similar to the mean swrp values throughout the sampled portions of the year fig 8 indicating wtp effluent had a greater impact on riverine nitrate in the upstream portion and relatively insignificant in stream denitrification here tributaries flowing through urban or mixed land use areas had nitrate isotope ratios similar to the swrp values especially during low flow months figs 7d and 8 indicating a sustained input from urban point sources in these tributaries the relatively higher δ18o no3 values and nitrate concentrations associated with the relatively lower δ15n no3 values of the downstream portion of the uirb suggested that agricultural input was the dominant source of nitrate in the main stem river in spring high base flow season spring samples of uirb agricultural tributaries had nitrate isotope ratios similar to the shallow agricultural groundwater values fig 7d and 8 which were similar to reported values for nitrate derived from nitrification of nh4 fertilizers or soils in illinois δ15n no3 values 2 4 δ18o no3 values 12 8 kelley et al 2013 kendall et al 2007 panno et al 2008 therefore leached nitrate transported through shallow groundwater including tile drainage in agricultural land could be the primary nitrate source to these tributaries it was estimated that the majority 85 of synthetic fertilizer applied in illinois was anhydrous nh3 panno et al 2008 which was subject to nitrification after application and subsequent leaching to surface water groundwater and the tile drainage system this process likely contributed to large transient increases in the no3 n concentrations in these tributaries when high base flow occurred fig 9b such phenomenon has been documented in a number of long term studies of agricultural runoff throughout the central u s booth and campbell 2007 ikenberry et al 2014 royer et al 2006 5 2 temporal variation in nitrate transport and reduction isotopic fractionation indicating nitrate reduction during low base flow period was observed in many samples figs 7 and 8 the two dashed trend lines in fig 8 indicate apparent fractionation slopes in agricultural tributaries slope 0 57 and the illinois river slope 0 73 during low flow months that are slightly different from each other but within the range of fractionation trends reported for nitrate reduction e g denitrification flux calculations were useful for interpreting land use effects on seasonal nitrate export variations most of spring nitrate export occurred in tributaries with agricultural or mixed land use table 1 reduction of nitrate fluxes accelerated in late summer when seasonal export decreased to 85 of spring export in most tributaries export continued to decrease to less than or equal to 35 of spring values in all agricultural tributaries in fall when export in the urban tributary nearly recovered to its spring level and exceeded those of most agricultural tributaries the bc tributary exhibited an unusual seasonal flux pattern in which its summer export was over twice as much as spring flux further examination of local land management activities would be required to understand this distinctive pattern the degree of the seasonal variation was controlled by land use pattern streams having mixed land use had nitrate concentrations and isotopic compositions that were only partly influenced by seasonal variations in agricultural input the monthly average flux of main stem stations also showed the wtp source exhibited fewer seasonal variations and was the major source during low flow times which is also indicated in fig 8 where the trajectory of main stem denitrification starts from the wtp source 5 3 spatial variation in nitrate transport and reduction in general nitrate losses and associated isotopic fractionations through the illinois river system at low flow could be related to some combination of 1 in stream including hyporheic nitrate loss within the main stem river 2 in stream including hyporheic nitrate loss in the tributary stream networks and 3 switch from high nitrate groundwater discharge to low nitrate groundwater discharge because of redox stratification in aquifers underlying the tributary watersheds especially those with tile drains presumably these options could have different effects on the relative losses of wtp nitrate by options 1 and 2 only in comparison to agricultural nitrate by all 3 options the seasonal export ratios in table 1 showed that most of the season losses of nitrate occurred in agricultural watersheds and tributaries and there were relatively fewer losses in the main stem river or in tributaries with other land use our findings agreed with previous studies showing that nitrate removal was more efficient in small tributaries than in large rivers alexander et al 2000 peterson et al 2001 distinctive patterns in nitrate mixing and reduction were also observed in isotopic values of tributaries figs 8 and 9 nitrate isotope ratios of agricultural tributary samples were highly fractionated during summer and fall months fig 8 exhibiting elevated δ18o no3 and δ15n no3 values with lower discharge and nitrate concentration fig 9 the decrease in nitrate export from agricultural watersheds in dry months was interpreted as a combined result of less discharge of unreduced nitrate bearing groundwater plus more efficient nitrate reduction in benthic sediments along the stream networks böhlke et al 2009 harvey et al 2013 royer et al 2004 the groundwater source included tile drains as variably reduced groundwater discharges along with other deeper flow paths that were more reducing in contrast urban tributary samples had higher concentrations during low flow periods accompanied by higher δ15n no3 values but less systematic changes in δ18o no3 fig 9c and d largely indicating seasonal change of dominant nitrate source rather than reduction process urban point sources had greater impact on these tributaries during low base flow period when the agricultural contribution was relatively insignificant the intermediate position of nitrate isotopic data of tributary samples with mixed land use was consistent with mixtures of urban wtp effluent and agriculture derived nitrate fig 8 the nitrate isotopic compositions and fluxes of main stem samples indicated seasonal variations in its nitrate mixing and transport processes the conceptual diagrams in fig 10 further illustrate the dominant processes in different seasons the characteristic slope of nitrate reduction had a different trajectory from that of mixing of the two principle sources such that source information could be preserved in the fractionated samples at high base flow wtp sources represented by swrp dominated upstream portions of the main stem and agricultural sources dominated downstream portions figs 8 and 10 agricultural tributaries delivered large nitrate fluxes during the spring season the isotope ratios indicated all sources mixed in spring with relatively little effect of nitrate reduction fig 10b at low base flow in summer and fall wtp sources appeared to dominate the entire main stem river while some loss and fractionation occurred downstream producing the lower of the two positive trends in fig 10b the slope of this trend was slightly higher than that of the upper agricultural trend possibly indicating downstream addition of minor isotopically fractionated agricultural inputs thus much of the agricultural nitrate loss and isotopic fractionation may have occurred in saturated soils or groundwaters before being discharged to streams as indicated by data from tile drains as well as within the stream networks while both agricultural discharge and wtp nitrate were affected by in stream losses at low flow 5 4 impact of discharge and land use on watershed nitrate export nitrate flux was highest in march in most of the streams followed by other high base flow months table 1 this observation is consistent with previous studies in the mid continent agricultural region in u s indicating nitrate concentrations and fluxes commonly are highest in the spring when base flow is highest the only exception with highest export occurring in july was bc alexander et al 2009 royer et al 2006 october export was higher than in other late summer and fall months due to relatively high discharge and riverine nitrate concentration nitrate not assimilated by plants during july september may have accumulated in dry soil and was more susceptible to being flushed or leached when infiltration and recharge increased after the growing season as a result relatively high nitrate concentrations were found in agricultural tributaries in october averaging 5 3 mg l in comparison to the average concentration in september being 1 3 mg l urban and agricultural watersheds had different seasonal patterns of nitrate concentrations and fluxes in fig 9 negative correlations between discharge and nitrate concentration in urban watersheds likely indicated dilution of point source wtp effluents in response to increased precipitation and surface water runoff into chicago s combined sewer system with the exception of some high peak flow events positive relations between discharge and nitrate concentration and flux were typical for agricultural watersheds in the region which may result from increased soil leaching during periods of high rainfall snowmelt and low evapotranspiration and associated elevated flows from agricultural tile drainage mixed agricultural urban streams diamonds yielded intermediate slopes that could be either negative fr or positive kr and illinois rivers depending on the overall extent of agricultural influence on the nitrate concentration of the stream lastly our data indicated inter annual variations in nitrate fluxes concentrations and isotopic compositions that were correlated with inter annual variations in discharge fig 7 comparing our isotopic results from three different sampling programs in water years 2004 2005 and 2008 it appears that isotopic fractionation effects associated with nitrate reduction were more pronounced in years with low flow fig 7 the isotopic fractionation trend in the main stem samples was more distinguishable in 2005 fig 5 than in 2008 fig 7c the integrated annual discharge of water year 2005 was 20 lower than the 35 year average while that of water year 2008 was 33 higher than the 35 year average fig 3 6 conclusions conceptual models of spatial and temporal variations of nitrate concentrations and isotopic composition in the uirb are summarized in fig 10 in spring season at relatively high base flow conditions wtp effluent nitrate from upstream sources was diluted and eventually largely overwhelmed by agricultural input in the downstream portion and neither source was greatly reduced in transit however the agricultural contribution decreased significantly in tributaries as well as in the illinois river during summer and fall when both flow and nitrate concentration decreased spatial isotopic patterns in low flow conditions are consistent with substantial nitrate reduction prior to discharge in agricultural watersheds as well as after discharge within the stream corridors we found nitrate flux decreased to 50 of spring export during fall in the main stem river measurements of nitrate concentrations and isotopic compositions in river water are useful indicators of nitrate sources mixing and in stream loss processes the isotopic composition of nitrate in the uirb varied with location land use and seasonal flow conditions the results of this study could be used as a basis for a

6852,to improve understanding of spatial seasonal and inter annual variations in nitrate sources and in stream processes in the illinois river system nitrate concentrations and isotopic compositions were measured in 445 water samples collected over a four year period 2004 2008 from the upper illinois river basin uirb samples included surface water in the river and major tributaries effluent samples from chicago s largest wastewater treatment plant wtp and representative groundwater from shallow wells in agricultural land two principal nitrate endmember sources within the uirb had distinctive isotopic compositions wtp effluent with δ15n 8 6 1 7 and δ18o 0 8 1 4 and agricultural groundwater with δ15n no3 3 4 0 6 and δ18o 3 7 0 5 when minimally affected by nitrate reduction isotopic data indicated that the large pulse of nitrate exported from the river basin during the spring was mostly derived from agricultural land drainage while nitrate from large wtp effluent point sources was predominant in the upper reaches of the river near chicago during low base flow conditions in late summer and fall the agricultural nitrate source was greatly diminished and the headwater wtp source was predominant in the river basin export our results indicated biogeochemical nitrate reduction and isotopic fractionation occurred within the river network affecting both agricultural and urban sources during surface water transport in addition diminished agricultural nitrate export was attributable to preferential discharge of biogeochemically reduced groundwater during low base flow isotopic indicators of spatial and seasonal variations in the relative importance of different nitrate sources and their relative susceptibility to natural attenuation might be useful for guiding

phytoplankton blooms and bottom water hypoxia in lakes and coastal waters and release of greenhouse gases through denitrification sobota et al 2015 van grinsven et al 2013 high riverine nitrate export to the gulf of mexico has contributed to the formation of summertime hypoxia off the coast and was found to be related to land use patterns in the mississippi river basin including widespread cultivation of row crops such as corn and soybeans along with substantial contributions from treated wastewater effluent in urban areas with high population density david et al 1997 david et al 2010 goolsby et al 1999 royer et al 2006 donner et al 2004 alexander et al 2008 because of the magnitude and complexity of the problem the mississippi river gulf of mexico hypoxia task force extended the target date for reducing the gulf hypoxic zone from 2015 to 2035 with an intermediate goal of a 20 reduction in nutrient loads by 2025 u s environmental protection agency usepa 2015 the illinois river is a major tributary of the mississippi river and flows through one of the most productive farming regions in the us some of its tributaries also flow through the most populated and urbanized region in the midwestern us the chicago metropolitan region arnold et al 1999 the illinois river basin has been identified as one of the principal watersheds contributing nutrients to the mississippi river markus et al 2013 terrio 2006 although n also occurs in the form of ammonium and organic compounds nitrate is the major dissolved n species under most conditions in streams and rivers draining the upper mississippi river watershed goolsby and battaglin 2001 thus it is critical to understand the sources and behavior of nitrate in watersheds such as the illinois river basin in order to control and reduce nitrate flux to the gulf recent long term trend work showed either little change or even a slight decline in the flow normalized nitrate flux between the late 20th century and early 21st century in the illinois river mcisaac et al 2016 murphy et al 2013 sprague et al 2011 regression studies also found the flow normalized nitrate concentration declined significantly during the same period in the illinois river markus et al 2013 mcisaac et al 2016 such changes were attributed to the increase in agricultural nitrogen use efficiency a possible depletion of legacy nitrogen and or improvements in the urban sewage system garcía et al 2016 mcisaac et al 2016 however there is no declining trend in the actual nitrate flux not flow normalized from the watershed markus et al 2013 and nitrate load of the illinois river remains high identifying nitrate sources and understanding its transport mechanisms are still challenging because of mixing and complex biogeochemical n transformation processes alexander et al 2009 groffman et al 2006 nestler et al 2011 stable isotope ratios of n and o in nitrate δ15n no3 δ18o no3 can provide information about nitrate sources and

competing n cycle processes and changing spatial and temporal patterns of streamflow and nitrate concentration isotopic discrimination of nitrate sources e g fertilizer n versus wastewater n is possible in some situations whereas net microbial nitrate reduction processes typically cause isotopic fractionation with increases in both the δ18o no3 and δ15n no3 values of residual nitrate

microbial reactions occur with varying effects depending on flow conditions and other environmental controls previous isotopic studies indicated that nitrate in the illinois river came from a mixture of urban and agricultural sources and there was evidence of seasonal variability in the dominant nitrate sources panno et al 2008 in agricultural watersheds of the illinois river basin nearly all nitrate export occurred between january and june and artificial tile drainage was an important mechanism for nitrate delivery from groundwater to streams kelly et al 2015 panno et al 2008 royer et al 2006 studies in this region and elsewhere indicate positive seasonal correlations between nitrate concentration and stream flow in agricultural watersheds can be related in part to stratified redox conditions and nitrate concentration of discharging groundwater e g fenelon and moore 1998 böhlke et al 2007 and may also reflect variation in the relative efficiency of in stream nitrate reduction alexander et al 2009 böhlke et al 2009 royer et al 2004 the goal of the current study was to use a relatively large comprehensive isotopic dataset to explore seasonal and spatial variability in nitrate sources urban vs agricultural and nitrate losses in the upper illinois river basin uirb we applied monthly measurements of nitrate concentration and its dual stable isotope ratios δ15n no3 δ18o no3 over four years to investigate links between hydrologic conditions and intra annual e g seasonal and inter annual variations in nitrate sources and export fluxes to the basin outlet we included tributary sampling to determine the roles of different subbasin land uses and tributary discharges in augmenting or diluting nitrate concentrations and altering nitrate isotopic composition in the uirb our study has general implications for understanding how nitrate sources and processes interact at various time scales in complex watersheds and it illustrates how isotopic data could be used to guide nutrient management strategies expectations and monitoring in midwestern u s and elsewhere 2 study area the uirb drains a total area of 37 353 km2 covering 38 counties in 4 states fig 1 72 of the basin area is in illinois 21 in indiana 7 in wisconsin and 0 1 in southeastern michigan 0 1 of the basin the river reach extends 214 5 km from lockport lock upstream on the des plaines river to peoria downstream on the illinois river tributaries and the associated subbasins are classified into three categories based on land use 1 the des plaines dupage chicago sanitary and ship canal river drains predominantly urban land 50 drainage area and receives discharge from major chicago wastewater treatment plants therefore is considered as an urban tributary 2 the agricultural tributaries are those draining predominantly agricultural land 75 of drainage area including aux sable creek mazon river vermilion river and big bureau creek 3 subbasins with 10 urban land and 75 agricultural land are defined as mixed land tributaries draining mixed land are two major tributaries of the uirb the kankakee river and the fox river agricultural land use accounted for about 75 of the land area in the entire uirb and urban land use accounted for about 17 of land area fig 1 the land use proportions were calculated based on the crop data layer 2008 of the national agricultural statistics service nass for the agricultural land area increasing demands for corn and soybeans have caused intensified cultivation of these crops which are the two principal row crops in the uirb in 2008 about 36 9 of the total uirb area was planted with corn and 21 6 with soybeans according to nass point sources in the chicago area are a major source of nutrients and other contaminants in the uirb panno et al 2008 there were about 196 wastewater treatment plants wtps discharging wastewater to streams in the basin in 2008 and most of them were located in the greater chicago area including the five largest wtps of the metropolitan water reclamation district of greater chicago mwrdgc namely stickney calumet northside kirie and egan in the order of decreasing capacity the stickney water reclamation plant swrp is the world s largest wtp it serves over 2 4 million people with a treatment capacity of about 4 5 million m3 per day thus its treated effluent plays an important role in the nitrate inventory of the uirb the stickney plant was built in the 1930 s and was not designed for nitrate removal however in 2016 new technology for phosphorus removal in the form of crystalline struvite magnesium ammonium phosphate was put into service at the plant the mwrdgc serves more than five million residents and thousands of industries of cook county illinois about 5 3 million m3 of wastewater is generated each day within this district all mwrdgc wastewater effluent drains into the chicago sanitary and ship canal which joins the des plaines river at lockport fig 1 during dry periods wtp effluent can make up large portion of flow in the sanitary and ship canal 3 methods 3 1 sample collection the illinois waterway monitoring project of the mwrdgc has conducted annual water quality surveys along the illinois waterway from the lockport lock to the peoria lock since 1984 to monitor water quality under the impact of the large and continuous amount of treated wastewater effluent released to the illinois waterway in the chicago region although stable isotope ratios of nitrogen and oxygen δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values in nitrate can provide important insights into nitrate sources transformations and mixing processes they were not routinely measured during monitoring surveys from october 2004 to december 2008 the mwrdgc surveys included sampling for nitrate isotope analyses in the upper illinois river and its tributaries fig 2 these samples represent a range of streamflow conditions fig 3 mostly related to seasonal base flow cycles high base flow in late fall and spring low base flow in summer and early fall relatively few samples were from short lived precipitation event related flow peaks and none were collected in the coldest winter months the stream water sample set was augmented with wtp effluent and shallow groundwater samples locations and names of sampling stations are reported in lin et al 2018 and their locations are shown in fig 2 three stream sampling programs were conducted for this study by mwrdgc personnel from 2004 to 2008 figs 2 and 3 1 quarterly water samples were collected from 49 stations along a 222 km reach of the illinois waterway which includes the chicago sanitary and ship canal and the des plaines river along with the illinois river downstream of the confluence of the des plaines and kankakee rivers in october of 2004 and may august and october of 2005 this sampling program occurred during a water year with its annual discharge 20 lower than the 35 year average 2 monthly samples were collected at seven of the illinois waterway stations from april to november in 2005 and from march to october in 2006 no winter sampling the selected stations were chicago sanitary and ship canal 1 des plaines river 4 and 8 and illinois river 20 23 30 and 39 3 monthly samples were collected from march through october 2008 from eight of the illinois waterway stations 1 4 8 20 30 39 45 plus nine stations on major tributaries just upstream of their outlets to the illinois river the sampled tributaries were des plaines river dp dupage river dr kankakee river kr aux sable creek ac mazon river mr fox river fr vermilion river vr and big bureau creek bc as well as senachwine lake sl a backwater lake fed by big bureau creek and connected to the illinois river the 2008 monthly samples were collected during a water year with its annual discharge 33 higher than the 35 year average august sampling was cancelled because of high water two collections were conducted in october one early and one late treated effluent samples were taken from the swrp also by mwrdgc personnel during all three of the regular sampling programs in addition groundwater samples were collected by university of illinois at chicago environmental isotope geochemistry lab personnel two shallow groundwater wells were sampled multiple times at the dixon waterfowl refuse near hennepin illinois one was a domestic water supply for a farmhouse on the property and one was at an outbuilding used for farm machinery storage and repair all stream water samples were collected at a depth of one meter below the surface in the center of the river channel with a submersible pump groundwater samples were collected from well discharge after thorough purging water was filtered on site through a 0 45 µm filter sealed in a hdpe bottle and then chilled during transport to the laboratory where it was stored frozen until thawed for analysis of nitrate concentration and isotopic composition 3 2 chemical analyses nitrogen and oxygen isotope ratios of nitrate were measured at the usgs reston stable isotope laboratory rsil using the bacterial denitrification method with pseudomonas aureofaciens casciotti et al 2002 coplen et al 2004 sigman et al 2001 denitrifying bacteria cultures were dispersed into vials from which atmospheric gases were then removed by flushing with helium gas water samples containing nitrate were added to the vials where the bacteria converted nitrate to nitrous oxide gas the produced nitrous oxide gas was then stripped from each vial by flushing again with helium gas and analyzed for isotopic compositions using a thermo finnigan delta series isotope ratio mass spectrometer the measurements were calibrated by analyzing nitrate isotopic reference materials along with the samples and then normalizing all data to reported reference values böhlke et al 2003 böhlke and coplen 1995 all isotope ratios are reported in the delta notation nitrogen isotope ratios of nitrate δ15n no3 are reported in per mil relative to atmospheric nitrogen gas which is defined as having a δ15n no3 value of 0 oxygen isotope ratios of nitrate δ18o no3 are reported in per mil relative to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow data reported in this study are consistent with the following values for nitrate isotopic reference materials for usgs34 δ15n 1 8 and δ18o 27 9 for usgs32 δ15n 180 and δ 18o 25 7 estimated uncertainties 2 sigma of normalized data are approximately 0 5 for δ15n and 1 0 for δ18o concentration of nitrate was measured at the mwrdgc laboratory using the automated colorimetry method established by the u s environmental protection agency usepa 2001 wasik and minarik 2009 with estimated uncertainties 2 sigma of approximately 2 5 percent other dissolved constituents sulfate and chloride concentration and the isotopic composition of water δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o were also measured with methods and results presented in supplemental information si and lin et al 2018 nitrate flux values were calculated at multiple locations in the watershed based on measured concentrations and daily mean discharge data lin et al 2018 obtained from u s geological survey national water information system daily mean discharge values of the illinois river at henry illinois during the study period are compared with the long term average values for the 35 year period from 1982 to 2016 in fig 3 3 3 statistical analyses since the measured water quality datasets of the uirb samples were moderately deviated from normal distribution the friedman test was carried out as the non parametric alternative to the repeated measures anova to test the respective impact of seasonal factor and location or land use factor on nitrate concentrations and isotopic ratios significance was determined at the 95 percent level p 0 05 for all tests post hoc analyses were carried out when friedman test results indicated a significant difference p 0 05 all statistical analyses were performed in r 3 2 2 r development core team 2017 4 results nitrate concentration and isotopic data for all samples are listed along with sample locations collection dates stream flows and other chemical and isotopic data in table s1 si and lin et al 2018 4 1 sampling program 1 quarterly sampling in 2004 and 2005 quarterly variations in no3 n concentration vs downstream distance in the illinois waterway are presented in fig 4 the friedman test and post hoc analyses results showed that river samples of may high base flow month 2005 had significantly p 0 05 higher no3 n concentrations median 5 4 mg l compared to those of low base flow months october 2004 median 4 4 mg l august 2005 median 2 9 mg l and october 2005 median 3 1 mg l overall higher no3 n concentrations were found in the upstream portion of the river and stickney wtp effluent samples representing the wtp effluent endmember had the highest measured no3 n concentrations a shift in no3 n concentration was observed at the confluence of the kankakee river and the des plaines river on the upstream side of the confluence no3 n concentrations were high at stations 1 through 10 including the chicago sanitary and ship canal and the des plaines river whereas on the downstream side of the confluence in the illinois river proper samples had lower no3 n concentrations the δ15n no3 values are plotted against δ18o no3 values in fig 5 observed δ18o no3 and δ15n no3 values generally increased downstream in both august and october however δ15n no3 values stayed relatively constant or decreased slightly along the illinois waterway in may 2005 indicating differences in nitrate sources and processes between spring march may and later seasons the friedman test and post hoc analyses results also supported the seasonal variation the δ15n no3 values of all river samples from may 2005 median 9 2 were significantly p 0 05 lower than the median values in other months 11 3 in august 2005 9 9 in october 2005 and 11 1 in october 2004 a corresponding shift in δ18o no3 values also can be observed with relatively low upstream δ18o no3 values at stations 1 through 10 and relatively high δ18o no3 values downstream of station 10 in contrast to δ15n no3 the median δ18o no3 value of river samples from may 2005 4 5 was higher than that in other months 3 1 in august 2005 1 2 in october 2005 and 2 6 in october 2004 the location and timing of the lowest no3 n concentrations corresponded to those of the highest δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values consistent with increasing effects of nitrate loss and isotopic fractionation in the downstream direction 4 2 sampling program 2 monthly sampling in 2005 and 2006 this sampling program occurred during two consecutive water years having below normal annual discharge fig 3 the swrp effluent chicago sanitary and ship canal and des plaines river 4 and 8 sites had variable no3 n concentrations over the year fig 6 a and b whereas the illinois river sites 20 23 30 and 39 had significantly p 0 05 higher concentrations in spring than in fall and summer the overall mean no3 n concentrations in chicago sanitary and ship canal and des plaines river samples were higher than those in illinois river samples for illinois river samples δ15n no3 values increased downstream in summer june august and fall september november but stayed relatively constant or decreased slightly along the illinois waterway in spring months spring δ15n no3 values ranging between 4 2 and 10 4 were also found to be significantly p 0 05 lower than summer ranging between 7 2 and 14 7 and fall values ranging between 7 9 and 15 3 fig 7 a and b a general increase of δ18o no3 with distance downstream in all seasons was observed in these monthly samples fig 7 in addition statistical analyses revealed significant seasonal variations p 0 05 in δ18o no3 values for example average δ18o no3 values of chicago sanitary and ship canal and des plaines river samples were 5 3 in spring 1 0 in summer and 0 2 in fall illinois river samples also exhibited a similar seasonal trend in average δ18o no3 values highest in spring 5 2 lower in summer 4 5 and lowest in fall 2 9 4 3 sampling program 3 monthly sampling in 2008 including tributary sampling in 2008 significant seasonal variation in nitrate concentration was observed in all stream samples between spring and fall p 0 05 the mean no3 n concentrations of all main stem main course of the upper illinois river samples were 4 6 mg l in spring 4 0 mg l in summer and 3 6 mg l in fall no3 n concentrations in some tributaries were higher than in the main stem year round except in september fig 6c tributaries with the highest mean no3 n concentrations were aux sable creek ac 5 7 mg l mazon river mr 5 6 mg l vermilion river vr 7 3 mg l and big bureau creek bc 9 8 mg l even though the seasonal contrast was not as evident in 2008 as in 2005 δ15n no3 values of main stem samples exhibited significant seasonal differences between spring and other seasons which generally increased downstream in summer and fall and decreased downstream in spring fig 7c the spring averages of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values of main stem samples in 2008 were 8 1 and 3 4 respectively while the summer averages were 9 4 and 3 3 and the fall averages were 9 4 and 1 3 respectively combined data in figs 7d and 8 indicate δ18o no3 values were elevated in agricultural tributaries in summer and fall 6 samples from urban tributaries and the main stem had lower δ18o no3 values than agricultural tributaries year round 4 4 relations with discharge combining all the measurements we found nitrate flux was well correlated with discharge r2 0 84 fig 9 a highest export fluxes of nitrate occurred at downstream illinois river main stem red and purple circles during high base flow discharge months agricultural tributaries triangles had lower nitrate fluxes compared to urban tributaries squares or tributaries with mixed land use diamonds nonetheless the highest nitrate concentrations were observed in some agricultural tributary samples fig 9b in these agricultural tributaries concentration was positively correlated with discharge resulting in high flux in high base flow period a similar trend was found in illinois river samples however concentration exhibited a negative correlation with discharge in urban tributary and in swrp samples indicating a different input and transport mechanisms in these systems δ15n no3 values were inversely related to discharge regardless of stream type and land use fig 9c δ18o no3 values were inversely related to discharge in urban tributaries swrp black circles and most agricultural tributaries but they were positively or poorly related to discharge in illinois river and tributaries with mixed land use fig 9d these contrasting correlations provided key information for identifying sources and transport processes of nitrate in the stream network 4 5 monthly and seasonal nitrate flux computed fluxes of nitrate for monthly sample dates in 2008 are shown in table 1 in the order of river distance downstream they were closely related to flow condition but land use also affected variability and timing of fluxes average flux values for spring summer and fall sample dates were also computed tributaries with urban dr and mixed land use kr fr had nitrate export fluxes in all months in comparison there was almost no export in september and low export in october from agricultural tributaries ac mr vr and bc unlike other sites the highest export in bc occurred in july and june monthly export at two illinois river stations 39 at henry and 20 at marseilles was relatively constant year round with the downstream site 39 exporting twice as much nitrate as the upstream site 20 and the highest export occurring in march seasonal ratios summer to spring and fall to spring respectively of nitrate flux were also computed to understand the extent of variation in nitrate export table 1 the urban tributary dr result exhibited higher fall spring ratio of average nitrate flux 0 96 than its summer spring ratio 0 59 the fall nitrate flux almost matched the spring flux while all other tributaries had much higher summer spring ratio ranging between 0 52 and 2 36 than fall spring ratio ranging between 0 12 and 0 49 the main stem results exhibited similar pattern with agricultural tributaries but the seasonal difference between summer and fall was smaller at both main stem sites 20 marseilles and 39 henry fall export of nitrate was 49 of the spring export the downstream site had proportionally higher summer export than the upstream site 5 discussion the nitrate dual isotope approach has been applied in many other watershed studies to identify nitrate sources and mixing relations and to seek evidence of nitrate attenuation in stream networks barnes and raymond 2010 burns et al 2009 hyer et al 2016 kendall et al 2007 li et al 2010 mayer et al 2002 xue et al 2009 chang et al 2002 the current study gives a new perspective on nitrate sources and behavior in the uirb which includes some of the most concentrated sources of nitrate export from both urban and agricultural origins on the north american continent previous studies indicated urban and agricultural nitrate sources and provided evidence of nitrate reduction in parts of the illinois river basin david and gentry 2000 panno et al 2008 our larger dataset provides additional resolution of spatial and temporal patterns of nitrate sources mixing and losses in this important region isotopic characteristics of nitrate are related in part to the isotopic compositions of n and o that were incorporated during nitrate formation isotopic fractionation that occurred during or soon after nitrate formation at the source and subsequent isotopic fractionation largely related to microbial nitrate reduction during transport through groundwater and streams in the current study isotopic characteristics of the major nitrate sources were inferred from limited analyses of prospective sources analyses of stream samples considered least likely to have been altered by nitrate reduction during transport and limited comparison with published data variable losses due to net microbial nitrate reduction were inferred from correlated arrays of elevated δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values with apparent slopes δδ18o δδ15n between 0 5 and 1 0 granger et al 2008 granger and wankel 2016 it is emphasized that some previously reported δ18o no3 values may be substantially different from recent data including ours because of analytical artifacts and improvements in calibration data böhlke et al 2003 révész and böhlke 2002 thus previously reported data may not be directly comparable to ours unless calibrated similarly 5 1 nitrate sources in the upper illinois river and its tributaries previous studies have identified dominant sources of nitrate in the uirb treated wastewater effluent and discharge from agricultural watersheds david et al 2010 panno et al 2008 agricultural nitrate can be derived from various sources of n fertilizer manure and soil derived from farming activities and animal feeding operations animal manure derived nitrate was identified as a source of elevated nitrate concentrations in some wells panno et al 2009 however manure was not considered a major source of nitrate in the illinois river david et al 2010 panno et al 2008 usgs county level input data indicated the average contribution from manure n in the uirb counties was about 11 of the fertilizer input during 2006 and 2007 gronberg and arnold 2017 gronberg and spahr 2012 in the current study two nitrate end members were identified by their characteristic isotopic compositions and no3 n concentrations in the basin as shown in fig 8 large urban point sources were represented by the swrp effluent black solid circles with mean values of δ15n no3 8 6 1 7 δ18o no3 0 8 1 4 and concentration averaging 8 6 mg l agricultural sources were represented by shallow groundwater sampled in agricultural area green open circles with mean values of δ15n no3 3 4 0 6 δ18o no3 3 7 0 5 concentration averaging 3 4 mg l endmembers were based on limited sampling and may not encompass the range of source characteristics of each type nonetheless the swrp endmember isotopic composition is supported by the fact that it plots near the origin of an apparent isotopic fractionation trend interpreted to represent nitrate subjected to variable microbial reduction in river samples most likely to be dominated by urban sources fig 8 similarly the groundwater samples plot near the origin of an apparent isotopic fractionation trend representing variably reduced nitrate in agricultural tributary streams and in tile drains where tile drains are an important pathway for delivery of agricultural nitrate from shallow groundwater to streams isotopic data indicate nitrate from both major sources was formed predominantly by nitrification of reduced nitrogen the contrast between urban and agricultural δ15n no3 values is consistent with the different nitrogen sources wastewater n versus soil and fertilizer n likely modified slightly in both cases by minor nitrogen losses before or after nitrification the contrast in δ18o no3 values may reflect differences in the nitrifying environments wtp aquatic treatment systems versus agricultural soils that affected isotope fractionation processes during nitrification or subsequent reactions boshers et al 2018 lab and field studies indicate nitrate formed by nitrification in saturated homogeneous systems commonly has δ18o no3 near that of the environmental water boshers et al 2018 buchwald et al 2012 whereas nitrate leached from soils into groundwater and streams typically has δ18o no3 significantly higher than that of local water and commonly similar to that estimated by assuming a 2 1 mixture of water and atmospheric oxygen kendall et al 2007 xue et al 2009 in the uirb given an unaltered atmospheric δ18o o2 value of 24 luz and barkan 2011 and a regional mean meteoric water δ18o h2o of around 7 table s1 the latter assumption would yield a δ18o no3 value of around 3 roughly similar to those of the agricultural groundwater and least fractionated agricultural tributary stream samples in fig 8 the lower and more variable δ18o no3 values of swrp samples could reflect smaller overall influence of o2 o relatively high and variable reaction rates or greater isotopic discrimination effects during nitrification in the wtp the upstream portion of the illinois river system above the confluence of the kankakee and des plaines rivers had higher no3 n concentrations than the downstream portion most of the time except in spring indicating watershed scale seasonal variation in nitrate sources or transport processes there was a higher proportion of agricultural land in the downstream region as opposed to the dominantly urban land use and wtp nitrate sources in the upstream portion large amounts of nitrate were leached from agricultural watersheds in spring when water levels were high soils were exposed and fertilizers were applied causing elevated stream nitrate concentrations in the high base flow months during low base flow seasons summer and fall the illinois river nitrate was diluted by the kankakee river and other agricultural tributaries because of reduced nitrate concentrations and discharges from those watersheds while the upstream wtp input remained relatively constant this seasonal pattern in nitrate concentration was consistent with the nitrate isotopic compositions in illinois river samples in the upstream portion of the river δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values were similar to the mean swrp values throughout the sampled portions of the year fig 8 indicating wtp effluent had a greater impact on riverine nitrate in the upstream portion and relatively insignificant in stream denitrification here tributaries flowing through urban or mixed land use areas had nitrate isotope ratios similar to the swrp values especially during low flow months figs 7d and 8 indicating a sustained input from urban point sources in these tributaries the relatively higher δ18o no3 values and nitrate concentrations associated with the relatively lower δ15n no3 values of the downstream portion of the uirb suggested that agricultural input was the dominant source of nitrate in the main stem river in spring high base flow season spring samples of uirb agricultural tributaries had nitrate isotope ratios similar to the shallow agricultural groundwater values fig 7d and 8 which were similar to reported values for nitrate derived from nitrification of nh4 fertilizers or soils in illinois δ15n no3 values 2 4 δ18o no3 values 12 8 kelley et al 2013 kendall et al 2007 panno et al 2008 therefore leached nitrate transported through shallow groundwater including tile drainage in agricultural land could be the primary nitrate source to these tributaries it was estimated that the majority 85 of synthetic fertilizer applied in illinois was anhydrous nh3 panno et al 2008 which was subject to nitrification after application and subsequent leaching to surface water groundwater and the tile drainage system this process likely contributed to large transient increases in the no3 n concentrations in these tributaries when high base flow occurred fig 9b such phenomenon has been documented in a number of long term studies of agricultural runoff throughout the central u s booth and campbell 2007 ikenberry et al 2014 royer et al 2006 5 2 temporal variation in nitrate transport and reduction isotopic fractionation indicating nitrate reduction during low base flow period was observed in many samples figs 7 and 8 the two dashed trend lines in fig 8 indicate apparent fractionation slopes in agricultural tributaries slope 0 57 and the illinois river slope 0 73 during low flow months that are slightly different from each other but within the range of fractionation trends reported for nitrate reduction e g denitrification flux calculations were useful for interpreting land use effects on seasonal nitrate export variations most of spring nitrate export occurred in tributaries with agricultural or mixed land use table 1 reduction of nitrate fluxes accelerated in late summer when seasonal export decreased to 85 of spring export in most tributaries export continued to decrease to less than or equal to 35 of spring values in all agricultural tributaries in fall when export in the urban tributary nearly recovered to its spring level and exceeded those of most agricultural tributaries the bc tributary exhibited an unusual seasonal flux pattern in which its summer export was over twice as much as spring flux further examination of local land management activities would be required to understand this distinctive pattern the degree of the seasonal variation was controlled by land use pattern streams having mixed land use had nitrate concentrations and isotopic compositions that were only partly influenced by seasonal variations in agricultural input the monthly average flux of main stem stations also showed the wtp source exhibited fewer seasonal variations and was the major source during low flow times which is also indicated in fig 8 where the trajectory of main stem denitrification starts from the wtp source 5 3 spatial variation in nitrate transport and reduction in general nitrate losses and associated isotopic fractionations through the illinois river system at low flow could be related to some combination of 1 in stream including hyporheic nitrate loss within the main stem river 2 in stream including hyporheic nitrate loss in the tributary stream networks and 3 switch from high nitrate groundwater discharge to low nitrate groundwater discharge because of redox stratification in aquifers underlying the tributary watersheds especially those with tile drains presumably these options could have different effects on the relative losses of wtp nitrate by options 1 and 2 only in comparison to agricultural nitrate by all 3 options the seasonal export ratios in table 1 showed that most of the season losses of nitrate occurred in agricultural watersheds and tributaries and there were relatively fewer losses in the main stem river or in tributaries with other land use our findings agreed with previous studies showing that nitrate removal was more efficient in small tributaries than in large rivers alexander et al 2000 peterson et al 2001 distinctive patterns in nitrate mixing and reduction were also observed in isotopic values of tributaries figs 8 and 9 nitrate isotope ratios of agricultural tributary samples were highly fractionated during summer and fall months fig 8 exhibiting elevated δ18o no3 and δ15n no3 values with lower discharge and nitrate concentration fig 9 the decrease in nitrate export from agricultural watersheds in dry months was interpreted as a combined result of less discharge of unreduced nitrate bearing groundwater plus more efficient nitrate reduction in benthic sediments along the stream networks böhlke et al 2009 harvey et al 2013 royer et al 2004 the groundwater source included tile drains as variably reduced groundwater discharges along with other deeper flow paths that were more reducing in contrast urban tributary samples had higher concentrations during low flow periods accompanied by higher δ15n no3 values but less systematic changes in δ18o no3 fig 9c and d largely indicating seasonal change of dominant nitrate source rather than reduction process urban point sources had greater impact on these tributaries during low base flow period when the agricultural contribution was relatively insignificant the intermediate position of nitrate isotopic data of tributary samples with mixed land use was consistent with mixtures of urban wtp effluent and agriculture derived nitrate fig 8 the nitrate isotopic compositions and fluxes of main stem samples indicated seasonal variations in its nitrate mixing and transport processes the conceptual diagrams in fig 10 further illustrate the dominant processes in different seasons the characteristic slope of nitrate reduction had a different trajectory from that of mixing of the two principle sources such that source information could be preserved in the fractionated samples at high base flow wtp sources represented by swrp dominated upstream portions of the main stem and agricultural sources dominated downstream portions figs 8 and 10 agricultural tributaries delivered large nitrate fluxes during the spring season the isotope ratios indicated all sources mixed in spring with relatively little effect of nitrate reduction fig 10b at low base flow in summer and fall wtp sources appeared to dominate the entire main stem river while some loss and fractionation occurred downstream producing the lower of the two positive trends in fig 10b the slope of this trend was slightly higher than that of the upper agricultural trend possibly indicating downstream addition of minor isotopically fractionated agricultural inputs thus much of the agricultural nitrate loss and isotopic fractionation may have occurred in saturated soils or groundwaters before being discharged to streams as indicated by data from tile drains as well as within the stream networks while both agricultural discharge and wtp nitrate were affected by in stream losses at low flow 5 4 impact of discharge and land use on watershed nitrate export nitrate flux was highest in march in most of the streams followed by other high base flow months table 1 this observation is consistent with previous studies in the mid continent agricultural region in u s indicating nitrate concentrations and fluxes commonly are highest in the spring when base flow is highest the only exception with highest export occurring in july was bc alexander et al 2009 royer et al 2006 october export was higher than in other late summer and fall months due to relatively high discharge and riverine nitrate concentration nitrate not assimilated by plants during july september may have accumulated in dry soil and was more susceptible to being flushed or leached when infiltration and recharge increased after the growing season as a result relatively high nitrate concentrations were found in agricultural tributaries in october averaging 5 3 mg l in comparison to the average concentration in september being 1 3 mg l urban and agricultural watersheds had different seasonal patterns of nitrate concentrations and fluxes in fig 9 negative correlations between discharge and nitrate concentration in urban watersheds likely indicated dilution of point source wtp effluents in response to increased precipitation and surface water runoff into chicago s combined sewer system with the exception of some high peak flow events positive relations between discharge and nitrate concentration and flux were typical for agricultural watersheds in the region which may result from increased soil leaching during periods of high rainfall snowmelt and low evapotranspiration and associated elevated flows from agricultural tile drainage mixed agricultural urban streams diamonds yielded intermediate slopes that could be either negative fr or positive kr and illinois rivers depending on the overall extent of agricultural influence on the nitrate concentration of the stream lastly our data indicated inter annual variations in nitrate fluxes concentrations and isotopic compositions that were correlated with inter annual variations in discharge fig 7 comparing our isotopic results from three different sampling programs in water years 2004 2005 and 2008 it appears that isotopic fractionation effects associated with nitrate reduction were more pronounced in years with low flow fig 7 the isotopic fractionation trend in the main stem samples was more distinguishable in 2005 fig 5 than in 2008 fig 7c the integrated annual discharge of water year 2005 was 20 lower than the 35 year average while that of water year 2008 was 33 higher than the 35 year average fig 3 6 conclusions conceptual models of spatial and temporal variations of nitrate concentrations and isotopic composition in the uirb are summarized in fig 10 in spring season at relatively high base flow conditions wtp effluent nitrate from upstream sources was diluted and eventually largely overwhelmed by agricultural input in the downstream portion and neither source was greatly reduced in transit however the agricultural contribution decreased significantly in tributaries as well as in the illinois river during summer and fall when both flow and nitrate concentration decreased spatial isotopic patterns in low flow conditions are consistent with substantial nitrate reduction prior to discharge in agricultural watersheds as well as after discharge within the stream corridors we found nitrate flux decreased to 50 of spring export during fall in the main stem river measurements of nitrate concentrations and isotopic compositions in river water are useful indicators of nitrate sources mixing and in stream loss processes the isotopic composition of nitrate in the uirb varied with location land use and seasonal flow conditions the results of this study could be used as a basis for a

6853,estimating streambed hydraulic conductivity is particularly important in arid and semi arid regions where surface water infiltration from ephemeral dryland streams helps maintain riparian ecosystems in situ permeameter tests are widely used to estimate the hydraulic conductivity of streambed sediments previous studies have demonstrated that one of the major factors controlling spatiotemporal variations in streambed hydraulic conductivity in such areas is streambed clogging by suspended sediments recently a modified hvorslev 1951 formula was theoretically proposed to account for the effect of streambed clogging on streambed hydraulic properties due to suspended particle sedimentation during falling head tests to validate the modified formula fieldwork was conducted at five sites in the lower heihe river a typical intermittent river of north western china in september 2017 a simple pvc pipe with an inner diameter of 4 cm was used as a permeameter for the field tests both muddy river water and clean water were used to fill the permeameter to conduct comparative tests to differentiate the interpretation of the field testing data obtained with clean water the data obtained with muddy river water were analysed with an equation considering an iteratively increasing total hydraulic resistance of riverbed sediments due to the effects of riverbed clogging the estimated vertical hydraulic conductivity for the top 0 3 m of riverbed sediments varied from 1 to 41 m day the proposed model was shown to accurately estimate the hydraulic conductivity of riverbed sediments using both clean and muddy water during slug tests keywords surface groundwater interaction falling head permeameter test streambed hydraulic conductivity streambed clogging heihe river 1 introduction streambed hydraulic conductivity k is considered a major factor that controls the exchange of water between a river and an underlying aquifer sophocleous 2002 despite the numerous methods developed to estimate streambed k adequately quantifying this parameter remains a challenge due to the significant temporal and spatial variabilities in streambed sediments brunner et al 2017 ghysels et al 2018 tang et al 2017 particular attention has been drawn to riverbed sediment dynamics associated with seepage direction partington et al 2017 and streamwater velocity genereux et al 2008 which are believed to cause the large temporal and spatial dynamics of streambed k cook 2015 such sediment dynamics have an especially large influence on streambed hydraulic properties during flooding events when stream velocities typically increase and the streamflow transports relatively high concentrations of suspended sediments such as silts and clays wang et al 2017 wu et al 2015 these fine grained sediments are deposited as mud drapes across the surface of the streambed as a consequence the streambed becomes physically clogged partington et al 2017 this effect can occur during a falling head permeameter test if muddy river water is poured into the pipe to create an instant increase in the water level wang et al 2017 wang et al 2017 noted that the well known hvorslev 1951 formula used to estimate streambed k does not consider the sediment deposition process inside the pipe when processing falling head permeameter test data based on the previous work of pozdniakov et al 2016 wang et al 2017 further proposed an iteratively increasing total hydraulic resistance that accounts for the effects of streambed clogging on changes in streambed hydraulic properties during falling head tests however this formula was developed theoretically thus it requires additional field data to validate its applicability therefore the purpose of this study was to validate the formula proposed by wang et al 2017 via field measurements from falling head permeameter tests 2 theoretical background the hvorslev 1951 formula represents a widely used solution for estimating the streambed k based on falling head permeameter tests recently pozdniakov et al 2016 developed a generalised solution for falling head permeameter tests that accounts for flow in a bounded medium by assuming that the bottom of a river is a prescribed head boundary thus the streambed k can be estimated using the curve of ln h 0 h t versus time t as follows 1 ln h 0 h t 4 k f π d t f π d 4 l 1 π d 4 l a l 1 where h0 is the instantaneous increase in the head above the initial water level inside the pipe m h t is the head inside the pipe as a function of time after the water level is instantaneously increased m l is the depth of pipe penetration into the streambed m d is the pipe diameter m and a l is the well function which accounts for the distance between the streambed boundary and the open end of the pipe as noted by pozdniakov et al 2016 for l d 2 a l 2 8 is recommended for calculating the streambed k with an accuracy of 5 to apply eq 1 the test results plotted as ln h 0 h t versus t must produce a straight or nearly straight line passing through the coordinate origin the curve described by eq 1 can then be used to determine the vertical k as follows pozdniakov et al 2016 2 k b π d 4 f b l 1 π d 4 l a l b 4 k f π d where b is the slope of the line ln h 0 h t versus t day 1 the work of pozdniakov et al 2016 showed that the curve of ln h 0 h t versus t can become nonlinear if the head at the penetration depth of the pipe differs from the head in the river however for a typical pipe penetration depth of 20 40 cm and a typical instantaneous increase in the head within the pipe of 40 50 cm the nonlinearity associated with this difference is usually not significant one of the factors that can lead to significant variations in the riverbed k is physical clogging with fine grained particles that occurs during wash up cycles high concentrations of suspended sediments such as silt and clay particles are transported by river flow during flood periods wang et al 2017 wu et al 2015 these sediments are deposited as mud drapes across the streambed surface thereby increasing the total hydraulic resistance of the riverbed sediments suspended sediments can also affect falling head permeameter tests when creating an instant increase in the water level by pouring muddy river water into the pipe accordingly sedimentation occurring during a falling head test can cause the observed curve of ln h 0 h t versus t to become nonlinear to account for the abovementioned effects of streambed clogging an iteratively increasing total hydraulic resistance was developed to correct the streambed k estimated during a falling head permeameter test wang et al 2017 3 π d 2 4 dh t dt h t r in r out r s t r in 4 l π d 2 k r out 1 a l d k r s t β h 0 h t γ t where β day m3 and γ m 2 are

when clean water is used for the slug test i e when b and c approach 0 eq 5 approaches eq 1 thus eq 5 can be used to process falling head tests conducted with both clean and muddy water because it can account for clogging effects through the parameters b and c 3 experimental setup the experimental data used in this study were obtained from field falling head permeameter tests in the lower heihe river a typical intermittent river of north western china wang 2018 this area is described in more detail in wang et al 2013 2017 in brief the study area is characterised by a hyper arid environment with high potential evaporation approximately 1500 mm year and extremely low precipitation less than 50 mm year conditions according to metrological measurements at the local weather station du et al 2016 wang et al 2014b and in situ evaporation measurements from large open water bodies liu et al 2016 as shown in fig 1 the lower heihe river divides into two losing streams i e the donghe and xihe rivers at the langxinshan hydrological station wang et al 2014a the riverbeds of the donghe and xihe rivers which are intermittent streams usually remain dry during the period from april to june fig 2 the average annual runoff was estimated to be approximately 6 2 108 m3 at the langxinshan hydrological station during the period from 1988 to 2017 with approximately 71 of the total runoff released into the donghe river fig 2 falling head permeameter tests were conducted at 5 different sites along the donghe and xihe rivers during the period of 27 29 september 2017 fig 1 a simple pvc pipe with an inner diameter of 4 cm was used as a permeameter for the field tests the pipe was installed while minimally disturbing the streambed at depths from 1 5 to 26 5 cm table 1 both clean and river muddy water fig 3 were used at site fts 01 fig 1 to test the influence of suspended sediment on the performance of falling head permeameter tests 4 results and discussion shown in fig 4 are typical curves of ln h 0 h t versus t for falling head permeameter tests using clean and river water at site fts 01 when clean water was used for the permeameter test the curve was nearly linear however the curve appeared to become nonlinear when river water containing suspended particles was used for the test these results indicate that the nonlinearity of the indicator curve is caused by sedimentation and the resulting clogging of pores during the test as shown in fig 4 linear fitting can be performed only when testing with clean water while nonlinear fitting as described by eq 5 is required when testing with river water eqs 1 2 and 5 were used to process the permeameter test data with linear and nonlinear indicator curves respectively the field test data were processed using linear regression based on the curves of ln h 0 h t versus t to fit the parameter b to eq 1 with the grapher v12 software http www goldensoftware com products grapher the parameters b b and c were fitted to eq 5 using a simple nonlinear optimisation program which aims to find the minimum root mean square error between the observed and calculated values table 1 shows the estimated k values obtained by considering using eq 5 and not considering using eq 2 colmatation processes it is evident from table 1 that eqs 2 and 5 provided similar values of k when clean water was used in the tests while the abovementioned equations usually provided different values of k when muddy river water was used in the tests thereby highlighting the importance of considering colmatation processes during slug tests when employing muddy river water in fact the k values estimated by eq 2 as listed in table 1 are wrong because this equation does not consider colmatation processes that occurred during field experiments especially during the tests in which muddy water was used when clean water was used eq 2 provides less error of k estimation because less additional hydraulic resistance was added by colmatation processes in comparison with the tests in which muddy water was used the results presented in table 1 demonstrate that the k values of riverbed sediments were similar for cases in which clean and river muddy water were used for the slug tests at a single point e g point nos 1 3 of site fts 01 which were located along the transect orthogonal to the direction of river flow with a distance of approximately 6 m between neighbouring points this fact suggests that eq 5 provides a valid solution that accounts for physical clogging due to fine grained particles suspended in the filtrating water consequently eq 5 can be used to process the data obtained from slug tests conducted with both clean and muddy water high correlation coefficients between the observed and calculated values of the permeameter water level drawdown 0 83 0 99 and good agreement between the estimated k values derived from injecting clean and muddy water confirm the accuracy of eq 5 the results of tests at site fts 01 did not reveal a clear distinction between the injection of muddy and clean water as expected we expected that the estimated k using clean water would be higher than that using river muddy water however the difference in the estimated k values using clean and river water is likely to be associated with the design of the field experiments as shown in a comparison of the experiments conducted at point no 2 of site fts 01 when experiments were conducted with clean water after experiments were conducted with river water the k estimated using clean water did not show an increase compared with the k estimated using river water as we expected this is also partly related to the fact that the water inside the pipe was not completely clean when we conducted experiments with clean water that is some river water remained inside the pipe when we conducted experiments with clean water when conducting slug tests colmatation processes should be avoided to correctly process the data this can be accomplished by using clean water that does not contain suspended particles table 1 also shows that the estimated k values for the top 0 3 m of riverbed sediments varied from 1 to 41 m day such large ranges of k in upper streambed sediments have been reported in previous studies e g chen et al 2010 min et al 2013 song et al 2016 in addition a general pattern was observed in the spatial variation of the streambed hydraulic properties along the river channel i e k decreased from upstream to downstream as noted earlier by dunkerley 2008 and wu et al 2015 this phenomenon is likely related to the dynamics of river water and the associated depositional and erosional processes for losing streams in arid regions the water depth becomes shallower and the flow velocity also decreases along the flow channel accordingly the suspended fine particles carried by the streamflow are gradually deposited onto the surface of the streambed as evidenced by the presence of clogging layers consisting of silt and clay at the downstream min et al 2013 in contrast the upstream riverbeds have layers consisting of coarse sediments with a higher permeability 5 conclusions field experiments conducted with both muddy river water and clean water in the lower heihe river a typical dryland ephemeral losing stream showed that the use of muddy water in falling head tests led to clogging of the sediment pores during injection and consequently to nonlinear behaviour of the indicator curve of ln h 0 h t versus t however when clean water was used for the slug test the indicator curve was nearly linear thus during flooding periods characterised by the ubiquity of muddy river water falling head tests should be performed using clean tap water if at all possible eq 5 was developed considering the physical processes of riverbed clogging due to suspended particles and is consequently valid for use with both clean and muddy water in the slug tests this fact was proven by the similar k values obtained with both clean and muddy water at a single test point these experimental studies allow us to provide the following recommendations for field testing the hydraulic properties of streambed sediments and for interpreting such test data when conducting in situ permeameter tests colmatation processes inside the pipe should be avoided because they can complicate the processing of experimental data by requiring the use of eq 5 instead of eq 2 for this purpose clean water instead of muddy river water is recommended for conducting field tests during the interpretation of field test data it is necessary to construct diagnostic plots of ln h 0 h t versus t eq 2 is valid for quantifying the hydraulic properties of streambed sediments only if the curve of ln h 0 h t versus t is a straight line passing through the coordinate origin for the case in which this curve is nonlinear which is an indicator of colmatation processes inside the pipe the nonlinear eq 5 must be employed to estimate the

events when stream velocities typically increase and the streamflow transports relatively high concentrations of suspended sediments such as silts and clays wang et al 2017 wu et al 2015 these fine grained sediments are deposited as mud drapes across the surface of the streambed as a consequence the streambed becomes physically clogged partington et al 2017 this effect can occur during a falling head permeameter test if muddy river water is poured into the pipe to create an instant increase in the water level wang et al 2017 wang et al 2017 noted that the well known hvorslev 1951 formula used to estimate streambed k does not consider the sediment deposition process inside the pipe when processing falling head permeameter test data based on the previous work of pozdniakov et al 2016 wang et al 2017 further proposed an iteratively increasing total hydraulic resistance that accounts for the effects of streambed clogging on changes in streambed hydraulic properties during falling head tests however this formula was developed theoretically thus it requires additional field data to validate its applicability therefore the purpose of this study was to validate the formula proposed by wang et al 2017 via field measurements from falling head permeameter tests 2 theoretical background the hvorslev 1951 formula represents a widely used solution for estimating the streambed k based on falling head permeameter tests recently pozdniakov et al 2016 developed a generalised solution for falling head permeameter tests that accounts for flow in a bounded medium by assuming that the bottom of a river is a prescribed head boundary thus the streambed k can be estimated using the curve of ln h 0 h t versus time t as follows 1 ln h 0 h t 4 k f π d t f π d 4 l 1 π d 4 l a l 1 where h0 is the instantaneous increase in the head above the initial water level inside the pipe m h t is the head inside the pipe as a function of time after the water level is instantaneously increased m l is the depth of pipe penetration into the streambed m d is the pipe diameter m and a l is the well function which accounts for the distance between the streambed boundary and the open end of the pipe as noted by pozdniakov et al 2016 for l d 2 a l 2 8 is recommended for calculating the streambed k with an accuracy of 5 to apply eq 1 the test results plotted as ln h 0 h t versus t must produce a straight or nearly straight line passing through the coordinate origin the curve described by eq 1 can then be used to determine the vertical k as follows pozdniakov et al 2016 2 k b π d 4 f b l 1 π d 4 l a l b 4 k f π d where b is the slope of the line ln h 0 h t versus t day 1 the work of pozdniakov et al 2016 showed that the curve of ln h 0 h t versus t can become nonlinear if the head at the penetration depth of the pipe differs from the head in the river however for a typical pipe penetration depth of 20 40 cm and a typical instantaneous increase in the head within the pipe of 40 50 cm the nonlinearity associated with this difference is usually not significant one of the factors that can lead to significant variations in the riverbed k is physical clogging with fine grained particles that occurs during wash up cycles high concentrations of suspended sediments such as silt and clay particles are transported by river flow during flood periods wang et al 2017 wu et al 2015 these sediments are deposited as mud drapes across the streambed surface thereby increasing the total hydraulic resistance of the riverbed sediments suspended sediments can also affect falling head permeameter tests when creating an instant increase in the water level by pouring muddy river water into the pipe accordingly sedimentation occurring during a falling head test can cause the observed curve of ln h 0 h t versus t to become nonlinear to account for the abovementioned effects of streambed clogging an iteratively increasing total hydraulic resistance was developed to correct the streambed k estimated during a falling head permeameter test wang et al 2017 3 π d 2 4 dh t dt h t r in r out r s t r in 4 l π d 2 k r out 1 a l d k r s t β h 0 h t γ t where β day m3 and γ m 2 are

when clean water is used for the slug test i e when b and c approach 0 eq 5 approaches eq 1 thus eq 5 can be used to process falling head tests conducted with both clean and muddy water because it can account for clogging effects through the parameters b and c 3 experimental setup the experimental data used in this study were obtained from field falling head permeameter tests in the lower heihe river a typical intermittent river of north western china wang 2018 this area is described in more detail in wang et al 2013 2017 in brief the study area is characterised by a hyper arid environment with high potential evaporation approximately 1500 mm year and extremely low precipitation less than 50 mm year conditions according to metrological measurements at the local weather station du et al 2016 wang et al 2014b and in situ evaporation measurements from large open water bodies liu et al 2016 as shown in fig 1 the lower heihe river divides into two losing streams i e the donghe and xihe rivers at the langxinshan hydrological station wang et al 2014a the riverbeds of the donghe and xihe rivers which are intermittent streams usually remain dry during the period from april to june fig 2 the average annual runoff was estimated to be approximately 6 2 108 m3 at the langxinshan hydrological station during the period from 1988 to 2017 with approximately 71 of the total runoff released into the donghe river fig 2 falling head permeameter tests were conducted at 5 different sites along the donghe and xihe rivers during the period of 27 29 september 2017 fig 1 a simple pvc pipe with an inner diameter of 4 cm was used as a permeameter for the field tests the pipe was installed while minimally disturbing the streambed at depths from 1 5 to 26 5 cm table 1 both clean and river muddy water fig 3 were used at site fts 01 fig 1 to test the influence of suspended sediment on the performance of falling head permeameter tests 4 results and discussion shown in fig 4 are typical curves of ln h 0 h t versus t for falling head permeameter tests using clean and river water at site fts 01 when clean water was used for the permeameter test the curve was nearly linear however the curve appeared to become nonlinear when river water containing suspended particles was used for the test these results indicate that the nonlinearity of the indicator curve is caused by sedimentation and the resulting clogging of pores during the test as shown in fig 4 linear fitting can be performed only when testing with clean water while nonlinear fitting as described by eq 5 is required when testing with river water eqs 1 2 and 5 were used to process the permeameter test data with linear and nonlinear indicator curves respectively the field test data were processed using linear regression based on the curves of ln h 0 h t versus t to fit the parameter b to eq 1 with the grapher v12 software http www goldensoftware com products grapher the parameters b b and c were fitted to eq 5 using a simple nonlinear optimisation program which aims to find the minimum root mean square error between the observed and calculated values table 1 shows the estimated k values obtained by considering using eq 5 and not considering using eq 2 colmatation processes it is evident from table 1 that eqs 2 and 5 provided similar values of k when clean water was used in the tests while the abovementioned equations usually provided different values of k when muddy river water was used in the tests thereby highlighting the importance of considering colmatation processes during slug tests when employing muddy river water in fact the k values estimated by eq 2 as listed in table 1 are wrong because this equation does not consider colmatation processes that occurred during field experiments especially during the tests in which muddy water was used when clean water was used eq 2 provides less error of k estimation because less additional hydraulic resistance was added by colmatation processes in comparison with the tests in which muddy water was used the results presented in table 1 demonstrate that the k values of riverbed sediments were similar for cases in which clean and river muddy water were used for the slug tests at a single point e g point nos 1 3 of site fts 01 which were located along the transect orthogonal to the direction of river flow with a distance of approximately 6 m between neighbouring points this fact suggests that eq 5 provides a valid solution that accounts for physical clogging due to fine grained particles suspended in the filtrating water consequently eq 5 can be used to process the data obtained from slug tests conducted with both clean and muddy water high correlation coefficients between the observed and calculated values of the permeameter water level drawdown 0 83 0 99 and good agreement between the estimated k values derived from injecting clean and muddy water confirm the accuracy of eq 5 the results of tests at site fts 01 did not reveal a clear distinction between the injection of muddy and clean water as expected we expected that the estimated k using clean water would be higher than that using river muddy water however the difference in the estimated k values using clean and river water is likely to be associated with the design of the field experiments as shown in a comparison of the experiments conducted at point no 2 of site fts 01 when experiments were conducted with clean water after experiments were conducted with river water the k estimated using clean water did not show an increase compared with the k estimated using river water as we expected this is also partly related to the fact that the water inside the pipe was not completely clean when we conducted experiments with clean water that is some river water remained inside the pipe when we conducted experiments with clean water when conducting slug tests colmatation processes should be avoided to correctly process the data this can be accomplished by using clean water that does not contain suspended particles table 1 also shows that the estimated k values for the top 0 3 m of riverbed sediments varied from 1 to 41 m day such large ranges of k in upper streambed sediments have been reported in previous studies e g chen et al 2010 min et al 2013 song et al 2016 in addition a general pattern was observed in the spatial variation of the streambed hydraulic properties along the river channel i e k decreased from upstream to downstream as noted earlier by dunkerley 2008 and wu et al 2015 this phenomenon is likely related to the dynamics of river water and the associated depositional and erosional processes for losing streams in arid regions the water depth becomes shallower and the flow velocity also decreases along the flow channel accordingly the suspended fine particles carried by the streamflow are gradually deposited onto the surface of the streambed as evidenced by the presence of clogging layers consisting of silt and clay at the downstream min et al 2013 in contrast the upstream riverbeds have layers consisting of coarse sediments with a higher permeability 5 conclusions field experiments conducted with both muddy river water and clean water in the lower heihe river a typical dryland ephemeral losing stream showed that the use of muddy water in falling head tests led to clogging of the sediment pores during injection and consequently to nonlinear behaviour of the indicator curve of ln h 0 h t versus t however when clean water was used for the slug test the indicator curve was nearly linear thus during flooding periods characterised by the ubiquity of muddy river water falling head tests should be performed using clean tap water if at all possible eq 5 was developed considering the physical processes of riverbed clogging due to suspended particles and is consequently valid for use with both clean and muddy water in the slug tests this fact was proven by the similar k values obtained with both clean and muddy water at a single test point these experimental studies allow us to provide the following recommendations for field testing the hydraulic properties of streambed sediments and for interpreting such test data when conducting in situ permeameter tests colmatation processes inside the pipe should be avoided because they can complicate the processing of experimental data by requiring the use of eq 5 instead of eq 2 for this purpose clean water instead of muddy river water is recommended for conducting field tests during the interpretation of field test data it is necessary to construct diagnostic plots of ln h 0 h t versus t eq 2 is valid for quantifying the hydraulic properties of streambed sediments only if the curve of ln h 0 h t versus t is a straight line passing through the coordinate origin for the case in which this curve is nonlinear which is an indicator of colmatation processes inside the pipe the nonlinear eq 5 must be employed to estimate the

6854,evapotranspiration was determined to be hydrological effect which induces suction evapotranspiration induced suction governs the slope stability ground water recharge and runoff this study focuses on suction induced in root zone of mix grass used in green infrastructure most of the previous studies focused on evapotranspiration induced suction less than 100 kpa measured using tensiometers however for investigating the drought condition it is essential to obtain suction data greater than 100 kpa it was noted that the response of plant parameters such as stomatal conductance and surface area were not considered holistically evapotranspiration induced suction the main objective of this study is to investigate relationship among evapotranspiration induced suction stomatal conductance and surface area for a mix grass species used in green infrastructure subjected to drought stress corresponds to suction 100 kpa stomatal conductance was observed to increase up to suction 6 1 kpa corresponding to volumetric field capacity thereafter large decrease more than 90 in stomatal conductance was found with an increase in suction stomatal conductance was found to be 0 at 2431 kpa i e wilting point change in normalized surface areas of mix grass was found to be relatively low within 15 with an increase in suction up to 138 kpa however beyond 138 kpa it varied drastically by 31 68 with an increase in suction from 138 kpa to 3642 kpa two new relationships i e stomatal conductance characteristic curve sccc and surface area characteristic curve sacc were proposed therefore the relationships developed in current study help to analyze the performance of green infrastructure accurately keywords green infrastructure wilted grass suction stomatal conductance heterogeneous

induces suction in root zone of green infrastructure influence of suction induced in soil root composite on slope stability and ground water recharge were demonstrated previously fredlund et al 1978 deb et al 2013 hazra et al 2017 taniguchi et al 1996 allison et al 1994 chen and dudhia 2001 ma et al 2009 most of the previous researchers lehmann et al 1998 czarnes et al 2000 pollen bankhead and simon 2010 gadi et al 2016 used tensiometers to measure suction in vegetated soil the restricted suction measurement range of tensiometer 1 100 kpa is not suitable for soils having relatively high silt or clay content gallage and uchimura 2010 abhijit et al 2013 this translates to the fact that low range of suction measurement may not be helpful to study the suction developed in the root zone for drought condition it is worth noting that the green infrastructure is subjected to intense and frequent droughts gadi et al 2016 bordoloi et al 2018b as a result of water deficit relatively high suction 1500 kpa occurs in the root zone bordoloi et al 2018a gadi et al 2018b therefore measurement of higher range of suction than what can be recorded using tensiometer is a pressing need for studying green infrastructure a few researchers have measured suction induced in root zone under drought conditions garg et al 2015a bordoloi et al 2018a for studying the response close to the wilting point suction of 1500 kpa feddes 1982 garg et al 2015a however there are not many studies that integrate the evapotranspiration induced suction response in root zone with plant parameters which is invariably necessary to understand the abiotic stress response of plants in green infrastructure stomatal conductance is one of the crucial plant parameters which governs the evapotranspiration through vegetation in green infrastructure bordoloi et al 2018a penman monteith equation was proposed by monteith 1965 to show the relation between evapotranspiration and stomatal conductance stomatal conductance is the measure of rate of carbon dioxide uptake or water loss through stomata of leaf this can be demonstrated using mechanism of opening and closing of stomata plural form of stoma see fig 1 transpiration occurs as long as stoma open and it stops when stoma is closed tipple and pagani 2007 light and health conditions of mix grass exist in green infrastructure were found to be highly heterogeneous spatially gadi et al 2017a this spatial heterogeneity is usually grouped into three categories of mix grass those three categories are green grass under sunlight ggl green grass under self shade ggs and completely wilted grass cwg see fig 1 gadi et al 2017b respectively it is evident that partial or complete closure of stomata occurs in mix grass due to water stress high suction tobin and kulmatiski 2018 as a result of stomatal closure stomatal conductance of the leaf varies tipple and pagani 2007 jarvis et al 1981 and would also depend on parts of the day i e morning afternoon and evening lo gullo et al 2005 beadle et al 1985 there are not many studies that deals with the variation of stomatal conductance with evapotranspiration induced suction specifically range of suction 100 kpa surface area of vegetation is another key parameter to estimate suction induced due to evapotranspiration in green infrastructure gadi et al 2018a garg et al 2015b garg and ng 2015 it is well known that surface area of mix grass decreases with time due to shrinkage of grass during drying period anjum et al 2011 the surface area variation with an increase in suction was rarely quantified previously a recent study gadi et al 2018b shows that suction induced due to relatively large vegetation surface area could be 10 times higher than that of small surface area of vegetation cover hence incorporation of stomatal conductance and surface area of vegetation is deemed necessary for analyzing evapotranspiration induced suction in green infrastructure projects this study purports to fill this research gap by investigating the interplay of evapotranspiration induced suction stomatal conductance and surface area of a mix grass species in a compacted soil mass important for bioengineering subjected to drought stress suction 100 kpa it is believed that the study is an integration of soil specific characteristics and plant parameters for understanding the complex interaction of soil plant atmosphere continuum the results from this study were used to quantitatively investigate the relationship between evapotranspiration induced suction stomatal conductance and surface area of mix grass 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil properties red soil is selected for investigation which is commonly found in subtropical regions wang et al 2004 huang et al 2010 soil was collected from a hill site in north east region in india the average contents of gravel sand silt and clay were determined to be 0 25 17 50 22 and 24 61 respectively soil is classified as ml astm d 2487 10 astm 2010 according to unified soil classification system uscs liquid limit plastic limit and shrinkage limit were found to be 42 24 and 19 optimum moisture content and maximum dry density were found to be 18 and 1 65 g c c respectively the basic physical and engineering properties were determined under the provisions of astm d 854 06 astm 2007a astm d 2487 10 astm 2010 astm d 698 07 astm 2007b and astm d 4318 93 astm 1993 2 2 selected plant species and transplantation condition mix grass which is combination of two grass species namely axonopus compressus and cynadon dactylon were selected for the study this combination of two grass species was selected based on its i wide spread existence in subtropical regions sun and liddle 1993 avilés nova et al 2008 ii drought tolerance ability which is suitable for erosion control eusebius et al 2002 and iii the recognition of its significant ornate and eco friendly values for land and slope rehabilitation and reforestation singh et al 2013 it should be noted that the selected species are non crop species and supplementary nutrients are not needed for growth rhizomes of both species were collected from nearby green space 2 3 experimental setup and instrumentation 2 3 1 soil sample preparation test setup used to demonstrate the measurement of stomatal conductance and surface of mix grass is schematically portrayed in fig 2 the experimental setup consists of a cylindrical pvc poly vinyl chloride mould of 300 mm diameter and 250 mm length with prefabricated holes at sides to accommodate suction and moisture content sensors the locations of the instrumentation can be seen in fig 2 soil sample was compacted statically to a targeted dry density of 1 56 g c c i e equivalent to relative compaction of 90 relative compaction refers to the percentage ratio of the adopted dry density for sample preparation to the maximum dry density determined by the standard proctor compaction test the selected relative compaction is commonly adopted for embankment construction li et al 2016 a vertical force of 60 kn was applied to statically compact the soil venkatarama reddy and jagadish 1993 bulk density of compacted soil sample was found to be 1 96 g c c the final height of the sample is 170 mm from base a perforated pvc base plate was attached to the mould to allow drainage a filter paper was placed on base plate to prevent loss of soil particles from mould in addition the inner surface of the mould was coated with lubricant to reduce interface friction between soil and pvc the soil was compacted in three different layers of equal thickness 2 3 2 installation of instrumentation dummy tubes were placed during compaction at the locations of vwc and suction sensors the tubes of relatively less diameter as compared to sensors were inserted to ensure the tight contact between soil and instruments after installation two mps 6 sensors decagon devices 2016a were installed in diametrically opposite ends at a depth of 40 mm to capture the suction range of 9 10 000 kpa induced due to root water uptake as placed in previous studies bordoloi et al 2018a in addition a tensiometer was installed to capture the suction range below 9 kpa a moisture content sensor sm 200 delta t devices 2006 was installed diametrically opposite to tensiometer the minor gap between sensor and soil was backfilled with the red soil to prevent the preferential flow a layer of anabond adhesive was applied in the clearance between sensor and pvc at the predrilled holes mps 6 sensors were connected to em 50 data logger decagon devices 2016b for data logging tensiometer and sm 200 were connected to gp2 goodchild et al 2014 and dl 6 data loggers delta t devices 2013 soil root composite water retention curve was obtained using measured suction and vwc 2 3 3 environmental conditions during plant growth the specimen was placed under transparent roof and exposed to natural environmental condition during monitoring period transparent roof was arranged to avoid effect of natural precipitation during monitoring period while the mould is subjected to drying controlled irrigation was applied using a sprinkler system to nurture the mix grass a mariott s bottle was connected to control intensity and duration of irrigation pattern a digital camera with a detachable frame was mounted above the pvc mould to obtain the images of mix grass periodically mix grass was transplanted to the pot after the installation of instruments vegetated pot was irrigated regularly for a period of 72 days after 4 days of interval the irrigation period was maintained at 4 day interval to ensure the suction below the wilting point reported by previous researchers 1500 kpa feddes 1982 area of green grass cover live grass cover in the pot was found to reach inner area of pot at the end of 73 days thereafter mix grass cover was exposed to evaporation until it completely wilts methodology to quantify the surface area of grass cover has been explained in section 2 5 the meteorological parameters such as solar radiation air temperature and air relative humidity were monitored using a micro climate monitoring system meteorological parameters observed during test period are shown in fig 3 explained in next section 2 3 4 camera settings for capturing images of mix grass cover a commercially available camera canon eos 600d was mounted on a detachable frame above the pvc mould to capture the images of mix grass cover periodically the lens range and horizontal vertical resolution were maintained at 18 55 mm and 72 dpi the focal length iso speed and exposure time were maintained at 23 mm iso 640 and 1 30 sec respectively resolution of camera model is 18 megapixels images were captured from same height 400 mm using an adjustable frame see fig 2 maintenance of same focal length iso speed and exposure time and height minimizes observational errors and enable constant number of pixels in order to compare the image analysis results accurately constant pixel area is essential gadi et al 2017c images were captured in ambient light during measurement period of stomatal conductance 2 4 measurement of stomatal conductance ggl ggs and cwg were categorized by visual observation to measure stomatal conductance it is evident that large number of leaves are available for testing measurement of stomatal conductance for all existing leaves in pot requires relatively long duration in such case measured stomatal conductance could not be compared accurately pietragalla and pask 2012 hence five locations of each category were selected for measurement of stomatal conductance using leaf porometer decagon devices 2006 stomatal conductance refers to ratio of flux density and the water vapor concentration difference between surroundings and leaf surface pietragalla and pask 2012 leaf is clamped to the open chamber in leaf porometer relative humidity gradient forms between surroundings of chamber and leaf surface leaf porometer calculates stomatal conductance from the relative humidity gradient a standard procedure decagon devices 2006 was adopted for the calibration of leaf porometer the instrument was calibrated using a known conductance value of filter paper moistened with distilled water the accuracy of the leaf porometer was found to be around 90 as the stomata is sensitive to physical manipulation any physical stress or human contact with the leaf is avoided as much as possible measurements were performed as accurately and quickly as possible as the porometer usage may alter surface of leaf variation in relative humidity temperature and radiant energy is found to be very low during 10 00 a m 12 00 a m hence stomatal conductance and surface area was monitored under ambient light during above mentioned time period relative humidity temperature and radiant energy are observed to be 79 4 31 c 2 c and 33 mj m 2 d 1 6 mj m 2 d 1 see fig 3 it must be noted that light relative humidity and temperature would change with time koyama and takemoto 2014 changes in light relative humidity and temperature affect stomatal conductance and surface area of mix grass bytnerowicz and fenn 1996 bytnerowicz et al 2003 mooney et al 1983 as a result of change in stomatal conductance and surface area the correlations developed in present study may not be same for different environmental conditions the main focus of present study is to explore the high evapotranspiration induced suction in soil root composite and changes in stomatal conductance and surface area of canopy at higher suctions hence measurements taken at only one point of time suffice the purpose of the study it is evident that age of grass effects the stomatal conductance buchanan wollaston et al 2005 lee et al 2011 hence the mix grass of relatively less age difference was considered for the measurement in addition mix grass wilts gradually therefore measurement of stomatal conductance for a single leaf could not be possible during entire monitoring period leaf considered for stomatal conductance measurement has been changed when the mix grass at selected location reaches to wilting point 2 5 quantification of surface area of ggl ggs cwg fig 4 shows the colour analysis procedure to differentiate and quantify the surface area covered by ggl ggs and cwg basis for colour analysis procedure was described in gadi et al 2017b image was digitized after importing into imagej imagej is a java based image processing tool pixel value statistics and density of vegetation cover rasband and image 2011 thereafter image was cropped and inner area of the pot was quantified using measurement option this measure option is shown along with imagej window in fig 4 a ggl ggs and cwg are categorized using colour threshold option see fig 4 b this option facilitate the histogram of l a and b values for the all pixels of image image j enable 256 values of l a and b on three different scales which vary between 0 and 255 marked in fig 4 b the three categories of mix grass were identified separately by adjusting the values of l a and b on scales the variation of l a and b ranges for three categories in fig 4 b area of all three categories were quantified using measure option it can be observed from fig 5 that fewer shoots exist below the mix grass as the captured images are two dimensional the surface area of above mentioned fewer shoots could not be categorized surface area of shoots below the mix grass was found to be 6 7 of total surface area of mix grass surface area of shoots below the mix grass could be relatively high in case of few species gadi et al 2017b in such case analysis of two dimensional images may not suffice the purpose hence three dimensional images are required to quantify and categorize the mix grass accurately 3d lidar imaging could be the possible solution to capture the high resolution three dimensional images omasa et al 2006 3 results 3 1 gradual wilting of mix grass cover during monitoring period fig 5 shows the water retention curve of soil root composite water retention curve was fitted using van genuchten 1980 approach fitting coefficients related to curvature α and pore size distribution n were found to be 0 27 and 1 45 respectively air entry value is found to be about 2 kpa air entry value represents the suction value at which air starts to enter pores in soil matrix the air entry value is generally established by following procedure fredlund and xing 1994 zhai and rahardjo 2012 a horizontal line is drawn from the saturation point a tangent line is drawn through the point where desaturation curve is linear the inflection point of above mentioned horizontal and tangent lines indicate the air entry value vwc is observed to reduce noticeably from about 30 to 7 with an increase in suction by 90 kpa volumetric field capacity is found to be 24 26 it refers to the vwc held in soil after excess water drained away due to gravity suction corresponding to volumetric field capacity is observed to be 5 8 kpa hygroscopic water content is found to be around 5 hygroscopic water content was determined according to guidelines of shah and singh 2005 lower limit of suction range corresponding to vwcs less than hygroscopic water content is observed to be around 1400 kpa fig 5a f shows the gradual wilting of mix grass with respect to suction during monitoring period there is no visible difference in surface area of grass observed for suction up to 103 kpa see fig 5 a c noticeable change in surface area covered by green grass was observed at suction values beyond 103 kpa completely wilted grass is observed over major region at suction around 2431 kpa 3 2 stomatal conductance variation during monitoring period 3 2 1 comparison of stomatal conductance measured at various suction values fig 6 shows the average stomatal conductance at the selected locations of ggl and ggs stomatal conductance is observed to vary between 681 m mol m 2 s 1 and 0 m mol m 2 s 1 stomatal conductance of ggl and ggs is observed to increase with rise in suction up to 6 1 kpa during monitoring period stomatal conductance of ggl and ggs is observed to increase by 54 and 101 with 5 kpa raise in suction it can also be observed that peak stomatal conductance occurs near to the suction corresponding to volumetric field capacity relatively less stomatal conductance at low suction can be explained on the basis of oxygen available in soil root composite low suction represents the situation when oxygen available in pores of soil root composite is very limited due to high saturation raes and deproost 2003 in such case stomatal conductance would be relatively low thomas et al 2016 thereafter stomatal conductance is found to decrease up to suction around 1340 kpa such decrease is observed to be around 90 for ggl and ggs furthermore stomatal conductance variation is observed to be relatively low around 21 with an increase in suction from 1340 kpa to that less than 2431 kpa it can be noticed that typical lower limit of suction range see fig 5 corresponding to vwcs less than hygroscopic water content is near to 1340 kpa in addition suction values beyond 1340 kpa lies in typical suction range corresponding to vwc below the hygroscopic water content stomatal conductance is observed to be zero at suction around 2431 kpa this suction value can be termed as typical wilting point for the selected combination of grass species wilting point was reported to be 1500 kpa by feddes 1982 in addition a recent study garg et al 2015a also presented the wilting point for schefflera heptaphylla according to feddes 1982 however results of the current study show that stomatal conductance corresponding to suction and wilting point may vary for different species predicted stomatal conductance values were presented in a recent study tobin and kulmatiski 2018 corresponding to a wide range of suction 1 500 kpa however applicability of the predicted stomatal conductance was not presented in the context of soil type or density in their study in addition stomatal conductance was not monitored from anaerobiosis point to wilting point for the selected non crop species decrement in stomatal conductance due to increase in suction from 6 kpa to 2431 kpa can be explained using phenomena of partial and complete stomata closure partial and complete closure of stomata occur when plant is subjected to drought stress i e large suction abscisic acid is a plant hormone which exists in guard cell mediates the adaptation of mix grass to drought stress through partial and complete closure of stomata tipple and pagani 2007 abscisic acid changes the ph and concentration of ca2 cl and k to respond drought wilkinson and davies 1997 these changes cause partial closure of stomata and increase the suction in leaf pei et al 2000 munemasa et al 2015 this partial closure of stomata results in less stomatal conductance it can be observed from fig 6 that partial closure of stomata occurs typically at suction between 6 kpa and 1340 kpa further water loss through stomata at very large suction and less available water content damages the chloroplast and guard cells hence major number of stomata exist in leaf will be completely closed and results in very low stomatal conductance such low stomatal conductance can be observed between 1340 kpa and 2431 kpa stomatal conductance becomes 0 when stomata system is completely damaged at suction around 2431 kpa stomatal conductance of mix grass under light is observed to be 19 64 higher than that under shade up to suction around 1340 kpa this can be attributed to difference in stomata opening corresponding to radiant energy variation gross et al 1996 stomata closes partially under the presence of low light for photosynthesis miyazawa et al 2005 whereas it opens completely in the presence of adequate radiant energy schymanski et al 2013 difference between stomatal conductance of ggl and ggs is minimal beyond the suction value of 1340 kpa stomatal conductance of ggl is observed to be only 2 4 higher than that of ggs at suction beyond 1340 kpa and below the wilting point this may be because of complete closure of major number of stomata exist in ggl as well as ggs due to large suction this shows that effect of suction dominates the influence of light when suction lies between 1340 kpa and 2431 kpa previous studies ackerson 1980 bréda et al 1993 tardieu and simonneau 1998 gomes et al 2004 warren 2008 show that decrease in stomatal conductance by 95 is possible due to water stress in soil however stomatal conductance was not monitored corresponding to change in suction 3 2 2 establishment of correlation between stomatal conductance and suction visual assessment suggests that the stomatal conductance suction relation mirrors water retention curve at suction values beyond 7 kpa see figs 5 and 6 a new model was proposed to characterize the shape of the relationship between stomatal conductance and suction s c ψ sc min sc max sc min 1 a ψ n 1 1 n sc ψ stomatal conductance corresponding to suction mol m 2 s 1 mol m 2 s 1 sc max maximum stomatal conductance mol m 2 s 1 mol m 2 s 1 sc min minimum stomatal conductance mol m 2 s 1 mol m 2 s 1 a is related to the suction corresponding to peak stomatal conductance a 0 n fitting coefficient associated with the curvature n 1 all the fitting parameters are tabulated in table 1 it should be noted that the fitting parameters are valid for the suction range beyond the corresponding suction of peak stomatal conductance the curves fitted can be referred as stomatal conductance characteristic curve sccc it should be noted that stomatal conductance may not decrease or increase consistently during day light period in such case comprehensive and accurate models can be developed using neural network alavi et al 2009 gandomi et al 2008 it should be noted that drought response of various evergreen or deciduous vegetation may be dissimilar to that of the species tested in preset study smith et al 2001 niinemets and valladares 2006 vijayaraghavan et al 2018 therefore sccc may also vary for various evergreen or deciduous species 3 2 3 comparison of normalized surface area of mix grass cover at various suction values surface areas of entire mix grass ggl ggs and cwg were obtained in pixels using image j thereafter it was normalized by maximum surface area of entire mix grass cover for better understanding fig 7 shows the variation of normalized surface area of entire mix grass cover ggl ggs and cwg with respect to suction normalized surface area of entire mix grass is observed to vary between 1 00 and 0 38 normalized surface area of entire mix grass cover is observed to increase initially with an increase in suction up to 6 kpa thereafter normalized surface area of entire mix grass is observed to decrease with an increase in suction up to 3642 kpa reason for such decrease is shrinkage of mix grass when it is exposed continuous evapotranspiration chartzoulakis et al 2002 scoffoni et al 2011 normalized surface area of ggl is found to vary between 0 00 and 0 79 normalized surface area of ggl is observed to increase with suction up to 18 kpa this is due to growth of new leaves of mix grass however normalized area of entire mix grass is not found to increase between 6 kpa and 18 kpa this is because of an increase in normalized area of wilted grass due to shrinkage of existing mix grass normalized surface area of ggl is found to decrease with an increase in suction from 18 kpa to 3624 kpa normalized surface area of ggl is observed to reach nil at suction around 3624 kpa range of normalized surface area of ggs is found to be 0 00 0 18 normalized surface area of ggs is found to decrease with an increase in suction up to around 3013 kpa although green grass exists normalized surface area of ggs is found to be negligible at 3013 kpa variation in normalized surface area of entire mix grass and three categories of mix grass is observed to be relatively low i e within 15 up to 138 kpa this can be explained by using the basis of favorable suction range for root water uptake feddes 1982 reported that root water uptake could be significant between 5 kpa and 100 kpa such high root water uptake implies more vegetation growth sharp and davies 1985 large decrease around 47 and 66 in normalized surface areas of entire mix grass cover and ggl can be observed with an increase in suction from 138 kpa to 2431 kpa in addition large increase in cwg around 31 also can be observed due to increase in suction from 138 kpa to 2431 kpa this may be due to an increase in water stress and reduction in root water uptake at higher ranges of suction normalized surface area of entire mix grass is found to decrease by 2 with an increase in suction from 2431 kpa to 3624 kpa whereas any variation in normalized surface area of cwg was not found within 2431 3624 kpa unlike to ggl and cwg difference between maximum and minimum normalized surface area of ggs is relatively low i e 18 reason for such low difference is decrement in normalized surface area of mix grass due to shrinkage jeong et al 2013 previous research jeong et al 2013 shows that surface area change could be possible under continuous drying in addition suction variation with time was monitored during drying period in vegetated soil widely somma et al 1998 wu et al 1999 vrugt et al 2001 javaux et al 2008 however normalized surface area decrement was not correlated to the suction in their studies 3 2 4 establishment of correlation between normalized surface area of mix grass and suction optical assessment advises that the trend of variation of normalized surface area of grass suction relation also emulates water retention curve see figs 5 and 7 a new equation is proposed to describe the normalized surface area of grass suction relation n s ψ ns min ns max ns min 1 a ψ n 1 1 n ns ψ normalized surface area corresponding to suction m2 m2 ns max maximum normalized surface area m2 m2 ns min minimum normalized surface area m2 m2 a is related to the suction corresponding to maximum normalized surface area a 0 n fitting coefficient associated with the curvature n 1 all the fitting parameters are tabulated in table 2 the curves fitted can be referred as sacc it must be noted that a slight increase in surface area corresponding to suction up to 18 kpa was not considered by the fitted curve it is known that drought response of evergreen or deciduous vegetation may be dissimilar to that of the species tested in present study ackerly 2004 hallik et al 2009 bartlett et al 2012 in addition change in colour of evergreen or deciduous vegetation would be different to that of species monitored in the current study damesin and rambal 1995 rambal 1993 werner et al 1999 therefore sacc is likely to vary for various evergreen or deciduous species previous studies herbel et al 1972 quan and liang 2017 beckett et al 2017 show that soil texture affects the stomatal conductance and surface area hence soil type may also influence the sccc and sacc however change in soil suction was not considered in previous studies 3 2 5 engineering implications of the developed relations evapotranspiration induced suction was widely analyzed to understand the slope stability zhu and zhang 2015 gadi et al 2018b and ground water recharge leterme et al 2012 fan 2014 richards equation with sink term is commonly used to simulate the evapotranspiration induced suction during drying period de silva et al 2008 deb et al 2013 commercially available finite element packages i e vadose w hydrus etc are used to numerically solve the richards equation dabach et al 2013 fig 6 shows that the difference between highest and lowest stomatal conductance would be up to 95 however most of the previous researchers assumed a single value of stomatal conductance as an input parameter to analyze the slope stability and ground water recharge this assumption may yield inaccurate analysis therefore the proposed relation i e sccc helps the scientific community to analyze the slope stability and ground water recharge considering the current state of plant parameters fig 7 shows that change in surface area of vegetation would be up to 60 with an increase in suction during drying whereas previous studies zhu and zhang 2015 assumes a single value of surface area of vegetation during entire period of drying this shows that sacc is vital to analyze the slope stability and ground water recharge accurately furthermore the proposed relationships can be programmed with commercially available finite element package i e vadose w and hydrus 4 conclusions this test aimed to investigate the variation of suction stomatal conductance and surface area when mix grass is subjected to drought stress stomatal conductance is found to vary between 681 m mol m 2 s 1 and 0 m mol m 2 s 1 during monitoring period ranges of normalized surface areas of entire mix grass ggl ggs and cwg with respect to maximum surface area are observed to be 0 38 1 00 0 00 0 79 0 02 0 38 and 0 05 0 18 respectively stomatal conductance is found to increase initially with an increase in suction up to 6 1 kpa i e around the suction corresponding to volumetric field capacity this increase can be attributed to oxygen raise in pores of soil root composite on the contrary stomatal conductance decreases by 90 for suction range from 6 kpa to 1340 kpa i e around lower limit of suction range corresponding to vwcs less than hygroscopic water content partial closure of stomata could be the reason for such large decrease in stomatal conductance stomatal conductance variation is relatively less around 21 with an increase in suction between 1340 and 2431 kpa suction range corresponding to water content below hygroscopic water content this could be due to complete closure of major number of stomata exist in leaf stomatal conductance becomes 0 at 2431 kpa i e wilting point due to damage of stomata system stomatal conductance of ggl is 2 64 higher than that of ggs at suction below 2431 kpa partial closure of stomata under low light attributes the less stomatal conductance of ggs change in normalized surface area of entire mix grass ggl ggs and cwg was relative low within 15 with an increase in suction up to 138 kpa this can be attributed to growth of new leaves normalized surface areas of entire mix grass and ggl decrease drastically by 47 and 66 with an increase in suction from 138 kpa to 2431 kpa normalized area of cwg increases significantly by 31 with an increase in suction from 138 kpa to 2431 kpa normalized surface areas of entire mix grass and ggl decrease by only 2 with rise in suction from 2431 kpa to 3642 kpa whereas normalized surface area of cwg remains reasonably constant between 2431 kpa and 3642 kpa decrement in normalized surface area of ggs was relatively low i e 18 before it reaches to 0 at 3013 kpa two novel relationships i e sccc and sacc were developed to estimate the evapotranspiration and numerical analysis of suction induced in green infrastructure accurately further studies are required to explore the diurnal variation of stomatal conductance and surface area of mix grass during continuous drying period in addition influence of soil type on sccc and sacc needs to be investigated furthermore comprehensive studies are needed to explore the influence of type of vegetation it is known that rapidity of stomatal closure and cell death varies with age of the plant this implies that the relationships between suction and plant parameters may change with age therefore age effect on relationships between suction and plant parameters need to be investigated in future studies conflict of interest the author declare that there is no conflict

6854,evapotranspiration was determined to be hydrological effect which induces suction evapotranspiration induced suction governs the slope stability ground water recharge and runoff this study focuses on suction induced in root zone of mix grass used in green infrastructure most of the previous studies focused on evapotranspiration induced suction less than 100 kpa measured using tensiometers however for investigating the drought condition it is essential to obtain suction data greater than 100 kpa it was noted that the response of plant parameters such as stomatal conductance and surface area were not considered holistically evapotranspiration induced suction the main objective of this study is to investigate relationship among evapotranspiration induced suction stomatal conductance and surface area for a mix grass species used in green infrastructure subjected to drought stress corresponds to suction 100 kpa stomatal conductance was observed to increase up to suction 6 1 kpa corresponding to volumetric field capacity thereafter large decrease more than 90 in stomatal conductance was found with an increase in suction stomatal conductance was found to be 0 at 2431 kpa i e wilting point change in normalized surface areas of mix grass was found to be relatively low within 15 with an increase in suction up to 138 kpa however beyond 138 kpa it varied drastically by 31 68 with an increase in suction from 138 kpa to 3642 kpa two new relationships i e stomatal conductance characteristic curve sccc and surface area characteristic curve sacc were proposed therefore the relationships developed in current study help to analyze the performance of green infrastructure accurately keywords green infrastructure wilted grass suction stomatal conductance heterogeneous

al 2009 leung et al 2015a b liang et al 2017 the implications of vegetation in geotechnical and ecological infrastructure i e green infrastructure is shown in fig 1 the process of evapotranspiration induces suction in root zone of green infrastructure influence of suction induced in soil root composite on slope stability and ground water recharge were demonstrated previously fredlund et al 1978 deb et al 2013 hazra et al 2017 taniguchi et al 1996 allison et al 1994 chen and dudhia 2001 ma et al 2009 most of the previous researchers lehmann et al 1998 czarnes et al 2000 pollen bankhead and simon 2010 gadi et al 2016 used tensiometers to measure suction in vegetated soil the restricted suction measurement range of tensiometer 1 100 kpa is not suitable for soils having relatively high silt or clay content gallage and uchimura 2010 abhijit et al 2013 this translates to the fact that low range of suction measurement may not be helpful to study the suction developed in the root zone for drought condition it is worth noting that the green infrastructure is subjected to intense and frequent droughts gadi et al 2016 bordoloi et al 2018b as a result of water deficit relatively high suction 1500 kpa occurs in the root zone bordoloi et al 2018a gadi et al 2018b therefore measurement of higher range of suction than what can be recorded using tensiometer is a pressing need for studying green infrastructure a few researchers have measured suction induced in root zone under drought conditions garg et al 2015a bordoloi et al 2018a for studying the response close to the wilting point suction of 1500 kpa feddes 1982 garg et al 2015a however there are not many studies that integrate the evapotranspiration induced suction response in root zone with plant parameters which is invariably necessary to understand the abiotic stress response of plants in green infrastructure stomatal conductance is one of the crucial plant parameters which governs the evapotranspiration through vegetation in green infrastructure bordoloi et al 2018a penman monteith equation was proposed by monteith 1965 to show the relation between evapotranspiration and stomatal conductance stomatal conductance is the measure of rate of carbon dioxide uptake or water loss through stomata of leaf this can be demonstrated using mechanism of opening and closing of stomata plural form of stoma see fig 1 transpiration occurs as long as stoma open and it stops when stoma is closed tipple and pagani 2007 light and health conditions of mix grass exist in green infrastructure were found to be highly heterogeneous spatially gadi et al 2017a this spatial heterogeneity is usually grouped into three categories of mix grass those three categories are green grass under sunlight ggl green grass under self shade ggs and completely wilted grass cwg see fig 1 gadi et al 2017b respectively it is evident that partial or complete closure of stomata occurs in mix grass due to water stress high suction tobin and kulmatiski 2018 as a result of stomatal closure stomatal conductance of the leaf varies tipple and pagani 2007 jarvis et al 1981 and would also depend on parts of the day i e morning afternoon and evening lo gullo et al 2005 beadle et al 1985 there are not many studies that deals with the variation of stomatal conductance with evapotranspiration induced suction specifically range of suction 100 kpa surface area of vegetation is another key parameter to estimate suction induced due to evapotranspiration in green infrastructure gadi et al 2018a garg et al 2015b garg and ng 2015 it is well known that surface area of mix grass decreases with time due to shrinkage of grass during drying period anjum et al 2011 the surface area variation with an increase in suction was rarely quantified previously a recent study gadi et al 2018b shows that suction induced due to relatively large vegetation surface area could be 10 times higher than that of small surface area of vegetation cover hence incorporation of stomatal conductance and surface area of vegetation is deemed necessary for analyzing evapotranspiration induced suction in green infrastructure projects this study purports to fill this research gap by investigating the interplay of evapotranspiration induced suction stomatal conductance and surface area of a mix grass species in a compacted soil mass important for bioengineering subjected to drought stress suction 100 kpa it is believed that the study is an integration of soil specific characteristics and plant parameters for understanding the complex interaction of soil plant atmosphere continuum the results from this study were used to quantitatively investigate the relationship between evapotranspiration induced suction stomatal conductance and surface area of mix grass 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil properties red soil is selected for investigation which is commonly found in subtropical regions wang et al 2004 huang et al 2010 soil was collected from a hill site in north east region in india the average contents of gravel sand silt and clay were determined to be 0 25 17 50 22 and 24 61 respectively soil is classified as ml astm d 2487 10 astm 2010 according to unified soil classification system uscs liquid limit plastic limit and shrinkage limit were found to be 42 24 and 19 optimum moisture content and maximum dry density were found to be 18 and 1 65 g c c respectively the basic physical and engineering properties were determined under the provisions of astm d 854 06 astm 2007a astm d 2487 10 astm 2010 astm d 698 07 astm 2007b and astm d 4318 93 astm 1993 2 2 selected plant species and transplantation condition mix grass which is combination of two grass species namely axonopus compressus and cynadon dactylon were selected for the study this combination of two grass species was selected based on its i wide spread existence in subtropical regions sun and liddle 1993 avilés nova et al 2008 ii drought tolerance ability which is suitable for erosion control eusebius et al 2002 and iii the recognition of its significant ornate and eco friendly values for land and slope rehabilitation and reforestation singh et al 2013 it should be noted that the selected species are non crop species and supplementary nutrients are not needed for growth rhizomes of both species were collected from nearby green space 2 3 experimental setup and instrumentation 2 3 1 soil sample preparation test setup used to demonstrate the measurement of stomatal conductance and surface of mix grass is schematically portrayed in fig 2 the experimental setup consists of a cylindrical pvc poly vinyl chloride mould of 300 mm diameter and 250 mm length with prefabricated holes at sides to accommodate suction and moisture content sensors the locations of the instrumentation can be seen in fig 2 soil sample was compacted statically to a targeted dry density of 1 56 g c c i e equivalent to relative compaction of 90 relative compaction refers to the percentage ratio of the adopted dry density for sample preparation to the maximum dry density determined by the standard proctor compaction test the selected relative compaction is commonly adopted for embankment construction li et al 2016 a vertical force of 60 kn was applied to statically compact the soil venkatarama reddy and jagadish 1993 bulk density of compacted soil sample was found to be 1 96 g c c the final height of the sample is 170 mm from base a perforated pvc base plate was attached to the mould to allow drainage a filter paper was placed on base plate to prevent loss of soil particles from mould in addition the inner surface of the mould was coated with lubricant to reduce interface friction between soil and pvc the soil was compacted in three different layers of equal thickness 2 3 2 installation of instrumentation dummy tubes were placed during compaction at the locations of vwc and suction sensors the tubes of relatively less diameter as compared to sensors were inserted to ensure the tight contact between soil and instruments after installation two mps 6 sensors decagon devices 2016a were installed in diametrically opposite ends at a depth of 40 mm to capture the suction range of 9 10 000 kpa induced due to root water uptake as placed in previous studies bordoloi et al 2018a in addition a tensiometer was installed to capture the suction range below 9 kpa a moisture content sensor sm 200 delta t devices 2006 was installed diametrically opposite to tensiometer the minor gap between sensor and soil was backfilled with the red soil to prevent the preferential flow a layer of anabond adhesive was applied in the clearance between sensor and pvc at the predrilled holes mps 6 sensors were connected to em 50 data logger decagon devices 2016b for data logging tensiometer and sm 200 were connected to gp2 goodchild et al 2014 and dl 6 data loggers delta t devices 2013 soil root composite water retention curve was obtained using measured suction and vwc 2 3 3 environmental conditions during plant growth the specimen was placed under transparent roof and exposed to natural environmental condition during monitoring period transparent roof was arranged to avoid effect of natural precipitation during monitoring period while the mould is subjected to drying controlled irrigation was applied using a sprinkler system to nurture the mix grass a mariott s bottle was connected to control intensity and duration of irrigation pattern a digital camera with a detachable frame was mounted above the pvc mould to obtain the images of mix grass periodically mix grass was transplanted to the pot after the installation of instruments vegetated pot was irrigated regularly for a period of 72 days after 4 days of interval the irrigation period was maintained at 4 day interval to ensure the suction below the wilting point reported by previous researchers 1500 kpa feddes 1982 area of green grass cover live grass cover in the pot was found to reach inner area of pot at the end of 73 days thereafter mix grass cover was exposed to evaporation until it completely wilts methodology to quantify the surface area of grass cover has been explained in section 2 5 the meteorological parameters such as solar radiation air temperature and air relative humidity were monitored using a micro climate monitoring system meteorological parameters observed during test period are shown in fig 3 explained in next section 2 3 4 camera settings for capturing images of mix grass cover a commercially available camera canon eos 600d was mounted on a detachable frame above the pvc mould to capture the images of mix grass cover periodically the lens range and horizontal vertical resolution were maintained at 18 55 mm and 72 dpi the focal length iso speed and exposure time were maintained at 23 mm iso 640 and 1 30 sec respectively resolution of camera model is 18 megapixels images were captured from same height 400 mm using an adjustable frame see fig 2 maintenance of same focal length iso speed and exposure time and height minimizes observational errors and enable constant number of pixels in order to compare the image analysis results accurately constant pixel area is essential gadi et al 2017c images were captured in ambient light during measurement period of stomatal conductance 2 4 measurement of stomatal conductance ggl ggs and cwg were categorized by visual observation to measure stomatal conductance it is evident that large number of leaves are available for testing measurement of stomatal conductance for all existing leaves in pot requires relatively long duration in such case measured stomatal conductance could not be compared accurately pietragalla and pask 2012 hence five locations of each category were selected for measurement of stomatal conductance using leaf porometer decagon devices 2006 stomatal conductance refers to ratio of flux density and the water vapor concentration difference between surroundings and leaf surface pietragalla and pask 2012 leaf is clamped to the open chamber in leaf porometer relative humidity gradient forms between surroundings of chamber and leaf surface leaf porometer calculates stomatal conductance from the relative humidity gradient a standard procedure decagon devices 2006 was adopted for the calibration of leaf porometer the instrument was calibrated using a known conductance value of filter paper moistened with distilled water the accuracy of the leaf porometer was found to be around 90 as the stomata is sensitive to physical manipulation any physical stress or human contact with the leaf is avoided as much as possible measurements were performed as accurately and quickly as possible as the porometer usage may alter surface of leaf variation in relative humidity temperature and radiant energy is found to be very low during 10 00 a m 12 00 a m hence stomatal conductance and surface area was monitored under ambient light during above mentioned time period relative humidity temperature and radiant energy are observed to be 79 4 31 c 2 c and 33 mj m 2 d 1 6 mj m 2 d 1 see fig 3 it must be noted that light relative humidity and temperature would change with time koyama and takemoto 2014 changes in light relative humidity and temperature affect stomatal conductance and surface area of mix grass bytnerowicz and fenn 1996 bytnerowicz et al 2003 mooney et al 1983 as a result of change in stomatal conductance and surface area the correlations developed in present study may not be same for different environmental conditions the main focus of present study is to explore the high evapotranspiration induced suction in soil root composite and changes in stomatal conductance and surface area of canopy at higher suctions hence measurements taken at only one point of time suffice the purpose of the study it is evident that age of grass effects the stomatal conductance buchanan wollaston et al 2005 lee et al 2011 hence the mix grass of relatively less age difference was considered for the measurement in addition mix grass wilts gradually therefore measurement of stomatal conductance for a single leaf could not be possible during entire monitoring period leaf considered for stomatal conductance measurement has been changed when the mix grass at selected location reaches to wilting point 2 5 quantification of surface area of ggl ggs cwg fig 4 shows the colour analysis procedure to differentiate and quantify the surface area covered by ggl ggs and cwg basis for colour analysis procedure was described in gadi et al 2017b image was digitized after importing into imagej imagej is a java based image processing tool pixel value statistics and density of vegetation cover rasband and image 2011 thereafter image was cropped and inner area of the pot was quantified using measurement option this measure option is shown along with imagej window in fig 4 a ggl ggs and cwg are categorized using colour threshold option see fig 4 b this option facilitate the histogram of l a and b values for the all pixels of image image j enable 256 values of l a and b on three different scales which vary between 0 and 255 marked in fig 4 b the three categories of mix grass were identified separately by adjusting the values of l a and b on scales the variation of l a and b ranges for three categories in fig 4 b area of all three categories were quantified using measure option it can be observed from fig 5 that fewer shoots exist below the mix grass as the captured images are two dimensional the surface area of above mentioned fewer shoots could not be categorized surface area of shoots below the mix grass was found to be 6 7 of total surface area of mix grass surface area of shoots below the mix grass could be relatively high in case of few species gadi et al 2017b in such case analysis of two dimensional images may not suffice the purpose hence three dimensional images are required to quantify and categorize the mix grass accurately 3d lidar imaging could be the possible solution to capture the high resolution three dimensional images omasa et al 2006 3 results 3 1 gradual wilting of mix grass cover during monitoring period fig 5 shows the water retention curve of soil root composite water retention curve was fitted using van genuchten 1980 approach fitting coefficients related to curvature α and pore size distribution n were found to be 0 27 and 1 45 respectively air entry value is found to be about 2 kpa air entry value represents the suction value at which air starts to enter pores in soil matrix the air entry value is generally established by following procedure fredlund and xing 1994 zhai and rahardjo 2012 a horizontal line is drawn from the saturation point a tangent line is drawn through the point where desaturation curve is linear the inflection point of above mentioned horizontal and tangent lines indicate the air entry value vwc is observed to reduce noticeably from about 30 to 7 with an increase in suction by 90 kpa volumetric field capacity is found to be 24 26 it refers to the vwc held in soil after excess water drained away due to gravity suction corresponding to volumetric field capacity is observed to be 5 8 kpa hygroscopic water content is found to be around 5 hygroscopic water content was determined according to guidelines of shah and singh 2005 lower limit of suction range corresponding to vwcs less than hygroscopic water content is observed to be around 1400 kpa fig 5a f shows the gradual wilting of mix grass with respect to suction during monitoring period there is no visible difference in surface area of grass observed for suction up to 103 kpa see fig 5 a c noticeable change in surface area covered by green grass was observed at suction values beyond 103 kpa completely wilted grass is observed over major region at suction around 2431 kpa 3 2 stomatal conductance variation during monitoring period 3 2 1 comparison of stomatal conductance measured at various suction values fig 6 shows the average stomatal conductance at the selected locations of ggl and ggs stomatal conductance is observed to vary between 681 m mol m 2 s 1 and 0 m mol m 2 s 1 stomatal conductance of ggl and ggs is observed to increase with rise in suction up to 6 1 kpa during monitoring period stomatal conductance of ggl and ggs is observed to increase by 54 and 101 with 5 kpa raise in suction it can also be observed that peak stomatal conductance occurs near to the suction corresponding to volumetric field capacity relatively less stomatal conductance at low suction can be explained on the basis of oxygen available in soil root composite low suction represents the situation when oxygen available in pores of soil root composite is very limited due to high saturation raes and deproost 2003 in such case stomatal conductance would be relatively low thomas et al 2016 thereafter stomatal conductance is found to decrease up to suction around 1340 kpa such decrease is observed to be around 90 for ggl and ggs furthermore stomatal conductance variation is observed to be relatively low around 21 with an increase in suction from 1340 kpa to that less than 2431 kpa it can be noticed that typical lower limit of suction range see fig 5 corresponding to vwcs less than hygroscopic water content is near to 1340 kpa in addition suction values beyond 1340 kpa lies in typical suction range corresponding to vwc below the hygroscopic water content stomatal conductance is observed to be zero at suction around 2431 kpa this suction value can be termed as typical wilting point for the selected combination of grass species wilting point was reported to be 1500 kpa by feddes 1982 in addition a recent study garg et al 2015a also presented the wilting point for schefflera heptaphylla according to feddes 1982 however results of the current study show that stomatal conductance corresponding to suction and wilting point may vary for different species predicted stomatal conductance values were presented in a recent study tobin and kulmatiski 2018 corresponding to a wide range of suction 1 500 kpa however applicability of the predicted stomatal conductance was not presented in the context of soil type or density in their study in addition stomatal conductance was not monitored from anaerobiosis point to wilting point for the selected non crop species decrement in stomatal conductance due to increase in suction from 6 kpa to 2431 kpa can be explained using phenomena of partial and complete stomata closure partial and complete closure of stomata occur when plant is subjected to drought stress i e large suction abscisic acid is a plant hormone which exists in guard cell mediates the adaptation of mix grass to drought stress through partial and complete closure of stomata tipple and pagani 2007 abscisic acid changes the ph and concentration of ca2 cl and k to respond drought wilkinson and davies 1997 these changes cause partial closure of stomata and increase the suction in leaf pei et al 2000 munemasa et al 2015 this partial closure of stomata results in less stomatal conductance it can be observed from fig 6 that partial closure of stomata occurs typically at suction between 6 kpa and 1340 kpa further water loss through stomata at very large suction and less available water content damages the chloroplast and guard cells hence major number of stomata exist in leaf will be completely closed and results in very low stomatal conductance such low stomatal conductance can be observed between 1340 kpa and 2431 kpa stomatal conductance becomes 0 when stomata system is completely damaged at suction around 2431 kpa stomatal conductance of mix grass under light is observed to be 19 64 higher than that under shade up to suction around 1340 kpa this can be attributed to difference in stomata opening corresponding to radiant energy variation gross et al 1996 stomata closes partially under the presence of low light for photosynthesis miyazawa et al 2005 whereas it opens completely in the presence of adequate radiant energy schymanski et al 2013 difference between stomatal conductance of ggl and ggs is minimal beyond the suction value of 1340 kpa stomatal conductance of ggl is observed to be only 2 4 higher than that of ggs at suction beyond 1340 kpa and below the wilting point this may be because of complete closure of major number of stomata exist in ggl as well as ggs due to large suction this shows that effect of suction dominates the influence of light when suction lies between 1340 kpa and 2431 kpa previous studies ackerson 1980 bréda et al 1993 tardieu and simonneau 1998 gomes et al 2004 warren 2008 show that decrease in stomatal conductance by 95 is possible due to water stress in soil however stomatal conductance was not monitored corresponding to change in suction 3 2 2 establishment of correlation between stomatal conductance and suction visual assessment suggests that the stomatal conductance suction relation mirrors water retention curve at suction values beyond 7 kpa see figs 5 and 6 a new model was proposed to characterize the shape of the relationship between stomatal conductance and suction s c ψ sc min sc max sc min 1 a ψ n 1 1 n sc ψ stomatal conductance corresponding to suction mol m 2 s 1 mol m 2 s 1 sc max maximum stomatal conductance mol m 2 s 1 mol m 2 s 1 sc min minimum stomatal conductance mol m 2 s 1 mol m 2 s 1 a is related to the suction corresponding to peak stomatal conductance a 0 n fitting coefficient associated with the curvature n 1 all the fitting parameters are tabulated in table 1 it should be noted that the fitting parameters are valid for the suction range beyond the corresponding suction of peak stomatal conductance the curves fitted can be referred as stomatal conductance characteristic curve sccc it should be noted that stomatal conductance may not decrease or increase consistently during day light period in such case comprehensive and accurate models can be developed using neural network alavi et al 2009 gandomi et al 2008 it should be noted that drought response of various evergreen or deciduous vegetation may be dissimilar to that of the species tested in preset study smith et al 2001 niinemets and valladares 2006 vijayaraghavan et al 2018 therefore sccc may also vary for various evergreen or deciduous species 3 2 3 comparison of normalized surface area of mix grass cover at various suction values surface areas of entire mix grass ggl ggs and cwg were obtained in pixels using image j thereafter it was normalized by maximum surface area of entire mix grass cover for better understanding fig 7 shows the variation of normalized surface area of entire mix grass cover ggl ggs and cwg with respect to suction normalized surface area of entire mix grass is observed to vary between 1 00 and 0 38 normalized surface area of entire mix grass cover is observed to increase initially with an increase in suction up to 6 kpa thereafter normalized surface area of entire mix grass is observed to decrease with an increase in suction up to 3642 kpa reason for such decrease is shrinkage of mix grass when it is exposed continuous evapotranspiration chartzoulakis et al 2002 scoffoni et al 2011 normalized surface area of ggl is found to vary between 0 00 and 0 79 normalized surface area of ggl is observed to increase with suction up to 18 kpa this is due to growth of new leaves of mix grass however normalized area of entire mix grass is not found to increase between 6 kpa and 18 kpa this is because of an increase in normalized area of wilted grass due to shrinkage of existing mix grass normalized surface area of ggl is found to decrease with an increase in suction from 18 kpa to 3624 kpa normalized surface area of ggl is observed to reach nil at suction around 3624 kpa range of normalized surface area of ggs is found to be 0 00 0 18 normalized surface area of ggs is found to decrease with an increase in suction up to around 3013 kpa although green grass exists normalized surface area of ggs is found to be negligible at 3013 kpa variation in normalized surface area of entire mix grass and three categories of mix grass is observed to be relatively low i e within 15 up to 138 kpa this can be explained by using the basis of favorable suction range for root water uptake feddes 1982 reported that root water uptake could be significant between 5 kpa and 100 kpa such high root water uptake implies more vegetation growth sharp and davies 1985 large decrease around 47 and 66 in normalized surface areas of entire mix grass cover and ggl can be observed with an increase in suction from 138 kpa to 2431 kpa in addition large increase in cwg around 31 also can be observed due to increase in suction from 138 kpa to 2431 kpa this may be due to an increase in water stress and reduction in root water uptake at higher ranges of suction normalized surface area of entire mix grass is found to decrease by 2 with an increase in suction from 2431 kpa to 3624 kpa whereas any variation in normalized surface area of cwg was not found within 2431 3624 kpa unlike to ggl and cwg difference between maximum and minimum normalized surface area of ggs is relatively low i e 18 reason for such low difference is decrement in normalized surface area of mix grass due to shrinkage jeong et al 2013 previous research jeong et al 2013 shows that surface area change could be possible under continuous drying in addition suction variation with time was monitored during drying period in vegetated soil widely somma et al 1998 wu et al 1999 vrugt et al 2001 javaux et al 2008 however normalized surface area decrement was not correlated to the suction in their studies 3 2 4 establishment of correlation between normalized surface area of mix grass and suction optical assessment advises that the trend of variation of normalized surface area of grass suction relation also emulates water retention curve see figs 5 and 7 a new equation is proposed to describe the normalized surface area of grass suction relation n s ψ ns min ns max ns min 1 a ψ n 1 1 n ns ψ normalized surface area corresponding to suction m2 m2 ns max maximum normalized surface area m2 m2 ns min minimum normalized surface area m2 m2 a is related to the suction corresponding to maximum normalized surface area a 0 n fitting coefficient associated with the curvature n 1 all the fitting parameters are tabulated in table 2 the curves fitted can be referred as sacc it must be noted that a slight increase in surface area corresponding to suction up to 18 kpa was not considered by the fitted curve it is known that drought response of evergreen or deciduous vegetation may be dissimilar to that of the species tested in present study ackerly 2004 hallik et al 2009 bartlett et al 2012 in addition change in colour of evergreen or deciduous vegetation would be different to that of species monitored in the current study damesin and rambal 1995 rambal 1993 werner et al 1999 therefore sacc is likely to vary for various evergreen or deciduous species previous studies herbel et al 1972 quan and liang 2017 beckett et al 2017 show that soil texture affects the stomatal conductance and surface area hence soil type may also influence the sccc and sacc however change in soil suction was not considered in previous studies 3 2 5 engineering implications of the developed relations evapotranspiration induced suction was widely analyzed to understand the slope stability zhu and zhang 2015 gadi et al 2018b and ground water recharge leterme et al 2012 fan 2014 richards equation with sink term is commonly used to simulate the evapotranspiration induced suction during drying period de silva et al 2008 deb et al 2013 commercially available finite element packages i e vadose w hydrus etc are used to numerically solve the richards equation dabach et al 2013 fig 6 shows that the difference between highest and lowest stomatal conductance would be up to 95 however most of the previous researchers assumed a single value of stomatal conductance as an input parameter to analyze the slope stability and ground water recharge this assumption may yield inaccurate analysis therefore the proposed relation i e sccc helps the scientific community to analyze the slope stability and ground water recharge considering the current state of plant parameters fig 7 shows that change in surface area of vegetation would be up to 60 with an increase in suction during drying whereas previous studies zhu and zhang 2015 assumes a single value of surface area of vegetation during entire period of drying this shows that sacc is vital to analyze the slope stability and ground water recharge accurately furthermore the proposed relationships can be programmed with commercially available finite element package i e vadose w and hydrus 4 conclusions this test aimed to investigate the variation of suction stomatal conductance and surface area when mix grass is subjected to drought stress stomatal conductance is found to vary between 681 m mol m 2 s 1 and 0 m mol m 2 s 1 during monitoring period ranges of normalized surface areas of entire mix grass ggl ggs and cwg with respect to maximum surface area are observed to be 0 38 1 00 0 00 0 79 0 02 0 38 and 0 05 0 18 respectively stomatal conductance is found to increase initially with an increase in suction up to 6 1 kpa i e around the suction corresponding to volumetric field capacity this increase can be attributed to oxygen raise in pores of soil root composite on the contrary stomatal conductance decreases by 90 for suction range from 6 kpa to 1340 kpa i e around lower limit of suction range corresponding to vwcs less than hygroscopic water content partial closure of stomata could be the reason for such large decrease in stomatal conductance stomatal conductance variation is relatively less around 21 with an increase in suction between 1340 and 2431 kpa suction range corresponding to water content below hygroscopic water content this could be due to complete closure of major number of stomata exist in leaf stomatal conductance becomes 0 at 2431 kpa i e wilting point due to damage of stomata system stomatal conductance of ggl is 2 64 higher than that of ggs at suction below 2431 kpa partial closure of stomata under low light attributes the less stomatal conductance of ggs change in normalized surface area of entire mix grass ggl ggs and cwg was relative low within 15 with an increase in suction up to 138 kpa this can be attributed to growth of new leaves normalized surface areas of entire mix grass and ggl decrease drastically by 47 and 66 with an increase in suction from 138 kpa to 2431 kpa normalized area of cwg increases significantly by 31 with an increase in suction from 138 kpa to 2431 kpa normalized surface areas of entire mix grass and ggl decrease by only 2 with rise in suction from 2431 kpa to 3642 kpa whereas normalized surface area of cwg remains reasonably constant between 2431 kpa and 3642 kpa decrement in normalized surface area of ggs was relatively low i e 18 before it reaches to 0 at 3013 kpa two novel relationships i e sccc and sacc were developed to estimate the evapotranspiration and numerical analysis of suction induced in green infrastructure accurately further studies are required to explore the diurnal variation of stomatal conductance and surface area of mix grass during continuous drying period in addition influence of soil type on sccc and sacc needs to be investigated furthermore comprehensive studies are needed to explore the influence of type of vegetation it is known that rapidity of stomatal closure and cell death varies with age of the plant this implies that the relationships between suction and plant parameters may change with age therefore age effect on relationships between suction and plant parameters need to be investigated in future studies conflict of interest the author declare that there is no conflict
