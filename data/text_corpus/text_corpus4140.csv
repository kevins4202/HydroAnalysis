20700,the research object of the article is a similar model of a naval ship with an integrated sandwich composite superstructure the similarity model of this naval ship is based on the similarity theory which is obtained by scaling down the actual naval ship based on the theoretical guidance of the double beam method by using the static loading test of the four point bending method the article analyzes the magnitude and trend of the strain stress and deformation of the measuring points on the naval ship model under different load cases the main measuring points of the similar naval ship model are located in the typical cross sections each deck and the interface between the steel main hull and the integrated sandwich composite superstructure the article mainly explores the changes of longitudinal strain and stress of the measuring points with height on three typical cross sections and the changes of longitudinal strain and stress with the ship s length on the interface and the deformation of the top deck of the superstructure combining with the results of finite element numerical simulation the complicated mechanical properties of the naval ship model with an integrated sandwich composite superstructure are explored by mutual verification with the experiments some valuable conclusions are obtained for the construction and design of the naval ship with an integrated sandwich composite superstructure keywords naval ship model sandwich composite integrated superstructure mechanical properties interface 1 introduction the integrated superstructure of the naval ship starts from the shape which greatly reduces the stealth performance of the naval ship during surface combat the use of composite sandwich structure is to start from the material to effectively improve the stealth performance of the naval ship during surface combat the traditional steel structure has high stiffness and small deformation when the longitudinal deformation of the hull occurs the superstructure is the farthest away from the neutral axis of the hull equivalent beam so the structural stress value in the superstructure will be very large which is ultimately easy to lead to structural damage therefore the main deck of the superstructure needs to be designed as a strong deck but this will increase the weight of the superstructure causing the ship s center of gravity to increase and its stability to decrease some studies have compared the cost weight and structural performance of large patrol boats made of steel aluminum or sandwich composite materials smith and monks 1982 nguyen et al 1997 goubalt and mayes 1996 if the composite material is used to replace the traditional steel material in the integrated superstructure it can not only reduce the weight and center of gravity of the hull structure but also improve the stealth stability and speed of the naval ship thus reducing the fuel consumption and emissions and increasing the payload of the naval ship therefore the use of composite structure in the integrated superstructure of naval ships is the inevitable development direction to improve the stealth performance and combat comprehensive performance of naval ships in the future from the mid 1940s to the mid 1960s the use of composite materials in other types of u s navy ships expanded rapidly and many articles described the early application of composite materials in u s navy ships mäkinen et al 1998 mckenzie and stark 1953 fried and graner 1966 graner 1969 heller 1970 by the 1970s the royal navy of england the netherlands navy the royal swedish navy and the norwegian navy began to build composite mine hunting boats and landing boats mouritz et al 2001 beale 1971 for example the corton el class frigate fig 1 in the netherlands marked the formal application of composite materials in the global naval ship in 1973 britain and the united states jointly developed the hms wilton the first gfrp anti mine ship in the world with a total length of 46 6 m and a displacement of 450t summerscales and smith 1990 in 1992 france tested the lafayette frigate whose superstructure was designed with composite sandwich panels fig 2 in 2016 the latest zumwalt ddg 1000 destroyer fig 3 was officially delivered to the u s navy with a total length of 183m a draft of 8 4m and a displacement of 14500t its superstructure is made of composite materials and the structure above the main deck is hidden inside the superstructure tang et al 2006 doerry et al 2015 kwon et al 2016 in the early stage it was mainly based on the empirical method and test method to ensure that the composite material has sufficient strength when applied on the ship horsmon 1994 grabovac grabovac et al 1993 outlined a bonded composite reinforcement being developed for use in the superstructure of the ffg 7 frigate of the royal australian navy in the 1970s the main classification societies such as abs rules for building 1978 bv hull 2012 dnv hull 2013 lr lr 2015 etc successively issued the classification specifications for composite ships but the regulations for the design of composite superstructure are not specific and complete wright et al 2000 analyzed the structural performance of the steel composite bonding joint in the connection between the frp transverse bulkhead and the steel structure in the ship and gave the numerical prediction and experimental results of the joint structural strength subsequently cao et al cao and grenestedt 2003 2004 designed two kinds of connection joints between the navy grp superstructure and the steel hull again karatzas et al 2015 proposed that it is feasible to adopt a composite structural design for the superstructure of large passenger ships by comparing existing structural designs under different loading conditions morshedsoluk et al morshedsoluk and khedmati 2016 calculated the ultimate strength of composite ship considering the influence of superstructure by using the expansion formula of

connection structure consisting of composite sandwich plates reinforced cores and adhesive for the construction of lightweight ships to resolve connection problems between bulkheads and decks of composite lightweight ship superstructures kharghani kharghani et al 2019 tested the strength and stiffness of composite to steel joint under bending and torsion loads and to calibrate numerical models with respect to the experimental measurements andric andric et al 2019 evaluated the longitudinal and racking strengths of the composite sandwich deck panels using the complete fem model of ro ro ship and compared with the conventional vehicle design lv 2017 compared the degree of participation of steel superstructure and composite superstructure in longitudinal bending and analyzed the natural frequency of composite superstructure under different boundary conditions and different models yu yu et al 2017 combined with parametric modeling to calculate the optimal solutions for six design variables of the composite superstructure and analyzed the influence of each design variable on the constraints and objective function using the scanning method li et al 2018 put forward the concept of composite material t shaped and y shaped connection combined with a plate frame to realize integrated composite superstructure and studied its mechanical properties under combined wave

and considering the applicable scope advantages and disadvantages of various connecting structures based on the building block method li 2018 analyzed the mechanical properties of sandwich panels connection joints and typical cabins in the composite superstructure and carried out experimental verification on typical models chen chen et al 2021 studied the progressive failure and ultimate strength prediction of sandwich composite hat stringer stiffened panels in the ship subjected to the transverse in plane loads although a large number of basic experiments and researches have been done on the basic mechanical properties of sandwich composite structures the research on the mechanical properties of the ship with sandwich composite integrated superstructures is still limited and incomplete and the depth of research needs to be improved the research objectives are also mostly related to the local structures or components of the composite superstructure of the ship such as typical joint composite sandwich plate composite stiffened plate composite joint and single mechanical property problem compared with the superstructure of traditional steel structure the integrated sandwich composite superstructure has some comprehensive advantages however the mechanical behavior of the sandwich composite structures is very complicated due to its inherent anisotropy and heterogeneity in addition the composite material itself has some disadvantages such as low elastic modulus insufficient rigidity weak malleability and large deformation the interlaminar tensile strength and interlaminar shear strength of fiber reinforced composites are lower than that of matrix so delamination failure of laminates is easy to occur under interlaminar stress these reasons make the connection structure s load redistribution capacity weak which is easy to cause local damage or overall failure of the structure and most of the damage locations occur in the connection structure this severely restricts the application and development of integrated composite superstructures therefore the main purpose of this article is to investigate the magnitude and distribution of the strain stress and deformation of the main structure under different load cases and to explore the transfer trend of force and deformation at the interface between the steel main hull and integrated sandwich composite superstructure it is hoped that the research results can provide reference and technical support for the design and optimization of the integrated sandwich composite superstructure in order to further improve the research on the mechanical properties of the naval ship with an integrated sandwich composite superstructure 2 similar model and experiment of naval ship the static structure model should satisfy the load and geometry similarity at the same time the outline size and thickness of the model not only have different magnitudes but also have different mechanical effects therefore this model chooses basic physical quantities such as length thickness and force as independent parameters because the main purpose of the test is to study the stress distribution under the combined external force the equivalent beam theory is used in the design of similar model when the equivalent beam theory is satisfied the bending moment is selected as the physical quantity to describe the external force the normal stress is selected as the physical quantity to describe the internal force the elastic modulus and poisson s ratio are selected as the basic physical quantities to describe the characteristics of the structure material the bending moment of inertia and cross sectional area are selected as physical quantities to describe the geometric characteristics of bending except for the same load types and boundary conditions it can be known from the dimensional analysis method of similar theory that the actual ship and the similar model ship should satisfy the following relationship 1 c μ μ s μ m 1 c e e s e m 1 the conversion relationship between the bending stress of the similar model and that of the real ship is as follows 2 c σ c m c l 2 c t 1 3 c σ σ s σ m 1 c m m s m m c l 2 c t c l l s l m 10 c t t s t m 3 4 i s i m c l 3 c t e s e m c l in the above equations μ is the poisson s ratio e is the elastic modulus σ is the normal stress m is the bending moment l is the length t is the thickness i is the moment of inertia of the section and e is the distance from the neutral axis of the cross section to the baseline their footprints s represent real ships and footprints m represent similar models the total length width and rib spacing of the navy ship model are 9750 mm 2000 mm and 50 mm respectively all the structures of the model are symmetrical in the middle longitudinal section the main hull is steel structure and the integrated superstructure is mainly a sandwich composite structure the main hull of the ship model has steel main decks no 01 and no 02 at 950 mm and 1460 mm from the baseline respectively the integrated superstructure is 820 mm high the integrated superstructure is 820 mm high and there are no 03 and no 04 composite decks at 1860 mm and 2280 mm away from the baseline respectively the model has a large opening with a length of 1050 mm and a width of 800 mm between the 235 and 256 ribs of the ship which runs through the steel decks of no 01 and no 02 and the composite deck no 03 besides box type loading ends with a length of 1500 mm are set at the fore and aft of the main hull to ensure that the bending moment within 4 m in the middle of the model is the maximum bending moment the steel main hull structure in the similar model test is shown in fig 4 and the sandwich composite integrated superstructure is shown in fig 5 the interface between the sandwich composite integrated superstructure and the steel main hull is connected by the h type composite and steel joints the external structure of the interface can be seen in fig 6 a and the internal structure of the interface can be seen in fig 6 b the main structures such as composite decks side panels and transverse bulkheads in the integrated superstructure are connected by bolts the assembling process of the no 03 deck transverse bulkhead and side panel structure in the integrated superstructure is shown in fig 7 the assembly process of the structure between no 02 steel deck and no 03 composite deck near the large opening is shown in fig 8 2 1 arrangement of measuring points combining the design specifications of the hull structure the test purpose and the finite element calculation results the measurement points are divided into four categories which are the strain measurement points of the typical cross sections 117 173 210 138 192 the strain measuring point at the interface between the superstructure and the main hull the strain measuring point in the area with large local stress and the displacement measuring point on the top of the superstructure a total of 5 displacement measuring points are set at the mid longitudinal section of the no 04 deck the numbers of displacement meters at measuring points are 08 07 17 19 and 18 which are respectively located at 105 138 173 192 and 210 of rib position the positions of the above measuring points corresponding to the ship model in the test are shown in fig 5 2 1 1 typical cross sections the same longitudinal strain gauges are arranged on the main hull and superstructure at the section positions 117 173 and 210 ribs of the ship model therefore fig 9 only shows the arrangement strain gauges in the 117 transverse section besides the same longitudinal strain gauges are arranged at the section positions 138 and 192 ribs of the superstructure therefore fig 10 only shows the arrangement strain gauges in the 192 transverse section the pink dot in the figure is the location of the strain gauge and the blue dot is the location of another type of strain gauge in the static loading test of the similar naval ship model the local strain gauges on the starboard side of the typical section at the rib positions 173 192 and 210 are shown in fig 11 the strain gauge is sealed and protected by white sealing glue so the white points in the figure are the measuring points of the strain gauge 2 1 2 interface between the integrated superstructure and main hull because the hull structure is symmetrical in the mid longitudinal section the three dimensional strain gauges are mainly arranged on the starboard side of the interface between the integrated superstructure and the main hull on the interface between the integrated superstructure and the main hull three rows of three way strain gauges are mainly arranged the first row is located on the starboard side of the hull 50 mm below the no 02 deck the second row is on the h steel structure 50 mm above the no 02 deck the third row is on the starboard composite plate of the integrated superstructure 100 mm vertically from the second row as shown in fig 12 and fig 13 there are one way and three way strain gauges in the ship s length direction at the measuring points the number of measuring points in the figure is to facilitate the analysis and processing of the collected data by the static strain acquisition system 2 2 constraint and loading in the test based on the four point bending method the static loading test was carried out on a similar naval ship model box type loading ends with a length of 1500 mm are set at the fore and aft of the main hull to ensure that the bending moment of the model within 4 m of the amidship is pure and the maximum bending moment tooling is designed at a distance of 2m close to the amidship to provide constraints to achieve the purpose of simulating longitudinal bending in the experiment the loading and constraint methods of the ship model in the hogging and sagging state are shown in fig 14 and fig 15 respectively in the three dimensional diagram the load is applied in the same way at both ends of the model in the test the hydraulic device is arranged at the box loading end of the 52 and 300 ribs and the whole loading process adopts step loading when the load in the hogging state is applied to the ship model the hydraulic device is arranged on the top of the box type loading end to apply a downward load on the ship through the reaction beam the load application process at one end of the model in the hogging state is shown in fig 16 when the load in the sagging state is applied to the ship model the hydraulic device is arranged on the test platform which directly applies the load to the box type loading end of the ship model the load application process at one end of the model in the sagging state is shown in fig 17 the two restraining devices are located at 134 and 217 rib positions respectively as shown in fig 18 and fig 19 and are used to restrain the ship model when the load in the hogging state is applied to the ship model the two restraining devices in the middle of the ship only play the role of supporting the hull so that the hull model is simply supported on the restraining device when the load in the sagging state is applied to the ship model the two restraining devices in the middle of the ship are welded to the hull so that the hull model is fixed on the restraining device following the similarity criterion the bending moment that the naval ship bears in ultimate and cruise conditions is converted into test loads and applied to the model in the test the bending moment applied by the ship model under different load cases and the load applied at the corresponding loading end are shown in table 1 3 double beam method the main idea of the double beam method is that the superstructure and the main hull are regarded as two separate beams which bear the interaction of horizontal force and vertical force respectively yang 1981 chen 2011 lu 2016 besides the main hull also bears the external bending moment by integrating the assumed vertical force and horizontal shear force along the length direction respectively the total vertical force and total horizontal shear force of the superstructure can be obtained as follows 5 v e r t i c a l f o r c e f a p 0 2 l p 1 c o s π x l d x 6 h o r i z o n t a l s h e a r f o r c e f a q 0 2 l q 1 c o

the superstructure the bending moment generated by the vertical force on the superstructure is shown below 7 m a p p 1 c o s π x l d x d x p 1 l 2 π 2 c o s π x l a x b according to the boundary condition that the calculation point is located at the end of the superstructure the horizontal shear force and bending moment are both 0 the bending moment at any x position caused by vertical force is as follows 8 m a p p 1 l 2 π 2 1 c o s π x l it is assumed that the distance between the centroid of the cross section of the superstructure and the line of intersection between the superstructure and the main hull is y a therefore at any x position of the superstructure the bending moment of horizontal shear force in the cross section is as follows 9 m a q 0 x y a q d x 0 x y a q 1 c o s π x 2

section of the main hull and the line of intersection between the superstructure and the main hull is y s and the bending moment m l caused by the external load at the position x l and the deflection δ 0 caused by the external load at the position x 0 in the same way the bending moment m s l on the main hull at the position x l caused by vertical force and horizontal force and the deflection y s 0 generated by the main hull at x 0 can be obtained 12 m s l m l 2 p 1 l 2 π 2 2 y s l π q 1 q 3 3 13 y s 0 δ 0 1 e s i s p 1 l 4 1 2 π 2 2 π 4 8 y s l 3 π 3 q 1 q 3 27 where the elastic modulus of the selected material for the main hull is e s the moment of inertia of the main hull s cross section to its neutral axis is i s in the middle of the length the total stress of the superstructure s cross

that the curvature of the intersection between the main hull and the superstructure is the same and the intersection is at the position x l the curvature radii of the superstructure and the main hull are as follows 16 1 r a m a l e a i a 1 e a i a 2 p 1 l 2 π 2 2 y a l π q 1 q 3 3 17 1 r s m s l e s i s 1 e s i s m l 2 p 1 l 2 π 2 2 y s l π q 1 q 3 3 according to the boundary conditions in formula

section and the total stress σ s l of main hull s cross section can be obtained by substituting these coefficients into equations 14 and 15 by substituting these coefficients into 8 and 9 the bending moment at any position of the superstructure can be obtained the results calculated by the double beam theory are different from the real values because the method does not consider the influence of the shear hysteresis effect on the longitudinal bending stress also this method has some limitations and only applies to the main hull and superstructure are symmetrical in the midship position and the superstructure needs to have a certain length if we need to improve the calculation accuracy we can further consider using j l taylor approximation theory to check 4 finite element calculation firstly the ship mesh model is established in the finite element software msc patran and then the model file is imported into the finite element software abaqus in which the loads and boundary constraints are applied in the model finally the model is nonlinearly solved by the finite element software abaqus and used as a post processor to analyze the strain stress and deformation of the structure in the model according to the cross section drawings basic structure drawings and general arrangement drawings and other related drawings of similar ship model the finite element software msc patran is used to build the numerical modeling of the whole ship model to fully simulate the loading process of the similar ship model in the test process the box loading end with a length of 1500 mm at both ends of the model is also established in the finite element model and the similar ship model is loaded through the box loading end the main steel hull of the ship model is constructed by beam and shell elements at the time of modeling shell elements will be used to simulate plates such as side plates longitudinal bulkheads transverse bulkheads decks bottom plates girders and floors beam elements will be used to simulate structures such as bones ribs stiffeners and panels on webs chen et al 2018 the total number of elements in the finite element ship similar model is 103 981 of which the number of shell elements of the s4r type is 92 042 the number of shell elements of the s3r type is 779 and the number of beam elements of the b31 type is 11 160 the mesh size of the element is generally 50 mm which is the length of a rib distance the shell element is used to simulate all the structures in the sandwich composite integrated superstructure the modeling method of the common node between the sandwich composite material integrated superstructure and the steel main hull is used to simplify and replace the h shaped bolt connection structure the three dimensional views of the whole ship model and its internal finite element structure are shown in fig 20 and fig 21 4 1 materials in the integrated superstructure all the main components are made of composite sandwich panel which is in the form of gfrp pvc gfrp a simplified view of the composite sandwich panel and the stiffeners attached to the sandwich panel is shown in fig 22 and fig 23 the composite sandwich panel is composed of two upper and lower glass fiber reinforced plastic laminates and a low density pvc foam core material in the middle the pvc foam core is bonded to the laminate by resin compared with the pvc foam core the gfrp has the characteristics of high density high modulus and strong strength gfrp is a glass fiber reinforced plastic which is composed of a bi directionally woven e glass fabric containing approximately equal amounts of fiber in two major directions 0 and 90 directions i e 1 1 fiber cloth epoxy resin which is used as a laminate of the composite sandwich panel the function of the laminates is to withstand in plane forces and bending the pvc foam core is to hold the laminate together and to withstand transverse shear loads it needs to have a certain shear strength and rigidity while ensuring its lightness to be responsible for transmitting the shearing force in the composite superstructure the 04 deck the transverse bulkhead and the side plate are mainly composed of a type sandwich panels and a type stiffeners the 03 deck is mainly composed of b type sandwich panels and a type stiffeners the middle longitudinal girders of the 03 deck and 04 deck are mainly composed of b type stiffeners the laminate is composed of fiber layers in 0 and 90 directions the alternate layering method of 0 90 10 was selected in the finite element model the material properties of the pvc foam core are shown in table 2 and the material properties of the gfrp are shown in tables 3 and 4 the main hull is made of q235 steel and the material parameters are shown in table 5 it can be seen that the elastic modulus and shear modulus of traditional steel are much larger than that of gfrp fiber and the elastic modulus and shear modulus of gfrp fiber are much larger than that of pvc foam core 4 2 constraints and loading the load application and boundary constraints in the finite element numerical analysis are completely determined according to the load and constraint of the ship model in the test and are also divided into two main conditions namely the cruise condition and the ultimate condition in the same way as the model loading test the bending moment is transformed into the corresponding concentrated force and applied to the box type loading end of the ship model the four point bending method is also used to simulate the different loading conditions when the ship is in the cruise hogging condition a downward vertical force of 79t is applied to the independent point of the model s first and last box type loading ends which is coupled with the element nodes in the loading area when the ship is in the cruise sagging condition an upward vertical force of 76t is applied to the independent point of the model s first and last box type loading ends which is coupled with the element nodes in the loading area in the numerical calculation the load application method under ultimate conditions is the same as the load application under cruise conditions but the magnitude of the load is different under ultimate conditions the finite element model bears a downward vertical force of 88t in the hogging state and an upward vertical force of 68 5t in the sagging state to simulate the total longitudinal bending under different load cases the simple support constraint is applied to the constrained area during the numerical calculation of the hogging condition and the fixed support constraint is applied to the constraint area during the numerical calculation of the sagging condition the load application and constraint in the finite element numerical calculation are shown in fig 24 the yellow arrow is the load application area of the hogging condition and the blue arrow is the load application area of the sagging condition the coupling mode of the nodes in the load application area of the box loading end is shown in fig 25 5 comparative analysis of the results the reliability of the finite element numerical calculation method is verified by analyzing the strain stress and displacement of the measuring point of the ship similarity model in the test and comparing it with the results of the finite element numerical calculation through the mutual verification of numerical simulation and experiment the mechanical properties of the main structure of the naval ship model are explored and analyzed especially the mechanical properties of the integrated sandwich composite superstructure this section mainly compares and analyzes the displacement of the measuring points on deck 04 the changes of the strain and stress along with the height on different typical cross sections the changes of the strain and stress at the interface along with the length of the ship and the changes of the strain and stress at other main structures 5 1 comparative analysis of displacements on deck 04 the displacement of no 04 deck of the integrated superstructure under different load cases are obtained by test and numerical calculation as shown in fig 26 and fig 27 table 6 shows the difference of displacement values at the measuring points obtained by the above two methods the position of the displacement measurement point corresponding to the number is shown in fig 5 the results show that the maximum displacement difference of the measuring points is 19 46 and the minimum is 0 17 the average difference of displacement is 6 65 under the cruise hogging condition 12 38 under the cruise sagging condition 6 56 under the ultimate hogging condition and 5 94 under the ultimate sagging condition the difference between them is not only within the allowable error range but also the changing trend of displacement is consistent therefore the reliability of the finite element method is preliminarily verified the middle part of the ship s length direction is located 4900 mm from the tail end because the no 04 deck is asymmetric in the middle of the ship s length direction the farther the measuring point is from the middle the greater the displacement value changes it is found that under the hogging condition with the increase of the distance between the measuring point and the tail end the changing trend of the displacement will increase first and then decrease the displacement of all measuring points moves upward downward it is also found that under the condition of sagging with the increase of the distance from the measuring point to the tail end the changing trend of the displacement will first decrease slowly and then increases rapidly the displacement of all measuring points moves upward when the naval ship s finite element model is in the cruise sagging condition the vertical displacement distribution of the integrated sandwich composite superstructure is shown in fig 28 when the naval ship s finite element model is in the ultimate hogging condition the vertical displacement distribution of the integrated sandwich composite superstructure is shown in fig 29 it can be seen that the deformation distribution of the integrated superstructure under these two conditions is the same as the above conclusions in addition the upward displacement of the head and tail of the integrated superstructure is the largest in the sagging statet the downward displacement of the head and tail of the integrated superstructure is the largest in the hogging state 5 2 comparative analysis of measuring points on the typical section due to the symmetry of the ship model load application and boundary constraint this section only analyzes the starboard side of 117 173 and 210 typical cross sections and explores the variation trend of the longitudinal strain and stress of the measuring point with the height from the bottom of the ship to the top of the integrated superstructure under different load cases the numbers and positions of the measuring points in the above three typical cross sections can be shown in fig 9 the comparative analysis of the data shows that the longitudinal strain and stress of the measuring point obtained through experiments and numerical calculations have a similar change trend with the increase of the height of the measuring point through the following data analysis the validity and reliability of the numerical calculation method can be verified again as shown in fig 30 and fig 31 the results show that the overall average error of the two methods is 15 93 in the cruise hogging condition 19 88 in the cruise sagging condition 17 86 in the ultimate hogging condition and 21 23 in the ultimate sagging condition besides it is found that under the hogging condition with the increase of the distance from the measuring point to the baseline the longitudinal strain and stress of the steel structure measuring point change from negative to positive when it reaches the composite superstructure the strain suddenly increases on the contrary the stress suddenly decreases as the height of the measuring point continues to increase strain and stress begin to decrease under the hogging condition with the increase of the distance from the measuring point to the baseline the longitudinal strain and stress of the steel structure measuring point change from positive to negative when it reaches the composite superstructure the strain suddenly increases in the negative direction on the contrary the stress suddenly decreases as the height of the measuring point continues to increase strain and stress begin to decrease when the naval ship s finite element model is in the cruise sagging condition the longitudinal stress distribution of the 117 cross section is shown in fig 32 when the naval ship s finite element model is in the ultimate hogging condition the longitudinal stress distribution of the 117 cross section is shown in fig 33 it can be seen that the longitudinal stress distribution of the 117 cross section with the height of the hull under these two conditions is the same as the above conclusions also it is found that the height of the neutral axis of the 117 cross section is about 650 mm by analyzing the strain and stress curves in the figure the stress and strain values of the measuring point at this height are zero as shown in fig 34 and fig 35 the results show that the overall average error of the two methods is 15 88 in the cruise hogging condition 21 24 in the cruise sagging condition 16 08 in the ultimate hogging condition and 20 11 in the ultimate sagging condition because section 173 is close to the transverse bulkhead in the middle of the ship under the hogging condition with the increase of the distance from the measuring point to the baseline the longitudinal strain and stress of the measuring point reach the negative maximum value when reaching the side bilge at a height of 350 mm then slowly decrease to 0 and start to increase in the positive direction after reaching the composite superstructure the strain and stress begin to decrease with the increase of height under the sagging condition with the increase of the distance from the measuring point to the baseline the longitudinal strain and stress of the measuring point reaches the positive maximum value when reaching the side bilge at a height of 350 mm and then slowly decrease to 0 and start to increase in the negative direction after reaching the composite superstructure the strain and stress begin to decrease with the increase of height when the naval ship s finite element model is in the cruise sagging condition the longitudinal stress distribution of the 173 cross section is shown in fig 36 when the naval ship s finite element model is in the ultimate hogging condition the longitudinal stress distribution of the 173 cross section is shown in fig 37 it can be seen that the longitudinal stress distribution of the 173 cross section with the height of the hull under these two conditions is the same as the above conclusions besides it is found that the height of the neutral axis of the 173 cross section is about 900 mm by analyzing the strain and stress curves in the figure the stress and strain values of the measuring point at this height are zero as shown in fig 38 and fig 39 the results show that the overall average error of the two methods is 15 03 in the cruise hogging condition 15 51 in the cruise sagging condition 18 10 in the ultimate hogging condition and 12 67 in the ultimate sagging condition because the bottom of the cross section of the 210 frame is close to the restraint area the strain and stress at the bottom of the ship are very large under the hogging condition with the increase of the distance from the measuring point to the baseline the longitudinal strain and stress of the measuring point change rapidly from negative to positive within the height of 0 400 mm and then increase with the increase of height when reaching the height of 1900 mm the strain reaches the maximum value in the positive direction and then begins to decrease with the increase of height after reaching the top the strain is close to zero after reaching the superstructure the stress dropped suddenly and then with the increase of height the stress slowly decreases to close to zero under the sagging condition with the increase of the distance from the measuring point to the baseline the longitudinal strain and stress of the measuring point change rapidly from positive to negative within the height of 0 400 mm and then increase in the negative direction with the increase of height when reaching the height of 1900 mm the strain reaches the negative maximum and then begins to decrease with the increase of height after reaching the top the strain is close to zero after reaching the superstructure the stress dropped suddenly and then with the increase of height the stress slowly decreases to close to zero also it is found that the height of the neutral axis of the 210 cross section is about 300 mm by analyzing the strain and stress curves in the figure the stress and strain values of the measuring point at this height are zero besides by analyzing the stress and strain curves of figss 30 39 the results show that the strain and stress curve of the measuring points under the hogging condition takes the horizontal axis where the strain and stress are zero as the symmetry axis and is symmetrical to the strain and stress curve under the sagging condition however due to the difference in the magnitude of the applied load under the different load cases there is a slight difference in the symmetry of the curve 5 3 comparative analysis of measuring points at the interface this section mainly analyzes the longitudinal strain and stress of the measuring points obtained by the two methods of test and numerical calculation under different load conditions the measurement points are distributed on the interface between the main hull and the sandwich composite superstructure the position of the measuring points at the interface in the test model can be shown in fig 5 the position and number of measuring points in cad drawings can refer to figs 12 and 13 by comparing and analyzing fig 40 43 it can be found that the longitudinal strain and stress of the measuring point obtained through experiment and finite element numerical calculation have the same changing trend along the length of the ship the horizontal coordinate in the figure is the longitudinal distance from the measuring point to the midship the longitudinal distance from the measuring point in the stern direction to the midship is set as positive and the longitudinal distance from the measuring point in the bow direction to the midship is set as negative the vertical coordinate on the left is the strain of the measuring point and the vertical coordinate on the right is the stress of the measuring point the results show that the average errors of the longitudinal strain and stress of the measuring points on the main hull obtained by the two methods are as follows it is 14 81 in the cruise hogging condition 14 17 in the cruise sagging condition 17 10 in the ultimate hogging condition and 12 44 in the ultimate sagging condition the results show that the average errors of the longitudinal strain and stress of the measuring points on the composite superstructure obtained by the two methods are as follows it is 16 06 in the cruise hogging condition 19 83 in the cruise sagging condition 16 86 in the ultimate hogging condition and 21 76 in the ultimate sagging condition it is verified again about the validity and reliability of the numerical calculation method the results show that the longitudinal strain at the interface between the main hull and the superstructure has the same changing trend under different load conditions except for the opening and the corner area within the bow area between 2500 mm and 3500 mm from the midship because the measuring point is in the corner area of the composite superstructure which causes the strain and stress of the main hull at the interface to have complex changes the strain and stress in this area change from a positive to a negative direction and then to a positive direction under cruising and ultimate hogging conditions however the changing trend of stress and strain is opposite under cruising and ultimate sagging conditions within the stern area between 3000 mm and 4200 mm from the midship the measuring point is located in the large opening area which runs through deck 01 to deck 03 the results show that the strain and stress of the superstructure at the interface are reduced under different load cases when it exceeds the large opening range the strain and stress of the measuring point begin to increase with the increase of the longitudinal distance besides the results show that the strain and stress of the main hull at the interface are reduced under the hogging conditions when it exceeds the large opening range the strain and stress of the measuring point begin to increase with the increase of the longitudinal distance under cruising and ultimate sagging conditions the changing trend of the stress and strain of the main hull in this area is opposite to that of the hogging conditions it can be seen that the force transfer of the interface at the corner area of the composite superstructure and the large opening area of the deck is relatively complex which leads to great changes in the strain and stress and makes the curve change sharply without obvious regularity in the parallel mid body region of the ship model the interface between the superstructure and main hull conforms to the deformation characteristics of the equivalent beam and strain has the same trend the stress of the interface on the superstructure changes within 15mpa in the positive and negative directions which is far less than the stress of the interface on the main hull 5 4 comparative analysis of measuring points on other structures in addition to the comparative analysis of the strain and stress of the measuring points on the above main structures this section also compares and analyzes the measuring points on the starboard side of the 192 cross section in the sandwich composite integrated superstructure the number and location of the measuring points on the starboard side of the 192 cross section are shown in fig 10 this section also analyzes the strain of the measuring point on the no 03 deck which are near the starboard side the measuring point of no 03 deck near the starboard side is numbered as 100 at 117 rib as shown in fig 9 by comparing and analyzing fig 44 and fig 45 it is found that with the increase of the height of the measuring point the longitudinal strain and stress of the measuring point on the starboard of section 192 obtained by numerical calculation method are consistent with the test results the results show that the overall average error of the two methods is 9 52 in the cruise hogging condition 12 40 in the cruise sagging condition 11 31 in the ultimate hogging condition and 12 68 in the ultimate sagging condition under cruising and ultimate hogging conditions the strain and stress of the measuring point on the 192 cross section of the integrated composite superstructure begin to increase with the increase of the height of the measuring point after reaching the position of 1860 mm the strain and stress begin to decrease slowly with the increase of height as shown in figs 44 and 45 because the 192 cross section is close to the transverse bulkhead of the 189 rib position and there is no 03 deck at the height of 1860 mm the strain and stress of the measuring point change little with the increase of the height by comparing and analyzing fig 46 and fig 47 it is found that the longitudinal strain and stress of the measuring points on the no 03 deck obtained by numerical calculation methods under different load conditions are consistent with the experimental results the measuring points are located at the rib positions of 117 138 173 192 and 210 near the starboard side area of deck 03 the meaning of the coordinate axis in the figure is the same as that in section 5 3 of the article the results show that the overall average error of the two methods is 8 34 in the cruise hogging condition 6 92 in the cruise sagging condition 8 06 in the ultimate hogging condition and 7 18 in the ultimate sagging condition besides due to the large opening in the stern the structural strength of the area is weakened which makes the longitudinal strain and stress of the measuring point at the no 03 deck increase slowly with the increase of the distance from the measuring point to the bow when the naval ship s finite element model is in the cruise sagging condition the longitudinal stress distribution of the no 03 deck is shown in fig 48 when the naval ship s finite element model is in the ultimate hogging condition the longitudinal stress distribution of the no 03 deck is shown in fig 49 the positions of the measuring points at different rib positions in figs 46 and 47 on deck 03 can also refer to figs 48 and 49 it can be seen that the longitudinal stress distribution of the no 03 deck under these two conditions is the same as the above conclusions in addition it is also found that the high stress position where the stress concentration easily occurs is at the corner of the deck large opening at the rib positions of 235 by analyzing the stress and strain curves of figs 44 47 the strain and stress curve of measuring points under the hogging condition takes the horizontal axis where the strain and stress are zero as the symmetry axis and is symmetrical to the strain and stress curve under the sagging condition however due to the difference in the magnitude of the applied load under the different load cases there is a slight difference in the symmetry of the curve 5 5 comparative analysis of test and fem calculation through the analysis of the two methods of exploring the mechanical properties of the naval ship similar model with an integrated sandwich composite superstructure the advantages and disadvantages of the test method and the finite element numerical calculation method can be found the disadvantages of the test method are mainly that it requires a large number of personnel costs a large amount of money and takes more time for example it takes some personnel to spend a lot of time to calculate the real naval ship based on the similarity theory so as to obtain the drawings of the similar model with reduced principal dimensions of the real ship then again it takes some personnel to spend a lot of time and money to build similar model of the naval ship based on similar model drawings when a similar model of the ship is built some personnel and time are needed again to make test preparations apply the load and collect the data according to the purpose of the test finally it will take some time to process and analyze the test data in addition because the model test cannot fully simulate the load cases that the naval ship bears in real sailing this test method can only qualitatively analyze the mechanical performance of the naval vessel under different sailing conditions the main advantage of the test method is that the obtained test data is more accurate which can more accurately reflect the mechanical properties of the naval ship similar model with an integrated sandwich composite superstructure under different load cases since the similar model is obtained based on the similar criterion and the applied load is also obtained through this criterion the strain and stress of the measuring points obtained in the test represent the results of the real naval vessel under different sailing conditions the displacement of the measuring point obtained by the test multiplied by the scale is the realistic displacement of the naval vessel the advantages of the finite element numerical calculation method are mainly that it costs less personnel and time than the test method especially less money this method can also analyze the mechanical properties of ship model under different kinds of loads or more complex load cases it can simulate load cases that cannot be applied to the naval ship model in the test method in addition this method can also view the stress strain and displacement of the structure at any position in the model the disadvantage of finite element numerical method is that it is unable to determine the accuracy of the calculation results because there are many factors that affect the results of numerical calculations such as the way of boundary constraint the type of applied load the division of the mesh the selection of material parameters and the selection of iterative algorithmr this article uses these two methods at the same time to explore the mechanical properties of the naval ship similar model with an integrated sandwich composite superstructure only by combining the advantages of the two methods at the same time we can obtain the mechanical properties of the naval ship more accurately and comprehensively firstly some basic and accurate experimental data are obtained by the experimental method which is mutually verified with the finite element calculation method after that the verified finite element method is used to further obtain the relevant data of any structure of the ship model so as to more comprehensively analyze the mechanical properties of the ship model the data and rules about the mechanical properties of ships explored by the two methods can provide meaningful reference value for the construction and design of ships 6 conclusions the research object of the article is a similar model of a naval ship with an integrated sandwich composite superstructure based on the theoretical guidance of the double beam method through the static loading test of the four point bending method the article analyzes the strain and stress of the measuring points on the main structure of the naval ship model under different load cases and the deformation of the top deck of the superstructure combining with the results of finite element numerical calculation the mechanical properties of the naval ship model with sandwich composite superstructure under different load cases are explored by mutual verification with the test the results show that all measuring points at five different positions on the top deck of the superstructure have a downward displacement under the hogging condition and have an upward displacement under the sagging condition besides the vertical displacement of the measuring point farthest from the stern is the largest and that near the midship is the smallest the article explores the changes of longitudinal strain and stress of the measuring points with height on three typical cross sections under different load cases it can be found that the overall trend of the strain and stress curves varying with the height of three similar cross sections is consistent however due to the different positions of the cross sections and the different structures near the cross sections there are some differences in the strain and stress curves of the three typical cross sections the height of the neutral axis where the stress and strain are zero is also different in the three sections the strain and stress curve of all measuring points under the hogging condition takes the horizontal axis where the strain and stress are zero as the symmetry axis and is symmetrical to the strain and stress curve under the sagging condition except for the strain and stress of measuring points of the large opening and corner area at the interface between the main hull and the superstructure however due to the difference in the magnitude of the applied load under the different load cases there is a slight difference in the symmetry of the curve besides the article explores the changes of longitudinal stress and strain of the measuring point on the interface with the direction of the ship s length in the parallel mid body region of the ship model the interface between the superstructure and main hull conforms to the deformation characteristics of the equivalent beam and the strain has the same trend the stress of the interface on the superstructure is far less than the stress of the interface on the main hull the force transfer of the interface at the corner area of the composite superstructure and the large opening area of the deck is relatively complex which leads to great changes in the strain and stress and makes the curve change sharply without obvious regularity after that the article analyzes the changes in longitudinal strain and stress of the measuring point at 192 cross section with height under different load cases and the changes in longitudinal strain and stress of the measuring point on deck with the length of the ship in addition it also analyzes the areas of the no 03 deck which are prone to stress concentration finally this article discusses the advantages and disadvantages of experimental methods and finite

20700,the research object of the article is a similar model of a naval ship with an integrated sandwich composite superstructure the similarity model of this naval ship is based on the similarity theory which is obtained by scaling down the actual naval ship based on the theoretical guidance of the double beam method by using the static loading test of the four point bending method the article analyzes the magnitude and trend of the strain stress and deformation of the measuring points on the naval ship model under different load cases the main measuring points of the similar naval ship model are located in the typical cross sections each deck and the interface between the steel main hull and the integrated sandwich composite superstructure the article mainly explores the changes of longitudinal strain and stress of the measuring points with height on three typical cross sections and the changes of longitudinal strain and stress with the ship s length on the interface and the deformation of the top deck of the superstructure combining with the results of finite element numerical simulation the complicated mechanical properties of the naval ship model with an integrated sandwich composite superstructure are explored by mutual verification with the experiments some valuable conclusions are obtained for the construction and design of the naval ship with an integrated sandwich composite superstructure keywords naval ship model sandwich composite integrated superstructure mechanical properties interface 1 introduction the integrated superstructure of the naval ship starts from the shape which greatly reduces the stealth performance of the naval ship during surface combat the use of composite sandwich structure is to start from the material to effectively improve the stealth performance of the naval ship during surface combat the traditional steel structure has high stiffness and small deformation when the longitudinal deformation of the hull occurs the superstructure is the farthest away from the neutral axis of the hull equivalent beam so the structural stress value in the superstructure will be very large which is ultimately easy to lead to structural damage therefore the main deck of the superstructure needs to be designed as a strong deck but this will increase the weight of the superstructure causing the ship s center of gravity to increase and its stability to decrease some studies have compared the cost weight and structural performance of large patrol boats made of steel aluminum or sandwich composite materials smith and monks 1982 nguyen et al 1997 goubalt and mayes 1996 if the composite material is used to replace the traditional steel material in the integrated superstructure it can not only reduce the weight and center of gravity of the hull structure but also improve the stealth stability and speed of the naval ship thus reducing the fuel consumption and emissions and increasing the payload of the naval ship therefore the use of composite structure in the integrated superstructure of naval ships is the inevitable development direction to improve the stealth performance and combat comprehensive performance of naval ships in the future from the mid 1940s to the mid 1960s the use of composite materials in other types of u s navy ships expanded rapidly and many articles described the early application of composite materials in u s navy ships mäkinen et al 1998 mckenzie and stark 1953 fried and graner 1966 graner 1969 heller 1970 by the 1970s the royal navy of england the netherlands navy the royal swedish navy and the norwegian navy began to build composite mine hunting boats and landing boats mouritz et al 2001 beale 1971 for example the corton el class frigate fig 1 in the netherlands marked the formal application of composite materials in the global naval ship in 1973 britain and the united states jointly developed the hms wilton the first gfrp anti mine ship in the world with a total length of 46 6 m and a displacement of 450t summerscales and smith 1990 in 1992 france tested the lafayette frigate whose superstructure was designed with composite sandwich panels fig 2 in 2016 the latest zumwalt ddg 1000 destroyer fig 3 was officially delivered to the u s navy with a total length of 183m a draft of 8 4m and a displacement of 14500t its superstructure is made of composite materials and the structure above the main deck is hidden inside the superstructure tang et al 2006 doerry et al 2015 kwon et al 2016 in the early stage it was mainly based on the empirical method and test method to ensure that the composite material has sufficient strength when applied on the ship horsmon 1994 grabovac grabovac et al 1993 outlined a bonded composite reinforcement being developed for use in the superstructure of the ffg 7 frigate of the royal australian navy in the 1970s the main classification societies such as abs rules for building 1978 bv hull 2012 dnv hull 2013 lr lr 2015 etc successively issued the classification specifications for composite ships but the regulations for the design of composite superstructure are not specific and complete wright et al 2000 analyzed the structural performance of the steel composite bonding joint in the connection between the frp transverse bulkhead and the steel structure in the ship and gave the numerical prediction and experimental results of the joint structural strength subsequently cao et al cao and grenestedt 2003 2004 designed two kinds of connection joints between the navy grp superstructure and the steel hull again karatzas et al 2015 proposed that it is feasible to adopt a composite structural design for the superstructure of large passenger ships by comparing existing structural designs under different loading conditions morshedsoluk et al morshedsoluk and khedmati 2016 calculated the ultimate strength of composite ship considering the influence of superstructure by using the expansion formula of

connection structure consisting of composite sandwich plates reinforced cores and adhesive for the construction of lightweight ships to resolve connection problems between bulkheads and decks of composite lightweight ship superstructures kharghani kharghani et al 2019 tested the strength and stiffness of composite to steel joint under bending and torsion loads and to calibrate numerical models with respect to the experimental measurements andric andric et al 2019 evaluated the longitudinal and racking strengths of the composite sandwich deck panels using the complete fem model of ro

natural frequency of composite superstructure under different boundary conditions and different models yu yu et al 2017 combined with parametric modeling to calculate the optimal solutions for six design variables of the composite superstructure and analyzed the influence of each design variable on the constraints and objective function using the scanning method li et al 2018 put forward the concept of composite material t shaped and y shaped connection combined with a plate frame to realize integrated composite superstructure and studied its mechanical properties under combined wave loads liu 2018 proposed the connection scheme between the composite superstructure and the steel main hull by combining the structural and mechanical characteristics of the composite superstructure and considering the applicable scope advantages and disadvantages of various connecting structures based on the building block method li 2018 analyzed the mechanical properties of sandwich panels connection joints and typical cabins in the composite superstructure and carried out experimental verification on typical models chen chen et al 2021 studied the progressive failure and ultimate strength prediction of sandwich composite hat stringer stiffened panels in the ship subjected to the transverse in plane loads although a large number of basic experiments and researches have been done on the basic mechanical properties of sandwich composite structures the research on the mechanical properties of the ship with sandwich composite integrated superstructures is still limited and incomplete and the depth of research needs to be improved the research objectives are also mostly related to the local structures or components of the composite superstructure of the ship such as typical joint composite sandwich plate composite stiffened plate composite joint and single mechanical property problem compared with the superstructure of traditional steel structure the integrated sandwich composite superstructure has some comprehensive advantages however the mechanical behavior of the sandwich composite structures is very complicated due to its inherent anisotropy and heterogeneity in addition the composite material itself has some disadvantages such as low elastic modulus insufficient rigidity weak malleability and large deformation the interlaminar tensile strength and interlaminar shear strength of fiber reinforced composites are lower than that of matrix so delamination failure of laminates is easy to occur under interlaminar stress these reasons make the connection structure s load redistribution capacity weak which is easy to cause local damage or overall failure of the structure and most of the damage locations occur in the connection structure this severely restricts the application and development of integrated composite superstructures therefore the main purpose of this article is to investigate the magnitude and distribution of the strain stress and deformation of the main structure under different load cases and to explore the transfer trend of force and deformation at the interface between the steel main hull and integrated sandwich composite superstructure it is hoped that the research results can provide reference and technical support for the design and optimization of the integrated sandwich composite superstructure in order to further improve the research on the mechanical properties of the naval ship with an integrated sandwich composite superstructure 2 similar model and experiment of naval ship the static structure model should satisfy the load and geometry similarity at the same time the outline size and thickness of the model not only have different magnitudes but also have different mechanical effects therefore this model chooses basic physical quantities such as length thickness and force as independent parameters because the main purpose of the test is to study the stress distribution under the combined external force the equivalent beam theory is used in the design of similar model when the equivalent beam theory is satisfied the bending moment is selected as the physical quantity to describe the external force the normal stress is selected as the physical quantity to describe the internal force the elastic modulus and poisson s ratio are selected as the basic physical quantities to describe the characteristics of the structure material the bending moment of inertia and cross sectional area are selected as physical quantities to describe the geometric characteristics of bending except for the same load types and boundary conditions it can be known from the dimensional analysis method of similar theory that the actual ship and the similar model ship should satisfy the following relationship 1 c μ μ s μ m 1 c e e s e m 1 the conversion relationship between the bending stress of the similar model and that of the real ship is as follows 2 c σ c m c l 2 c t 1 3 c σ σ s σ m 1 c m m s m m c l 2 c t c l l s l m 10 c t t s t m 3 4 i s i m c l 3 c t e s e m c l in the above equations μ is the poisson s ratio e is the elastic modulus σ is the normal stress m is the bending moment l is the length t is the thickness i is the moment of inertia of the section and e is the distance from the neutral axis of the cross section to the baseline their footprints s represent real ships and footprints m represent similar models the total length width and rib spacing of the navy ship model are 9750 mm 2000 mm and 50 mm respectively all the structures of the model are symmetrical in the middle longitudinal section the main hull is steel structure and the integrated superstructure is mainly a sandwich composite structure the main hull of the ship model has steel main decks no 01 and no 02 at 950 mm and 1460 mm from the baseline respectively the integrated superstructure is 820 mm high the integrated superstructure is 820 mm high and there are no 03 and no 04 composite decks at 1860 mm and 2280 mm away from the baseline respectively the model has a large opening with a length of 1050 mm and a width of 800 mm between the 235 and 256 ribs of the ship which runs through the steel decks of no 01 and no 02 and the composite deck no 03 besides box type loading ends with a length of 1500 mm are set at the fore and aft of the main hull to ensure that the bending moment within 4 m in the middle of the model is the maximum bending moment the steel main hull structure in the similar model test is shown in fig 4 and the sandwich composite integrated superstructure is shown in fig 5 the interface between the sandwich composite integrated superstructure and the steel main hull is connected by the h type composite and steel joints the external structure of the interface can be seen in fig 6 a and the internal structure of the interface can be seen in fig 6 b the main structures such as composite decks side panels and transverse bulkheads in the integrated superstructure are connected by bolts the assembling process of the no 03 deck transverse bulkhead and side panel structure in the integrated superstructure is shown in fig 7 the assembly process of the structure between no 02 steel deck and no 03 composite deck near the large opening is shown in fig 8 2 1 arrangement of measuring points combining the design specifications of the hull structure the test purpose and the finite element calculation results the measurement points are divided into four categories which are the strain measurement points of the typical cross sections 117 173 210 138 192 the strain measuring point at the interface between the superstructure and the main hull the strain measuring point in the area with large local stress and the displacement measuring point on the top of the superstructure a total of 5 displacement measuring points are set at the mid longitudinal section of the no 04 deck the numbers of displacement meters at measuring points are 08 07 17 19 and 18 which are respectively located at 105 138 173 192 and 210 of rib position the positions of the above measuring points corresponding to the ship model in the test are shown in fig 5 2 1 1 typical cross sections the same longitudinal strain gauges are arranged on the main hull and superstructure at the section positions 117 173 and 210 ribs of the ship model therefore fig 9 only shows the arrangement strain gauges in the 117 transverse section besides the same longitudinal strain gauges are arranged at the section positions 138 and 192 ribs of the superstructure therefore fig 10 only shows the arrangement strain gauges in the 192 transverse section the pink dot in the figure is the location of the strain gauge and the blue dot is the location of another type of strain gauge in the static loading test of the similar naval ship model the local strain gauges on the starboard side of the typical section at the rib positions 173 192 and 210 are shown in fig 11 the strain gauge is sealed and protected by white sealing glue so the white points in the figure are the measuring points of the strain gauge 2 1 2 interface between the integrated superstructure and main hull because the hull structure is symmetrical in the mid longitudinal section the three dimensional strain gauges are mainly arranged on the starboard side of the interface between the integrated superstructure and the main hull on the interface between the integrated superstructure and the main hull three rows of three way strain gauges are mainly arranged the first row is located on the starboard side of the hull 50 mm below the no 02 deck the second row is on the h steel structure 50 mm above the no 02 deck the third row is on the starboard composite plate of the integrated superstructure 100 mm vertically from the second row as shown in fig 12 and fig 13 there are one way and three way strain gauges in the ship s length direction at the measuring points the number of measuring points in the figure is to facilitate the analysis and processing of the collected data by the static strain acquisition system 2 2 constraint and loading in the test based on the four point bending method the static loading test was carried out on a similar naval ship model box type loading ends with a length of 1500 mm are set at the fore and aft of the main hull to ensure that the bending moment of the model within 4 m of the amidship is pure and the maximum bending moment tooling is designed at a distance of 2m close to the amidship to provide constraints to achieve the purpose of simulating longitudinal bending in the experiment the loading and constraint methods of the ship model in the hogging and sagging state are shown in fig 14 and fig 15 respectively in the three dimensional diagram the load is applied in the same way at both ends of the model in the test the hydraulic device is arranged at the box loading end of the 52 and 300 ribs and the whole loading process adopts step loading when the load in the hogging state is applied to the ship model the hydraulic device is arranged on the top of the box type loading end to apply a downward load on the ship through the reaction beam the load application process at one end of the model in the hogging state is shown in fig 16 when the load in the sagging state is applied to the ship model the hydraulic device is arranged on the test platform which directly applies the load to the box type loading end of the ship model the load application process at one end of the model in the sagging state is shown in fig 17 the two restraining devices are located at 134 and 217 rib positions respectively as shown in fig 18 and fig 19 and are used to restrain the ship model when the load in the hogging state is applied to the ship model the two restraining devices in the middle of the ship only play the role of supporting the hull so that the hull model is simply supported on the restraining device when the load in the sagging state is applied to the ship model the two restraining devices in the middle of the ship are welded to the hull so that the hull model is fixed on the restraining device following the similarity criterion the bending moment that the naval ship bears in ultimate and cruise conditions is converted into test loads and applied to the model in the test the bending moment applied by the ship model under different load cases and the load applied at the corresponding loading end are shown in table 1 3 double beam method the main idea of the double beam method is that the superstructure and the main hull are regarded as two separate beams which bear the interaction of horizontal force and vertical force respectively yang 1981 chen 2011 lu 2016 besides the main hull also bears the external bending moment by integrating the assumed vertical force and horizontal shear force along the length direction respectively the total vertical force and total horizontal shear force of the superstructure can be obtained as follows 5 v e r t i c a l f o r c e f a p 0 2 l p 1 c o s π x l d x 6 h o r i z o n t a l s h e a r f o r c e f a q 0 2 l q 1 c o

is as follows 8 m a p p 1 l 2 π 2 1 c o s π x l it is assumed that the distance between the centroid of the cross section of the superstructure and the line of intersection between the superstructure

section and the total stress σ s l of main hull s cross section can be obtained by substituting these coefficients into equations 14 and 15 by substituting these coefficients into 8 and 9 the bending moment at any position of the superstructure can be obtained the results calculated by the double beam theory are different from the real values because the method does not consider the influence of the shear hysteresis effect on the longitudinal bending stress also this method has some limitations and only applies to the main hull and superstructure are symmetrical in the midship position and the superstructure needs to have a certain length if we need to improve the calculation accuracy we can further consider using j l taylor approximation theory to check 4 finite element calculation firstly the ship mesh model is established in the finite element software msc patran and then the model file is imported into the finite element software abaqus in which the loads and boundary constraints are applied in the model finally the model is nonlinearly solved by the finite element software abaqus and used as a post processor to analyze the strain stress and deformation of the structure in the model according to the cross section drawings basic structure drawings and general arrangement drawings and other related drawings of similar ship model the finite element software msc patran is used to build the numerical modeling of the whole ship model to fully simulate the loading process of the similar ship model in the test process the box loading end with a length of 1500 mm at both ends of the model is also established in the finite element model and the similar ship model is loaded through the box loading end the main steel hull of the ship model is constructed by beam and shell elements at the time of modeling shell elements will be used to simulate plates such as side plates longitudinal bulkheads transverse bulkheads decks bottom plates girders and floors beam elements will be used to simulate structures such as bones ribs stiffeners and panels on webs chen et al 2018 the total number of elements in the finite element ship similar model is 103 981 of which the number of shell elements of the s4r type is 92 042 the number of shell elements of the s3r type is 779 and the number of beam elements of the b31 type is 11 160 the mesh size of the element is generally 50 mm which is the length of a rib distance the shell element is used to simulate all the structures in the sandwich composite integrated superstructure the modeling method of the common node between the sandwich composite material integrated superstructure and the steel main hull is used to simplify and replace the h shaped bolt connection structure the three dimensional views of the whole ship model and its internal finite element structure are shown in fig 20 and fig 21 4 1 materials in the integrated superstructure all the main components are made of composite sandwich panel which is in the form of gfrp pvc gfrp a simplified view of the composite sandwich panel and the stiffeners attached to the sandwich panel is shown in fig 22 and fig 23 the composite sandwich panel is composed of two upper and lower glass fiber reinforced plastic laminates and a low density pvc foam core material in the middle the pvc foam core is bonded to the laminate by resin compared with the pvc foam core the gfrp has the characteristics of high density high modulus and strong strength gfrp is a glass fiber reinforced plastic which is composed of a bi directionally woven e glass fabric containing approximately equal amounts of fiber in two major directions 0 and 90 directions i e 1 1 fiber cloth epoxy resin which is used as a laminate of the composite sandwich panel the function of the laminates is to withstand in plane forces and bending the pvc foam core is to hold the laminate together and to withstand transverse shear loads it needs to have a certain shear strength and rigidity while ensuring its lightness to be responsible for transmitting the shearing force in the composite superstructure the 04 deck the transverse bulkhead and the side plate are mainly composed of a type sandwich panels and a type stiffeners the 03 deck is mainly composed of b type sandwich panels and a type stiffeners the middle longitudinal girders of the 03 deck and 04 deck are mainly composed of b type stiffeners the laminate is composed of fiber layers in 0 and 90 directions the alternate layering method of 0 90 10 was selected in the finite element model the material properties of the pvc foam core are shown in table 2 and the material properties of the gfrp are shown in tables 3 and 4 the main hull is made of q235 steel and the material parameters are shown in table 5 it can be seen that the elastic modulus and shear modulus of traditional steel are much larger than that of gfrp fiber and the elastic modulus and shear modulus of gfrp fiber are much larger than that of pvc foam core 4 2 constraints and loading the load application and boundary constraints in the finite element numerical analysis are completely determined according to the load and constraint of the ship model in the test and are also divided into two main conditions namely the cruise condition and the ultimate condition in the same way as the model loading test the bending moment is transformed into the corresponding concentrated force and applied to the box type loading end of the ship model the four point bending method is also used to simulate the different loading conditions when the ship is in the cruise hogging condition a downward vertical force of 79t is applied to the independent point of the model s first and last box type loading ends which is coupled with the element nodes in the loading area when the ship is in the cruise sagging condition an upward vertical force of 76t is applied to the independent point of the model s first and last box type loading ends which is coupled with the element nodes in the loading area in the numerical calculation the load application method under ultimate conditions is the same as the load application under cruise conditions but the magnitude of the load is different under ultimate conditions the finite element model bears a downward vertical force of 88t in the hogging state and an upward vertical force of 68 5t in the sagging state to simulate the total longitudinal bending under different load cases the simple support constraint is applied to the constrained area during the numerical calculation of the hogging condition and the fixed support constraint is applied to the constraint area during the numerical calculation of the sagging condition the load application and constraint in the finite element numerical calculation are shown in fig 24 the yellow arrow is the load application area of the hogging condition and the blue arrow is the load application area of the sagging condition the coupling mode of the nodes in the load application area of the box loading end is shown in fig 25 5 comparative analysis of the results the reliability of the finite element numerical calculation method is verified by analyzing the strain stress and displacement of the measuring point of the ship similarity model in the test and comparing it with the results of the finite element numerical calculation through the mutual verification of numerical simulation and experiment the mechanical properties of the main structure of the naval ship model are explored and analyzed especially the mechanical properties of the integrated sandwich composite superstructure this section mainly compares and analyzes the displacement of the measuring points on deck 04 the changes of the strain and stress along with the height on different typical cross sections the changes of the strain and stress at the interface along with the length of the ship and the changes of the strain and stress at other main structures 5 1 comparative analysis of displacements on deck 04 the displacement of no 04 deck of the integrated superstructure under different load cases are obtained by test and numerical calculation as shown in fig 26 and fig 27 table 6 shows the difference of displacement values at the measuring points obtained by the above two methods the position of the displacement measurement point corresponding to the number is shown in fig 5 the results show that the maximum displacement difference of the measuring points is 19 46 and the minimum is 0 17 the average difference of displacement is 6 65 under the cruise hogging condition 12 38 under the cruise sagging condition 6 56 under the ultimate hogging condition and 5 94 under the ultimate sagging condition the difference between them is not only within the allowable error range but also the changing trend of displacement is consistent therefore the reliability of the finite element method is preliminarily verified the middle part of the ship s length direction is located 4900 mm from the tail end because the no 04 deck is asymmetric in the middle of the ship s length direction the farther the measuring point is from the middle the greater the displacement value changes it is found that under the hogging condition with the increase of the distance between the measuring point and the tail end the changing trend of the displacement will increase first and then decrease the displacement of all measuring points moves upward downward it is also found that under the condition of sagging with the increase of the distance from the measuring point to the tail end the changing trend of the displacement will first decrease slowly and then increases rapidly the displacement of all measuring points moves upward when the naval ship s finite element model is in the cruise sagging condition the vertical displacement distribution of the integrated sandwich composite superstructure is shown in fig 28 when the naval ship s finite element model is in the ultimate hogging condition the vertical displacement distribution of the integrated sandwich composite superstructure is shown in fig 29 it can be seen that the deformation distribution of the integrated superstructure under these two conditions is the same as the above conclusions in addition the upward displacement of the head and tail of the integrated superstructure is the largest in the sagging statet the downward displacement of the head and tail of the integrated superstructure is the largest in the hogging state 5 2 comparative analysis of measuring points on the typical section due to the symmetry of the ship model load application and boundary constraint this section only analyzes the starboard side of 117 173 and 210 typical cross sections and explores the variation trend of the longitudinal strain and stress of the measuring point with the height from the bottom of the ship to the top of the integrated superstructure under different load cases the numbers and positions of the measuring points in the above three typical cross sections can be shown in fig 9 the comparative analysis of the data shows that the longitudinal strain and stress of the measuring point obtained through experiments and numerical calculations have a similar change trend with the increase of the height of the measuring point through the following data analysis the validity and reliability of the numerical calculation method can be verified again as shown in fig 30 and fig 31 the results show that the overall average error of the two methods is 15 93 in the cruise hogging condition 19 88 in the cruise sagging condition 17 86 in the ultimate hogging condition and 21 23 in the ultimate sagging condition besides it is found that under the hogging condition with the increase of the distance from the measuring point to the baseline the longitudinal strain and stress of the steel structure measuring point change from negative to positive when it reaches the composite superstructure the strain suddenly increases on the contrary the stress suddenly decreases as the height of the measuring point continues to increase strain and stress begin to decrease under the hogging condition with the increase of the distance from the measuring point to the baseline the longitudinal strain and stress of the steel structure measuring point change from positive to negative when it reaches the composite superstructure the strain suddenly increases in the negative direction on the contrary the stress suddenly decreases as the height of the measuring point continues to increase strain and stress begin to decrease when the naval ship s finite element model is in the cruise sagging condition the longitudinal stress distribution of the 117 cross section is shown in fig 32 when the naval ship s finite element model is in the ultimate hogging condition the longitudinal stress distribution of the 117 cross section is shown in fig 33 it can be seen that the longitudinal stress distribution of the 117 cross section with the height of the hull under these two conditions is the same as the above conclusions also it is found that the height of the neutral axis of the 117 cross section is about 650 mm by analyzing the strain and stress curves in the figure the stress and strain values of the measuring point at this height are zero as shown in fig 34 and fig 35 the results show that the overall average error of the two methods is 15 88 in the cruise hogging condition 21 24 in the cruise sagging condition 16 08 in the ultimate hogging condition and 20 11 in the ultimate sagging condition because section 173 is close to the transverse bulkhead in the middle of the ship under the hogging condition with the increase of the distance from the measuring point to the baseline the longitudinal strain and stress of the measuring point reach the negative maximum value when reaching the side bilge at a height of 350 mm then slowly decrease to 0 and start to increase in the positive direction after reaching the composite superstructure the strain and stress begin to decrease with the increase of height under the sagging condition with the increase of the distance from the measuring point to the baseline the longitudinal strain and stress of the measuring point reaches the positive maximum value when reaching the side bilge at a height of 350 mm and then slowly decrease to 0 and start to increase in the negative direction after reaching the composite superstructure the strain and stress begin to decrease with the increase of height when the naval ship s finite element model is in the cruise sagging condition the longitudinal stress distribution of the 173 cross section is shown in fig 36 when the naval ship s finite element model is in the ultimate hogging condition the longitudinal stress distribution of the 173 cross section is shown in fig 37 it can be seen that the longitudinal stress distribution of the 173 cross section with the height of the hull under these two conditions is the same as the above conclusions besides it is found that the height of the neutral axis of the 173 cross section is about 900 mm by analyzing the strain and stress curves in the figure the stress and strain values of the measuring point at this height are zero as shown in fig 38 and fig 39 the results show that the overall average error of the two methods is 15 03 in the cruise hogging condition 15 51 in the cruise sagging condition 18 10 in the ultimate hogging condition and 12 67 in the ultimate sagging condition because the bottom of the cross section of the 210 frame is close to the restraint area the strain and stress at the bottom of the ship are very large under the hogging condition with the increase of the distance from the measuring point to the baseline the longitudinal strain and stress of the measuring point change rapidly from negative to positive within the height of 0 400 mm and then increase with the increase of height when reaching the height of 1900 mm the strain reaches the maximum value in the positive direction and then begins to decrease with the increase of height after reaching the top the strain is close to zero after reaching the superstructure the stress dropped suddenly and then with the increase of height the stress slowly decreases to close to zero under the sagging condition with the increase of the distance from the measuring point to the baseline the longitudinal strain and stress of the measuring point change rapidly from positive to negative within the height of 0 400 mm and then increase in the negative direction with the increase of height when reaching the height of 1900 mm the strain reaches the negative maximum and then begins to decrease with the increase of height after reaching the top the strain is close to zero after reaching the superstructure the stress dropped suddenly and then with the increase of height the stress slowly decreases to close to zero also it is found that the height of the neutral axis of the 210 cross section is about 300 mm by analyzing the strain and stress curves in the figure the stress and strain values of the measuring point at this height are zero besides by analyzing the stress and strain curves of figss 30 39 the results show that the strain and stress curve of the measuring points under the hogging condition takes the horizontal axis where the strain and stress are zero as the symmetry axis and is symmetrical to the strain and stress curve under the sagging condition however due to the difference in the magnitude of the applied load under the different load cases there is a slight difference in the symmetry of the curve 5 3 comparative analysis of measuring points at the interface this section mainly analyzes the longitudinal strain and stress of the measuring points obtained by the two methods of test and numerical calculation under different load conditions the measurement points are distributed on the interface between the main hull and the sandwich composite superstructure the position of the measuring points at the interface in the test model can be shown in fig 5 the position and number of measuring points in cad drawings can refer to figs 12 and 13 by comparing and analyzing fig 40 43 it can be found that the longitudinal strain and stress of the measuring point obtained through experiment and finite element numerical calculation have the same changing trend along the length of the ship the horizontal coordinate in the figure is the longitudinal distance from the measuring point to the midship the longitudinal distance from the measuring point in the stern direction to the midship is set as positive and the longitudinal distance from the measuring point in the bow direction to the midship is set as negative the vertical coordinate on the left is the strain of the measuring point and the vertical coordinate on the right is the stress of the measuring point the results show that the average errors of the longitudinal strain and stress of the measuring points on the main hull obtained by the two methods are as follows it is 14 81 in the cruise hogging condition 14 17 in the cruise sagging condition 17 10 in the ultimate hogging condition and 12 44 in the ultimate sagging condition the results show that the average errors of the longitudinal strain and stress of the measuring points on the composite superstructure obtained by the two methods are as follows it is 16 06 in the cruise hogging condition 19 83 in the cruise sagging condition 16 86 in the ultimate hogging condition and 21 76 in the ultimate sagging condition it is verified again about the validity and reliability of the numerical calculation method the results show that the longitudinal strain at the interface between the main hull and the superstructure has the same changing trend under different load conditions except for the opening and the corner area within the bow area between 2500 mm and 3500 mm from the midship because the measuring point is in the corner area of the composite superstructure which causes the strain and stress of the main hull at the interface to have complex changes the strain and stress in this area change from a positive to a negative direction and then to a positive direction under cruising and ultimate hogging conditions however the changing trend of stress and strain is opposite under cruising and ultimate sagging conditions within the stern area between 3000 mm and 4200 mm from the midship the measuring point is located in the large opening area which runs through deck 01 to deck 03 the results show that the strain and stress of the superstructure at the interface are reduced under different load cases when it exceeds the large opening range the strain and stress of the measuring point begin to increase with the increase of the longitudinal distance besides the results show that the strain and stress of the main hull at the interface are reduced under the hogging conditions when it exceeds the large opening range the strain and stress of the measuring point begin to increase with the increase of the longitudinal distance under cruising and ultimate sagging conditions the changing trend of the stress and strain of the main hull in this area is opposite to that of the hogging conditions it can be seen that the force transfer of the interface at the corner area of the composite superstructure and the large opening area of the deck is relatively complex which leads to great changes in the strain and stress and makes the curve change sharply without obvious regularity in the parallel mid body region of the ship model the interface between the superstructure and main hull conforms to the deformation characteristics of the equivalent beam and strain has the same trend the stress of the interface on the superstructure changes within 15mpa in the positive and negative directions which is far less than the stress of the interface on the main hull 5 4 comparative analysis of measuring points on other structures in addition to the comparative analysis of the strain and stress of the measuring points on the above main structures this section also compares and analyzes the measuring points on the starboard side of the 192 cross section in the sandwich composite integrated superstructure the number and location of the measuring points on the starboard side of the 192 cross section are shown in fig 10 this section also analyzes the strain of the measuring point on the no 03 deck which are near the starboard side the measuring point of no 03 deck near the starboard side is numbered as 100 at 117 rib as shown in fig 9 by comparing and analyzing fig 44 and fig 45 it is found that with the increase of the height of the measuring point the longitudinal strain and stress of the measuring point on the starboard of section 192 obtained by numerical calculation method are consistent with the test results the results show that the overall average error of the two methods is 9 52 in the cruise hogging condition 12 40 in the cruise sagging condition 11 31 in the ultimate hogging condition and 12 68 in the ultimate sagging condition under cruising and ultimate hogging conditions the strain and stress of the measuring point on the 192 cross section of the integrated composite superstructure begin to increase with the increase of the height of the measuring point after reaching the position of 1860 mm the strain and stress begin to decrease slowly with the increase of height as shown in figs 44 and 45 because the 192 cross section is close to the transverse bulkhead of the 189 rib position and there is no 03 deck at the height of 1860 mm the strain and stress of the measuring point change little with the increase of the height by comparing and analyzing fig 46 and fig 47 it is found that the longitudinal strain and stress of the measuring points on the no 03 deck obtained by numerical calculation methods under different load conditions are consistent with the experimental results the measuring points are located at the rib positions of 117 138 173 192 and 210 near the starboard side area of deck 03 the meaning of the coordinate axis in the figure is the same as that in section 5 3 of the article the results show that the overall average error of the two methods is 8 34 in the cruise hogging condition 6 92 in the cruise sagging condition 8 06 in the ultimate hogging condition and 7 18 in the ultimate sagging condition besides due to the large opening in the stern the structural strength of the area is weakened which makes the longitudinal strain and stress of the measuring point at the no 03 deck increase slowly with the increase of the distance from the measuring point to the bow when the naval ship s finite element model is in the cruise sagging condition the longitudinal stress distribution of the no 03 deck is shown in fig 48 when the naval ship s finite element model is in the ultimate hogging condition the longitudinal stress distribution of the no 03 deck is shown in fig 49 the positions of the measuring points at different rib positions in figs 46 and 47 on deck 03 can also refer to figs 48 and 49 it can be seen that the longitudinal stress distribution of the no 03 deck under these two conditions is the same as the above conclusions in addition it is also found that the high stress position where the stress concentration easily occurs is at the corner of the deck large opening at the rib positions of 235 by analyzing the stress and strain curves of figs 44 47 the strain and stress curve of measuring points under the hogging condition takes the horizontal axis where the strain and stress are zero as the symmetry axis and is symmetrical to the strain and stress curve under the sagging condition however due to the difference in the magnitude of the applied load under the different load cases there is a slight difference in the symmetry of the curve 5 5 comparative analysis of test and fem calculation through the analysis of the two methods of exploring the mechanical properties of the naval ship similar model with an integrated sandwich composite superstructure the advantages and disadvantages of the test method and the finite element numerical calculation method can be found the disadvantages of the test method are mainly that it requires a large number of personnel costs a large amount of money and takes more time for example it takes some personnel to spend a lot of time to calculate the real naval ship based on the similarity theory so as to obtain the drawings of the similar model with reduced principal dimensions of the real ship then again it takes some personnel to spend a lot of time and money to build similar model of the naval ship based on similar model drawings when a similar model of the ship is built some personnel and time are needed again to make test preparations apply the load and collect the data according to the purpose of the test finally it will take some time to process and analyze the test data in addition because the model test cannot fully simulate the load cases that the naval ship bears in real sailing this test method can only qualitatively analyze the mechanical performance of the naval vessel under different sailing conditions the main advantage of the test method is that the obtained test data is more accurate which can more accurately reflect the mechanical properties of the naval ship similar model with an integrated sandwich composite superstructure under different load cases since the similar model is obtained based on the similar criterion and the applied load is also obtained through this criterion the strain and stress of the measuring points obtained in the test represent the results of the real naval vessel under different sailing conditions the displacement of the measuring point obtained by the test multiplied by the scale is the realistic displacement of the naval vessel the advantages of the finite element numerical calculation method are mainly that it costs less personnel and time than the test method especially less money this method can also analyze the mechanical properties of ship model under different kinds of loads or more complex load cases it can simulate load cases that cannot be applied to the naval ship model in the test method in addition this method can also view the stress strain and displacement of the structure at any position in the model the disadvantage of finite element numerical method is that it is unable to determine the accuracy of the calculation results because there are many factors that affect the results of numerical calculations such as the way of boundary constraint the type of applied load the division of the mesh the selection of material parameters and the selection of iterative algorithmr this article uses these two methods at the same time to explore the mechanical properties of the naval ship similar model with an integrated sandwich composite superstructure only by combining the advantages of the two methods at the same time we can obtain the mechanical properties of the naval ship more accurately and comprehensively firstly some basic and accurate experimental data are obtained by the experimental method which is mutually verified with the finite element calculation method after that the verified finite element method is used to further obtain the relevant data of any structure of the ship model so as to more comprehensively analyze the mechanical properties of the ship model the data and rules about the mechanical properties of ships explored by the two methods can provide meaningful reference value for the construction and design of ships 6 conclusions the research object of the article is a similar model of a naval ship with an integrated sandwich composite superstructure based on the theoretical guidance of the double beam method through the static loading test of the four point bending method the article analyzes the strain and stress of the measuring points on the main structure of the naval ship model under different load cases and the deformation of the top deck of the superstructure combining with the results of finite element numerical calculation the mechanical properties of the naval ship model with sandwich composite superstructure under different load cases are explored by mutual verification with the test the results show that all measuring points at five different positions on the top deck of the superstructure have a downward displacement under the hogging condition and have an upward displacement under the sagging condition besides the vertical displacement of the measuring point farthest from the stern is the largest and that near the midship is the smallest the article explores the changes of longitudinal strain and stress of the measuring points with height on three typical cross sections under different load cases it can be found that the overall trend of the strain and stress curves varying with the height of three similar cross sections is consistent however due to the different positions of the cross sections and the different structures near the cross sections there are some differences in the strain and stress curves of the three typical cross sections the height of the neutral axis where the stress and strain are zero is also different in the three sections the strain and stress curve of all measuring points under the hogging condition takes the horizontal axis where the strain and stress are zero as the symmetry axis and is symmetrical to the strain and stress curve under the sagging condition except for the strain and stress of measuring points of the large opening and corner area at the interface between the main hull and the superstructure however due to the difference in the magnitude of the applied load under the different load cases there is a slight difference in the symmetry of the curve besides the article explores the changes of longitudinal stress and strain of the measuring point on the interface with the direction of the ship s length in the parallel mid body region of the ship model the interface between the superstructure and main hull conforms to the deformation characteristics of the equivalent beam and the strain has the same trend the stress of the interface on the superstructure is far less than the stress of the interface on the main hull the force transfer of the interface at the corner area of the composite superstructure and the large opening area of the deck is relatively complex which leads to great changes in the strain and stress and makes the curve change sharply without obvious regularity after that the article analyzes the changes in longitudinal strain and stress of the measuring point at 192 cross section with height under different load cases and the changes in longitudinal strain and stress of the measuring point on deck with the length of the ship in addition it also analyzes the areas of the no 03 deck which are prone to stress concentration finally this article discusses the advantages and disadvantages of experimental methods and finite element numerical calculation methods in exploring the mechanical properties of the naval ship similar model with an integrated sandwich composite superstructure credit authorship contribution

20701,offshore piles are used as foundations for various marine structures such as quay walls dolphins and offshore platforms offshore piles are primarily subjected to lateral loads from wind waves and currents which is particularly challenging for piles with substantial free length above the seabed this paper presents a new approach to determine the depth to fixity and the depth of the apparent plastic hinge of offshore piles considering the pile head condition type of soil below and the soil nonlinearity employing the p y curve method a comprehensive numerical investigation was conducted covering a wide range of key parameters governing the lateral response of offshore piles the results of the parametric analysis were used to establish numerical equations to determine the depth to fixity and the depth of the apparent plastic hinge for free and fixed head piles embedded either in sand or in clay in addition a closed form solution has been developed utilizing the equivalent cantilever fixed base model to estimate the lateral capacity of an offshore pile at specified lateral deflection and the corresponding maximum bending moment the new approach was verified by field load test results conducted on partially embedded piles in sand and clay keywords offshore piles lateral loads depth to fixity p y method 1 introduction vertical piles are used as a foundation in many offshore structures such as oil production rigs loading platforms breasting and mooring dolphins el naggar and novak 1995 1996 typically the upper portion of an offshore pile is surrounded by water consequently offshore piles are considered structurally as partially embedded piles the total length of a partially embedded pile is comprised of two segments unsupported length defined as the length of the piles above the seabed and embedment length defined as the length of the pile below the seabed an offshore pile is subjected to primarily lateral loads from the surrounding marine environment these lateral loads may be the impact loads from wave action drag forces from underwater currents or impact and pullout forces from vessels berthing the offshore piles will undergo significant horizontal displacement under those lateral loads thus the pile may develop a plastic hinge along its embedment length below the seabed el naggar 2018 in addition to the lateral loads offshore piles are exposed to axial loads that might be compression or tension the axial compression forces on an offshore pile will increase the depth of the plastic hinge and the depth to fixity hence the offshore pile will show stiffer response to lateral loads on the contrary tensile axial loads on an offshore pile will elevate the depth of the plastic hinge and consequently the fixity point therefore decreases the lateral capacity of the pile when compared to similar offshore pile under pure lateral loads pile failure under lateral loading may occur due to the failure of either the soil or the pile if the failure is due to yielding of the soil surrounding the embedded pile length the failure mechanism is called rigid pile or short pile failure on the other hand if the failure is due to yielding of the pile section itself at the point of the maximum moment the failure mechanism is flexible pile or long pile failure abdelaziz and el naggar 2015 chen and lee 2010 therefore the lateral response of offshore piles should be evaluated precisely for reliable design and operation of offshore structures the response of partially embedded piles under lateral loads has been studied utilizing the equivalent fixed base cantilever model by many researchers davisson and robinson 1965 scarlat 1996 chai 2002 caltrans 2006 heidari et al 2014 and heidari and el naggar 2018 in this model an equivalent cantilever is fixed at an estimated depth below the ground surface simulating the lateral response of the pile soil system this method also assumes that the plastic curvature is lumped at the center of the equivalent plastic hinge at a depth above the equivalent depth to fixity scarlat 1996 provided semi empirical expressions based on linear elastic analyses to estimate the depth to fixity chai 2002 developed analytical formulations for piles in cohesive and cohesionless soils assuming an elastic pile supported by an elastic winkler foundation which corresponds to the working load level the developed relations by chai were shown to depend on the aboveground height depth to maximum moment depth to fixity and equivalent plastic hinge length because the soil response to lateral load is nonlinear even within the working load range duncan et al 1994 the solutions proposed by chai 2002 tend to overestimate the lateral stiffness of the soil pile system when evaluating the yield displacement for pile shaft above the seabed heidari and el naggar 2018 developed an analytical formulation using the concept of the strain wedge method to assess the depth to plastic hinge the depth to fixity and the equivalent length of the plastic hinge the derived analytical expressions were suitable for the performance based design pbd of above ground extended pile shafts in clay and sand this analytical equation revealed the significant effect of soil and pile properties on evaluating the depth to fixity and the equivalent length of the plastic hinge budek et al 2000 conducted finite element fe analysis of pile soil system subjected to lateral loading the results of the fe analysis were used by budek and his co workers to establish charts for the variation of plastic hinge depth with normalized system stiffness considering different aboveground heights the analyses were assuming linear elastic soil behavior the results demonstrated that the length of the plastic hinge for piles embedded in cohesionless soils varies almost linearly with soil stiffness and the aboveground height of the pile chai and hutchinson 2002 performed four full scale cyclic tests on reinforced concrete rc piles installed in sand to evaluate the parameters that affect the length of the plastic hinge they reported that the length of the plastic hinge was neither sensitive to the soil stiffness nor to the value of displacement ductility factor the ratio of the peak non linear displacement to the yield displacement but it primarily depends on the aboveground height of the pile they concluded that the rate of increase of the modulus of the horizontal subgrade reaction recommended for analysis of a pile in cohesionless soil should be reduced to as low as one quarter of its value to assess the ductility capacity of the pile at the ultimate load in contrast goel 2015 performed numerical analyses and revealed that length of the plastic hinge changes with the displacement ductility factor only and recommended using different values of length of the plastic hinge at different loading intervals for consistent estimation of displacement capacity based on the above the simplified design approach for partially embedded piles and offshore piles requires prior knowledge of several key parameters such as soil nonlinearity depth to fixity and depth to plastic hinge for coherent evaluation of partially embedded pile capacity under lateral loads 2 objectives and scope of work this paper aims to derive mathematical formulations to estimate the depth to apparent plastic hinge and the depth to fixity the formulation will be based on numerical solution for offshore piles incorporating the nonlinear behavior of the pile soil system this will be achieved by conducting a comprehensive numerical analysis through a parametric study that covers a wide range of offshore pile and soil parameters the depths obtained from the mathematical formulations will be employed in an equivalent cantilever model to develop closed form equations suitable for offshore piles the closed form equations can estimate the lateral capacity and the maximum bending moment at a given lateral deflection for free head and fixed head pile conditions 3 methodology of using equivalent cantilever model the total length of an offshore pile l is equal to the unsupported length lu plus the embedded length le as shown in fig 1 a under lateral loads the offshore piles reach a point of zero deflection at a distance below the seabed called depth to fixity lf therefore the unsupported equivalent length l1 of an offshore pile defined as the length from the pile head to the depth to fixity along the pile shaft is equal to lu plus lf as illustrated in fig 1b based on that an equivalent cantilever model with length equal to l1 can be used to simulate the lateral response of an offshore pile in this model a fixed based cantilever replaces the pile column in which the equivalent system has the same load displacement response as that of the pile soil system heidari and el naggar 2018 the applied lateral load causes bending moment that may develop a plastic hinge at a depth below the ground surface davisson and robinson 1965 presented an approximate procedure for an equivalent cantilever model to estimate lf for partially embedded piles the procedure utilized theoretical solutions illustrating the pile as a free standing pile with a fixed base at the depth of fixity below the ground surface davisson and robinson 1965 concluded that the depth lf below the ground surface depends mainly on the soil subgrade modulus and the pile bending stiffness epip they suggested that lf 1 4r for soils with subgrade modulus constant with depth and lf 1 8t for soils with subgrade modulus increasing linearly with depth they provided equations to compute the subgrade reaction factor t for granular soils to represent soils with subgrade modulus varying with depth and stiffness factor r for cohesive soils to represent soils with subgrade modulus constant with depth as follows 1 t e p i p η h 5 2 r e p i p k 1 4 where ep is young s modulus of pile material in mn m2 ip is the moment of inertia of the pile cross section in m4 ηh is the modulus of subgrade reaction of granular soil in mn m3 and k1 is the modulus of subgrade reaction of cohesive soils in mn m3 the indian standard code of practice indian code of standards 2911 part i section 2 2010 provided an analytical solution based on the method proposed by davisson and robinson 1965 to estimate the depth of fixity below the ground surface the is code approach determined the stiffness factor t or r from the same equations as davisson and his co worker eqns 1 and 2 but with different values for soil stiffness ηh and k1 that has been recommended by is code the is code provided a chart that can be used to determine the lf based on a given lu pile head condition and type of soil the chart provided by is code is given in fig 2 the main drawbacks of both equivalent cantilever models are that they defined the soil with its modulus of subgrade reaction only i e no consideration of soil nonlinearity it does not distinguish between depth to fixity and depth to plastic hinge and it neglects the influence of pile inelastic behavior of the partially embedded piles besides the recommended graph by the is code fig 2 is suitable for piles with free length less than or equal 3 times the pile diameter only in the current approach an offshore pile depth of the plastic hinge lfm and the depth to fixity lfd are defined as shown in fig 3 both depths are key parameters in determining the lateral response of an offshore pile hence they need to be determined simultaneously by assuming a concentrated plastic hinge rotation at the depth of maximum moment the unsupported equivalent length for the moment l1m and unsupported equivalent length for deflection l1d can be calculated by adding lu to the determined lfm and lfd respectively as depicted in fig 3 based on that two equivalent cantilever models can be created first model with length equal l1d to estimate the lateral deflection at given lateral load and the other with length l1m to estimate the corresponding maximum bending moment to establish the key parameters necessary for this approach numerical investigation was conducted for offshore piles subjected to lateral loads to compute lfm and lfd of the piles numerically the widely used p y curves approach was employed herein to simulate the nonlinear soil response the p y curves approach is based on solution of the differential equation describing the pile as a beam column and the soil resistance is simulated using nonlinear winkler type springs the soil reaction against the pile p is related to the deflection of the pile y by means of nonlinear load deflection curves the main criticism of the p y method is that the soil is not treated as a continuum but as a series of discrete springs i e winkler model however the p y curves were derived from correlations with results of full scale experiments where only the pile head movements were recorded these comparisons show reasonable to excellent agreement between computed and experimental results isenhower and wang 2011 specially for small to medium diameter offshore piles i e flexible offshore piles therefore the p y curves was used to derive numerical expressions for determination of lfm and lfd for offshore piles under lateral loads embedded in either cohesive or cohesionless soil 4 parametric study through numerical investigation a parametric study was carried out employing lpile 6 0 software to estimate lfm and lfd methods of defining the geometry and material of the pile as well as the relevant p y curves according to the soil type are summarized in this section and detailed in isenhower and wang 2011 the piles analyzed here are either drilled shafts cast in place concrete rc piles or steel pipe piles the material properties of the steel and rc adopted in this study are kept constant and equal to the values given in table 1 the offshore piles considered in the study has circular cross sections with outer diameters varying from 0 61 m to 2 03 m the value of lu considered in this study varied from 2 5 m to simulate the offshore piles in shallow water to 20 0 m to simulate the offshore piles in deep water however the total length of the offshore piles considered here ranged from 20 m to 50 m the offshore piles were assumed to be either a free head or a fully fixed head in the platforms the parametric study was conducted for offshore pile embedded in either cohesionless soil or cohesive soil the cohesionless soils were modeled in the software utilizing the american petroleum institute 2010 api method for sand the p y relation employed in the api sand model is shown in fig 4 this sand model is recommended by the api for designing fixed offshore platforms the model uses an initial modulus of subgrade reaction k based on several field experiments and hyperbolic tangent function for computation of the p y curve the ultimate soil resistance p u in the curve is calculated at each case and depth as the lesser of p u at shallow depths denoted as p us and at great depth denoted as p ud from 3a p u s c 1 x c 2 d γ x 3b p u d c 3 d γ x where c1 c2 and c3 is

x is the depth d is the pile diameter γ is the effective unit weight of the sand and ϕ is angle of internal friction according to the api method the ultimate soil resistance p u was established at lateral deformation equal 3d 80 the api model calculates k for the sand depending on its ϕ and its location with respect to the ground water table either above or below the ground water table fig 5 illustrates the variation of k with ϕ for fine sand in the api sand model the frictional angle of the sand used in the parametric study varied from loose sand with ϕ 28 to dense very dense sand with ϕ 41 and the corresponding k was computed from fig 5 for cohesive soils two models were employed in the parametric study soft clay in the presence of free water by matlock 1970 and stiff clay in the presence of free water by reese and welch 1975 models the characteristic p y curves for soft clay model and stiff clay model are illustrated in figs 6 and 7 respectively both models define the clay by its γ undrained shear strength su and the axial strain corresponding to one half the maximum principal stress difference ε50 the best possible estimate of su variation with depth should be obtained to model the offshore clay if no stress strain curves are available for the clay under consideration recommended values of ε50 are given in table 2 can be used in the soft clay model the ultimate resistance of the soil p u at a depth x from the ground surface taken as the lesser from 5a p u 3 γ avg s u x x 2 d s u d 5b p u 9 s u d then the deflection corresponding to ε50 is calculated as 6 y

values of y similarly the ultimate resistance of the soil at a depth x based on stiff clay model p c is the lesser from 8a p c t 2 s u d γ d x 2 83 s u x 8b p c t 11 s u d then the deflection corresponding to ε50 is calculated as 9 y 50 ε 50 d the stiff clay model by reese and welch 1975 required an initial value of k to be defined the value of k recommended for the stiff clay given by reese and welch 1975 in given table 3 su in the current parametric study varied from 25 kpa to 50 kpa for soft clay model and from 50 kpa to 200 kpa for the stiff clay model the corresponding value of k in the stiff clay model was computed from table 3 some results of the parametric study cases are given in appendix a 5 determination of lfd and lfm employing the above model parameters around 600 cases were analyzed using lpile 2011 software the results of these analyses were categorized depending on the soil type sand or clay and the pile head condition free or fixed in the absence of lateral load test results the design of piles to resist lateral loads is based on acceptable lateral deflection rather than the ultimate lateral capacity anderson et al 2003 based on that each case analyzed in the parametric study was subjected to two lateral load magnitudes the first load magnitude is the lateral load that produces a tolerable lateral deflection during the course of this numerical study the authors noted that the difference in the depth of fixity at lateral deflection varying between 20 mm and 37 mm depending on the diameter of the piles is negligible and can be ignored thus the tolerable lateral deflection here was taken 37 mm this case of loading was studied to simulate the response of an offshore pile to working applied loads beyond this deflection the soil surrounding the pile started to fail progressively and the depth of fixity became significantly affected by the nonlinearity of the pile cross section until the lateral deflection reached around 5 10 of the pile diameter at which point the pile cross section started to yield having said that the second lateral load magnitude was taken as the load corresponding to lateral deflection between 5 and 10 of the offshore pile diameter this load was studied to simulate the ultimate lateral load capacity of the pile pyke 1984 briaud 1984 and chen and lee 2010 the values of lfd and lfm were estimated from the analysis results for both lateral load levels in the first load level true plastic hinge was not developed however lfm was estimated for this case at an apparent plastic hinge located at the depth of the maximum moment lfd in both cases was estimated at the location of zero lateral deflection under the applied lateral load the variation in depth of lfd at both load values for all analyzed cases was found to be between 1 and 4 times the pile diameter depending on lu and the type of soil to ensure of full contribution of pile bending stiffness epip the numerical equations given in section 5 1 and 5 2 for cohesionless and cohesive soils were derived for lateral loads that cause lateral deformation below 37 mm with recommendation to use reduced bending stiffness such as degradation stiffness with applied lateral loads for higher deflections 5 1 cohesionless soils sand the variation of l1m t and l1d t with lu t for free and fixed head offshore piles embedded in sand are illustrated in fig 8 and fig 9 respectively l1m and l1d were calculated by adding the computed lfm and lfd to lu in each case the stiffness factor t used in the illustrations was calculated from eq 1 and values of ηh in the equation were computed from fig 5 based on the api sand model figs 8 and 9 show that l1d and l1m for the free and fixed head increase as lu increases and the difference between l1d t and l1m t for the same head condition is almost constant for all values of lu t with l1d is deeper than l1m alternatively l1m and l1d for free head and fixed head offshore piles installed in sand can be estimated from the following numerical formulation curve fitting equations with r2 0 99 as follows for free head pile in sand 10a l 1 m f r e e s a n d 0 009 l u 2 t 0 85 l u 1 15 t 10b l 1 d f r e e s a n d 0

sand l1m and l1d can be computed from eq 10a through 11b by substituting lu 0 0 5 2 cohesive soils clay similarly fig 10 and fig 11 display the variations of the l1m and l1d with lu for free head and fixed head offshore piles embedded in clay respectively the stiffness factor c shown in the figures was calculated from the following equation 12 c e p i p s u 4 where su is the average undrained shear strength of the clay layers along the embedment length of the offshore pile for highly variable su with depth the average undrained shear strength of the clay within depth equal l1d should be used as revealed in offshore pile in sand the difference between l1d c and l1m c at any lu c is almost constant for the same head condition but generally both increases by increasing the pile free length l1m and l1d for free head and fixed head offshore piles embedded in clayey soils can be also evaluated from the following eqs for free head pile in clay 13a l 1 m c f r e e c l a y 0 06 l u c 2

0 66 l u c 0 52 6 deflection and corresponding bending moment for offshore piles the prediction of the pile lateral capacity requires the assessment of its shaft rigidity there is no standard definition for shaft rigidity but several criteria can be used to judge the rigidity of the pile shaft typically piles characterized by aspect ratio l d less than 6 are rigid short while piles with aspect ratio larger than 20 are flexible long pile accordingly most offshore piles can be categorized as long piles except large diameter monopiles used as foundations in wind turbines the results of the analyses conducted in this paper were employed to create a closed form solution utilizing equivalent cantilever model to obtain the lateral capacity of a single flexible offshore pile embedded in either sand or clay the term closed form solution here implies that it is applicable to offshore flexible piles embedded in soil with either friction angle ϕ soil or undrained shear strength c soil the proposed closed form solution will provide conservative solution if applied to an offshore pile embedded in c ϕ soil because the user will need to ignore one of the two shear strength parameters also as the closed form solution is for flexible piles it may estimate unrealistic lateral response for large diameter offshore piles with l d less than 10 the fixed base of the equivalent cantilever shall be located at a depth equal l1d to estimate the lateral load corresponding to a given lateral deflection after determining the lateral load the fixed base of the cantilever will be placed at a depth equal to l1m to calculate the corresponding maximum bending moment as shown in fig 12 a and b for free and fixed pile head conditions at a tolerable lateral deflection δall the lateral capacity of the pile may be computed according to fig 12 by 15a p f r e e 3 δ a l l e p i p l 1 d 3 15b p f i x e d 12 δ a l l e p i p l 1 d 3 where pfree and pfixed are the lateral capacity of free and fixed head pile to produce lateral deflection equal δall and l1d is the unsupported equivalent length for deflection calculated from eqs 10b 11b and 13b or 14b depending on the type of soil and the pile head fixation the pile bending stiffness in eq 16a and b should be substituted depending on the magnitude of the applied lateral load the corresponding maximum bending moment can then be calculated from 16a m f r e e p f r e e l 1 m 16b m f i x e d p f i x e d l 1 m 2 where l1m is the unsupported equivalent length for moment calculated from eqs 10a 11a and 13a or 14a for offshore piles embedded in sand ϕ should be evaluated from appropriate field or laboratory tests the sand modulus of subgrade reaction is then obtained from fig 5 and stiffness factor t is calculated from eq 1 according to the pile head condition at the platform free or fixed l1m and l1d should be estimated from eq 10a through 11b for offshore piles embedded in clayey soils average su is computed along the effective length of the pile and the stiffness factor c is calculated from eq 12 based on the pile head condition free or fixed l1m and l1d should be estimated from eq 13a through 14b 7 comparison with field load test the main factor is selecting appropriate field test results to verify the current approach is the location of the recorded lateral deflection during the load test unfortunately the majority of lateral load test on offshore piles and partially embedded piles records the lateral deflection of the piles at the ground level and not at the pile head where the loads typically applied 7 1 driven piles in clay price and wardle 1981 reported the results of lateral load test conducted on steel pipe installed in clay at brent cross london united kingdom the tested pile was 0 406 m in diameter and 16 5 m in length the bending stiffness of the piles cross section was equal to 5 14 104 kn m2 the lateral load was applied to the pile head at 1 0 m above the existing ground surface in a free head condition the undrained shear strength of the clay at the pile test site varied from 44 kpa at the ground level to 80 5 kpa at depth of 6 2 m below ground surface with an average value of 55 kpa the teste pile was subjected to both static and cyclic loads on the head of the tested pile however price and wardle reported that static loads were of larger magnitude than cyclic loads and were applied in a reloading state after cycling has been done the assumption was made by the price and his co author that cyclic with smaller loads didn t not affect the subsequence static loads based on the pile bending stiffness and the given soil parameters the l1d and l1m of the tested pile were estimated equal to 3 02 m and 1 96 m respectively fig 13 compares the applied load and corresponding deflection at the pile head obtained from the pile load test results and the current approach it can be inferred from fig 13 that the current approach is in an agreement with the pile load test results until applied load of 60 kn as the applied load exceeded 60 kn the calculated response overestimated the soil stiffness and resistance this could be attributed to the fact that the pile was subjected to cyclic loading prior to applying the static loading as reported by price and wardle 1981 which would remold the clay and reduce its strength the current analysis was conducted using the original strength and stiffness of the clay and not the remolded values and hence the calculated response was stiffer than the experimental results in addition price and wardle 1981 stated in their article that non linear behavior of the pile cross section was observed during 100 kn static load test and the non linearity started at 60 kn however price and his co worker didn t report how much reduction can be applied to the pile epip the authors attempted to account for the anticipated remolding of the clay by reducing the undrained shear strength by 25 50 corresponding to applied loads between 60 kn and 100 kn the load displacement curve using the current approach utilizing the reduced strength was then added to the previous curves and shown in fig 14 it can be observed that the current approach shows more favorable agreement with the field load test when account for the low shear strength of the clay surrounding the tested pile the yield moment of the pile cross section was estimated at 301 kn m and the corresponding yield moment estimated from the current approach with reduced undried shear strength was found equal to 265 kn m furthermore the lateral pile deflection profile and bending moment profile with depth for the steel pile tested by price and wardle was estimated employing lpile software lpile 2006 and presented in fig 15 the pile head deflections computed by the software are in a good agreement with the deflections estimated using the current approach given in fig 14 at the same applied load 7 2 cast in place in clay stewart et al 2007 performed ﬁeld tests on a cast in place rc pile the diameter of the free head shaft was 0 61 m and the height aboveground was 4 06 m the pile shaft was embedded 7 63 m into a nature silty clay layer to ensure a long pile failure in the shaft the shaft was designed using concrete 27 5 mpa concrete and reinforced by 8 28 6 mm longitudinal bars the upper 15 m of soil at the site consisted of mostly silty clays interspersed with relatively thin layers of silty sands the undrained shear strength of the upper 8 m was determined from in situ cpt test and found to be equal approximately 190 kpa the pile was loaded in a two way cycle the pile was heavily instrumented with six different types of sensors to measure shear deformations actuator loads and displacement at pile head and ground surface stewart and his co workers presented the load head lateral deflection curve and provide an experimental moment curvature relationship derived from test data the pile bending stiffness was then back calculated from the experimental moment curvature relation and employed in estimating the lateral load and the moment in the current approach the back calculated epip from the moment curvature relationship was found to vary from 4 56e4 to 1 67e4 fig 16 and fig 17 compare the load head deflection and the moment curvature of the experiment and the current approach it should be noted that the moment curvature given in fig 17 is for the moment at the ground level and not the maximum moment both figures show a good agreement between the experimental data and the current approach even after first yield point however the current approach failed in estimating the lateral load and the corresponding bending moment at failure deflection more than 200 mm this might be attribute to the fact that the back calculated epip used in the analysis at this level is not representing the actual cross section of the pile at failure 7 3 cast in place piles in sand 23 price and wardle reported the results of lateral load tests on large diameter bored piles installed in sand in 1987 the results of the pile load test were given in the report issued by the transportation and road research laboratory old wokingham road crowthorne berkshire the tested piles are 1 5 m in diameter concrete piles and reinforced by 36 round bars 50 mm in diameter price and wardle 1987 reported that the ultimate bending moment at which a plastic hinge would occur was equal to 15 900 kn m at concrete strain of 0 003 in addition they estimated the anticipated load at yield from the instrumentation installed inside the pile to be equal 3500 kn and the corresponding yielding moment to be approximately 12100 kn m the epip of the pile cross section before loading was computed equal to 1 57 107 kn m2 price and wardle reported a reduction in the pile epip as the magnitude of the bending strain increased due to concrete cracking they back calculate the epip from the recorded instrumentation bending strain and found that epip decreased from 1 2 107 at load equal 400 kn to 5 106 at load equal 2000 kn the maximum lateral load applied during the lateral field test and the corresponding maximum moment calculated from the instrumentation bending strain were 2400 kn and 8800 kn m respectively the tested pile was installed in sand with friction angle vary from 37 to 43 at the upper 9 5 m with an average value of 40 based on that l1d and l1m were calculated at each load and corresponding reduced epip the load deflection of the lateral load test conducted by price and wardle 1987 and that estimated from the current approach are depicted in fig 18 the response obtained from the current approach is in a good agreement with the field test results after applying the reduced epip of the bored piles in estimating l1d and l1m the difference between the results from the current method and the pile load test results is less than or equal 10 table 4 summarizes the comparison between the maximum measured and yielding bending moment reported by price and wardle 1987 and those estimated from the current approach the estimated bending moment in the current approach was calculated using epip equal 5 106 kn m2 and 4 8 106 kn m2 for the maximum applied load of 2400 kn and the yielding load of 3500 kn respectively besides the lateral pile deflection and bending moment profile with depth for the 1 5 m concrete pile tested by price and wardle 1987 was computed employing lpile software lpile 2006 and presented in fig 19 also the pile head deflection calculated by the software are in fair agreement with the field and the current approach head deflections shown in fig 18 the lpile analysis underestimated the maximum bending moment in the pile cross section the agreement between the current approach and the results of the pile load test for reinforced concrete piles highlighted the importance of selecting the appropriate bending stiffness of the pile in estimating the lateral deflection the presented study cases also show that the current method can be extended to estimate the yielding moment of the pile cross section if the degradation in the pile bending stiffness with the applied moment is assessed 8 conclusions a new approach was presented here to estimate equivalent unsupported length for deflection and moment for laterally loaded offshore vertical piles offshore piles are considered partially embedded piles because the upper part of the pile will be surrounded by water and the lower part of the pile is embedded in soil deposit numerical investigations covering a wide range of offshore piles parameters were carried out employing the p y curves approach to model the nonlinearity of the soil to estimate l1d and l1m for offshore piles the results of the analysis provide numerical equations to estimate l1d and l1m for sand and clay soils in free and fixed pile head conditions a closed form solution suitable for flexible offshore piles based on the equivalent cantilever fixed base model was presented the solution employed the numerical results in determining l1d and l1m to estimate the lateral capacity of an offshore pile and the maximum bending moment at tolerable lateral deflection the closed form solution can be extended to estimate the yield capacity of the offshore piles if the degradation of the pile bending stiffness with the applied load magnitude is evaluated the current approach was verified with lateral pile load test results conducted on partially embedded piles in clay and sand the verification demonstrated a good agreement between the pile load test results and the current approach for both soil deposits in free head condition the verification process reveals that the new approach required precise evaluation of the pile bending stiffness therefore the variation of pile bending stiffness with the magnitude of the applied lateral loads should be assessed to select the appropriate corresponding bending stiffness credit

20701,offshore piles are used as foundations for various marine structures such as quay walls dolphins and offshore platforms offshore piles are primarily subjected to lateral loads from wind waves and currents which is particularly challenging for piles with substantial free length above the seabed this paper presents a new approach to determine the depth to fixity and the depth of the apparent plastic hinge of offshore piles considering the pile head condition type of soil below and the soil nonlinearity employing the p y curve method a comprehensive numerical investigation was conducted covering a wide range of key parameters governing the lateral response of offshore piles the results of the parametric analysis were used to establish numerical equations to determine the depth to fixity and the depth of the apparent plastic hinge for free and fixed head piles embedded either in sand or in clay in addition a closed form solution has been developed utilizing the equivalent cantilever fixed base model to estimate the lateral capacity of an offshore pile at specified lateral deflection and the corresponding maximum bending moment the new approach was verified by field load test results conducted on partially embedded piles in sand and clay keywords offshore piles lateral loads depth to fixity p y method 1 introduction vertical piles are used as a foundation in many offshore structures such as oil production rigs loading platforms breasting and mooring dolphins el naggar and novak 1995 1996 typically the upper portion of an offshore pile is surrounded by water consequently offshore piles are considered structurally as partially embedded piles the total length of a partially embedded pile is comprised of two segments unsupported length defined as the length of the piles above the seabed and embedment length defined as the length of the pile below the seabed an offshore pile is subjected to primarily lateral loads from the surrounding marine environment these lateral loads may be the impact loads from wave action drag forces from underwater currents or impact and pullout forces from vessels berthing the offshore piles will undergo significant horizontal displacement under those lateral loads thus the pile may develop a plastic hinge along its embedment length below the seabed el naggar 2018 in addition to the lateral loads offshore piles are exposed to axial loads that might be compression or tension the axial compression forces on an offshore pile will increase the depth of the plastic hinge and the depth to fixity hence the offshore pile will show stiffer response to lateral loads on the contrary tensile axial loads on an offshore pile will elevate the depth of the plastic hinge and consequently the fixity point therefore decreases the lateral capacity of the pile when compared to similar offshore pile under pure lateral loads pile failure under lateral loading may occur due to the failure of either the soil or the pile if the failure is due to yielding of the soil surrounding the embedded pile length the failure mechanism is called rigid pile or short pile failure on the other hand if the failure is due to yielding of the pile section itself at the point of the maximum moment the failure mechanism is flexible pile or long pile failure abdelaziz and el naggar 2015 chen and lee 2010 therefore the lateral response of offshore piles should be evaluated precisely for reliable design and operation of offshore structures the response of partially embedded piles under lateral loads has been studied utilizing the equivalent fixed base cantilever model by many researchers davisson and robinson 1965 scarlat 1996 chai 2002 caltrans 2006 heidari et al 2014 and heidari and el naggar 2018 in this model an equivalent cantilever is fixed at an estimated depth below the ground surface simulating the lateral response of the pile soil system this method also assumes that the plastic curvature is lumped at the center of the equivalent plastic hinge at a depth above the equivalent depth to fixity scarlat 1996 provided semi empirical expressions based on linear elastic analyses to estimate the depth to fixity chai 2002 developed analytical formulations for piles in cohesive and cohesionless soils assuming an elastic pile supported by an elastic winkler foundation which corresponds to the working load level the developed relations by chai were shown to depend on the aboveground height depth to maximum moment depth to fixity and equivalent plastic hinge length because the soil response to lateral load is nonlinear even within the working load range duncan et al 1994 the solutions proposed by chai 2002 tend to overestimate the lateral stiffness of the soil pile system when evaluating the yield displacement for pile shaft above the seabed heidari and el naggar 2018 developed an analytical formulation using the concept of the strain wedge method to assess the depth to plastic hinge the depth to fixity and the equivalent length of the plastic hinge the derived analytical expressions were suitable for the performance based design pbd of above ground extended pile shafts in clay and sand this analytical equation revealed the significant effect of soil and pile properties on evaluating the depth to fixity and the equivalent length of the plastic hinge budek et al 2000 conducted finite element fe analysis of pile soil system subjected to lateral loading the results of the fe analysis were used by budek and his co workers to establish charts for the variation of plastic hinge depth with normalized system stiffness considering different aboveground heights the analyses were assuming linear elastic soil behavior the results demonstrated that the length of the plastic hinge for piles embedded in cohesionless soils varies almost linearly with soil stiffness and the aboveground height of the pile chai and hutchinson 2002 performed four full scale cyclic tests on reinforced concrete rc piles installed in sand to evaluate the parameters that affect the length of the plastic hinge they reported that the length of the plastic hinge was neither sensitive to the soil stiffness nor to the value of displacement ductility factor the ratio of the peak non linear displacement to the yield displacement but it primarily depends on the aboveground height of the pile they concluded that the rate of increase of the modulus of the horizontal subgrade reaction recommended for analysis of a pile in cohesionless soil should be reduced to as low as one quarter of its value to assess the ductility capacity of the pile at the ultimate load in contrast goel 2015 performed numerical analyses and revealed that length of the plastic hinge changes with the displacement ductility factor only and recommended using different values of length of the plastic hinge at different loading intervals for consistent estimation of displacement capacity based on the above the simplified design approach for partially embedded piles and offshore piles requires prior knowledge of several key parameters such as soil nonlinearity depth to fixity and depth to plastic hinge for coherent evaluation of partially embedded pile capacity under lateral loads 2 objectives and scope of work this paper aims to derive mathematical formulations to estimate the depth to apparent plastic hinge and the depth to fixity the formulation will be based on numerical solution for offshore piles incorporating the nonlinear behavior of the pile soil system this will be achieved by conducting a comprehensive numerical analysis through a parametric study that covers a wide range of offshore pile and soil parameters the depths obtained from the mathematical formulations will be employed in an equivalent cantilever model to develop closed form equations suitable for offshore piles the closed form equations can estimate the lateral capacity and the maximum bending moment at a given lateral deflection for free head and fixed head pile conditions 3 methodology of using equivalent cantilever model the total length of an offshore pile l is equal to the unsupported length lu plus the embedded length le as shown in fig 1 a under lateral loads the offshore piles reach a point of zero deflection at a distance below the seabed called depth to fixity lf therefore the unsupported equivalent length l1 of an offshore pile defined as the length from the pile head to the depth to fixity along the pile shaft is equal to lu plus lf as illustrated in fig 1b based on that an equivalent cantilever model with length equal to l1 can be used to simulate the lateral response of an offshore pile in this model a fixed based cantilever replaces the pile column in which the equivalent system has the same load displacement response as that of the pile soil system heidari and el naggar 2018 the applied lateral load causes bending moment that may develop a plastic hinge at a depth below the ground surface davisson and robinson 1965 presented an approximate procedure for an equivalent cantilever model to estimate lf for partially embedded piles the procedure utilized theoretical solutions illustrating the pile as a free standing pile with a fixed base at the depth of fixity below the ground surface davisson and robinson 1965 concluded that the depth lf below the ground surface depends mainly on the soil subgrade modulus and the pile bending stiffness epip they suggested that lf 1 4r for soils with subgrade modulus constant with depth and lf 1 8t for soils with subgrade modulus increasing linearly with depth they provided equations to compute the subgrade reaction factor t for granular soils to represent soils with subgrade modulus varying with depth and stiffness factor r for cohesive soils to represent soils with subgrade modulus constant with depth as follows 1 t e p i p η h 5 2 r e p i p k 1 4 where ep is young s modulus of pile material in mn m2 ip is the moment of inertia of the pile cross section in m4 ηh is the modulus of subgrade reaction of granular soil in mn m3 and k1 is the modulus of subgrade reaction of cohesive soils in mn m3 the indian standard code of practice indian code of standards 2911 part i section 2 2010 provided an analytical solution based on the method proposed by davisson and robinson 1965 to estimate the depth of fixity below the ground surface the is code approach determined the stiffness factor t or r from the same equations as davisson and his co worker eqns 1 and 2 but with different values for soil stiffness ηh and k1 that has been recommended by is code the is code provided a chart that can be used to determine the lf based on a given lu pile head condition and type of soil the chart provided by is code is given in fig 2 the main drawbacks of both equivalent cantilever models are that they defined the soil with its modulus of subgrade reaction only i e no consideration of soil nonlinearity it does not distinguish between depth to fixity and depth to plastic hinge and it neglects the influence of pile inelastic behavior of the partially embedded piles besides the recommended graph by the is code fig 2 is suitable for piles with free length less than or equal 3 times the pile diameter only in the current approach an offshore pile depth of the plastic hinge lfm and the depth to fixity lfd are defined as shown in fig 3 both depths are key parameters in determining the lateral response of an offshore pile hence they need to be determined simultaneously by assuming a concentrated plastic hinge rotation at the depth of maximum moment the unsupported equivalent length for the moment l1m and unsupported equivalent length for deflection l1d can be calculated by adding lu to the determined lfm and lfd respectively as depicted in fig 3 based on that two equivalent cantilever models can be created first model with length equal l1d to estimate the lateral deflection at given lateral load and the other with length l1m to estimate the corresponding maximum bending moment to establish the key parameters necessary for this approach numerical investigation was conducted for offshore piles subjected to lateral loads to compute lfm and lfd of the piles numerically the widely used p y curves approach was employed herein to simulate the nonlinear soil response the p y curves approach is based on solution of the differential equation describing the pile as a beam column and the soil resistance is simulated using nonlinear winkler type springs the soil reaction against the pile p is related to the deflection of the pile y by means of nonlinear load deflection curves the main criticism of the p y method is that the soil is not treated as a continuum but as a series of discrete springs i e winkler model however the p y curves were derived from correlations with results of full scale experiments where only the pile head movements were recorded these comparisons show reasonable to excellent agreement between computed and experimental results isenhower and wang 2011 specially for small to medium diameter offshore piles i e flexible offshore piles therefore the p y curves was used to derive numerical expressions for determination of lfm and lfd for offshore piles under lateral loads embedded in either cohesive or cohesionless soil 4 parametric study through numerical investigation a parametric study was carried out employing lpile 6 0 software to estimate lfm and lfd methods of defining the geometry and material of the pile as well as the relevant p y curves according to the soil type are summarized in this section and detailed in isenhower and wang 2011 the piles analyzed here are either drilled shafts cast in place concrete rc piles or steel pipe piles the material properties of the steel and rc adopted in this study are kept constant and equal to the values given in table 1 the offshore piles considered in the study has circular cross sections with outer diameters varying from 0 61 m to 2 03 m the value of lu considered in this study varied from 2 5 m to simulate the offshore piles in shallow water to 20 0 m to simulate the offshore piles in deep water however the total length of the offshore piles considered here ranged from 20 m to 50 m the offshore piles were assumed to be either a free head or a fully fixed head in the platforms the parametric study was conducted for offshore pile embedded in either cohesionless soil or cohesive soil the cohesionless soils were modeled in the software utilizing the american petroleum institute 2010 api method for sand the p y relation employed in the api sand model is shown in fig 4 this sand model is recommended by the api for designing fixed offshore platforms the model uses an initial modulus of subgrade reaction k based on several field experiments and hyperbolic tangent function for computation of the p y curve the ultimate soil resistance p u in the curve is calculated at each case and depth as the lesser of p u at shallow depths denoted as p us and at great depth denoted as p ud from 3a p u s c 1 x c 2 d γ x 3b p u d c 3 d γ x where c1 c2 and c3 is

x is the depth d is the pile diameter γ is the effective unit weight of the sand and ϕ is angle of internal friction according to the api method the ultimate soil resistance p u was established at lateral deformation equal 3d 80 the api model calculates k for the sand depending on its ϕ and its location with respect to the ground water table either above or below the ground water table fig 5 illustrates the variation of k with ϕ for fine sand in the api sand model the frictional angle of the sand used in the parametric study varied from loose sand with ϕ 28 to dense very dense sand with ϕ 41 and the corresponding k was computed from fig 5 for cohesive soils two models were employed in the parametric study soft clay in the presence of free water by matlock 1970 and stiff clay in the presence of free water by reese and welch 1975 models the characteristic p y curves for soft clay model and stiff clay model are illustrated in figs 6 and 7 respectively both models define the clay by its γ undrained shear strength su and the axial strain corresponding to one half the maximum principal stress difference ε50 the best possible estimate of su variation with depth should be obtained to model the offshore clay if no stress strain curves are available for the clay under consideration recommended values of ε50 are given in table 2 can be used in the soft clay model the ultimate resistance of the soil p u at a depth x from the ground surface taken as the lesser from 5a p u 3 γ avg s u x x 2 d s u d 5b p u 9 s u d then the deflection corresponding to ε50 is calculated as 6 y

values of y similarly the ultimate resistance of the soil at a depth x based on stiff clay model p c is the lesser from 8a p c t 2 s u d γ d x 2 83 s u x 8b p c t 11 s u d then the deflection corresponding to ε50 is calculated as 9 y 50 ε 50 d the stiff clay model by reese and welch 1975 required an initial value of k to be defined the value of k recommended for the stiff clay given by reese and welch 1975 in given table 3 su in the current parametric study varied from 25 kpa to 50 kpa for soft clay model and from 50 kpa to 200 kpa for the stiff clay model the corresponding value of k in the stiff clay model was computed from table 3 some results of the parametric study cases are given in appendix a 5 determination of lfd and lfm employing the above model parameters around 600 cases were analyzed using lpile 2011 software the results of these analyses were categorized depending on the soil type sand or clay and the pile head condition free or fixed in the absence of lateral load test results the design of piles to resist lateral loads is based on acceptable lateral deflection rather than the ultimate lateral capacity anderson et al 2003 based on that each case analyzed in the parametric study was subjected to two lateral load magnitudes the first load magnitude is the lateral load that produces a tolerable lateral deflection during the course of this numerical study the authors noted that the difference in the depth of fixity at lateral deflection varying between 20 mm and 37 mm depending on the diameter of the piles is negligible and can be ignored thus the tolerable lateral deflection here was taken 37 mm this case of loading was studied to simulate the response of an offshore pile to working applied loads beyond this deflection the soil surrounding the pile started to fail progressively and the depth of fixity became significantly affected by the nonlinearity of the pile cross section until the lateral deflection reached around 5 10 of the pile diameter at which point the pile cross section started to yield having said that the second lateral load magnitude was taken as the load corresponding to lateral deflection between 5 and 10 of the offshore pile diameter this load was studied to simulate the ultimate lateral load capacity of the pile pyke 1984 briaud 1984 and chen and lee 2010 the values of lfd and lfm were estimated from the analysis results for both lateral load levels in the first load level true plastic hinge was not developed however lfm was estimated for this case at an apparent plastic hinge located at the depth of the maximum moment lfd in both cases was estimated at the location of zero lateral deflection under the applied lateral load the variation in depth of lfd at both load values for all analyzed cases was found to be between 1 and 4 times the pile diameter depending on lu and the type of soil to ensure of full contribution of pile bending stiffness epip the numerical equations given in section 5 1 and 5 2 for cohesionless and cohesive soils were derived for lateral loads that cause lateral deformation below 37 mm with recommendation to use reduced bending stiffness such as degradation stiffness with applied lateral loads for higher deflections 5 1 cohesionless soils sand the variation of l1m t and l1d t with lu t for free and fixed head offshore piles embedded in sand are illustrated in fig 8 and fig 9 respectively l1m and l1d were calculated by adding the computed lfm and lfd to lu in each case the stiffness factor t used in the illustrations was calculated from eq 1 and values of ηh in the equation were computed from fig 5 based on the api sand model figs 8 and 9 show that l1d and l1m for the free and fixed head increase as lu increases and the difference between l1d t and l1m t for the same head condition is almost constant for all values of lu t with l1d is deeper than l1m alternatively l1m and l1d for free head and fixed head offshore piles installed in sand can be estimated from the following numerical formulation curve fitting equations with r2 0 99 as follows for free head pile in sand 10a l 1 m f r e e s a n d 0 009 l u 2 t 0 85 l u 1 15 t 10b l 1 d f r e e s a n d 0

sand l1m and l1d can be computed from eq 10a through 11b by substituting lu 0 0 5 2 cohesive soils clay similarly fig 10 and fig 11 display the variations of the l1m and l1d with lu for free head and fixed head offshore piles embedded in clay respectively the stiffness factor c shown in the figures was calculated from the following equation 12 c e p i p s u 4 where su is the average undrained shear strength of the clay layers along the embedment length of the offshore pile for highly variable su with depth the average undrained shear strength of the clay within depth equal l1d should be used as revealed in offshore pile in sand the difference between l1d c and l1m c at any lu c is almost constant for the same head condition but generally both increases by increasing the pile free length l1m and l1d for free head and fixed head offshore piles embedded in clayey soils can be also evaluated from the following eqs for free head pile in clay 13a l 1 m c f r e e c l a y 0 06 l u c 2 0 79 l u c 0 2 13b l 1 d c f r e e c l a y 0 055 l u c 2 0 8 l u c 0 4 for fixed head pile in clay 14a l 1 m c f i x e d c l a y 0 09 l u c 2 0 67 l u c 0 4 14b l 1 d c f i x e d c l a y 0 08 l u c 2 0 66 l u c 0 52 6 deflection and corresponding bending moment for offshore piles the prediction of the pile lateral capacity requires the assessment of its shaft rigidity there is no standard definition for shaft rigidity but several criteria can be used to judge the rigidity of the pile shaft typically piles characterized by aspect ratio l d less than 6 are rigid short while piles with aspect ratio larger than 20 are flexible long pile accordingly most offshore piles can be categorized as long piles except large diameter monopiles used as foundations in wind turbines the results of the analyses conducted in this paper were employed to create a closed form solution utilizing equivalent cantilever model to obtain the lateral capacity of a single flexible offshore pile embedded in either sand or clay the term closed form solution here implies that it is applicable to offshore flexible piles embedded in soil with either friction angle ϕ soil or undrained shear strength c soil the proposed closed form solution will provide conservative solution if applied to an offshore pile embedded in c ϕ soil because the user will need to ignore one of the two shear strength parameters also as the closed form solution is for flexible piles it may estimate unrealistic lateral response for large diameter offshore piles with l d less than 10 the fixed base of the equivalent cantilever shall be located at a depth equal l1d to estimate the lateral load corresponding to a given lateral deflection after determining the lateral load the fixed base of the cantilever will be placed at a depth equal to l1m to calculate the corresponding maximum bending moment as shown in fig 12 a and b for free and fixed pile head conditions at a tolerable lateral deflection δall the lateral capacity of the pile may be computed according to fig 12 by 15a p f r e e 3 δ a l l e p i p l 1 d 3 15b p f i x e d 12 δ a l l e p i p l 1 d 3 where pfree and pfixed are the lateral capacity of free and fixed head pile to produce lateral deflection equal δall and l1d is the unsupported equivalent length for deflection calculated from eqs 10b 11b and 13b or 14b depending on the type of soil and the pile head fixation the pile bending stiffness in eq 16a and b should be substituted depending on the magnitude of the applied lateral load the corresponding maximum bending moment can then be calculated from 16a m f r e e p f r e e l 1 m 16b m f i x e d p f i x e d l 1 m 2 where l1m is the unsupported equivalent length for moment calculated from eqs 10a 11a and 13a or 14a for offshore piles embedded in sand ϕ should be evaluated from appropriate field or laboratory tests the sand modulus of subgrade reaction is then obtained from fig 5 and stiffness factor t is calculated from eq 1 according to the pile head condition at the platform free or fixed l1m and l1d should be estimated from eq 10a through 11b for offshore piles embedded in clayey soils average su is computed along the effective length of the pile and the stiffness factor c is calculated from eq 12 based on the pile head condition free or fixed l1m and l1d should be estimated from eq 13a through 14b 7 comparison with field load test the main factor is selecting appropriate field test results to verify the current approach is the location of the recorded lateral deflection during the load test unfortunately the majority of lateral load test on offshore piles and partially embedded piles records the lateral deflection of the piles at the ground level and not at the pile head where the loads typically applied 7 1 driven piles in clay price and wardle 1981 reported the results of lateral load test conducted on steel pipe installed in clay at brent cross london united kingdom the tested pile was 0 406 m in diameter and 16 5 m in length the bending stiffness of the piles cross section was equal to 5 14 104 kn m2 the lateral load was applied to the pile head at 1 0 m above the existing ground surface in a free head condition the undrained shear strength of the clay at the pile test site varied from 44 kpa at the ground level to 80 5 kpa at depth of 6 2 m below ground surface with an average value of 55 kpa the teste pile was subjected to both static and cyclic loads on the head of the tested pile however price and wardle reported that static loads were of larger magnitude than cyclic loads and were applied in a reloading state after cycling has been done the assumption was made by the price and his co author that cyclic with smaller loads didn t not affect the subsequence static loads based on the pile bending stiffness and the given soil parameters the l1d and l1m of the tested pile were estimated equal to 3 02 m and 1 96 m respectively fig 13 compares the applied load and corresponding deflection at the pile head obtained from the pile load test results and the current approach it can be inferred from fig 13 that the current approach is in an agreement with the pile load test results until applied load of 60 kn as the applied load exceeded 60 kn the calculated response overestimated the soil stiffness and resistance this could be attributed to the fact that the pile was subjected to cyclic loading prior to applying the static loading as reported by price and wardle 1981 which would remold the clay and reduce its strength the current analysis was conducted using the original strength and stiffness of the clay and not the remolded values and hence the calculated response was stiffer than the experimental results in addition price and wardle 1981 stated in their article that non linear behavior of the pile cross section was observed during 100 kn static load test and the non linearity started at 60 kn however price and his co worker didn t report how much reduction can be applied to the pile epip the authors attempted to account for the anticipated remolding of the clay by reducing the undrained shear strength by 25 50 corresponding to applied loads between 60 kn and 100 kn the load displacement curve using the current approach utilizing the reduced strength was then added to the previous curves and shown in fig 14 it can be observed that the current approach shows more favorable agreement with the field load test when account for the low shear strength of the clay surrounding the tested pile the yield moment of the pile cross section was estimated at 301 kn m and the corresponding yield moment estimated from the current approach with reduced undried shear strength was found equal to 265 kn m furthermore the lateral pile deflection profile and bending moment profile with depth for the steel pile tested by price and wardle was estimated employing lpile software lpile 2006 and presented in fig 15 the pile head deflections computed by the software are in a good agreement with the deflections estimated using the current approach given in fig 14 at the same applied load 7 2 cast in place in clay stewart et al 2007 performed ﬁeld tests on a cast in place rc pile the diameter of the free head shaft was 0 61 m and the height aboveground was 4 06 m the pile shaft was embedded 7 63 m into a nature silty clay layer to ensure a long pile failure in the shaft the shaft was designed using concrete 27 5 mpa concrete and reinforced by 8 28 6 mm longitudinal bars the upper 15 m of soil at the site consisted of mostly silty clays interspersed with relatively thin layers of silty sands the undrained shear strength of the upper 8 m was determined from in situ cpt test and found to be equal approximately 190 kpa the pile was loaded in a two way cycle the pile was heavily instrumented with six different types of sensors to measure shear deformations actuator loads and displacement at pile head and ground surface stewart and his co workers presented the load head lateral deflection curve and provide an experimental moment curvature relationship derived from test data the pile bending stiffness was then back calculated from the experimental moment curvature relation and employed in estimating the lateral load and the moment in the current approach the back calculated epip from the moment curvature relationship was found to vary from 4 56e4 to 1 67e4 fig 16 and fig 17 compare the load head deflection and the moment curvature of the experiment and the current approach it should be noted that the moment curvature given in fig 17 is for the moment at the ground level and not the maximum moment both figures show a good agreement between the experimental data and the current approach even after first yield point however the current approach failed in estimating the lateral load and the corresponding bending moment at failure deflection more than 200 mm this might be attribute to the fact that the back calculated epip used in the analysis at this level is not representing the actual cross section of the pile at failure 7 3 cast in place piles in sand 23 price and wardle reported the results of lateral load tests on large diameter bored piles installed in sand in 1987 the results of the pile load test were given in the report issued by the transportation and road research laboratory old wokingham road crowthorne berkshire the tested piles are 1 5 m in diameter concrete piles and reinforced by 36 round bars 50 mm in diameter price and wardle 1987 reported that the ultimate bending moment at which a plastic hinge would occur was equal to 15 900 kn m at concrete strain of 0 003 in addition they estimated the anticipated load at yield from the instrumentation installed inside the pile to be equal 3500 kn and the corresponding yielding moment to be approximately 12100 kn m the epip of the pile cross section before loading was computed equal to 1 57 107 kn m2 price and wardle reported a reduction in the pile epip as the magnitude of the bending strain increased due to concrete cracking they back calculate the epip from the recorded instrumentation bending strain and found that epip decreased from 1 2 107 at load equal 400 kn to 5 106 at load equal 2000 kn the maximum lateral load applied during the lateral field test and the corresponding maximum moment calculated from the instrumentation bending strain were 2400 kn and 8800 kn m respectively the tested pile was installed in sand with friction angle vary from 37 to 43 at the upper 9 5 m with an average value of 40 based on that l1d and l1m were calculated at each load and corresponding reduced epip the load deflection of the lateral load test conducted by price and wardle 1987 and that estimated from the current approach are depicted in fig 18 the response obtained from the current approach is in a good agreement with the field test results after applying the reduced epip of the bored piles in estimating l1d and l1m the difference between the results from the current method and the pile load test results is less than or equal 10 table 4 summarizes the comparison between the maximum measured and yielding bending moment reported by price and wardle 1987 and those estimated from the current approach the estimated bending moment in the current approach was calculated using epip equal 5 106 kn m2 and 4 8 106 kn m2 for the maximum applied load of 2400 kn and the yielding load of 3500 kn respectively besides the lateral pile deflection and bending moment profile with depth for the 1 5 m concrete pile tested by price and wardle 1987 was computed employing lpile software lpile 2006 and presented in fig 19 also the pile head deflection calculated by the software are in fair agreement with the field and the current approach head deflections shown in fig 18 the lpile analysis underestimated the maximum bending moment in the pile cross section the agreement between the current approach and the results of the pile load test for reinforced concrete piles highlighted the importance of selecting the appropriate bending stiffness of the pile in estimating the lateral deflection the presented study cases also show that the current method can be extended to estimate the yielding moment of the pile cross section if the degradation in the pile bending stiffness with the applied moment is assessed 8 conclusions a new approach was presented here to estimate equivalent unsupported length for deflection and moment for laterally loaded offshore vertical piles offshore piles are considered partially embedded piles because the upper part of the pile will be surrounded by water and the lower part of the pile is embedded in soil deposit numerical investigations covering a wide range of offshore piles parameters were carried out employing the p y curves approach to model the nonlinearity of the soil to estimate l1d and l1m for offshore piles the results of the analysis provide numerical equations to estimate l1d and l1m for sand and clay soils in free and fixed pile head conditions a closed form solution suitable for flexible offshore piles based on the equivalent cantilever fixed base model was presented the solution employed the numerical results in determining l1d and l1m to estimate the lateral capacity of an offshore pile and the maximum bending moment at tolerable lateral deflection the closed form solution can be extended to estimate the yield capacity of the offshore piles if the degradation of the pile bending stiffness with the applied load magnitude is evaluated the current approach was verified with lateral pile load test results conducted on partially embedded piles in clay and sand the verification demonstrated a good agreement between the pile load test results and the current approach for both soil deposits in free head condition the verification process reveals that the new approach required precise evaluation of the pile bending stiffness therefore the variation of pile bending stiffness with the magnitude of the applied lateral loads should be assessed to select the appropriate corresponding bending stiffness credit

20702,the bypass hole lowers the traditional pig velocity and brings significant uneven pig velocity which rises the pigging stuck risks aiming to give the quick evaluations of the uneven pig motion this paper first proposed a transient steady state analytical model to describe the trend and the fluctuation range of the uneven pig velocity then developed the stoppage model to estimate the stoppage time as the result of inlet mass flow friction force and bypass character the accuracy of the analytical model was verified by the consistency between the model calculated velocity experimental data and the simulated velocity trend and the stoppage model was verified by the simulated velocity trends on considering the gas compressibility effect and the variation in friction profile this paper studied the occurrence of pig stoppage and the extent of slippage with the designed abnormal friction section in simulation procedure the variation in friction aggravates the slippage and stimulates the occurrence of stoppage the positive friction deviation is largely responsible for the sudden deceleration and then stoppage while the gas compressibility is primarily responsible for the occasional stoppage after the pig acceleration deceleration procedure when the pig travels into the lower friction region keywords transient model slippage stoppage pigging simulation gas pipeline 1 introduction in ocean gas and oil engineering natural gas is more likely to be liquefied by the high deepwater pressure and sophisticated seabed terrain the accumulation of the liquid condensate raises in the friction factor and hence results in a higher pressure drop between the start and the end of the pipe the fact that pressure at the pipe end is usually fixed at the offshore platform indicates that a higher pressure drop results in a higher pipe inlet pressure which lowers gas production talaie and deilamani 2014 lim et al 2015 periodic pigging ensures a small amount of condensate in the pipe and hence promotes the pipe s working efficiency the pig in the ocean piping industry is usually a cylinder containing several parts the bypass pig is a cylindrical pig with a bypass hole in the center axis in most cases the major difference between traditional pigs and bypass pigs is the relative motion of the gas and the pig traditional pigs have a fine sealing effect that makes the velocity of the pig equal to that of the propellant gas in bypass pigs the bypass hole ensures gas exchange between the two sides of the pig and therefore there is relative motion between the pig and the driven gas the gas velocity in the pipe is usually designed to be 10 20 m s which forces traditional pigs to run at such a high value however the relative velocity between bypass pigs and the driven gas enable them run at a lower speed and results in a better cleaning effect norris and rydahl 2003 waltrich et al 2015 however the different mechanisms of pig motion with and without a bypass are still unclear in both theory and practice different mechanisms lead to various methods in transient pig tracing and bypass design in early research mcdonald and baker 1964 proposed a steady state pigging model in a gas liquid pipeline which provided the application of steady state calculation and the basis of the pig designing calculation in experiment and engineering barua 1982 improved the accuracy of empirical equations based on numerous experiments in mcdonald calculation nieckele et al 2001 were early researchers who introduced the bypass hole to the pig they used the correlation between the pressure drop over the pig and the gas velocity in bypass hole to study pig motion on the basis of the gas steady state flow wu and wan 2005 also studied the bypass effect on the pigging slug based on the steady state analysis their studies show the main advantages of the steady state analysis are the quick acquisition of the pigging characteristics and the simplification in pig designing procedure rahe 2006 zhu et al 2014 however the steady state analytical results were unable to show the detailed variations in pig velocity trend especially pigging slippage on account of the variations of both the pressure fields and gas velocity fields in the pigging procedure appropriate mathematical pigging model and suitable numerical method are the necessities to study the transient pigging details kohda et al 1987 proposed the early transient pigging simulation referred to the drift flow codes with the method of characteristics moc scoggins 1977 and the application of additional nodes to trace the traditional pig motion in gas liquid pipeline nguyen et al 2001a 2001b simplified the kohda moc solution procedure and verified the feasibility of their solution in describing the bypass pig motion in compressible gas pipeline the numerical solution indicated the velocity fluctuation of bypass pig and non bypass pig but they did not give any correlation to describe the uneven pig motion esmaeilzadeh et al 2006 2009 extended the nguyen et al s study to the motion of conventional pigs without a bypass in gas and liquid pipelines and the findings of botros and golshan 2010 also verified the accuracy and applicability of this solution the application of moc with fine time steps is able to describe the uneven pig motion while the uneven pigging slippage have not been investigated in their papers besides patricio et al 2020 showed the application of another explicit method flux corrected transport method fct in the one phase pipe pigging simulation and the accuracy of fct was validated the accuracy with two fluid model by figueiredo et al 2017 no obvious uneven appeared in their pig velocity trend and olga result to the implicit method minami et al 1991 1996 proposed a semi implicit numerical solution for the pigging procedure with the steady state gas assumption and no fluctuations appeared in their pig velocity trends jamshidi et al 2016 modified the pressure drop calculation of the pigging slug in minami s work and no pig velocity floatation appeared either the impact of gas compressibility should take the response for the uneven pig motion which was theoretically analyzed as the non classical riemann problem by simone and felipe 2012 although many researchers attempted to explore the pigging kinetic motion researchers have not been successful in the uneven pig motion description let alone the complicated quantified friction effects due to the multi effects of friction and gas compressibility and the lack of real time pig velocity testing technology in the current study a transient steady state analytical model is proposed that can predict the pig velocity and reveal the range of velocity fluctuations and a stoppage model is used to evaluate the stoppage time during the early pigging stage which gives the quick evaluation of the uneven pig motion and the initial stoppage both experimental data and simulation results were used to validate the accuracy and applicability of the models this paper also illustrates the friction effect on the extent of the pigging slippage and the occurrence of the stoppage based on simulation results the different scales of the friction deviation in different lengths were adopted to study the friction effect which validated the application of simulation in bypass pigging 2 research methodology a transient pigging model contains a transient pig kinetic model and transient fluid flow in a single phase pipeline the combination of the flow and the pig motion describes the impact of the pig motion on the fluid and the driving effect of the fluid on the pig the interactive effect leads to difficulty in obtaining the pig velocity in this section an analytical model is proposed that indicates the variation of the friction causes no slippage and stoppage the model demonstrates that gas compressibility is the key factor influencing the extent of pigging slippage and the occurrence of stoppage moreover a stoppage evaluation model is proposed to estimate the time of stoppage during the early pigging stage experimental and numerical treatments are also illustrated to study the bypass pigging process 2 1 transient analytical model of pig velocity the pipe is mostly regarded as a one dimensional model when studying the pigging performance in a long pipe the bypass hole ensures mass exchange between the two sides of the pig the combination of the gas through the bypass and the pressure at the pig head and pig tail forms the relation between the gas flow and the bypass pig motion the forces acting on the pig are shown in fig 1 the pig runs in a force balance state obeying newton s second law 1 m p i g a p i g δ p a a h m p i g g sin θ f f f τ where m pig is the mass of the pig and a pig is the acceleration of the pig δp indicates the pressure difference between the pig tail and pig head which is formulated as δp p tail p head a and a h are the areas of the inner pipe cross section and the bypass hole respectively g is the acceleration of gravity which was measured to be 9 81 m s2 and θ is the angle of incline at the given point the term f f indicates the friction force between the pig and the pipe which can be calculated using the correlation between the contact force and friction factor where the contact force is suggested by the shigley shrink fit correlation shigley et al 2005 in this study the friction force was tested as 193 02 n by using a winch the average value of the four friction forces by pulling the pig moving at the constant velocities of 0 1 m s 0 2 m s 0 5 m s and 1 0 m s due to the test pipe section and the ability of the winch which may result in less error in model calculation and numerical results the term f τ indicates the propelling force generated by the shear force of the bypass gas which is the product of the shear stress and inner area of the bypass hole f τ τ h π d h l p i g the shear stress can be calculated by the velocity difference between the pig and the bypass gas 2 τ h 1 2 f h ρ g b y v g b y v p i g v g b y v p i g where f h ρ g by v g by and v pig are the wall friction factor of the bypass hole the bypass gas density the absolute velocity of the bypass gas and the velocity of the pig respectively the steady state assumption was adopted to simplify the gas flowing in the bypass hole which indicates that the gas masses at the pig tail the bypass hole and the pig head have the same value the wall hole friction factor f h can be obtained by using the strategy proposed by bendiksen et al 1991 which couples the friction factors for laminar and turbulent flows proposed by moody 1947 3 f h max 16 re h 0 001375 1 2 10 4 ε h d h 10 4 re h 3 where re h ε h and d h are the reynolds number of the bypass flow the bypass hole roughness and the diameter of the hole respectively the pressure drop δp also provides the propellant that drives the gas flow through the bypass hole hence the pressure drop can be obtained from the bypass gas flow as follows 4 δ p 1 2 κ p i g ρ g b y v g b y v p i g v g b y v p i g where κ pig is the pressure loss coefficient over the pig this coefficient is usually separated into three parts the sudden constriction loss coefficient κ c the straight bypass coefficient κ f and the sudden expansion loss coefficient κ e the empirical equations in the handbook of idelchik 1986 are suggested to calculate the three factors supposing that 5 k p i g κ p i g ρ g b y a 1 φ 2 φ 2 sgn v g b y v p i g by considering the relative motion of the gas and the pig and conservation of mass the pig pressure drop equation eq 4 can then be written as 6 δ p a 1 φ k p i g v g p i g v p i g 2 where v g pig is the superficial gas velocity at the pig position donate f pig as the sum of the forces acting on the pig except the pressure force that is 7 f p i g m p i g g sin θ f f f τ in view of eq 6 eq 1 can be simplified as 8 m p i g a p i g k p i g v g p i g v p i g 2 f p i g in the pig design process the pig is usually considered as undergoing steady motion with a constant steady gas flow that is the pig design velocity is the pig velocity with no acceleration in eq 8 therefore 9 v p i g d e s i g n v g p i g f p i g k p i g the pig velocity can be formulated as follows 10 v p i g v p i g 0 t 0 t a p i g d t where v pig0 is the velocity of the pig at t 0 equations 8 and 10 show the variation of the pig motion in most cases the parameter k pig is primarily related to the bypass rate and the gas density at the pig when the time interval is small the terms k pig and f pig can be regarded as fixed values the analytical solution of the pig motion model can be obtained with the fixed terms as 11 v p i g v p i g d e s i g n 2 v g p i g v p i g d e s i g n c exp t τ 1 12 a p i g 2 v g p i g v p i g d e s i g n c exp t τ τ c exp t τ 1 2 where 13 c 1 2 v g p i g v p i g d e s i g n v p i g d e s i g n v p i g 0 a n d τ m p i g 2 v g p i g v p i g d e s i g n k p i g the term c indicates the proximity of the real pig velocity to the designed velocity when the pig velocity greatly differs from the designed value c will reach quite a small value resulting in a greater acceleration and a rapid change in pig velocity the term τ indicates the rate of velocity variation with time which is more likely the time constant of the velocity variation compared with the initial velocity variation the variation is negligible when the time reaches 5τ if the gas density is assumed to be constant or an incompressible liquid is adopted there is no variation in the density profile greatly simplifying the pigging process the velocities of the fluid at any place have the same superficial velocity which indicates the superficial gas velocity at the pig position v g pig is constant as pig moving when a constant flow at the pipe inlet is adopted and the variation of the friction force changes the value of f pig in eq 9 which lead the variation in the designed pig velocity v g pig this variation results new values of c and τ eq 13 which lead different velocity trends by using eq 11 the pig usually starts at a velocity of zero when the pigging starts the impacts of different c values and τ values on the pig velocity trends eq 11 resulted from different constant frictions with a fixed bypass structure and local gas velocity are shown in fig 2 a and b and the impact of the friction variation at 5τ 0 is shown in fig 2 c in fig 2 a the pig velocity trends verify that the constant factor c is mainly responsible for the uneven variation change of the pig velocity trends and that the smaller value of c results in a more intensive variation with a larger curvature the variation in c has a minor impact on the stabilization time of 5τ the change in the time constant only indicates the affine transform of the velocity trends in the time direction that is no pig slippage or stoppage would appear in the pigging process when the friction force is constant under the assumption of gas incompressibility in addition the variations that the pig moves from a gradually stabilized into another similar state with different values of c τ and v pigdesign after 5τ 0 see fig 2 c are resulted from the sudden change of friction the gradual smooth variations of the pig velocity in fig 2 c show no slippage or stoppage when the friction force changed the opposite phenomenon of no slippage and stoppage in fig 2 c and the slippage in the field experiment indicates the significant impact of gas compressibility in pigging slippage and stoppage the analytical solution eq 11 12 and 13 is able to describe the pig kinetic motion in pigging however the variation of the pressure profile in pigging leads to the changes in ρ gby and then the change of k pig eq 5 v pigdesign eq 9 c and τ eq 13 in turn when the incompressible gas is adopted the transient multi effect makes it hard to directly describe the uneven pig motion with given inlet flow at the pipe entrance in reality the pig usually moves at an uneven velocity which is sometimes higher and sometimes lower than the designed velocity in a compressible gas pipeline the fluctuations gradually become smoother with time according to this kinetic properties the steady state velocity trend with the fixed values c and τ generated from the pig steady state motion and the estimations of maximum and minimum are proposed to describe the transient pig motion in the pipe the perdition model of maximum and the minimum velocities of the pig as it moves in the constant friction section are 14 v p i g m i n v p i g d e s i g n a b s v p i g v p i g d e s i g n k v f i t t 1 a n d v p i g m a x v p i g d e s i g n a b s v p i g v p i g d e s i g n k v f i t t 1 where k v fit is the factor used to evaluate the inertia of the pig velocity in the pigging process which is suggested to be fit by the experimental data or simulation results when time equals zero the maximum and minimum of the predicted pig velocity are v pig0 and 2v pigdesign v pig0 this model implies that the amplitude of the velocity trend is gradually smoothed by time and that the maximum amplitude of the pig velocity trend is abs v pigdesign v pig0 the analytical pig velocity equation eq 11 with steady state variables and the maximum velocity and minimum velocity equations eq 14 indicate that three lines enclose an area that tightly surrounds the pig velocity trend as the pig moves these equations eq 11 and eq 14 comprise the so called transient steady state analytical model of pig velocity which is verified in the next section 2 2 pigging stoppage model the pig usually stops during the very early stage of the pigging process the stoppage of the pig is likely the result of the combined effect of the friction force bypass rate and mass flow in a fixed pipeline the stoppage of the pig may be weakened by a high mass flow of gas a low friction force or a small bypass rate which is summarized by the experiments and numerical results the stoppage model with three correlations in a similar form was proposed to illustrate the effect of the mass flow rate the friction force and the bypass rate on the stoppage the relation between the stoppage time and the mass flow rate is given as the following form 15 δ t s t o p k q f i t q m a s s q m a s s s t u c k where δt stop is the stoppage time q mass is the mass flow rate of the gas k q fit is the variation factor generated from the experiments or simulation and q mass stuck is the minimum mass flow respectively the value of q mass stuck implies that the friction force is equal to the fluid driving force allowing the pig with a fixed bypass rate to run at a velocity close to zero and according to this equation the stoppage time δt stop is infinite when the mass flow decreases to q mass stuck and is nearly zero with an extensively high q mass value q mass stuck can be calculated by using the force balance of the pig kinetic motion with a minimum pig velocity of zero eq 1 the relation between the stoppage time and the friction force at a fixed inlet mass flow is given as follows 16 δ t s t o p k f f i t f f s t u c k k f f i t f f f f s t u c k where f f stuck is the maximum friction force at which the mass flow can keep the pig moving and k f tit is a fixed parameter that indicates the variation trend between stoppage and friction this model indicates that the stuck time equals zero when the friction force is zero and equals infinity when the friction reaches near f f stuck f f stuck can also be calculated by using the pig kinetic equation with zero pig velocity the correlation between the stoppage time and the bypass rate has a similar reciprocal relationship 17 δ t s t o p k ρ κ φ f i t ρ g b y κ pig φ 2 ρ g b y κ pig φ 2 min δ t s t o p min where ρ g by κ pig φ 2 min is the minimum value of ρ g by κ pig φ 2 which is nearly zero when φ equals 1 k ρκφ fit is a fixed parameter fitted by experiment or simulation and δt stop min is the minimum stoppage time when the bypass rate equals zero the factor ρ g by κ pig φ 2 is the independent variable in this equation representing the combined effects of the bypass rate φ and the pressure loss coefficient κ pig these three equations provide the stoppage times for different cases only one desired parameter should be investigated by experiment and simulation in eqs 15 and 16 and the two desired variables in eq 17 imply that at least two known pigging processes with different bypass rates can describe the variation of bypass rate and pigging stoppage time the accuracy and applicability of the equations should be investigated by simulations or experiments as detailed in the following section 2 3 transient pigging simulation the pigging model comprises a fluid model that describes the flow variation in the pipe and a pig model that accounts for the pig movement mechanism appropriate numerical method and discretized scheme can be used to obtain the numerical results base on the mathematical model the fluid model based on conservation of mass and momentum at a given fluid temperature was adopted in the simulation the simulation is proposed on the basis of moving grid and finite element method fem the moving grid keeps the pig head and pig tail fixed on the discretized nodes when the pig travels this method reduces interpolation errors in the fixed grid when obtaining the flow parameters at the head and tail of the pig in the fem implicit discretization procedure parabolic three node isoparametric elements were used to discretize the velocity field and linear two node elements were adopted to describe the pressure field comini and del giudice 1985 the pipe was divided into two sections by the bypass pig the upstream section from the pipe inlet to the pig tail and the downstream section from the pig head to the pipe outlet both sections were filled with gas and connected by the bypass flow through the pig the steady state flow in the pipe was adopted as the initial condition and the constant gas mass flow at the pipe inlet and the outlet local atmospheric pressure were adopted as the boundary conditions the numerical pipe have the same diameter inner wall roughness and length with the experiments and the experimental pipe is introduced in the next part 2 4 experimental study the experimental system consisted of a transparent horizontal pipe through which one can observe the uneven motion of the pig along the pipe the observation section was made of plexiglass with an inner diameter of 64 0 mm and a total length of 15 026 m a polyvinyl chloride section was used to connect the pig launcher to the vortex flowmeter compressible dry gas was adopted as the working fluid in the experiments nine pressure sensors with satisfactory accuracy and high response sensitivity keller pr25y were placed to record the pressure trends at the designated positions of the visible pipe the high speed camera was placed to observe the pigging slippage and stoppage with the monitoring pipe length of 2 0 m the camera can be moved to different point to record the pig kinetic motion with different inlet flow rate the experimental system and the physical map are shown in figs 3 and 4 respectively the bypass pig containing several parts is shown in fig 5 the cooperation of different parts makes the bypass pig stand upright when it travels along the pipe the replaceable bypass nozzle ensures quick substitution of the bypass hole 3 results and discussion in this section the results of the transient analytical model and stoppage evaluation model will be compared with experimental and simulation results in the first subsection the accuracy and applicability of the pigging simulation and the reliability of the experiments are verified in the second subsection the analytical model which describes the pig velocity variation and the maximum and minimum evaluations of pig velocity is verified the third subsection presents the characteristics of the pigging stoppage and verifies the feasibility of the stoppage model which can be used to evaluate the extent of pigging stoppage during the early pigging stage the fourth subsection illustrates the combined effect of friction and gas compressibility in pig slippage and stoppage which results in uneven pig velocity and sometimes stopping and starting motion 3 1 pressure variation along the pipe the gas flow at the inlet was 0 0643 0 002 kg s and the outlet was at atmospheric pressure the experimental pressure variations and the numerical results caused by the pig at a 4 bypass rate are shown in fig 6 the time of the sudden increase in pressure trends indicates when the pig goes through different pressure sensors the increased amount of the pressure trends corresponded the different pressures at the pig tail and pig head low pressure at pig head and high pressure at pig tail and this pressure difference propelled the pig against the friction force between the pig and the pipe the variations in the numerical pressure profiles fit well with the experimental data however fluctuations in the experimental trends were different from the gradual smooth trends in the numerical results primarily because of the uneven experimental friction profile moreover the numerical trends indicated a slightly later arrival of the pig at different pressure sensors the experimental pigging time was 4 936 s and the numerical pigging time was 4 316 s the notable high pressure experimental trends after 4 1 s indicate a higher pressure drop placed on the pig which may have resulted from locally high friction and hence the sudden decrease in pig velocity generated from the larger friction causes the incensement in experimental pigging time 3 2 characteristics of pig motion and validation of the transient analytical model the bypass pig is more likely to move at a nonconstant velocity in the field experiments and in the indoor experiment the analytical pig velocity equation eq 11 and the velocity trends in fig 2 theoretically imply the variation of friction force results in the gradual variation in pig velocity with no fluctuations with the gas density assumption while the high speed video camera recorded the velocity fluctuations and restart after the stoppage of the pig in the certain area hence the uneven pig motion is affected by the friction profile together with the gas compressibility the pig velocity superficial gas velocity and pressure drop in the pig kinetic equation eq 1 are difficult to measure experimentally given the coherence of the pressure trends in fig 6 which verified the feasibility and applicability of the numerical model the numerical results were mainly used to verify the transient analytical model of the pig velocity resulting from difficulties in measuring the pig velocity trends in the experiments the simulated pressure drop superficial gas velocity and pig velocity are shown in fig 7 a and the performance of the analytical pig velocity eq 11 and eq 14 is shown in fig 7 b in fig 7 a one can see that the pig stopped at the very early stage during the pigging process when the pig starts to move the pressure drop over the pig overcomes the friction force between the pig and the pipe at this point the pig begins to move and then the pressure drop over the pig fluctuates near the value of this point the unstable pressure drop over the pig may result from the instantaneous gas velocity field and gas density field near the pig which interact with the pig velocity and pressure field the amplitudes of the pressure drop trend gas velocity trend and pig velocity trend gradually became smoother with time when the pressure drop is higher than the designed value enabling the friction force to be overcome the pig is in an accelerating state leading to higher superficial gas velocity at the pig when the pressure drop is lower than the designed value the pig and the gas near the pig were in a decelerating state the reciprocating fluctuation of damping in the three trends indicate that the unsteady pig motion was gradually smoothed as the pig moved the red pink and blue lines in fig 7 b show respectively the pig velocity and the maximum and minimum velocity estimations of the transient analytical model eq 11 and eq 14 with k v fit 1 1811 the numerical velocity trend is tightly bounded by the maximum and minimum estimations which indicates the good applicability of the steady state analysis model the average pig velocity is also a crucial factor in evaluating the pigging process the average pig velocity is the total pigging length divided by the total length which can be easily obtained from experimental and simulation results the transient analytical model only provided the pig velocity under the steady state assumption which may be different from the average velocity found in the experiment and simulation the average velocities at different bypass rates and different flow rates in the experiments simulations and models are shown in fig 8 the numerical average pig velocity is slightly lower than that of the steady values from transient velocity model ignoring the stoppage time calculation during the early pigging process is mainly responsible for the higher steady state velocity of the analytical model the close trends among the experimental data numerical results and model verifies the application of the transient analytical model and the simulation at the same time the uneven friction force between the pig and the pipe in the experiment may be responsible for the slightly uneven increase in the six experimental trends in fig 8 3 3 characteristics of pig stoppage and stoppage model validation the early stage stoppage of the pig in the pigging process is mostly related to the inlet mass flow the friction force and the pipe and the bypass rate of the pig in a certain pipeline the simulation results were adopted to verify the pigging stoppage model because of their good performance in terms of the details of the variation of the desired variables the trends of pig velocity the superficial gas velocity at the pig and the pressure drop over the pig and validation of the stoppage model of mass flow eq 15 with a friction force of 193 02 n and a bypass rate of 4 are shown in fig 9 the velocity trends in fig 9 a illustrate that the increasing mass flow resulted in an increase in the pig velocity and an increasing amplitude of the fluctuations the pigging time was decreased by a higher pig velocity the nodes of the superficial gas velocities in different flows when the pig starts to move lie at a fixed value see fig 9 b at this time the pressure drop over the pig overcame the friction force as shown in fig 9 c in addition the pigging stoppage time is increased by the greater amount of propellant carried by the higher flow rate this demonstrates that different mass flows provided the same pressure propellant which keeps the pig running near the designed value and that the pigging stoppage is more likely weakened by a higher mass flow rate validation of the stoppage model of mass flow eq 15 with k q fit 0 0135 and q mass stuck 0 0361 is shown in fig 9 d fig 10 shows the simulated variations in the pig velocity superficial gas velocity and pressure drop and the validation of the stoppage model of the friction force eq 16 with a bypass rate of 4 when the inlet mass flow of the compressible gas is a constant value of 0 0643 kg s when the friction increases the pig velocity and amplitude of the fluctuation decrease both the stoppage time and pigging time increased with the lower pig velocity the nodes of the gas velocity in fig 10 b and the pressure drop curves in fig 10 c denote the times when the pig starts to move these nodes indicate that the higher friction force causes a higher pressure drop that can balance the friction and hence this results in a higher superficial gas velocity which can provide a higher pressure drop according to eq 4 the increasing trends of pressure drop over the pig are the same in fig 10 c demonstrating that the constant flow and the fixed pig structures provide a constant pressure increasing trend the stoppage model of the friction force eq 16 with k f tit 321 76 and f f stuck 458 10 n shows good accuracy in fig 10 d which indicates the applicability of the model the bypass rate mainly influences the driving force δpa 1 φ and the pressure loss coefficient κ pig when the pig starts to move the pressure driving forces δpa 1 φ of different bypass rates are the same which indicates a lower pressure drop over the pig when the bypass rate increases fig 11 shows the trends of velocity and superficial gas velocity at the pig and a validation of the stoppage model of bypass eq 17 a pig velocity trends of different bypass rates b superficial gas velocity trends of different bypass rates c validation of the stoppage model of the bypass in fig 11 a one can see that the pig velocity is primarily weakened by a higher bypass rate which ensures a greater gas exchange between the two sides of the pig the higher capacity of gas exchange through a higher bypass rate with a given constant inlet flow results in a higher start value of the superficial gas velocity when the pig starts to move in the validation of the stoppage model of the bypass rate eq 17 the stoppage time reaches its minimum value of 0 228 s when the bypass rate is zero the model with k ρκφ fit 212 8 fits well with the simulation results 3 4 study of pig slippage and stoppage the previous subsection indicates that fluctuations of uneven pig velocity are mostly weakened as the pig continues to move through the pipe and that pig stoppage occurs at the very early stage in the pigging process under constant friction gas compressibility and friction are the major factors that influence the performance of pig slippage and stoppage gas compressibility mainly affects the transition of the pig motion when the pig moves in an unbalanced state friction may influence the major variations in pig kinetic characteristics consequently friction is mainly investigated to study its impact on pig motion an inlet mass flow of 0 0643 kg s and a bypass rate of 4 were used to study the impact of friction on pig slippage pipes with upstream normal friction forces of 193 02 n and downstream friction forces of 77 208 115 81 154 42 173 72 213 32 231 62 270 23 and 308 83 n which were 10 20 40 and 60 higher and lower than the upstream section were adopted to show the impact of friction variation on the pig motion the upstream section and downstream section are the same length of half pipe the trends of pig velocity superficial gas velocity and pressure drop over the pig with a bypass rate of 4 and flow rate of 0 0643 kg s are shown in fig 12 the trends of pig velocity superficial gas velocity at the pig and the pressure drop over the pig were the same before 2 358 s with the same friction force of 193 02 n when the pig travels into the downstream section of the pipe with abnormal friction the higher downstream friction causes pig stoppage the pigging kinetic parameters after the pig restarts have similar variations and fluctuations as in fig 10 e g the fluctuations of pig velocity in fig 12 b and superficial gas velocity in fig 12 d and the balance between the pressure drop and friction in fig 12 f in this case the stoppage of the pig mainly results from the sudden deceleration in the abnormally higher friction section of pipe and the slippage after the restart is mostly similar to that observed in the pigging start stage the stoppage time has a positive correlation with the sudden variation in friction when the abnormal friction is lower than the upstream value the sudden deceased friction causes a high acceleration in the pig velocity the sudden increase in velocity may be far greater than the designed velocity in the downstream section the great difference between the current pig velocity and the designed velocity results in an abrupt fluctuation with a large amplitude when the amplitude is not large enough to shake the pig velocity to zero the pig suddenly travels with a velocity with a higher fluctuation see the red line of 173 72 n in fig 12 a moreover the fluctuation with the lower abrupt friction may be large enough to shake the pig velocity to zero e g see the blue lines of 154 42 n in fig 12 a 12 c and 12 e pigging stoppage occurs because gas compressibility causes fluctuations and the restart process has characteristics of the start process of the pigging start with constant friction the pink and green lines with friction of 77 208 and 115 81 n respectively in fig 12 show no stoppage of the pig quite large fluctuations in pig velocity and the inadequate abrupt pipe length are the reason for the disappearance of the stoppage and restart stage an abrupt friction force in the upstream half section with a bypass rate of 4 and flow rate of 0 0643 kg s was also investigated to verify the occurrence of slippage and stoppage of friction variation as is shown in fig 13 the abrupt impacts of low friction in the upstream section of pipe are illustrated in fig 13 a c and 13 e which are the case when the pig travels from low abnormal frictions into high friction the variations in the pig velocity and superficial gas velocity are quite similar to those shown in fig 12 b and d stoppage does not occur when the pig travels from the low friction of 173 72 n to the high friction of 193 02 n this demonstrates that the extent of the friction difference determines the occurrence of pig stoppage when it travels from a section of low friction to one of high friction the variations in the pressure drops in fig 13 e show the gradual balance between the pressure propellant and friction when friction changes fig 13 b shows the absence of a stoppage with small velocity fluctuations resulting from a small decrease in friction pink line of 115 81 n moreover the appearance of pig stoppage in the blue line of 154 42 n and red line of 175 72 n is caused by the large velocity fluctuations resulting from the large friction reduction and disappearance of pig stoppage green line of 77 208 n mainly resulting from the insufficient downstream length the trends in fig 13 are quite similar to those in fig 12 the occurrence of pig stoppage is mainly related to the extent of the friction difference the phenomenon in which the velocity is usually decreased by the sudden higher friction is the primary response for the stoppage of a pig traveling from low to high friction sections however the large fluctuations of the sudden acceleration of the pig caused by gas compressibility forces the velocity to reduce to zero which signifies the stoppage of pig when it travels from high to low friction regions the pig stoppage is more likely to provide a quick change in pressure drop to balance the friction force the occurrence of the stoppage and the extent of slippage may also be influenced by the length of the abnormal friction section different abnormal friction values starting from the midpoint of the pigging pipe with lengths of 2 0 m and 4 0 m and half the pipe length were adopted to investigate the characteristics of slippage and stoppage the trends of pig velocity and pressure drop over the pig with a bypass rate of 4 and a flow rate of 0 0643 kg s are illustrated in fig 14 the velocity trends before 2 358 s overlapped in the same line in fig 14 a and b as did the pressure drop trends in fig 14 c and d the trends of pig velocity and pressure drop of abnormal lengths of 2 0 and 4 0 m have two group turning points the first is at the time when the pig travels into the abnormal friction section that has the same frictional character of the half pipe full lines in fig 14 the second is at the time when the pig travels into the normal friction section which may result in pig stoppage e g the additional two pig stoppages seen in the green and pink lines in fig 14 a and additional stoppage in the green pink and red lines in fig 14 b even an abnormal friction section with a small length may result in serious slippage and additional stoppage consequently numerical simulation of pipes with known pigging conditions is needed to evaluate transient pigging performance in the natural gas industry 4 conclusions the purpose of this study is to give the quick calculation to describe the uneven pig motion with stoppage in engineering and show the friction effect in pigging slippage and stoppage in compressible gas pipeline aiming at the quick calculation of the pig motion characteristics this paper proposed a transient steady state analytical model which shows the main trend of the pig velocity and the estimation of the velocity fluctuation range the accuracy of the analytical model was verified by the good coincidence of average pig velocities in simulations experiments and models meanwhile the pigging velocity was tightly surrounded by the maximum and minimum estimations from the model with only one parameter fitted by the velocity curve this paper then provides the pigging stoppage model formed by three equations which shows the relations between the stoppage time and inlet mass flow friction force and bypass character for the early state stoppage estimation the stoppage model fit fine with the numerical stoppage both the analytical model and the numerical results show the gradually smoothed pig velocity and no stoppage after the pig starts to move with the application of incompressible fluid and friction variation which is different from the unsmoothed pig motion with sometimes stoppage in experiments the friction is slightly uneven in the experimental pipe hence this paper illustrates the occurrence of pig stoppage and the extent of slippage with the abnormal friction of a certain length in simulation the slippage extent mainly relies on the friction difference of the abnormal section and the stoppage occurs when the pig travels in the abnormal region once the friction difference reaches certain deviation no matter higher or lower than the upstream region friction variation is mainly responsible for the sudden deceleration and then stoppage when the pig travels into the higher friction region and gas compressibility is primarily responsible for the stoppage after the acceleration deceleration of the pig when it travels into the lower friction region moreover two friction variation points that one certain abnormal friction area brings result in several stoppages which may correspond to the move stop restart pig motion in experiments future investigations are necessary to study the friction model and friction testing technology the friction force is influenced by the shrink fit between the pig disks and the pipe wall the worn factor of the pig disks the character of pipe the inner diameter the inner wall roughness and the pig velocity the lack of the theoretical friction model and the testing technology in obtaining the accurate real time friction profile leads to the imprecise friction adopted in models and simulation the error in the friction may result in the not entirely accurate calculation results hence the friction model and the friction measuring technology are essential to be investigated and then the friction effect on the pigging slippage and stoppage can be investigated in depth credit authorship contribution statement xiaowei li conceptualization methodology formal analysis software data curation visualization

20702,the bypass hole lowers the traditional pig velocity and brings significant uneven pig velocity which rises the pigging stuck risks aiming to give the quick evaluations of the uneven pig motion this paper first proposed a transient steady state analytical model to describe the trend and the fluctuation range of the uneven pig velocity then developed the stoppage model to estimate the stoppage time as the result of inlet mass flow friction force and bypass character the accuracy of the analytical model was verified by the consistency between the model calculated velocity experimental data and the simulated velocity trend and the stoppage model was verified by the simulated velocity trends on considering the gas compressibility effect and the variation in friction profile this paper studied the occurrence of pig stoppage and the extent of slippage with the designed abnormal friction section in simulation procedure the variation in friction aggravates the slippage and stimulates the occurrence of stoppage the positive friction deviation is largely responsible for the sudden deceleration and then stoppage while the gas compressibility is primarily responsible for the occasional stoppage after the pig acceleration deceleration procedure when the pig travels into the lower friction region keywords transient model slippage stoppage pigging simulation gas pipeline 1 introduction in ocean gas and oil engineering natural gas is more likely to be liquefied by the high deepwater pressure and sophisticated seabed terrain the accumulation of the liquid condensate raises in the friction factor and hence results in a higher pressure drop between the start and the end of the pipe the fact that pressure at the pipe end is usually fixed at the offshore platform indicates that a higher pressure drop results in a higher pipe inlet pressure which lowers gas production talaie and deilamani 2014 lim et al 2015 periodic pigging ensures a small amount of condensate in the pipe and hence promotes the pipe s working efficiency the pig in the ocean piping industry is usually a cylinder containing several parts the bypass pig is a cylindrical pig with a bypass hole in the center axis in most cases the major difference between traditional pigs and bypass pigs is the relative motion of the gas and the pig traditional pigs have a fine sealing effect that makes the velocity of the pig equal to that of the propellant gas in bypass pigs the bypass hole ensures gas exchange between the two sides of the pig and therefore there is relative motion between the pig and the driven gas the gas velocity in the pipe is usually designed to be 10 20 m s which forces traditional pigs to run at such a high value however the relative velocity between bypass pigs and the driven gas enable them run at a lower speed and results in a better cleaning effect norris and rydahl 2003 waltrich et al 2015 however the different mechanisms of pig motion with and without a bypass are still unclear in both theory and practice different mechanisms lead to various methods in transient pig tracing and bypass design in early research mcdonald and baker 1964 proposed a steady state pigging model in a gas liquid pipeline which provided the application of steady state calculation and the basis of the pig designing calculation in experiment and engineering barua 1982 improved the accuracy of empirical equations based on numerous experiments in mcdonald calculation nieckele et al 2001 were early researchers who introduced the bypass hole to the pig they used the correlation between the pressure drop over the pig and the gas velocity in bypass hole to study pig motion on the basis of the gas steady state flow wu and wan 2005 also studied the bypass effect on the pigging slug based on the steady state analysis their studies show the main advantages of the steady state analysis are the quick acquisition of the pigging characteristics and the simplification in pig designing procedure rahe 2006 zhu et al 2014 however the steady state analytical results were unable to show the detailed variations in pig velocity trend especially pigging slippage on account of the variations of both the pressure fields and gas velocity fields in the pigging procedure appropriate mathematical pigging model and suitable numerical method are the necessities to study the transient pigging details kohda et al 1987 proposed the early transient pigging simulation referred to the drift flow codes with the method of characteristics moc scoggins 1977 and the application of additional nodes to trace the traditional pig motion in gas liquid pipeline nguyen et al 2001a 2001b simplified the kohda moc solution procedure and verified the feasibility of their solution in describing the bypass pig motion in compressible gas pipeline the numerical solution indicated the velocity fluctuation of bypass pig and non bypass pig but they did not give any correlation to describe the uneven pig motion esmaeilzadeh et al 2006 2009 extended the nguyen et al s study to the motion of conventional pigs without a bypass in gas and liquid pipelines and the findings of botros and golshan 2010 also verified the accuracy and applicability of this solution the application of moc with fine time steps is able to describe the uneven pig motion while the uneven pigging slippage have not been investigated in their papers besides patricio et al 2020 showed the application of another explicit method flux corrected transport method fct in the one phase pipe pigging simulation and the accuracy of fct was validated the accuracy with two fluid model by figueiredo et al 2017 no obvious uneven appeared in their pig velocity trend and olga result to the implicit method minami et al 1991 1996 proposed a semi implicit numerical solution for the pigging procedure with the steady state gas assumption and no fluctuations appeared in their pig velocity trends jamshidi et al 2016 modified the pressure drop calculation of the pigging slug in minami s work and no pig velocity floatation appeared either the impact of gas compressibility should take the response for the uneven pig motion which was theoretically analyzed as the non classical riemann problem by simone and felipe 2012 although many researchers attempted to explore the pigging kinetic motion researchers have not been successful in the uneven pig motion description let alone the complicated quantified friction effects due to the multi effects of friction and gas compressibility and the lack of real time pig velocity testing technology in the current study a transient steady state analytical model is proposed that can predict the pig velocity and reveal the range of velocity fluctuations and a stoppage model is used to evaluate the stoppage time during the early pigging stage which gives the quick evaluation of the uneven pig motion and the initial stoppage both experimental data and simulation results were used to validate the accuracy and applicability of the models this paper also illustrates the friction effect on the extent of the pigging slippage and the occurrence of the stoppage based on simulation results the different scales of the friction deviation in different lengths were adopted to study the friction effect which validated the application of simulation in bypass pigging 2 research methodology a transient pigging model contains a transient pig kinetic model and transient fluid flow in a single phase pipeline the combination of the flow and the pig motion describes the impact of the pig motion on the fluid and the driving effect of the fluid on the pig the interactive effect leads to difficulty in obtaining the pig velocity in this section an analytical model is proposed that indicates the variation of the friction causes no slippage and stoppage the model demonstrates that gas compressibility is the key factor influencing the extent of pigging slippage and the occurrence of stoppage moreover a stoppage evaluation model is proposed to estimate the time of stoppage during the early pigging stage experimental and numerical treatments are also illustrated to study the bypass pigging process 2 1 transient analytical model of pig velocity the pipe is mostly regarded as a one dimensional model when studying the pigging performance in a long pipe the bypass hole ensures mass exchange between the two sides of the pig the combination of the gas through the bypass and the pressure at the pig head and pig tail forms the relation between the gas flow and the bypass pig motion the forces acting on the pig are shown in fig 1 the pig runs in a force balance state obeying newton s second law 1 m p i g a p i g δ p a a h m p i g g sin θ f f f τ where m pig is the mass of the pig and a pig is the acceleration of the pig δp indicates the pressure difference between the pig tail and pig head which is formulated as δp p tail p head a and a h are the areas of the inner pipe cross section and the bypass hole respectively g is the acceleration of gravity which was measured to be 9 81 m s2 and θ is the angle of incline at the given point the term f f indicates the friction force between the pig and the pipe which can be calculated using the correlation between the contact force and friction factor where the contact force is suggested by the shigley shrink fit correlation shigley et al 2005 in this study the friction force was tested as 193 02 n by using a winch the average value of the four friction forces by pulling the pig moving at the constant velocities of 0 1 m s 0 2 m s 0 5 m s and 1 0 m s due to the test pipe section and the ability of the winch which may result in less error in model calculation and numerical results the term f τ indicates the propelling force generated by the shear force of the bypass gas which is the product of the shear stress and inner area of the bypass hole f τ τ h π d h l p i g the shear stress can be calculated by the velocity difference between the pig and the bypass gas 2 τ h 1 2 f h ρ g b y v g b y v p i g v g b y v p i g where f h ρ g by v g by and v pig are the wall friction factor of the bypass hole the bypass gas density the absolute velocity of the bypass gas and the velocity of the pig respectively the steady state assumption was adopted to simplify the gas flowing in the bypass hole which indicates that the gas masses at the pig tail the bypass hole and the pig head have the same value the wall hole friction factor f h can be obtained by using the strategy proposed by bendiksen et al 1991 which couples the friction factors for laminar and turbulent flows proposed by moody 1947 3 f h max 16 re h 0 001375 1 2 10 4 ε h d h 10 4 re h 3 where re h ε h and d h are the reynolds number of the bypass flow the bypass hole roughness and the diameter of the hole respectively the pressure drop δp also provides the propellant that drives the gas flow through the bypass hole hence the pressure drop can be obtained from the bypass gas flow as follows 4 δ p 1 2 κ p i g ρ g b y v g b y v p i g v g b y v p i g where κ pig is the pressure loss coefficient over the pig this coefficient is usually separated into three parts the sudden constriction loss coefficient κ c the straight bypass coefficient κ f and the sudden expansion loss coefficient κ e the empirical equations in the handbook of idelchik 1986 are suggested to calculate the three factors supposing that 5 k p i g κ p i g ρ g b y a 1 φ 2 φ 2 sgn v g b y v p i g by considering the relative motion of the gas and the pig and conservation of mass the pig pressure drop equation eq 4 can then be written as 6 δ p a 1 φ k p i g v g p i g v p i g 2 where v g pig is the superficial gas velocity at the pig position donate f pig as the sum of the forces acting on the pig except the pressure force that is 7 f p i g m p i g g sin θ f f f τ in view of eq 6 eq 1 can be simplified as 8 m p i g a p i g k p i g v g p i g v p i g 2 f p i g in the pig design process the pig is usually considered as undergoing steady motion with a constant steady gas flow that is the pig design velocity is the pig velocity with no acceleration in eq 8 therefore 9 v p i g d e s i g n v g p i g f p i g k p i g the pig velocity can be formulated as follows 10 v p i g v p i g 0 t 0 t a p i g d t where v pig0 is the velocity of the pig at t 0 equations 8 and 10 show the variation of the pig motion in most cases the parameter k pig is primarily related to the bypass rate and the gas density at the pig when the time interval is small the terms k pig and f pig can be regarded as fixed values the analytical solution of the pig motion model can be obtained with the fixed terms as 11 v p i g v p i g d e s i g n 2 v g p i g v p i g d e s i g n c exp t τ 1 12 a p i g 2 v g p i g v p i g d e s i g n c exp t τ τ c exp t τ 1 2 where 13 c 1 2 v g p i g v p i g d e s i g n v p i g d e s i g n v p i g 0 a n d τ m p i g 2 v g p i g v p i g d e s i g n k p i g the term c indicates the proximity of the real pig velocity to the designed velocity when the pig velocity greatly differs from the designed value c will reach quite a small value resulting in a greater acceleration and a rapid change in pig velocity the term τ indicates the rate of velocity variation with time which is more likely the time constant of the velocity variation compared with the initial velocity variation the variation is negligible when the time reaches 5τ if the gas density is assumed to be constant or an incompressible liquid is adopted there is no variation in the density profile greatly simplifying the pigging process the velocities of the fluid at any place have the same superficial velocity which indicates the superficial gas velocity at the pig position v g pig is constant as pig moving when a constant flow at the pipe inlet is adopted and the variation of the friction force changes the value of f pig in eq 9 which lead the variation in the designed pig velocity v g pig this variation results new values of c and τ eq 13 which lead different velocity trends by using eq 11 the pig usually starts at a velocity of zero when the pigging starts the impacts of different c values and τ values on the pig velocity trends eq 11 resulted from different constant frictions with a fixed bypass structure and local gas velocity are shown in fig 2 a and b and the impact of the friction variation at 5τ 0 is shown in fig 2 c in fig 2 a the pig velocity trends verify that the constant factor c is mainly responsible for the uneven variation change of the pig velocity trends and that the smaller value of c results in a more intensive variation with a larger curvature the variation in c has a minor impact on the stabilization time of 5τ the change in the time constant only indicates the affine transform of the velocity trends in the time direction that is no pig slippage or stoppage would appear in the pigging process when the friction force is constant under the assumption of gas incompressibility in addition the variations that the pig moves from a gradually stabilized into another similar state with different values of c τ and v pigdesign after 5τ 0 see fig 2 c are resulted from the sudden change of friction the gradual smooth variations of the pig velocity in fig 2 c show no slippage or stoppage when the friction force changed the opposite phenomenon of no slippage and stoppage in fig 2 c and the slippage in the field experiment indicates the significant impact of gas compressibility in pigging slippage and stoppage the analytical solution eq 11 12 and 13 is able to describe the pig kinetic motion in pigging however the variation of the pressure profile in pigging leads to the changes in ρ gby and then the change of k pig eq 5 v pigdesign eq 9 c and τ eq 13 in turn when the incompressible gas is adopted the transient multi effect makes it hard to directly describe the uneven pig motion with given inlet flow at the pipe entrance in reality the pig usually moves at an uneven velocity which is sometimes higher and sometimes lower than the designed velocity in a compressible gas pipeline the fluctuations gradually become smoother with time according to this kinetic properties the steady state velocity trend with the fixed values c and τ generated from the pig steady state motion and the estimations of maximum and minimum are proposed to describe the transient pig motion in the pipe the perdition model of maximum and the minimum velocities of the pig as it moves in the constant friction section are 14 v p i g m i n v p i g d e s i g n a b s v p i g v p i g d e s i g n k v f i t t 1 a n d v p i g m a x v p i g d e s i g n a b s v p i g v p i g d e s i g n k v f i t t 1 where k v fit is the factor used to evaluate the inertia of the pig velocity in the pigging process which is suggested to be fit by the experimental data or simulation results when time equals zero the maximum and minimum of the predicted pig velocity are v pig0 and 2v pigdesign v pig0 this model implies that the amplitude of the velocity trend is gradually smoothed by time and that the maximum amplitude of the pig velocity trend is abs v pigdesign v pig0 the analytical pig velocity equation eq 11 with steady state variables and the maximum velocity and minimum velocity equations eq 14 indicate that three lines enclose an area that tightly surrounds the pig velocity trend as the pig moves these equations eq 11 and eq 14 comprise the so called transient steady state analytical model of pig velocity which is verified in the next section 2 2 pigging stoppage model the pig usually stops during the very early stage of the pigging process the stoppage of the pig is likely the result of the combined effect of the friction force bypass rate and mass flow in a fixed pipeline the stoppage of the pig may be weakened by a high mass flow of gas a low friction force or a small bypass rate which is summarized by the experiments and numerical results the stoppage model with three correlations in a similar form was proposed to illustrate the effect of the mass flow rate the friction force and the bypass rate on the stoppage the relation between the stoppage time and the mass flow rate is given as the following form 15 δ t s t o p k q f i t q m a s s q m a s s s t u c k where δt stop is the stoppage time q mass is the mass flow rate of the gas k q fit is the variation factor generated from the experiments or simulation and q mass stuck is the minimum mass flow respectively the value of q mass stuck implies that the friction force is equal to the fluid driving force allowing the pig with a fixed bypass rate to run at a velocity close to zero and according to this equation the stoppage time δt stop is infinite when the mass flow decreases to q mass stuck and is nearly zero with an extensively high q mass value q mass stuck can be calculated by using the force balance of the pig kinetic motion with a minimum pig velocity of zero eq 1 the relation between the stoppage time and the friction force at a fixed inlet mass flow is given as follows 16 δ t s t o p k f f i t f f s t u c k k f f i t f f f f s t u c k where f f stuck is the maximum friction force at which the mass flow can keep the pig moving and k f tit is a fixed parameter that indicates the variation trend between stoppage and friction this model indicates that the stuck time equals zero when the friction force is zero and equals infinity when the friction reaches near f f stuck f f stuck can also be calculated by using the pig kinetic equation with zero pig velocity the correlation between the stoppage time and the bypass rate has a similar reciprocal relationship 17 δ t s t o p k ρ κ φ f i t ρ g b y κ pig φ 2 ρ g b y κ pig φ 2 min δ t s t o p min where ρ g by κ pig φ 2 min is the minimum value of ρ g by κ pig φ 2 which is nearly zero when φ equals 1 k ρκφ fit is a fixed parameter fitted by experiment or simulation and δt stop min is the minimum stoppage time when the bypass rate equals zero the factor ρ g by κ pig φ 2 is the independent variable in this equation representing the combined effects of the bypass rate φ and the pressure loss coefficient κ pig these three equations provide the stoppage times for different cases only one desired parameter should be investigated by experiment and simulation in eqs 15 and 16 and the two desired variables in eq 17 imply that at least two known pigging processes with different bypass rates can describe the variation of bypass rate and pigging stoppage time the accuracy and applicability of the equations should be investigated by simulations or experiments as detailed in the following section 2 3 transient pigging simulation the pigging model comprises a fluid model that describes the flow variation in the pipe and a pig model that accounts for the pig movement mechanism appropriate numerical method and discretized scheme can be used to obtain the numerical results base on the mathematical model the fluid model based on conservation of mass and momentum at a given fluid temperature was adopted in the simulation the simulation is proposed on the basis of moving grid and finite element method fem the moving grid keeps the pig head and pig tail fixed on the discretized nodes when the pig travels this method reduces interpolation errors in the fixed grid when obtaining the flow parameters at the head and tail of the pig in the fem implicit discretization procedure parabolic three node isoparametric elements were used to discretize the velocity field and linear two node elements were adopted to describe the pressure field comini and del giudice 1985 the pipe was divided into two sections by the bypass pig the upstream section from the pipe inlet to the pig tail and the downstream section from the pig head to the pipe outlet both sections were filled with gas and connected by the bypass flow through the pig the steady state flow in the pipe was adopted as the initial condition and the constant gas mass flow at the pipe inlet and the outlet local atmospheric pressure were adopted as the boundary conditions the numerical pipe have the same diameter inner wall roughness and length with the experiments and the experimental pipe is introduced in the next part 2 4 experimental study the experimental system consisted of a transparent horizontal pipe through which one can observe the uneven motion of the pig along the pipe the observation section was made of plexiglass with an inner diameter of 64 0 mm and a total length of 15 026 m a polyvinyl chloride section was used to connect the pig launcher to the vortex flowmeter compressible dry gas was adopted as the working fluid in the experiments nine pressure sensors with satisfactory accuracy and high response sensitivity keller pr25y were placed to record the pressure trends at the designated positions of the visible pipe the high speed camera was placed to observe the pigging slippage and stoppage with the monitoring pipe length of 2 0 m the camera can be moved to different point to record the pig kinetic motion with different inlet flow rate the experimental system and the physical map are shown in figs 3 and 4 respectively the bypass pig containing several parts is shown in fig 5 the cooperation of different parts makes the bypass pig stand upright when it travels along the pipe the replaceable bypass nozzle ensures quick substitution of the bypass hole 3 results and discussion in this section the results of the transient analytical model and stoppage evaluation model will be compared with experimental and simulation results in the first subsection the accuracy and applicability of the pigging simulation and the reliability of the experiments are verified in the second subsection the analytical model which describes the pig velocity variation and the maximum and minimum evaluations of pig velocity is verified the third subsection presents the characteristics of the pigging stoppage and verifies the feasibility of the stoppage model which can be used to evaluate the extent of pigging stoppage during the early pigging stage the fourth subsection illustrates the combined effect of friction and gas compressibility in pig slippage and stoppage which results in uneven pig velocity and sometimes stopping and starting motion 3 1 pressure variation along the pipe the gas flow at the inlet was 0 0643 0 002 kg s and the outlet was at atmospheric pressure the experimental pressure variations and the numerical results caused by the pig at a 4 bypass rate are shown in fig 6 the time of the sudden increase in pressure trends indicates when the pig goes through different pressure sensors the increased amount of the pressure trends corresponded the different pressures at the pig tail and pig head low pressure at pig head and high pressure at pig tail and this pressure difference propelled the pig against the friction force between the pig and the pipe the variations in the numerical pressure profiles fit well with the experimental data however fluctuations in the experimental trends were different from the gradual smooth trends in the numerical results primarily because of the uneven experimental friction profile moreover the numerical trends indicated a slightly later arrival of the pig at different pressure sensors the experimental pigging time was 4 936 s and the numerical pigging time was 4 316 s the notable high pressure experimental trends after 4 1 s indicate a higher pressure drop placed on the pig which may have resulted from locally high friction and hence the sudden decrease in pig velocity generated from the larger friction causes the incensement in experimental pigging time 3 2 characteristics of pig motion and validation of the transient analytical model the bypass pig is more likely to move at a nonconstant velocity in the field experiments and in the indoor experiment the analytical pig velocity equation eq 11 and the velocity trends in fig 2 theoretically imply the variation of friction force results in the gradual variation in pig velocity with no fluctuations with the gas density assumption while the high speed video camera recorded the velocity fluctuations and restart after the stoppage of the pig in the certain area hence the uneven pig motion is affected by the friction profile together with the gas compressibility the pig velocity superficial gas velocity and pressure drop in the pig kinetic equation eq 1 are difficult to measure experimentally given the coherence of the pressure trends in fig 6 which verified the feasibility and applicability of the numerical model the numerical results were mainly used to verify the transient analytical model of the pig velocity resulting from difficulties in measuring the pig velocity trends in the experiments the simulated pressure drop superficial gas velocity and pig velocity are shown in fig 7 a and the performance of the analytical pig velocity eq 11 and eq 14 is shown in fig 7 b in fig 7 a one can see that the pig stopped at the very early stage during the pigging process when the pig starts to move the pressure drop over the pig overcomes the friction force between the pig and the pipe at this point the pig begins to move and then the pressure drop over the pig fluctuates near the value of this point the unstable pressure drop over the pig may result from the instantaneous gas velocity field and gas density field near the pig which interact with the pig velocity and pressure field the amplitudes of the pressure drop trend gas velocity trend and pig velocity trend gradually became smoother with time when the pressure drop is higher than the designed value enabling the friction force to be overcome the pig is in an accelerating state leading to higher superficial gas velocity at the pig when the pressure drop is lower than the designed value the pig and the gas near the pig were in a decelerating state the reciprocating fluctuation of damping in the three trends indicate that the unsteady pig motion was gradually smoothed as the pig moved the red pink and blue lines in fig 7 b show respectively the pig velocity and the maximum and minimum velocity estimations of the transient analytical model eq 11 and eq 14 with k v fit 1 1811 the numerical velocity trend is tightly bounded by the maximum and minimum estimations which indicates the good applicability of the steady state analysis model the average pig velocity is also a crucial factor in evaluating the pigging process the average pig velocity is the total pigging length divided by the total length which can be easily obtained from experimental and simulation results the transient analytical model only provided the pig velocity under the steady state assumption which may be different from the average velocity found in the experiment and simulation the average velocities at different bypass rates and different flow rates in the experiments simulations and models are shown in fig 8 the numerical average pig velocity is slightly lower than that of the steady values from transient velocity model ignoring the stoppage time calculation during the early pigging process is mainly responsible for the higher steady state velocity of the analytical model the close trends among the experimental data numerical results and model verifies the application of the transient analytical model and the simulation at the same time the uneven friction force between the pig and the pipe in the experiment may be responsible for the slightly uneven increase in the six experimental trends in fig 8 3 3 characteristics of pig stoppage and stoppage model validation the early stage stoppage of the pig in the pigging process is mostly related to the inlet mass flow the friction force and the pipe and the bypass rate of the pig in a certain pipeline the simulation results were adopted to verify the pigging stoppage model because of their good performance in terms of the details of the variation of the desired variables the trends of pig velocity the superficial gas velocity at the pig and the pressure drop over the pig and validation of the stoppage model of mass flow eq 15 with a friction force of 193 02 n and a bypass rate of 4 are shown in fig 9 the velocity trends in fig 9 a illustrate that the increasing mass flow resulted in an increase in the pig velocity and an increasing amplitude of the fluctuations the pigging time was decreased by a higher pig velocity the nodes of the superficial gas velocities in different flows when the pig starts to move lie at a fixed value see fig 9 b at this time the pressure drop over the pig overcame the friction force as shown in fig 9 c in addition the pigging stoppage time is increased by the greater amount of propellant carried by the higher flow rate this demonstrates that different mass flows provided the same pressure propellant which keeps the pig running near the designed value and that the pigging stoppage is more likely weakened by a higher mass flow rate validation of the stoppage model of mass flow eq 15 with k q fit 0 0135 and q mass stuck 0 0361 is shown in fig 9 d fig 10 shows the simulated variations in the pig velocity superficial gas velocity and pressure drop and the validation of the stoppage model of the friction force eq 16 with a bypass rate of 4 when the inlet mass flow of the compressible gas is a constant value of 0 0643 kg s when the friction increases the pig velocity and amplitude of the fluctuation decrease both the stoppage time and pigging time increased with the lower pig velocity the nodes of the gas velocity in fig 10 b and the pressure drop curves in fig 10 c denote the times when the pig starts to move these nodes indicate that the higher friction force causes a higher pressure drop that can balance the friction and hence this results in a higher superficial gas velocity which can provide a higher pressure drop according to eq 4 the increasing trends of pressure drop over the pig are the same in fig 10 c demonstrating that the constant flow and the fixed pig structures provide a constant pressure increasing trend the stoppage model of the friction force eq 16 with k f tit 321 76 and f f stuck 458 10 n shows good accuracy in fig 10 d which indicates the applicability of the model the bypass rate mainly influences the driving force δpa 1 φ and the pressure loss coefficient κ pig when the pig starts to move the pressure driving forces δpa 1 φ of different bypass rates are the same which indicates a lower pressure drop over the pig when the bypass rate increases fig 11 shows the trends of velocity and superficial gas velocity at the pig and a validation of the stoppage model of bypass eq 17 a pig velocity trends of different bypass rates b superficial gas velocity trends of different bypass rates c validation of the stoppage model of the bypass in fig 11 a one can see that the pig velocity is primarily weakened by a higher bypass rate which ensures a greater gas exchange between the two sides of the pig the higher capacity of gas exchange through a higher bypass rate with a given constant inlet flow results in a higher start value of the superficial gas velocity when the pig starts to move in the validation of the stoppage model of the bypass rate eq 17 the stoppage time reaches its minimum value of 0 228 s when the bypass rate is zero the model with k ρκφ fit 212 8 fits well with the simulation results 3 4 study of pig slippage and stoppage the previous subsection indicates that fluctuations of uneven pig velocity are mostly weakened as the pig continues to move through the pipe and that pig stoppage occurs at the very early stage in the pigging process under constant friction gas compressibility and friction are the major factors that influence the performance of pig slippage and stoppage gas compressibility mainly affects the transition of the pig motion when the pig moves in an unbalanced state friction may influence the major variations in pig kinetic characteristics consequently friction is mainly investigated to study its impact on pig motion an inlet mass flow of 0 0643 kg s and a bypass rate of 4 were used to study the impact of friction on pig slippage pipes with upstream normal friction forces of 193 02 n and downstream friction forces of 77 208 115 81 154 42 173 72 213 32 231 62 270 23 and 308 83 n which were 10 20 40 and 60 higher and lower than the upstream section were adopted to show the impact of friction variation on the pig motion the upstream section and downstream section are the same length of half pipe the trends of pig velocity superficial gas velocity and pressure drop over the pig with a bypass rate of 4 and flow rate of 0 0643 kg s are shown in fig 12 the trends of pig velocity superficial gas velocity at the pig and the pressure drop over the pig were the same before 2 358 s with the same friction force of 193 02 n when the pig travels into the downstream section of the pipe with abnormal friction the higher downstream friction causes pig stoppage the pigging kinetic parameters after the pig restarts have similar variations and fluctuations as in fig 10 e g the fluctuations of pig velocity in fig 12 b and superficial gas velocity in fig 12 d and the balance between the pressure drop and friction in fig 12 f in this case the stoppage of the pig mainly results from the sudden deceleration in the abnormally higher friction section of pipe and the slippage after the restart is mostly similar to that observed in the pigging start stage the stoppage time has a positive correlation with the sudden variation in friction when the abnormal friction is lower than the upstream value the sudden deceased friction causes a high acceleration in the pig velocity the sudden increase in velocity may be far greater than the designed velocity in the downstream section the great difference between the current pig velocity and the designed velocity results in an abrupt fluctuation with a large amplitude when the amplitude is not large enough to shake the pig velocity to zero the pig suddenly travels with a velocity with a higher fluctuation see the red line of 173 72 n in fig 12 a moreover the fluctuation with the lower abrupt friction may be large enough to shake the pig velocity to zero e g see the blue lines of 154 42 n in fig 12 a 12 c and 12 e pigging stoppage occurs because gas compressibility causes fluctuations and the restart process has characteristics of the start process of the pigging start with constant friction the pink and green lines with friction of 77 208 and 115 81 n respectively in fig 12 show no stoppage of the pig quite large fluctuations in pig velocity and the inadequate abrupt pipe length are the reason for the disappearance of the stoppage and restart stage an abrupt friction force in the upstream half section with a bypass rate of 4 and flow rate of 0 0643 kg s was also investigated to verify the occurrence of slippage and stoppage of friction variation as is shown in fig 13 the abrupt impacts of low friction in the upstream section of pipe are illustrated in fig 13 a c and 13 e which are the case when the pig travels from low abnormal frictions into high friction the variations in the pig velocity and superficial gas velocity are quite similar to those shown in fig 12 b and d stoppage does not occur when the pig travels from the low friction of 173 72 n to the high friction of 193 02 n this demonstrates that the extent of the friction difference determines the occurrence of pig stoppage when it travels from a section of low friction to one of high friction the variations in the pressure drops in fig 13 e show the gradual balance between the pressure propellant and friction when friction changes fig 13 b shows the absence of a stoppage with small velocity fluctuations resulting from a small decrease in friction pink line of 115 81 n moreover the appearance of pig stoppage in the blue line of 154 42 n and red line of 175 72 n is caused by the large velocity fluctuations resulting from the large friction reduction and disappearance of pig stoppage green line of 77 208 n mainly resulting from the insufficient downstream length the trends in fig 13 are quite similar to those in fig 12 the occurrence of pig stoppage is mainly related to the extent of the friction difference the phenomenon in which the velocity is usually decreased by the sudden higher friction is the primary response for the stoppage of a pig traveling from low to high friction sections however the large fluctuations of the sudden acceleration of the pig caused by gas compressibility forces the velocity to reduce to zero which signifies the stoppage of pig when it travels from high to low friction regions the pig stoppage is more likely to provide a quick change in pressure drop to balance the friction force the occurrence of the stoppage and the extent of slippage may also be influenced by the length of the abnormal friction section different abnormal friction values starting from the midpoint of the pigging pipe with lengths of 2 0 m and 4 0 m and half the pipe length were adopted to investigate the characteristics of slippage and stoppage the trends of pig velocity and pressure drop over the pig with a bypass rate of 4 and a flow rate of 0 0643 kg s are illustrated in fig 14 the velocity trends before 2 358 s overlapped in the same line in fig 14 a and b as did the pressure drop trends in fig 14 c and d the trends of pig velocity and pressure drop of abnormal lengths of 2 0 and 4 0 m have two group turning points the first is at the time when the pig travels into the abnormal friction section that has the same frictional character of the half pipe full lines in fig 14 the second is at the time when the pig travels into the normal friction section which may result in pig stoppage e g the additional two pig stoppages seen in the green and pink lines in fig 14 a and additional stoppage in the green pink and red lines in fig 14 b even an abnormal friction section with a small length may result in serious slippage and additional stoppage consequently numerical simulation of pipes with known pigging conditions is needed to evaluate transient pigging performance in the natural gas industry 4 conclusions the purpose of this study is to give the quick calculation to describe the uneven pig motion with stoppage in engineering and show the friction effect in pigging slippage and stoppage in compressible gas pipeline aiming at the quick calculation of the pig motion characteristics this paper proposed a transient steady state analytical model which shows the main trend of the pig velocity and the estimation of the velocity fluctuation range the accuracy of the analytical model was verified by the good coincidence of average pig velocities in simulations experiments and models meanwhile the pigging velocity was tightly surrounded by the maximum and minimum estimations from the model with only one parameter fitted by the velocity curve this paper then provides the pigging stoppage model formed by three equations which shows the relations between the stoppage time and inlet mass flow friction force and bypass character for the early state stoppage estimation the stoppage model fit fine with the numerical stoppage both the analytical model and the numerical results show the gradually smoothed pig velocity and no stoppage after the pig starts to move with the application of incompressible fluid and friction variation which is different from the unsmoothed pig motion with sometimes stoppage in experiments the friction is slightly uneven in the experimental pipe hence this paper illustrates the occurrence of pig stoppage and the extent of slippage with the abnormal friction of a certain length in simulation the slippage extent mainly relies on the friction difference of the abnormal section and the stoppage occurs when the pig travels in the abnormal region once the friction difference reaches certain deviation no matter higher or lower than the upstream region friction variation is mainly responsible for the sudden deceleration and then stoppage when the pig travels into the higher friction region and gas compressibility is primarily responsible for the stoppage after the acceleration deceleration of the pig when it travels into the lower friction region moreover two friction variation points that one certain abnormal friction area brings result in several stoppages which may correspond to the move stop restart pig motion in experiments future investigations are necessary to study the friction model and friction testing technology the friction force is influenced by the shrink fit between the pig disks and the pipe wall the worn factor of the pig disks the character of pipe the inner diameter the inner wall roughness and the pig velocity the lack of the theoretical friction model and the testing technology in obtaining the accurate real time friction profile leads to the imprecise friction adopted in models and simulation the error in the friction may result in the not entirely accurate calculation results hence the friction model and the friction measuring technology are essential to be investigated and then the friction effect on the pigging slippage and stoppage can be investigated in depth credit authorship contribution statement xiaowei li conceptualization methodology formal analysis software data curation visualization

20703,submarine pipeline is a type of important infrastructure in petroleum industry used for transporting crude oil or natural gas understanding of the dynamics characteristics under hydrodynamic loading is crucial for engineers when assessing the stability of offshore pipelines in their designed service period in this study taking the integrated numerical model fssi cas 2d as the tool the nonlinear ocean wave current induced dynamics of a shallowly buried submarine steel pipeline and its surrounding loosely deposited seabed soil is numerically investigated the excellent soil model pastor zienkiewicz mark iii pziii is adopted to describe the complicated mechanical behaviour of loose seabed soil under cyclic loading computational results indicate that the shallowly buried submarine pipeline eventually significantly float up and extrude the seabed soil over the pipeline driven by the gradually increased buoyancy on the pipeline caused by the accumulation of pore pressure around the pipeline making the seabed over the pipeline hunch significantly as a result considerable deformation occurs in the seabed soil surrounding the pipeline two effective stress based criterion are proposed to judge the occurrence of soil liquefaction adopting the two criterion it is found that the surrounding seabed soil around the pipeline does not become liquefied only stiffness softening has occurred in it however the soil in the upper seabed with shallow depth away from the pipeline becomes liquefied with a liquefaction depth 1 2 1 5 m comparative analysis indicates that the pipeline transporting natural gas floats upward with a much greater displacement than that if crude oil is transported the computational results show that the integrated mode fssi cas 2d has successfully and subtly captured a series of nonlinear physical phenomena of the intensive interaction between pipeline and its surrounding seabed soil finally it is indicated that the integrated model fssi cas 2d has an advantage to investigate the complicated interaction between fluid structure seabed foundation keywords fluid structure seabed interaction fssi pore pressure build up residual liquefaction loosely deposited seabed soil sinking and floating of pipeline seabed liquefaction wave current pastor zienkiewicz mark iii fssi cas 2d 1 introduction submarine pipeline is an important type of infrastructure in petroleum industry it is broadly used for transporting crude oil or natural gas nowadays several hundreds of thousands kilometers of submarine pipelines would have been built worldwide the stability of submarine pipelines is absolutely the precondition for ensuring their normal service performance in the designed service period however submarine pipelines are vulnerable under the attacking of extreme ocean wave or strong seismic wave due to the breaking or lateral buckling caused by the liquefaction of seabed foundation some such kind of catastrophic failures have been reported in the past decades e g christian et al 1974 reported that an underwater pipeline for a nuclear plant with a diameter 3 05 m and a buried depth about 3 m in lake ontario has failed for several times apparently due to soil liquefaction herbich et al 1984 also reported that a pipeline with a diameter 3 05 m was found to float up to the bed surface after an extreme storm in the construction period therefore it is necessary and meaningful to understand the responding dynamics characteristics of submarine pipelines under cyclic loading applied by ocean waves or seismic waves generally the instability of submarine pipelines could be attributed to scouring ocean wave action or seismic wave attacking on the seismic dynamics of submarine pipeline shallowly buried in seabed foundation scientists and engineers actually have paid little attention on it only a few works have been previously conducted a latest brief literature view on the seismic dynamics of submarine pipelines is available in zhang et al 2019 on the scouring of seabed floor near to submarine pipelines some valuable works also have been conducted to understand the mechanism under the action of ocean wave and current larsen et al 2016 kiziloz et al 2013 bayraktar et al 2016 fredsoe 2016 however scouring is not the focus of this study on the ocean wave induced dynamics of submarine pipeline a series of research works also have been previously conducted and a great number of literature are currently available the research method mainly includes analytical solution numerical modelling and laboratory wave flume test on the aspect of analytical solution numerical modelling of the dynamics of pipeline a latest brief literature view is also available in zhang et al 2019 however most of previous works were limited to the condition that the seabed soil was deemed as poro elastic medium macpherson 1978 magda 1992 duan et al 2017 in fact there is another types of seabed soil widely existed in offshore area in the world it is loosely deposited seabed soil in which pore pressure could build up significantly under hydrodynamic loading summer et al 2006b resulting in seabed soil becoming liquefied recently the wave induced dynamics of pipeline buried in loose seabed soil is tentatively investigated zhao et al 2018 adopting some empirical based soil models such as the soil model proposed by seed seed and rahman 1978 martin and seed 1984 there were also a few investigations adopting advanced soil model such as pziii model proposed by zienkiewicz et al 1999 to do such work dunn et al 2006 zhang et al 2011 unfortunately the intensive interaction between pipeline and seabed foundation the large deformation occurred in loosely deposited surrounding soil and the sinking floatation of pipeline have not comprehensively demonstrated in these works on the aspect of the laboratory wave flume test there are also several typical works are available for the dynamics of pipeline buried in loose sandy bed summer b m have conducted a series of wave flume tests to investigate the dynamics of a pipeline and its surrounding sandy soil sumer et al 1999 summer et al 2006b a they conformed that the surrounding sandy soil of pipeline can become liquefied and the pipeline can sink or float up under hydrodynamic loading teh et al 2003 also performed a great number of wave flume tests to observe the process of pore pressure accumulation the liquefaction of sandy bed as well as the sinking of pipeline based these tests teh et al 2006 proposed a formulation to predict the sinking depth of offshore pipeline zhou et al 2011 also conducted a number of large scale wave flume tests for the problem of wave pipeline seabed soil interaction however only the wave induced excess pore pressure was measured and analyzed in their work observation on the soil deformation and on the sinking or floatation of pipeline was not performed at all neelamani and ai banaa 2012 performed a series of wave flume tests to observe the variation of random wave induced force on pipeline buried in different types of soil it was found that the permeability of soil and the buried depth had significant effect on the wave induced force on underwater pipelines most recently miyamoto et al 2020 perform a number of important wave flume tests in a drum centrifuge for the pipeline soil interaction problem which owns breakthrough and milestone meaning in the authors opinion in their tests ocean waves are generated by a vibrating paddle then the generated waves propagate along a ring channel in the drum centrifuge and apply hydrodynamic loading to the loose sandy bed in which a pipeline is shallowly buried wave induced soil liquefaction and the floatation of pipeline are also clearly observed in these tests miyamoto et al 2020 s work will be a typical work in the literature of offshore geotechnics all these laboratory wave flume tests previously conducted are beneficial for the engineers and scientists to understand the characteristics and mechanism of the pipeline loose seabed foundation interaction under hydrodynamic loading it is indicated by a number of previous failure cases such as that reported by christian et al 1974 and herbich et al 1984 that the upheaval bulking of buried pipelines is one of the most important instability mechanism in engineering practice in order to avoid the floatation of buried pipelines increasing the buried depth and the specific gravity sg of submarine pipelines are the two common measures used in the design of engineering current guideline on the sg of submarine pipelines is generally suggested to be limited into 1 7 to 1 8 however the origins of such recommendation are not clear as claimed by bizzotto et al 2017b powell et al 2002 proposed a value range of 1 5 1 7 for the sg of submarine pipelines based on a series of physical model tests if the potential of floatation is highly possible extra engineering measures such as rock dumping could be adopted to avoid the possible upheaval bulking as pointed out by cathie et al 2005 and cowie and finch 2001 it has been recognized that the upheaval bulking of submarine pipeline can be caused by 1 the thermal expansion of the steel wall of pipeline when transporting elevated temperature substances during operating period 2 the operational defects in the process of pipeline laying ploughing or jetting and backfilling 3 the significant accumulation of pore pressure and the resultant soil softening or liquefaction in the surrounding seabed soil induced by the environmental dynamic loading such as ocean wave and seismic wave as a result the buoyancy applied on pipelines becomes much greater and the upheaval resistance of the surrounding soil reduces significantly which could directly lead to submarine pipelines are prone to uplift for the first and second mechanism stated above where there is no dynamic environmental loading involved there have been a series of numerical or laboratory investigations to study the uplift failure mechanism of submarine pipelines bizzotto et al 2017a 2017b cowie and finch 2001 cathie et al 2005 roy et al 2018 cheuk et al 2008 bransby et al 2001 berghe et al 2005 newson and deljoui 2006 however there are only few works have been conducted for the floatation of pipelines under the dynamic loading of ocean wave or seismic wave miyamoto et al 2020 so far as we know in this study we will focus on the above mentioned third mechanism involving the ocean wave or seismic wave it is known that ocean wave is a kind of significant and non ignorable environment loading for marine structures such as submarine pipelines it brings great threat to the stability of offshore structures constructed on or shallowly buried in loosely deposited seabed foundation in this study taking the integrated numerical model fssi cas 2d as the tool the wave current induced dynamics of a submarine steel pipeline shallowly buried in loose seabed foundation is comprehensively investigated the analysis results could further improve the understanding of ocean engineers and scientists on the dynamics of submarine pipeline buried in loose seabed foundation under hydrodynamic loading 2 numerical model and constitutive model dynamic biot s equation known as u p approximation proposed by zienkiewicz et al 1980 are

1 3 and generalized newmark scheme implicit scheme is adopted to calculate the time integration when solving the above governing equations chan 1988 for the problem of fluid structure seabed interaction fssi an integrated coupled numerical model fssi cas 2d was developed by the authors ye 2012 in fssi cas 2d the wave motion and the porous flow in porous seabed is governed by varans equation hsu et al 2002 meanwhile the dynamic behaviour of offshore structure and its seabed foundation is governed by the above equations 1 3 a coupled algorithm was developed to couple the varans equation and biot s dynamics equation together more detailed information about fssi cas 2d can be found in ye et al 2013b and ye 2012 void ratio e and related darcy s permeability k of soil generally is variational depending on the deformation of soil in computation the wave current induced variation of void ratio of seabed soil is considered following 5 e n 1 1 e n exp δ p q δ ε v s 1 where n stands for n t h time step δ p is the incremental pore pressure δ ε v s is the incremental volumetric strain of soil and q 1 β is the compressibility of pore water the above equation is established from the perspective of large deformation correspondingly the permeability of seabed soil k variates following 6 k c f e 3 1 e where c f k 0 1 e 0 e 0 3 is an empirical coefficient miyamoto et al 2004 in which e 0 and k 0 is the initial void ratio and permeability in this study an excellent soil model pastor zienkiewicz mark iii pziii proposed by pastor et al 1990 is adopted to describe the dynamic behaviour of loose seabed soil surrounding pipeline the reliability of pziii has been validated by a series of laboratory tests in which monotonic and cyclic loading are both involved especially the centrifuge tests in the velacs project zienkiewicz et al 1999 this model is one of the heritages of olek zienkiewicz pastor et al 2011 3 verification for pipeline seabed interaction the developed integrated model fssi cas 2d has been widely validated in previous literature published by the authors ye et al 2013b involving analytical solutions a series of wave flume tests and one centrifuge test it also has been successfully applied to study the dynamics of large scale breakwater and its seabed foundation involving breaking waves ye et al 2014 tsunami waves ye et al 2013a as well as seismic wave ye and wang 2015 it is proved that the integrated numerical model fssi cas 2d is applicable for the analysis of the dynamics of offshore structures and their seabed foundation however pipeline was not involved in previous verification cases here the reliability of fssi cas 2d for the problem of pipeline seabed interaction is further illustrated adopting some previous wave flume test results 3 1 elastic seabed turcotte 1984 conducted a series of wave flume tests for the problem of pipeline seabed interaction at cornell university these test results have been widely adopted to examine the reliability of some analytical solutions zhou et al 2013 and numerical models luan et al 2008 zhang et al 2011 in this section turcotte 1984 s test results are also adopted to verify the reliability of fssi cas 2d for the problem of pipeline seabed interaction in turcotte 1984 s test an empty steel pipeline with a sg specific gravity of 0 907 was buried in a sandy bed installed in a wave flume a series of water waves were generated to apply cyclic loading on the surface of the sandy bed totally eight water pressure sensors were uniformly installed around the pipeline to record the wave induced pressure the dimension and the property parameters of the sandy bed as well as the pipeline given by turcotte 1984 are listed in table 1 the water depth in the wave flume was 0 533 m three kinds of water wave with different wave heights and wave periods were generated in tests the integrated model fssi cas 2d is used to reproduce the experimental process of these wave flume tests adopting poro elastic soil model finally the reliability fo fssi cas 2d is validated by comparing the numerical results with the test data given by turcotte 1984 the comparison between the wave flume test data and the present numerical results for the three kinds of water waves are illustrated in fig 1 it can be seen that the numerical results reproduced by fssi cas 2d agree very well with the test results in the cases where the wave height is 14 3 cm or 3 02 cm in order to further enhance the reliability of this verification the theoretic results proposed by cheng 1986 is also given in fig 1 it is further found that the numerical results reproduced by fssi cas 2d in the case where the wave height 5 24 cm wave period 0 9 s is greater than the test results however the agreement between the present numerical results and the theoretic results proposed by cheng 1986 is quite well overall it is indicated that the integrated model fssi cas 2d is reliable for the problem of wave elastic seabed pipeline interaction 3 2 loose seabed except for dense elastic seabed the verification for loosely deposited seabed soil is also necessary for fssi cas 2d actually this verification work has been performed by us ye et al 2013b in a previous publication in ye et al 2013b s work there were two typical laboratory tests performed by teh et al 2003 and sassa and sekiguchi 1999 were used to take the verification work the verification work shown that the integrated model fssi cas 2d is also reliable for the problem of wave loose seabed pipeline interaction so long as an appropriate advanced soil constitutive model is selected and the model parameters for loose seabed soil is reliably calibrated based on credible laboratory testing data based on these verification work in ye et al 2013b the integrated model fssi cas 2d has been successfully applied to investigate the dynamics and residual liquefaction of loosely deposited seabed under wave loading yang and ye 2017 2018 or seismic wave loading ye and wang 2016 it is shown that the integrated model fssi cas 2d can describe the progressive liquefaction process and post liquefaction behaviour of loose seabed soil when an appropriate advanced soil constitutive model is incorporated 4 computational domain boundary conditions and hydrodynamic loading as demonstrated in fig 2 a steel pipeline with a wall thickness of 3 cm with a outer diameter of 800 mm transporting crude oil is buried in the loosely deposited seabed foundation specific gravity at empty sg 1 113 the water depth d over the seabed surface is 10 m the buried depth of the pipeline is 1 0 m the distance from the pipeline center to the surface of seabed the computational domain of the seabed foundation is 200 m in length and 20 m in thickness the pipeline is installed on the symmetrical line x 100 m the bottom of the seabed foundation is fixed both in x and z direction the two lateral sides of the computational domain are also fixed in x direction and set free in z direction on the surface of the seabed foundation the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic water wave pressure is applied at the meantime the effective stresses keep zero at all times on the surface of seabed floor because the seabed foundation is porous in order to simulate the working status of the pipeline a pressure with a value of 200 kpa driving the crude oil flowing in the pipeline is applied due to the fact that the seabed floor is flat in the computation domain the hydrodynamic water pressure can be determined by analytical solution the analytical formulation first explicitly proposed by ye and jeng 2012 for the third order wave current is used in this study as a result the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic water wave pressure applied on the surface of seabed floor is 7 p x t ρ f g d ρ f g h 2 cosh λ d 1 ω 2 λ 2 h 2 2 u 0 λ ω 0 cos λ x ω t 3 ρ f h 2 8 ω 0 ω 0 u 0 λ 2 sinh 4 λ d g λ 3 sinh 2 λ d cos 2 λ x ω t 3 ρ f λ h 3 ω 0 ω 0 u 0 λ 512 9 4 sinh 2 λ d sinh 7 λ d cos 3 λ x ω t where h is wave height t is wave period d is water depth ρ f is the density of sea water g is gravity λ l 2 π is wave number where l is wave length ω t 2 π is angle frequency u 0 is current velocity when there is no current in wave u 0 0 m s the above third order solution can be degraded into the classic form of the solution of third order nonlinear wave one of the advantages of equation 7 is that the high nonlinearity of ocean wave in shallow water can be effective considered it is noted that the wave induced seabed scouring as well as the effect of axial force along the pipeline and the hogging curvature generated in the process of pipeline installation on the dynamics of pipeline and its surrounding seabed soil are all not considered in modelling the generated mesh for the pipeline and seabed used in computation is shown in fig 3 there are totally 23316 4 nodes elements in the mesh the pipeline is treated as impermeable and rigid steel circle wall thickness 3 cm and the transported crude oil is also meshed four typical point a b c and d around the pipeline labelled in fig 3 are chosen as the representatives to analyze the characteristics of dynamics of seabed soil surrounding the pipeline thereafter the parameters of the loosely deposited seabed soil for pziii model are listed in table 2 they were previously determined by zienkiewicz et al 1999 for nevada sand d r 60 d 50 0 14 0 17 mm c u 1 67 and g s 2 64 2 67 coming from kammerer et al 2000 when taking part in the velacs project the initial void ratio e and saturation of seabed soil used in computation is 0 7372 and 98 respectively and they are both uniformly distributed in the computational domain correspondingly the initial permeability is set as 7 2 10 5 m s wave height wave period and current velocity is set as 3 0 m 8 0s u 0 0 5 m s respectively 5 results 5 1 initial state before applying the wave current loading there is an initial state for the pipeline seabed foundation system this initial state should be taken as the initial condition for the subsequent dynamics analysis the detailed analysis on the initial displacement pore pressure and effective stresses of the seabed pipeline system is available in zhang et al 2019 which is just recently published by the authors overall the existence of the pipeline has significant effect on the initial distribution of displacement and effective stresses in the surrounding seabed soil of the pipeline 5 2 dynamic displacement of pipeline due to the fact that the ocean wave induced dynamics of loosely deposited seabed soil has been comprehensively investigated adopting advanced elasto plastic soil model in several previous literature such as yang and ye 2018 yang and ye 2017 and liao et al 2015 the dynamics of seabed soil far away from the pipeline is not presented any more here only the dynamics of the pipeline and its surrounding seabed soil as well as their interaction are the focus in this study the dynamic displacement of the pipeline responding to the wave and current loading is demonstrated in fig 4 it is found that the pipeline continuously moves toward to the right side in horizontal direction accompanied by a regular vibration and the amplitude of the horizontal vibration increases gradually at the end of the computation t 156 s the residual horizontal displacement of the pipeline is about 90 mm the amplitude of the horizontal vibration is about 30 mm it means that the horizontal vibration of the pipeline is relatively strong under the cyclic loading applied by the wave and current it is also can be seen that the vertical displacement of the pipeline contains two components as well residual and oscillatory respectively oscillatory displacement definitely is due to the periodic applying of ocean wave meanwhile the residual displacement is due to the deformation of surrounding seabed soil from the prospective of residual vertical displacement it is observed that the pipeline is sinking before t 80 s after that the pipeline continuously floats up this transition of displacement mode of the pipeline is closely related to the development of residual pore pressure in the loosely deposited surrounding soil of the pipeline under hydrodynamic loading this vibration and the floatation of pipeline actually have previously been clearly observed in some wave flume tests conducted by sumer et al 1999 teh et al 2003 and miyamoto et al 2020 it is indicated that the integrated model fssi cas 2d can effectively capture the complicated behaviour of shallowly buried pipeline under hydrodynamic loading previous studies yang and ye 2018 summer et al 2006b have proved from the perspectives of experiment and numerical modelling that the pore pressure in loose seabed soil will build up under cyclic wave loading in this study it is also observed that the pore pressure has built up in the surrounding loose seabed soil under the action of wave and current as a result the upward floating force on the pipeline applied by the pore water will gradually become greater and greater in the process of pore pressure accumulation as illustrated in fig 5 in fig 5 it can be seen that there is a positive residual value for the horizontal component of the floating force f x from the time t 50 s this is the reason why there is a residual horizontal displacement towards to the right side furthermore the development of the vertical component of the floating force f z is very interesting f z is less than the gravity of the pipeline oil system in the early stage at a critical point f z becomes greater than the gravity of the pipeline oil system resulting from the wave and current induced pore pressure build up in the surrounding loose seabed soil just because of this considerable upward floating force applied by the pore water the pipeline will float up in the later stage as demonstrated in fig 4 the permanent horizontal displacement and the upward floatation of the pipeline undoubtedly cause its surrounding seabed soil deforming correspondingly as shown in fig 6 it is observed that the seabed soil over the pipeline also move relatively upward to the surface layer soil of the seabed away from the pipeline which is driven by the floating behaviour of the pipeline it is indicated that the interaction between the pipeline and its surrounding seabed soil is intensive this upheaval of the seabed soil over the pipeline is also clearly observed most recently by miyamoto et al 2020 in their centrifuge wave flume tests indicating again that the integrated model fssi cas 2d can effectively handle the intensive nonlinear pipeline soil interaction in computation in this study the numerical computation is terminated automatically at the time t 156 s about 20 wave periods due to the non convergence of numerical solving the reasons are mainly attributed to the facts that 1 the used soil model pziii is a type of complicated elato plastic soil constitutive model for loose soil resulting in that it is not easy to keep converged state in computation 2 the interaction between the pipeline and its surrounding loose seabed soil is complicated 3 there is no yield and potential surface in the tensile stress space for pziii soil model all these factors are very easy to cause the computation becoming non convergent at the later stage regardless of the time step interval the size of mesh and the type of solver chosen for the solution of linearized equations in this study the computation result where the integrated model fssi cas 2d terminating at t 156 s is the best one after the biggest effort by us 5 3 effective stresses and pore pressure in order to comprehensively understand the interaction mechanism between the pipeline and its surrounding loose soil it is necessary to explore the wave induced dynamics characteristics of pore pressure and effective stress in the surrounding seabed soil the time histories of pore pressure effective stress and void ratio e at the four typical positions a b c and d are demonstrated in figs 7 10 it is observed that the pore pressure at the four positions all only build up slightly namely the residual pore pressure in the surrounding soil is not significant however the oscillatory pore pressure is considerable it is also observed that the mean effective stress i 1 σ x σ y σ z 3 all reduce from their initial values to a small magnitude about 2 kpa noted negative value means compressible in the process of pore pressure slightly building up it is worthy pointing out that there is no position where the effective stress i 1 could reach zero becoming fully liquefied it means that only partial liquefaction could occur this phenomenon is significantly different with the situation if there is no pipeline buried in seabed as revealed by yang and ye 2017 that the loosely deposited seabed soil can become fully liquefied under wave and current loading it is indicated that the existence of the pipeline has significant effect on the dynamics of the surrounding seabed soil similarly the time histories of the shear stress also show that the absolute value of residual shear stress at the four positions reduce gradually approaching zero in the process of pore pressure sightly building up the oscillatory component in the time history of the wave and current induced shear stress also indicates that the soil at the four positions do not become fully liquefied otherwise the oscillatory component should disappear as that revealed by yang and ye 2017 due to the fact that a fully liquefied soil behaves like a kind of heavy fluid with apparently large viscosity without the ability to transmit shear wave and shear stress it is interesting to find that the void ratio of the soil at the position a and b gradually become smaller and smaller in the loading process meanwhile the void ratio of the soil at the position c and d basically keep unchanged before t 70 s after that their void ratio increase quickly under the wave and current cyclic loading it means that the seabed soil over the pipeline becomes denser and denser soil permeability reduces correspondingly meanwhile the seabed soil beneath the pipeline gradually dilates soil permeability increases correspondingly under cyclic loading this phenomenon can be attributed to the upward displacement of the pipeline driven by the increasing upward floating force applied on the pipeline as illustrated in fig 5 generally the quick increasing of void ratio of soil would result in the quick drop of pore pressure from the perspective of linearity however the pore pressure at the position c and d do not drop as expected as shown in figs 9 and 10 it is further indicated that the interaction between the pipeline and its surrounding loose seabed is nonlinear and complicated except the time history of pore pressure and effective stress the distribution of pore pressure and effective stress in the surrounding seabed soil around the pipeline at several typical times are shown in fig 11 it can be observed in fig 11 that the residual pore pressure doesn t build up uniformly around the pipeline the residual pore pressure in the seabed soil beneath the pipeline is greater than that in the seabed soil over the pipeline indicating that the rate of building up of the pore pressure beneath the pipeline is greater than that in the zone over the pipeline it is also found that the residual pore pressure around the pipeline maximumly doesn t exceed 10 kpa at the initial state t 0s the mean effective stress i 1 around the pipeline are all less than 10 kpa and the i 1 beneath the pipeline is greater than that in the zone over the pipeline due to the gravity compression of the steel pipeline crude oil system after t 100 s the i 1 around the pipeline generally is less than 2 kpa there is no position where i 1 becomes zero it means there is no a position where the surrounding loose seabed soil becomes fully liquefied only partial liquefaction could be observed due to the existence of the pipeline there is shear stress in the seabed soil around the pipeline at the initial time additionally the shear stress around the pipeline is also not uniform the distribution of the shear stress like a flower with four petals at the initial state among the four petals the one in the range of 210 260 is the smallest as demonstrated in fig 11 in the loading process applied by the wave and current the shear stress in the seabed soil around the pipeline significantly reduces actually the variation of this shear stress s distribution around the pipeline is very complicated due to the complexity of the interaction between the pipeline and its surrounding loose seabed soil besides the time history it is also meaningful and necessary to explore the distribution characteristics of the wave induced pore pressure and effective stress in the surrounding seabed soil of the pipeline as illustrated in fig 12 the distribution of pore pressure at t 150 s is not strictly layered any more due to the uneven accumulation of pore pressure in the seabed however the distorted effect on the layered distribution of the pore pressure is very limited because the magnitude of pore pressure accumulation is not significant in the upper seabed as demonstrated in figs 7 10 due to the fact that the steel pipeline in not porous the pore pressure inside and outside of the steel pipeline is isolated the pressure inside of the pipeline keeps as 200 kpa which is not affected by the pore pressure build up in the surrounding seabed soil in the process of pore pressure build up the effective stress in seabed will certainly reduce if there is no buried pipeline yang and ye 2018 however the existence of the pipeline makes the distribution of the mean effective stress i1 in the surrounding seabed of the pipeline much more complicated overall i1 is all reduced relative to their initial value except in some local zone over the pipeline in which the i1 is greater than its initial value this is due to the fact that the seabed soil over the pipeline is extruded by the upward floating pipeline driven by the accumulated residual pore pressure in the surrounding seabed soil in the zone away from the pipeline the distribution of i1 is almost layered as that demonstrated by yang and ye 2018 where there is no buried pipeline in the upper seabed z 18 m 20 m away from the pipeline the magnitude of i1 generally is less than 1 kpa indicating that the seabed soil in this zone becomes liquefied with high possibility in the surrounding seabed soil of the pipeline the effect of the pipeline is very significant the i1 in this zone generally is greater than 1 kpa indicating that the seabed soil in this zone is not likely to liquefy additionally it is observed that there is a small zone with high magnitude of effective stress over the pipeline where the mean effective stress i1 is much greater than that in its near zone this is also due to the upward floating of the pipeline exactly due to the gravity effect the i1 in the zone beneath the pipeline is significantly greater than that in the counterpart zone in the seabed the distribution of shear stress at t 150 s is significantly different with its initial symmetrical distribution there is no any characteristics of symmetry and the maximum magnitude of the shear stress in the surrounding seabed soil of the pipeline is only 1 kpa which is much less than that in the initial state in the zone away from the pipeline the magnitude of shear stress is all near to zero this phenomenon further indicates that the seabed soil away from the pipeline is likely to become liquefied while the surrounding seabed soil of the pipeline is not likely to become liquefied at the end of computation fig 13 illustrates the relation between the shear stress and shear strain at the four typical position a b c and d around the pipeline it is found that the direction of shear strain at position a c is opposite with that at position b d to the end of computation the magnitude of shear strain at the four positions is in the range of 6 13 and the magnitude of shear strain at position c and d beneath the pipeline is greater than that on the position a and b which is over the pipeline on the position a and b the magnitude of the residual shear strain gradually reduces respectively to about 500 pa and 0 pa with the pore pressure build up induced by wave current loading on position c and d the shear strain is very small at early time until the occurrence of stiffness softening of seabed soil after that a significant cyclic mobilization is observed due to the fact that the amplitude of the cyclic mobilization is in the range of 500 1200 pa the seabed soil on the position c and d is not likely to become liquefied at t 150s this conclusion is consistent with that obtained from fig 12 5 4 liquefaction it has been widely proved that loosely deposited seabed soil could become liquefied under continuous hydrodynamic loading by laboratory tests sassa and sekiguchi 1999 and field records sassa et al 2006 generally there are two types of liquefaction mechanisms for seabed soil the first one is the momentary liquefaction which could only occur in very dense sandy soil under wave trough due to the upward seepage force its effect on the stability of offshore structures is not significant however the momentary liquefaction could significantly boost the scouring of seabed soil around offshore structures another one is the residual liquefaction occurring due to the pore pressure accumulation in loosely deposited soil under cyclic loading the liquefaction occurring in the loosely deposited seabed soil in this study is exactly the residual liquefaction generally residual liquefaction in loose seabed foundation has adverse effect on the stability of offshore structures once residual liquefaction occurs in seabed soil the bearing capacity of seabed soil will significantly lost which could result in a series of engineering failures e g the upheaval bulking and the breaking of offshore pipeline generally there are two kinds of criteria to quantitatively access and judge the occurrence of residual liquefaction in loose seabed soil yang and ye 2018 the first one is the pore pressure based criteria this kind of criterion defines a ratio between excess pore pressure and initial effective stress when this ratio is greater than a critical value e g 0 8 residual liquefaction is judged to occur for seabed soil as pointed by ye and wang 2015 this pore pressure based criteria can only be used for the cases in which there is no offshore structure involved if an offshore structure is built on or buried in seabed foundation then the pore pressure based criteria is actually not a reliable criteria to judge the occurrence of residual liquefaction due to the fact that there probably is intensive soil structure interaction ye and wang 2015 presented a reliable case to demonstrate this conclusion in which a large scale offshore breakwater was built on a loosely deposited seabed foundation their results showed that the breakwater subsided about 5 m and laterally moved to one side about 12 m under the attacking of a seismic wave in the process the pore pressure significantly built up exceeding its initial effective stress meanwhile the effective stress gradually increased however rather than reduced in the seabed soil beneath the breakwater caused by the large deformation of seabed foundation as well as the great subsidence and tilting of the overlying breakwater ye and wang 2015 also presented an interesting result that the residual pore pressure reached up to double times of the initial effective stress when the seabed soil becoming fully liquefied at a position based on previous conventional recognition the residual pore pressure in sandy seabed soil cohesion is zero is impossible to be greater than the corresponding initial effective stress if there is no offshore structure exactly due to the presence of the offshore breakwater as well as the intensive soil structure interaction the development of residual pore pressure and effective stress in seabed foundation is highly complex the pore pressure based criteria actually is an indirect judgement criterion it is not suggested to be used in the cases where soil structure interaction is involved the second method is based on the effective stress according to the traditional definition of soil liquefaction the most obvious physical characteristics of soil liquefaction is that the effective stress between soil particles approaches to zero partial liquefaction or exactly is equal to zero fully liquefaction therefore we can adopt this physical characteristics to judge the occurrence of soil liquefaction as a result the effective stress based criterion is a type of direct criteria based on this recognition two specific formulations have been proposed by the authors in previous literatures ye and wang 2015 yang and ye 2018 to access the residual liquefaction of loose seabed soil the first one is that a parameter referred as to residual liquefaction potential l p is defined to describe the liquefaction potential of loose seabed soil under cyclic loading noted compressive stress is taken as negative value 8 l p σ z d σ z 0 α c l p c r i t i c a l where σ z d σ z σ z 0 is wave induced dynamic vertical effective stress σ z 0 is initial vertical effective stress σ z is current vertical effective stress c is cohesion of seabed soil α is a dimensionless material coefficient in equation 8 the cohesion of seabed soil is taken into consideration from the perspective of that it is much more difficult for cohesive soil to become liquefied under cyclic loading cohesion of soil could effectively enhance the liquefaction resistance of soil l r σ z 0 α c liu and jeng 2016 therefore it is better to consider the cohesion c of soil when evaluate liquefaction potential more detailed explanation on α and soil cohesion is available in yang and ye 2018 in this study cohesion c is zero because seabed is assumed as sandy soil then there is no effect of α on the l p of sandy seabed soil for sandy seabed soil the residual liquefaction potential can be expressed as l p 1 σ z σ z 0 if the effective stresses in 3d situation are considered it becomes l p 1 i 1 i 1 0 where i 1 0 is the initial mean effective stress l p c r i t i c a l is a critical value given by engineers and scientists involved when l p is greater than or equal to the given l p c r i t i c a l at a position the seabed soil at this position can be judged to become liquefied on the issue of the value range of l p generally it is in the range of 0 0 1 0 in the case of intensive soil structure nonlinear interaction l p in some local zones could be less than 0 0 due to the fact that σ z could be greater than σ z 0 even through the pore pressure has been significantly built up as the results presented in ye and wang 2015 the second judgement formulation of the effective stress based criteria is i 1 i 1 c r i t i c a l where i 1 c r i t i c a l is also a critical value given by engineers and scientists involved it means that the residual liquefaction will occur at a position where if the current mean effective stress i 1 is less than or equal to the given critical value i 1 c r i t i c a l due to the fact that sandy soil can not bear any tensile stress the mean effective stress i 1 in sandy seabed soil must be negative generally the critical value i 1 c r i t i c a l given by engineers and scientists is a small value close to zero e g 1 kpa in theory the current i 1 must be very small in partially liquefied situation or must be equal to zero in fully liquefied situation therefore this effective stress based judgement formulation for soil liquefaction adopting the current i 1 is more in line with the definition of liquefaction than that of l p although equation 8 and the formulation i 1 i 1 c r i t i c a l are both the effective stress based criterion for soil residual liquefaction none of them are perfect they each have their own strengths and weaknesses for the first judgement formulation equation 8 the value of α currently is impossible to be quantitatively determined in terms of experiments or theoretic analysis because very little attention has been paid on it by scholars therefore the first judgement formulation is not applicable for clay and silty soil additionally the critical value l p c r i t i c a l is not a constant value for all types of soils but need to be given by engineers or scientists based on their engineering experiences and theoretic analysis aa a result unexpected artificial error would be brought according to the suggestion of wu et al 2004 l p c r i t i c a l is in the range of 0 78 0 99 depending on the soil types previous investigation conducted by ye et al 2015 indicated that l p c r i t i c a l 0 86 for nevada sand this value will be adopted to judge the occurrence of residual liquefaction in the surrounding seabed soil of the pipeline for the second judgement formulation unexpected artificial error is also unavoidable when determining the critical value i 1 c r i t i c a l for example the size and shape of the predicted residual liquefaction zone would be significantly different when i 1 c r i t i c a l 1 kpa or i 1 c r i t i c a l 2 kpa another defect of the second judgement formulation is that it is not applicable to judge the liquefaction or not for the upper seabed soil with shallow buried depth e g the absolute mean effective stress i 1 is certainly less than 1 kpa for the seabed soil with a buried depth less than 5 cm near to seabed surface at the initial state as a result the seabed soil will be wrongly judged to become liquefied all the time if we take i 1 c r i t i c a l 1 kpa even though there would be no a wave loading on the seabed surface however the second judgement formulation has huge advantages to judge the occurrence of liquefaction for the seabed soil which has a great initial effective stress e g 100 kpa the distribution of the wave current induced liquefaction zone predicted by adopting the two effective stress based criteria at time t 150 s are shown in figs 14 and 15 in fig 14 the critical l p is set as 0 86 following the suggestion of ye et al 2015 it is observed that the upper seabed soil with shallow buried depth away from the pipeline all becomes liquefied with a liquefaction depth about 1 0 2 0 m meanwhile the seabed soil surrounding the pipeline is all not liquefied it is indicated that the presence of the pipeline indeed has significant effect on the wave induced dynamics of its surrounding seabed soil it is worth to point out that the seabed soil over the pipeline is also not liquefied even though this part of seabed soil is directly applied by the wave current hydrodynamic loading this phenomenon is attributed to that the upward floating of the pipeline brings extrusion effect to the seabed soil over the pipeline making the effective stress in it is compressive with a great magnitude this high stress zone over the pipeline actually can be clearly observed in the i 1 distribution in fig 12 even though the l p in the surrounding seabed soil of the pipeline does not exceed the set critical value 0 86 liquefaction does not occur it does not mean that the stiffness of the surrounding seabed soil not to attenuate actually softening is always occurring in the surrounding seabed soil of the pipeline accompanying the accumulation of pore pressure and reduction of effective stress the interaction between the pipeline and its surrounding seabed soil must be properly considered in computation otherwise the computational results is not reliable and convincing or even wrong there is no unified standard for the artificial selection of the value of i 1 c r i t i c a l in the domain of offshore geotechnics so far as stated above the size and the shape of the predicted liquefaction zone will largely depend on the selected value of i 1 c r i t i c a l in theory soil can become fully liquefied only when the i 1 reduces to zero from a great initial value however it is difficult for seabed soil to reach this extreme state in which i 1 0 kpa actually large deformation in seabed foundation would have occurred before i 1 approaching zero presenting the liquefaction characteristics of soil under this situation liquefaction is deemed has been occurred in the perspective of engineering practices therefore the value of i 1 c r i t i c a l absolutely can not be set as zero otherwise there would be on liquefaction occurs in seabed foundation under any hydrodynamic loading on the other hand the reasonable selection of the value of i 1 c r i t i c a l decided by engineers and scientists needs based on the engineering experiences and experimental data together in this study we set the value of i 1 c r i t i c a l as 1 0 kpa to predict the liquefaction zone distribution near to the pipeline as shown in fig 15 it is observed that the distribution of the liquefaction zone predicted adopting i 1 is similar with that predicted adopting l p the only differences include 1 the liquefaction depth is about the 1 2 m which is much less that in fig 14 2 the area of the non liquefied zone surrounding the pipeline is significantly smaller than that predicted adopting l p it is indicated that the effective stress based criteria adopting l p and i 1 are both acceptable to predict the liquefaction zone surrounding the pipeline even though there is intensive soil structure interaction 5 5 effect of the pipeline gas system in the practice of engineering marine pipeline is not only used to transport crude oil but also natural gas density is 0 7174 kg m3 at 1 atm pressure in this study the wave current induced dynamics of the pipeline gas system buried in the same loosely deposited seabed foundation is also investigated to seek the differences of dynamics between the pipeline oil system and the pipeline gas system applied by hydrodynamic loading firstly the distribution of displacements pore pressure and effective stresses of the pipeline gas seabed system at the initial state as have been shown in figs 16 and 17 are compared with that of the pipeline oil seabed system in fig 16 it is found that the distribution of the initial displacement is completely different with that if crude oil is transported in the pipeline in the case crude oil is transported the downward subsidence of the pipeline at the initial state is about 28 2 mm which is more than the subsidence of its surrounding seabed soil see fig 4 in zhang et al 2019 it means that the pipeline oil system slightly sinks downward relative to its surrounding soil caused by the considerable weight of the pipeline oil system oppositely the downward subsidence of the pipeline is only 27 mm which is less than the subsidence of its surrounding seabed soil as illustrated in fig 16 it means that the pipeline gas system slightly floats upward relative to its surrounding soil of course this phenomenon is due to that the density of natural gas is much less than that of crude oil the weight of the pipeline gas system is certainly less than that of pipeline oil system however the buoyancy applied by the hydrostatic water pressure on the steel pipeline is the same due to the fact that the volume of pore water expelled by the pipeline has no change as a result the pipeline gas system certainly will have a strong trend to float upward even at the initial state exactly because of this upward floating trend of the pipeline gas system the low stress zone beneath the pipeline is larger in size than that if crude oil is transported see fig 5 in zhang et al 2019 as demonstrated in fig 17 also due to this slight sinking and slight floating of the pipeline relative to its surrounding seabed soil the distribution of the initial horizontal displacement around the pipeline is significantly different however they both have symmetry along x 100 m similarly it is observed in fig 17 that the distribution of pore pressure in the seabed is also layered without any excess pore pressure the distribution of the initial shear stress τ x z around the pipeline shown in fig 17 is also different with the distribution where crude oil is transported the domain of influence of τ x z beneath the pipeline is obviously larger than that over the pipeline nevertheless the domain of influence of the initial τ x z beneath and over the pipeline basically is same for pipeline oil system this difference is also caused by the slight sinking and slight floating of the pipeline relative to its surrounding seabed soil at the initial state the comparison of the time history of the wave current induced displacement of the pipeline is illustrated in fig 18 it is observed that the difference of the horizontal displacement of the pipeline is minor however the difference of the vertical displacement is significant between the pipeline oil system and the pipeline gas system whether it is crude oil or natural gas transported the pipeline firstly sinks relative to its initial position under hydrodynamic loading in the early stage until to the moment when the upward buoyancy applied on the pipeline become greater than the gravity of the pipeline oil gas system after that the pipeline will gradually float up to the end of computation the pipeline transporting natural gas floats up about 100 mm relative to its initial position which is much greater than that of the pipeline transporting crude oil about 25 mm as illustrated in fig 19 the difference of the upward buoyancy applied on the pipeline by the wave current induced excess pore pressure is not very significant however the gravity of the pipeline gas system is much less than that of the pipeline oil system as a result the pipeline transporting natural gas certainly will float up much more this substantial floating of the pipeline gas system with a magnitude of 100 mm will extrude the seabed soil over the pipeline with a more obvious way making the seabed over the pipeline hunch more significantly than that if crude oil is transported as that demonstrated in fig 20 it is worth to point out that a pipeline could float up to the surface and finally seating on seabed this penetration process of the pipeline actually is very difficult to be numerically modelled due to the fact the fe method is not good at handling such great distortion of mesh adopting ale method although cel method could handle large deformation problems to some extends the complicated fluid solid interaction structure soil interaction as well as nonlinear dynamic behaviours can not be effectively handled by cel method fig 21 illustrates the time history comparison of the wave current induced pore pressure effective stress and void ratio at the typical position d it is found that the time history of the pore pressure and shear stress basically is the same for the pipeline oil gas systems due to the greater gravity of the pipeline oil system the initial mean effective stress i 1 at the position d under the pipeline is greater than that if natural gas is transported in addition to this point there is no essential difference on the time history of i 1 the most significant difference is presented on the time history of void ratio at the position d under the pipeline the seabed soil dilates very significantly regardless of crude oil or natural gas being transported accompanying the floating up of the pipeline however the magnitude of dilation of the seabed soil under the pipeline transporting natural gas is much greater than that if crude oil is transported this phenomenon is attributed to the much more greater magnitude of the upward floating of the pipeline transporting natural gas as analyzed above it is indispensable to compare the distribution of liquefaction zone in the seabed soil around the pipeline in which crude oil or natural gas is transported fig 22 shows the liquefaction zone predicted by adopting i 1 the second effective stress based criterion it is observed that the liquefaction zone around the pipeline gas system basically is the same with that illustrated in fig 15 only the upper seabed soil with a thickness about 1 4 m away from the pipeline gas system becomes liquefied the seabed soil around the pipeline gas system is also not liquefied overall the biggest difference on the dynamics of the pipeline and its surrounding seabed soil between the pipeline gas system and the pipeline oil system is reflected on the upward floating of the pipeline driven by the excess pore pressure induced by hydrodynamic loading 5 6 post densification once the hydrodynamic loading stopping to apply the accumulated excess pore pressure in seabed soil will gradually dissipate accompanying the gradual drainage of pore water out of seabed through the seabed surface in this process the effective stress in seabed soil will increase correspondingly and the offshore structures built on or buried in seabed foundation will also correspondingly subside finally the seabed foundation soil will become more dense and get higher bearing capacity once the excess pore pressure is completely dissipated fig 23 demonstrates the post densification precess of the pore pressure dissipation effective stress growth as well as the subsidence of the pipeline transporting crude oil or natural gas it is observed that the pore pressure indeed gradually dissipates and the effective stress gradually grows in the surrounding seabed soil of the pipeline the pipeline indeed gradually subsides downward after the wave current stopping to apply hydrodynamic loading this post densification process of the pipeline oil gas seabed system is an important result for the problem of offshore pipeline dynamics due to the fact there is no attention has been paid on the issue in previous literature it will promote us to further understand the mechanism and dynamics characteristics of offshore pipeline subjected to ocean wave hydrodynamic loading 6 conclusion in this study the dynamics of a pipeline transporting crude oil or natural gas shallowly buried in loosely deposited seabed foundation under third order ocean wave current loading is numerically investigated adopting the integrated model fssi cas 2d which was firstly developed by jeng et al 2013 and ye et al 2013b specially for the problem of fluid structure seabed foundation interaction through comprehensive analysis for the computational results the following recognitions are obtained 1 the pore pressure in the surrounding seabed soil of the shallowly buried pipeline does not accumulate significantly however the effective stress reduces about 50 80 relative to its initial value it is indicated that stiffness softening has occurred in the surrounding seabed soil of the pipeline this softening provides extremely favorable conditions for the horizontal vertical vibrations and the upward floating of pipeline the significant floating up of the pipeline results in the occurrence of large deformation in the surrounding seabed soil the soil over the pipeline gradually becomes denser meanwhile the soil beneath the pipeline significantly dilates accompanying the upward floating of the pipeline 2 the buoyancy applied on the pipeline is not a constant but is gradually increased under continuous hydrodynamic loading the increase of the buoyancy is attributed to the accumulation of the pore pressure in the surrounding seabed soil around the pipeline the pipeline sinks downward relative to its initial position at the early stage regardless of transporting crude oil or natural gas until to the moment when the upward buoyancy applied on the pipeline become greater than the gravity of the pipeline oil gas system after that the pipeline continuously floats up driven by the significant buoyancy it is noted that the magnitude of floating displacement of the pipeline transporting natural gas is much greater than the pipeline transporting crude oil due to the much lighter weight of natural gas than that of crude oil this substantial floating of the pipeline gas system extrudes the seabed soil over the pipeline with a more obvious way making the seabed over the pipeline hunch more significantly than that if crude oil is transported 3 two effective stress based criteria are proposed to judge the occurrence of soil liquefaction their own advantages and disadvantages all have been presented in the study adopting the two criteria the liquefaction zone in the seabed soil closed to the pipeline is successfully predicted it is found that the surrounding seabed soil around the pipeline does not become liquefied only the soil in the upper seabed with shallow depth away from the pipeline becomes liquefied with a liquefaction depth 1 2 1 5 m additionally the shapes and the sizes of the liquefaction zone predicted adopting the two proposed effective stress based criteria are basically the same without significant difference it is indicated that the two effective stress based criteria adopting l p and i 1 are both acceptable to predict the liquefaction zone surrounding the pipeline 4 through the comparative analysis between the pipeline oil seabed system and the pipeline gas seabed system it is found that the biggest difference on the dynamics of the pipeline and its surrounding seabed soil between them is reflected on the upward floating of the pipeline driven by the excess pore pressure induced by hydrodynamic loading secondly the magnitude of dilation of the seabed soil under the pipeline transporting natural gas is much greater than that if crude oil is transported 5 there is basically little attention has been paid on the consolidation process of seabed foundation after wave stopping to apply in previous literature the post densification process of the pipeline oil gas seabed system is firstly presented in this study it will promote us to further understand the mechanism and dynamics characteristics of offshore pipeline subjected to ocean wave hydrodynamic loading 6 the computational results show that the integrated mode fssi cas 2d has successfully and subtly captured a series of nonlinear physical phenomena of the intensive interaction between the pipeline transporting crude oil or natural gas and the loosely deposited seabed soil e g the vibration sinking and floating of the pipeline the large deformation liquefaction in the surrounding seabed soil etc it is indicated that the integrated model fssi cas 2d developed by ye et al 2013b and jeng et al 2013 has an advantage to investigate the complicated interaction between fluid structure seabed foundation 7 it is essential to point out that this work is just an early work in the field of numerical analysis of the dynamics of submarine pipelines as well as in the area of evaluation of the stability of submarine pipelines under hydrodynamic load the main purpose is to comprehensively understand the basic mechanism how a pipeline buried in loose seabed floor responds to hydrodynamic load under some ideal conditions there should be certain gap with the application in practical engineering because either there are a number of conditions set in the numerical modelling are slightly different with the realistic conditions or some important factors that could affect the dynamics of pipelines are not taken into consideration in this study e g the complex topography of seabed floor affected by scouring the effect of pipeline laying ploughing or jetting backfilling on the mechanical properties of the surrounding soil of pipelines and the axial effect on the behaviour of pipelines upheaval bulking caused

20703,submarine pipeline is a type of important infrastructure in petroleum industry used for transporting crude oil or natural gas understanding of the dynamics characteristics under hydrodynamic loading is crucial for engineers when assessing the stability of offshore pipelines in their designed service period in this study taking the integrated numerical model fssi cas 2d as the tool the nonlinear ocean wave current induced dynamics of a shallowly buried submarine steel pipeline and its surrounding loosely deposited seabed soil is numerically investigated the excellent soil model pastor zienkiewicz mark iii pziii is adopted to describe the complicated mechanical behaviour of loose seabed soil under cyclic loading computational results indicate that the shallowly buried submarine pipeline eventually significantly float up and extrude the seabed soil over the pipeline driven by the gradually increased buoyancy on the pipeline caused by the accumulation of pore pressure around the pipeline making the seabed over the pipeline hunch significantly as a result considerable deformation occurs in the seabed soil surrounding the pipeline two effective stress based criterion are proposed to judge the occurrence of soil liquefaction adopting the two criterion it is found that the surrounding seabed soil around the pipeline does not become liquefied only stiffness softening has occurred in it however the soil in the upper seabed with shallow depth away from the pipeline becomes liquefied with a liquefaction depth 1 2 1 5 m comparative analysis indicates that the pipeline transporting natural gas floats upward with a much greater displacement than that if crude oil is transported the computational results show that the integrated mode fssi cas 2d has successfully and subtly captured a series of nonlinear physical phenomena of the intensive interaction between pipeline and its surrounding seabed soil finally it is indicated that the integrated model fssi cas 2d has an advantage to investigate the complicated interaction between fluid structure seabed foundation keywords fluid structure seabed interaction fssi pore pressure build up residual liquefaction loosely deposited seabed soil sinking and floating of pipeline seabed liquefaction wave current pastor zienkiewicz mark iii fssi cas 2d 1 introduction submarine pipeline is an important type of infrastructure in petroleum industry it is broadly used for transporting crude oil or natural gas nowadays several hundreds of thousands kilometers of submarine pipelines would have been built worldwide the stability of submarine pipelines is absolutely the precondition for ensuring their normal service performance in the designed service period however submarine pipelines are vulnerable under the attacking of extreme ocean wave or strong seismic wave due to the breaking or lateral buckling caused by the liquefaction of seabed foundation some such kind of catastrophic failures have been reported in the past decades e g christian et al 1974 reported that an underwater pipeline for a nuclear plant with a diameter 3 05 m and a buried depth about 3 m in lake ontario has failed for several times apparently due to soil liquefaction herbich et al 1984 also reported that a pipeline with a diameter 3 05 m was found to float up to the bed surface after an extreme storm in the construction period therefore it is necessary and meaningful to understand the responding dynamics characteristics of submarine pipelines under cyclic loading applied by ocean waves or seismic waves generally the instability of submarine pipelines could be attributed to scouring ocean wave action or seismic wave attacking on the seismic dynamics of submarine pipeline shallowly buried in seabed foundation scientists and engineers actually have paid little attention on it only a few works have been previously conducted a latest brief literature view on the seismic dynamics of submarine pipelines is available in zhang et al 2019 on the scouring of seabed floor near to submarine pipelines some valuable works also have been conducted to understand the mechanism under the action of ocean wave and current larsen et al 2016 kiziloz et al 2013 bayraktar et al 2016 fredsoe 2016 however scouring is not the focus of this study on the ocean wave induced dynamics of submarine pipeline a series of research works also have been previously conducted and a great number of literature are currently available the research method mainly includes analytical solution numerical modelling and laboratory wave flume test on the aspect of analytical solution numerical modelling of the dynamics of pipeline a latest brief literature view is also available in zhang et al 2019 however most of previous works were limited to the condition that the seabed soil was deemed as poro elastic medium macpherson 1978 magda 1992 duan et al 2017 in fact there is another types of seabed soil widely existed in offshore area in the world it is loosely deposited seabed soil in which pore pressure could build up significantly under hydrodynamic loading summer et al 2006b resulting in seabed soil becoming liquefied recently the wave induced dynamics of pipeline buried in loose seabed soil is tentatively investigated zhao et al 2018 adopting some empirical based soil models such as the soil model proposed by seed seed and rahman 1978 martin and seed 1984 there were also a few investigations adopting advanced soil model such as pziii model proposed by zienkiewicz et al 1999 to do such work dunn et al 2006 zhang et al 2011 unfortunately the intensive interaction between pipeline and seabed foundation the large deformation occurred in loosely deposited surrounding soil and the sinking floatation of pipeline have not comprehensively demonstrated in these works on the aspect of the laboratory wave flume test there are also several typical works are available for the dynamics of pipeline buried in loose sandy bed summer b m have conducted a series of wave flume tests to investigate the dynamics of a pipeline and its surrounding sandy soil sumer et al 1999 summer et al 2006b a they conformed that the surrounding sandy soil of pipeline can become liquefied and the pipeline can sink or float up under hydrodynamic loading teh et al 2003 also performed a great number of wave flume tests to observe the process of pore pressure accumulation the liquefaction of sandy bed as well as the sinking of pipeline based these tests teh et al 2006 proposed a formulation to predict the sinking depth of offshore pipeline zhou et al 2011 also conducted a number of large scale wave flume tests for the problem of wave pipeline seabed soil interaction however only the wave induced excess pore pressure was measured and analyzed in their work observation on the soil deformation and on the sinking or floatation of pipeline was not performed at all neelamani and ai banaa 2012 performed a series of wave flume tests to observe the variation of random wave induced force on pipeline buried in different types of soil it was found that the permeability of soil and the buried depth had significant effect on the wave induced force on underwater pipelines most recently miyamoto et al 2020 perform a number of important wave flume tests in a drum centrifuge for the pipeline soil interaction problem which owns breakthrough and milestone meaning in the authors opinion in their tests ocean waves are generated by a vibrating paddle then the generated waves propagate along a ring channel in the drum centrifuge and apply hydrodynamic loading to the loose sandy bed in which a pipeline is shallowly buried wave induced soil liquefaction and the floatation of pipeline are also clearly observed in these tests miyamoto et al 2020 s work will be a typical work in the literature of offshore geotechnics all these laboratory wave flume tests previously conducted are beneficial for the engineers and scientists to understand the characteristics and mechanism of the pipeline loose seabed foundation interaction under hydrodynamic loading it is indicated by a number of previous failure cases such as that reported by christian et al 1974 and herbich et al 1984 that the upheaval bulking of buried pipelines is one of the most important instability mechanism in engineering practice in order to avoid the floatation of buried pipelines increasing the buried depth and the specific gravity sg of submarine pipelines are the two common measures used in the design of engineering current guideline on the sg of submarine pipelines is generally suggested to be limited into 1 7 to 1 8 however the origins of such recommendation are not clear as claimed by bizzotto et al 2017b powell et al 2002 proposed a value range of 1 5 1 7 for the sg of submarine pipelines based on a series of physical model tests if the potential of floatation is highly possible extra engineering measures such as rock dumping could be adopted to avoid the possible upheaval bulking as pointed out by cathie et al 2005 and cowie and finch 2001 it has been recognized that the upheaval bulking of submarine pipeline can be caused by 1 the thermal expansion of the steel wall of pipeline when transporting elevated temperature substances during operating period 2 the operational defects in the process of pipeline laying ploughing or jetting and backfilling 3 the significant accumulation of pore pressure and the resultant soil softening or liquefaction in the surrounding seabed soil induced by the environmental dynamic loading such as ocean wave and seismic wave as a result the buoyancy applied on pipelines becomes much greater and the upheaval resistance of the surrounding soil reduces significantly which could directly lead to submarine pipelines are prone to uplift for the first and second mechanism stated above where there is no dynamic environmental loading involved there have been a series of numerical or laboratory investigations to study the uplift failure mechanism of submarine pipelines bizzotto et al 2017a 2017b cowie and finch 2001 cathie et al 2005 roy et al 2018 cheuk et al 2008 bransby et al 2001 berghe et al 2005 newson and deljoui 2006 however there are only few works have been conducted for the floatation of pipelines under the dynamic loading of ocean wave or seismic wave miyamoto et al 2020 so far as we know in this study we will focus on the above mentioned third mechanism involving the ocean wave or seismic wave it is known that ocean wave is a kind of significant and non ignorable environment loading for marine structures such as submarine pipelines it brings great threat to the stability of offshore structures constructed on or shallowly buried in loosely deposited seabed foundation in this study taking the integrated numerical model fssi cas 2d as the tool the wave current induced dynamics of a submarine steel pipeline shallowly buried in loose seabed foundation is comprehensively investigated the analysis results could further improve the understanding of ocean engineers and scientists on the dynamics of submarine pipeline buried in loose seabed foundation under hydrodynamic loading 2 numerical model and constitutive model dynamic biot s equation known as u p approximation proposed by zienkiewicz et al 1980 are

compressibility of pore fluid β is taken to consider the unsaturation of seabed soil which is only applicable for the nearly saturated soil fe method is utilized to solve the above governing equations 1 3 and generalized newmark scheme implicit scheme is adopted to calculate the time integration when solving the above governing equations chan 1988 for the problem of fluid structure seabed interaction fssi an integrated coupled numerical model fssi cas 2d was developed by the authors ye 2012 in fssi cas 2d the wave motion and the porous flow in porous seabed is governed by varans equation hsu et al 2002 meanwhile the dynamic behaviour of offshore structure and its seabed foundation is governed by the above equations 1 3 a coupled algorithm was developed to couple the varans equation and biot s dynamics equation together more detailed information about fssi cas 2d can be found in ye et al 2013b and ye 2012 void ratio e and related darcy s permeability k of soil generally is variational depending on the deformation of soil in computation the wave current induced variation of void ratio of seabed soil is considered following 5 e n 1 1 e n exp δ p q δ ε v s 1 where n

from the perspective of large deformation correspondingly the permeability of seabed soil k variates following 6 k c f e 3 1 e where c f k 0 1 e 0 e 0 3 is an empirical coefficient miyamoto et al 2004 in which e 0 and k 0 is the initial void ratio and permeability in this study an excellent soil model pastor zienkiewicz mark iii pziii proposed by pastor et al 1990 is adopted to describe the dynamic behaviour of loose seabed soil surrounding pipeline the reliability of pziii has been validated by a series of laboratory tests in which monotonic and cyclic loading are both involved especially the centrifuge tests in the velacs project zienkiewicz et al 1999 this model is one of the heritages of olek zienkiewicz pastor et al 2011 3 verification for pipeline seabed interaction the developed integrated model fssi cas 2d has been widely validated in previous literature published by the authors ye et al 2013b involving analytical solutions a series of wave flume tests and one centrifuge test it also has been successfully applied to study the dynamics of large scale breakwater and its seabed foundation involving breaking waves ye et al 2014 tsunami waves ye et al 2013a as well as seismic wave ye and wang 2015 it is proved that the integrated numerical model fssi cas 2d is applicable for the analysis of the dynamics of offshore structures and their seabed foundation however pipeline was not involved in previous verification cases here the reliability of fssi cas 2d for the problem of pipeline seabed interaction is further illustrated adopting some previous wave flume test results 3 1 elastic seabed turcotte 1984 conducted a series of wave flume tests for the problem of pipeline seabed interaction at cornell university these test results have been widely adopted to examine the reliability of some analytical solutions zhou et al 2013 and numerical models luan et al 2008 zhang et al 2011 in this section turcotte 1984 s test results are also adopted to verify the reliability of fssi cas 2d for the problem of pipeline seabed interaction in turcotte 1984 s test an empty steel pipeline with a sg specific gravity of 0 907 was buried in a sandy bed installed in a wave flume a series of water waves were generated to apply cyclic loading on the surface of the sandy bed totally eight water pressure sensors were uniformly installed around the pipeline to record the wave induced pressure the dimension and the property parameters of the sandy bed as well as the pipeline given by turcotte 1984 are listed in table 1 the water depth in the wave flume was 0 533 m three kinds of water wave with different wave heights and wave periods were generated in tests the integrated model fssi cas 2d is used to reproduce the experimental process of these wave flume tests adopting poro elastic soil model finally the reliability fo fssi cas 2d is validated by comparing the numerical results with the test data given by turcotte 1984 the comparison between the wave flume test data and the present numerical results for the three kinds of water waves are illustrated in fig 1 it can be seen that the numerical results reproduced by fssi cas 2d agree very well with the test results in the cases where the wave height is 14 3 cm or 3 02 cm in order to further enhance the reliability of this verification the theoretic results proposed by cheng 1986 is also given in fig 1 it is further found that the numerical results reproduced by fssi cas 2d in the case where the wave height 5 24 cm wave period 0 9 s is greater than the test results however the agreement between the present numerical results and the theoretic results proposed by cheng 1986 is quite well overall it is indicated that the integrated model fssi cas 2d is reliable for the problem of wave elastic seabed pipeline interaction 3 2 loose seabed except for dense elastic seabed the verification for loosely deposited seabed soil is also necessary for fssi cas 2d actually this verification work has been performed by us ye et al 2013b in a previous publication in ye et al 2013b s work there were two typical laboratory tests performed by teh et al 2003 and sassa and sekiguchi 1999 were used to take the verification work the verification work shown that the integrated model fssi cas 2d is also reliable for the problem of wave loose seabed pipeline interaction so long as an appropriate advanced soil constitutive model is selected and the model parameters for loose seabed soil is reliably calibrated based on credible laboratory testing data based on these verification work in ye et al 2013b the integrated model fssi cas 2d has been successfully applied to investigate the dynamics and residual liquefaction of loosely deposited seabed under wave loading yang and ye 2017 2018 or seismic wave loading ye and wang 2016 it is shown that the integrated model fssi cas 2d can describe the progressive liquefaction process and post liquefaction behaviour of loose seabed soil when an appropriate advanced soil constitutive model is incorporated 4 computational domain boundary conditions and hydrodynamic loading as demonstrated in fig 2 a steel pipeline with a wall thickness of 3 cm with a outer diameter of 800 mm transporting crude oil is buried in the loosely deposited seabed foundation specific gravity at empty sg 1 113 the water depth d over the seabed surface is 10 m the buried depth of the pipeline is 1 0 m the distance from the pipeline center to the surface of seabed the computational domain of the seabed foundation is 200 m in length and 20 m in thickness the pipeline is installed on the symmetrical line x 100 m the bottom of the seabed foundation is fixed both in x and z direction the two lateral sides of the computational domain are also fixed in x direction and set free in z direction on the surface of the seabed foundation the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic water wave pressure is applied at the meantime the effective stresses keep zero at all times on the surface of seabed floor because the seabed foundation is porous in order to simulate the working status of the pipeline a pressure with a value of 200 kpa driving the crude oil flowing in the pipeline is applied due to the fact that the seabed floor is flat in the computation domain the hydrodynamic water pressure can be determined by analytical solution the analytical formulation first explicitly proposed by ye and jeng 2012 for the third order wave current is used in this study as a result the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic water wave pressure applied on the surface of seabed floor is 7 p x t ρ f g d ρ f g h 2 cosh λ d 1 ω 2 λ 2 h 2 2 u 0 λ ω 0 cos λ x ω t 3 ρ f h 2 8 ω 0 ω 0 u 0 λ 2 sinh 4 λ d g λ 3 sinh 2 λ d cos 2 λ x ω t 3 ρ f λ h 3 ω 0 ω 0 u 0 λ 512 9 4 sinh 2 λ d

u 0 is current velocity when there is no current in wave u 0 0 m s the above third order solution can be degraded into the classic form of the solution of third order nonlinear wave one of the advantages of equation 7 is that the high nonlinearity of ocean wave in shallow water can be effective considered it is noted that the wave induced seabed scouring as well as the effect of axial force along the pipeline and the hogging curvature generated in the process of pipeline installation on the dynamics of pipeline and its surrounding seabed soil are all not considered in modelling the generated mesh for the pipeline and seabed used in computation is shown in fig 3 there are totally 23316 4 nodes elements in the mesh the pipeline is treated as impermeable and rigid steel circle wall thickness 3 cm and the transported crude oil is also meshed four typical point a b c and d around the pipeline labelled in fig 3 are chosen as the representatives to analyze the characteristics of dynamics of seabed soil surrounding the pipeline thereafter the parameters of the loosely deposited seabed soil for pziii model are listed in table 2 they were previously determined by zienkiewicz et al 1999 for nevada sand d r 60 d 50 0 14 0 17 mm c u 1 67 and g s 2 64 2 67 coming from kammerer et al 2000 when taking part in the velacs project the initial void ratio e and saturation of seabed soil used in computation is 0 7372 and 98 respectively and they are both uniformly distributed in the computational domain correspondingly the initial permeability is set as 7 2 10 5 m s wave height wave period and current velocity is set as 3 0 m 8 0s u 0 0 5 m s respectively 5 results 5 1 initial state before applying the wave current loading there is an initial state for the pipeline seabed foundation system this initial state should be taken as the initial condition for the subsequent dynamics analysis the detailed analysis on the initial displacement pore pressure and effective stresses of the seabed pipeline system is available in zhang et al 2019 which is just recently published by the authors overall the existence of the pipeline has significant effect on the initial distribution of displacement and effective stresses in the surrounding seabed soil of the pipeline 5 2 dynamic displacement of pipeline due to the fact that the ocean wave induced dynamics of loosely deposited seabed soil has been comprehensively investigated adopting advanced elasto plastic soil model in several previous literature such as yang and ye 2018 yang and ye 2017 and liao et al 2015 the dynamics of seabed soil far away from the pipeline is not presented any more here only the dynamics of the pipeline and its surrounding seabed soil as well as their interaction are the focus in this study the dynamic displacement of the pipeline responding to the wave and current loading is demonstrated in fig 4 it is found that the pipeline continuously moves toward to the right side in horizontal direction accompanied by a regular vibration and the amplitude of the horizontal vibration increases gradually at the end of the computation t 156 s the residual horizontal displacement of the pipeline is about 90 mm the amplitude of the horizontal vibration is about 30 mm it means that the horizontal vibration of the pipeline is relatively strong under the cyclic loading applied by the wave and current it is also can be seen that the vertical displacement of the pipeline contains two components as well residual and oscillatory respectively oscillatory displacement definitely is due to the periodic applying of ocean wave meanwhile the residual displacement is due to the deformation of surrounding seabed soil from the prospective of residual vertical displacement it is observed that the pipeline is sinking before t 80 s after that the pipeline continuously floats up this transition of displacement mode of the pipeline is closely related to the development of residual pore pressure in the loosely deposited surrounding soil of the pipeline under hydrodynamic loading this vibration and the floatation of pipeline actually have previously been clearly observed in some wave flume tests conducted by sumer et al 1999 teh et al 2003 and miyamoto et al 2020 it is indicated that the integrated model fssi cas 2d can effectively capture the complicated behaviour of shallowly buried pipeline under hydrodynamic loading previous studies yang and ye 2018 summer et al 2006b have proved from the perspectives of experiment and numerical modelling that the pore pressure in loose seabed soil will build up under cyclic wave loading in this study it is also observed that the pore pressure has built up in the surrounding loose seabed soil under the action of wave and current as a result the upward floating force on the pipeline applied by the pore water will gradually become greater and greater in the process of pore pressure accumulation as illustrated in fig 5 in fig 5 it can be seen that there is a positive residual value for the horizontal component of the floating force f x from the time t 50 s this is the reason why there is a residual horizontal displacement towards to the right side furthermore the development of the vertical component of the floating force f z is very interesting f z is less than the gravity of the pipeline oil system in the early stage at a critical point f z becomes greater than the gravity of the pipeline oil system resulting from the wave and current induced pore pressure build up in the surrounding loose seabed soil just because of this considerable upward floating force applied by the pore water the pipeline will float up in the later stage as demonstrated in fig 4 the permanent horizontal displacement and the upward floatation of the pipeline undoubtedly cause its surrounding seabed soil deforming correspondingly as shown in fig 6 it is observed that the seabed soil over the pipeline also move relatively upward to the surface layer soil of the seabed away from the pipeline which is driven by the floating behaviour of the pipeline it is indicated that the interaction between the pipeline and its surrounding seabed soil is intensive this upheaval of the seabed soil over the pipeline is also clearly observed most recently by miyamoto et al 2020 in their centrifuge wave flume tests indicating again that the integrated model fssi cas 2d can effectively handle the intensive nonlinear pipeline soil interaction in computation in this study the numerical computation is terminated automatically at the time t 156 s about 20 wave periods due to the non convergence of numerical solving the reasons are mainly attributed to the facts that 1 the used soil model pziii is a type of complicated elato plastic soil constitutive model for loose soil resulting in that it is not easy to keep converged state in computation 2 the interaction between the pipeline and its surrounding loose seabed soil is complicated 3 there is no yield and potential surface in the tensile stress space for pziii soil model all these factors are very easy to cause the computation becoming non convergent at the later stage regardless of the time step interval the size of mesh and the type of solver chosen for the solution of linearized equations in this study the computation result where the integrated model fssi cas 2d terminating at t 156 s is the best one after the biggest effort by us 5 3 effective stresses and pore pressure in order to comprehensively understand the interaction mechanism between the pipeline and its surrounding loose soil it is necessary to explore the wave induced dynamics characteristics of pore pressure and effective stress in the surrounding seabed soil the time histories of pore pressure effective stress and void ratio e at the four typical positions a b c and d are demonstrated in figs 7 10 it is observed that the pore pressure at the four positions all only build up slightly namely the residual pore pressure in the surrounding soil is not significant however the oscillatory pore pressure is considerable it is also observed that the mean effective stress i 1 σ x σ y σ z 3 all reduce from their initial values to a small magnitude about 2 kpa noted negative value means compressible in the process of pore pressure slightly building up it is worthy pointing out that there is no position where the effective stress i 1 could reach zero becoming fully liquefied it means that only partial liquefaction could occur this phenomenon is significantly different with the situation if there is no pipeline buried in seabed as revealed by yang and ye 2017 that the loosely deposited seabed soil can become fully liquefied under wave and current loading it is indicated that the existence of the pipeline has significant effect on the dynamics of the surrounding seabed soil similarly the time histories of the shear stress also show that the absolute value of residual shear stress at the four positions reduce gradually approaching zero in the process of pore pressure sightly building up the oscillatory component in the time history of the wave and current induced shear stress also indicates that the soil at the four positions do not become fully liquefied otherwise the oscillatory component should disappear as that revealed by yang and ye 2017 due to the fact that a fully liquefied soil behaves like a kind of heavy fluid with apparently large viscosity without the ability to transmit shear wave and shear stress it is interesting to find that the void ratio of the soil at the position a and b gradually become smaller and smaller in the loading process meanwhile the void ratio of the soil at the position c and d basically keep unchanged before t 70 s after that their void ratio increase quickly under the wave and current cyclic loading it means that the seabed soil over the pipeline becomes denser and denser soil permeability reduces correspondingly meanwhile the seabed soil beneath the pipeline gradually dilates soil permeability increases correspondingly under cyclic loading this phenomenon can be attributed to the upward displacement of the pipeline driven by the increasing upward floating force applied on the pipeline as illustrated in fig 5 generally the quick increasing of void ratio of soil would result in the quick drop of pore pressure from the perspective of linearity however the pore pressure at the position c and d do not drop as expected as shown in figs 9 and 10 it is further indicated that the interaction between the pipeline and its surrounding loose seabed is nonlinear and complicated except the time history of pore pressure and effective stress the distribution of pore pressure and effective stress in the surrounding seabed soil around the pipeline at several typical times are shown in fig 11 it can be observed in fig 11 that the residual pore pressure doesn t build up uniformly around the pipeline the residual pore pressure in the seabed soil beneath the pipeline is greater than that in the seabed soil over the pipeline indicating that the rate of building up of the pore pressure beneath the pipeline is greater than that in the zone over the pipeline it is also found that the residual pore pressure around the pipeline maximumly doesn t exceed 10 kpa at the initial state t 0s the mean effective stress i 1 around the pipeline are all less than 10 kpa and the i 1 beneath the pipeline is greater than that in the zone over the pipeline due to the gravity compression of the steel pipeline crude oil system after t 100 s the i 1 around the pipeline generally is less than 2 kpa there is no position where i 1 becomes zero it means there is no a position where the surrounding loose seabed soil becomes fully liquefied only partial liquefaction could be observed due to the existence of the pipeline there is shear stress in the seabed soil around the pipeline at the initial time additionally the shear stress around the pipeline is also not uniform the distribution of the shear stress like a flower with four petals at the initial state among the four petals the one in the range of 210 260 is the smallest as demonstrated in fig 11 in the loading process applied by the wave and current the shear stress in the seabed soil around the pipeline significantly reduces actually the variation of this shear stress s distribution around the pipeline is very complicated due to the complexity of the interaction between the pipeline and its surrounding loose seabed soil besides the time history it is also meaningful and necessary to explore the distribution characteristics of the wave induced pore pressure and effective stress in the surrounding seabed soil of the pipeline as illustrated in fig 12 the distribution of pore pressure at t 150 s is not strictly layered any more due to the uneven accumulation of pore pressure in the seabed however the distorted effect on the layered distribution of the pore pressure is very limited because the magnitude of pore pressure accumulation is not significant in the upper seabed as demonstrated in figs 7 10 due to the fact that the steel pipeline in not porous the pore pressure inside and outside of the steel pipeline is isolated the pressure inside of the pipeline keeps as 200 kpa which is not affected by the pore pressure build up in the surrounding seabed soil in the process of pore pressure build up the effective stress in seabed will certainly reduce if there is no buried pipeline yang and ye 2018 however the existence of the pipeline makes the distribution of the mean effective stress i1 in the surrounding seabed of the pipeline much more complicated overall i1 is all reduced relative to their initial value except in some local zone over the pipeline in which the i1 is greater than its initial value this is due to the fact that the seabed soil over the pipeline is extruded by the upward floating pipeline driven by the accumulated residual pore pressure in the surrounding seabed soil in the zone away from the pipeline the distribution of i1 is almost layered as that demonstrated by yang and ye 2018 where there is no buried pipeline in the upper seabed z 18 m 20 m away from the pipeline the magnitude of i1 generally is less than 1 kpa indicating that the seabed soil in this zone becomes liquefied with high possibility in the surrounding seabed soil of the pipeline the effect of the pipeline is very significant the i1 in this zone generally is greater than 1 kpa indicating that the seabed soil in this zone is not likely to liquefy additionally it is observed that there is a small zone with high magnitude of effective stress over the pipeline where the mean effective stress i1 is much greater than that in its near zone this is also due to the upward floating of the pipeline exactly due to the gravity effect the i1 in the zone beneath the pipeline is significantly greater than that in the counterpart zone in the seabed the distribution of shear stress at t 150 s is significantly different with its initial symmetrical distribution there is no any characteristics of symmetry and the maximum magnitude of the shear stress in the surrounding seabed soil of the pipeline is only 1 kpa which is much less than that in the initial state in the zone away from the pipeline the magnitude of shear stress is all near to zero this phenomenon further indicates that the seabed soil away from the pipeline is likely to become liquefied while the surrounding seabed soil of the pipeline is not likely to become liquefied at the end of computation fig 13 illustrates the relation between the shear stress and shear strain at the four typical position a b c and d around the pipeline it is found that the direction of shear strain at position a c is opposite with that at position b d to the end of computation the magnitude of shear strain at the four positions is in the range of 6 13 and the magnitude of shear strain at position c and d beneath the pipeline is greater than that on the position a and b which is over the pipeline on the position a and b the magnitude of the residual shear strain gradually reduces respectively to about 500 pa and 0 pa with the pore pressure build up induced by wave current loading on position c and d the shear strain is very small at early time until the occurrence of stiffness softening of seabed soil after that a significant cyclic mobilization is observed due to the fact that the amplitude of the cyclic mobilization is in the range of 500 1200 pa the seabed soil on the position c and d is not likely to become liquefied at t 150s this conclusion is consistent with that obtained from fig 12 5 4 liquefaction it has been widely proved that loosely deposited seabed soil could become liquefied under continuous hydrodynamic loading by laboratory tests sassa and sekiguchi 1999 and field records sassa et al 2006 generally there are two types of liquefaction mechanisms for seabed soil the first one is the momentary liquefaction which could only occur in very dense sandy soil under wave trough due to the upward seepage force its effect on the stability of offshore structures is not significant however the momentary liquefaction could significantly boost the scouring of seabed soil around offshore structures another one is the residual liquefaction occurring due to the pore pressure accumulation in loosely deposited soil under cyclic loading the liquefaction occurring in the loosely deposited seabed soil in this study is exactly the residual liquefaction generally residual liquefaction in loose seabed foundation has adverse effect on the stability of offshore structures once residual liquefaction occurs in seabed soil the bearing capacity of seabed soil will significantly lost which could result in a series of engineering failures e g the upheaval bulking and the breaking of offshore pipeline generally there are two kinds of criteria to quantitatively access and judge the occurrence of residual liquefaction in loose seabed soil yang and ye 2018 the first one is the pore pressure based criteria this kind of criterion defines a ratio between excess pore pressure and initial effective stress when this ratio is greater than a critical value e g 0 8 residual liquefaction is judged to occur for seabed soil as pointed by ye and wang 2015 this pore pressure based criteria can only be used for the cases in which there is no offshore structure involved if an offshore structure is built on or buried in seabed foundation then the pore pressure based criteria is actually not a reliable criteria to judge the occurrence of residual liquefaction due to the fact that there probably is intensive soil structure interaction ye and wang 2015 presented a reliable case to demonstrate this conclusion in which a large scale offshore breakwater was built on a loosely deposited seabed foundation their results showed that the breakwater subsided about 5 m and laterally moved to one side about 12 m under the attacking of a seismic wave in the process the pore pressure significantly built up exceeding its initial effective stress meanwhile the effective stress gradually increased however rather than reduced in the seabed soil beneath the breakwater caused by the large deformation of seabed foundation as well as the great subsidence and tilting of the overlying breakwater ye and wang 2015 also presented an interesting result that the residual pore pressure reached up to double times of the initial effective stress when the seabed soil becoming fully liquefied at a position based on previous conventional recognition the residual pore pressure in sandy seabed soil cohesion is zero is impossible to be greater than the corresponding initial effective stress if there is no offshore structure exactly due to the presence of the offshore breakwater as well as the intensive soil structure interaction the development of residual pore pressure and effective stress in seabed foundation is highly complex the pore pressure based criteria actually is an indirect judgement criterion it is not suggested to be used in the cases where soil structure interaction is involved the second method is based on the effective stress according to the traditional definition of soil liquefaction the most obvious physical characteristics of soil liquefaction is that the effective stress between soil particles approaches to zero partial liquefaction or exactly is equal to zero fully liquefaction therefore we can adopt this physical characteristics to judge the occurrence of soil liquefaction as a result the effective stress based criterion is a type of direct criteria based on this recognition two specific formulations have been proposed by the authors in previous literatures ye and wang 2015 yang and ye 2018 to access the residual liquefaction of loose seabed soil the first one is that a parameter referred as to residual liquefaction potential l p is defined to describe the liquefaction potential of loose seabed soil under cyclic loading noted compressive stress is taken as negative value 8 l p σ z d σ z 0 α c l p c r i t i c a l where σ z d σ z σ z 0 is wave induced dynamic vertical effective stress σ z 0 is initial vertical effective stress σ z is current vertical effective stress c is cohesion of seabed soil α is a dimensionless material coefficient in equation 8 the cohesion of seabed soil is taken into consideration from the perspective of that it is much more difficult for cohesive soil to become liquefied under cyclic loading cohesion of soil could effectively enhance the liquefaction resistance of soil l r σ z 0 α c liu and jeng 2016 therefore it is better to consider the cohesion c of soil when evaluate liquefaction potential more detailed explanation on α and soil cohesion is available in yang and ye 2018 in this study cohesion c is zero because seabed is assumed as sandy soil then there is no effect of α on the l p of sandy seabed soil for sandy seabed soil the residual liquefaction potential can be expressed as l p 1 σ z σ z 0 if the effective stresses in 3d situation are considered it becomes l p 1 i 1 i 1 0 where i 1 0 is the initial mean effective stress l p c r i t i c a l is a critical value given by engineers and scientists involved when l p is greater than or equal to the given l p c r i t i c a l at a position the seabed soil at this position can be judged to become liquefied on the issue of the value range of l p generally it is in the range of 0 0 1 0 in the case of intensive soil structure nonlinear interaction l p in some local zones could be less than 0 0 due to the fact that σ z could be greater than σ z 0 even through the pore pressure has been significantly built up as the results presented in ye and wang 2015 the second judgement formulation of the effective stress based criteria is i 1 i 1 c r i t i c a l where i 1 c r i t i c a l is also a critical value given by engineers and scientists involved it means that the residual liquefaction will occur at a position where if the current mean effective stress i 1 is less than or equal to the given critical value i 1 c r i t i c a l due to the fact that sandy soil can not bear any tensile stress the mean effective stress i 1 in sandy seabed soil must be negative generally the critical value i 1 c r i t i c a l given by engineers and scientists is a small value close to zero e g 1 kpa in theory the current i 1 must be very small in partially liquefied situation or must be equal to zero in fully liquefied situation therefore this effective stress based judgement formulation for soil liquefaction adopting the current i 1 is more in line with the definition of liquefaction than that of l p although equation 8 and the formulation i 1 i 1 c r i t i c a l are both the effective stress based criterion for soil residual liquefaction none of them are perfect they each have their own strengths and weaknesses for the first judgement formulation equation 8 the value of α currently is impossible to be quantitatively determined in terms of experiments or theoretic analysis because very little attention has been paid on it by scholars therefore the first judgement formulation is not applicable for clay and silty soil additionally the critical value l p c r i t i c a l is not a constant value for all types of soils but need to be given by engineers or scientists based on their engineering experiences and theoretic analysis aa a result unexpected artificial error would be brought according to the suggestion of wu et al 2004 l p c r i t i c a l is in the range of 0 78 0 99 depending on the soil types previous investigation conducted by ye et al 2015 indicated that l p c r i t i c a l 0 86 for nevada sand this value will be adopted to judge the occurrence of residual liquefaction in the surrounding seabed soil of the pipeline for the second judgement formulation unexpected artificial error is also unavoidable when determining the critical value i 1 c r i t i c a l for example the size and shape of the predicted residual liquefaction zone would be significantly different when i 1 c r i t i c a l 1 kpa or i 1 c r i t i c a l 2 kpa another defect of the second judgement formulation is that it is not applicable to judge the liquefaction or not for the upper seabed soil with shallow buried depth e g the absolute mean effective stress i 1 is certainly less than 1 kpa for the seabed soil with a buried depth less than 5 cm near to seabed surface at the initial state as a result the seabed soil will be wrongly judged to become liquefied all the time if we take i 1 c r i t i c a l 1 kpa even though there would be no a wave loading on the seabed surface however the second judgement formulation has huge advantages to judge the occurrence of liquefaction for the seabed soil which has a great initial effective stress e g 100 kpa the distribution of the wave current induced liquefaction zone predicted by adopting the two effective stress based criteria at time t 150 s are shown in figs 14 and 15 in fig 14 the critical l p is set as 0 86 following the suggestion of ye et al 2015 it is observed that the upper seabed soil with shallow buried depth away from the pipeline all becomes liquefied with a liquefaction depth about 1 0 2 0 m meanwhile the seabed soil surrounding the pipeline is all not liquefied it is indicated that the presence of the pipeline indeed has significant effect on the wave induced dynamics of its surrounding seabed soil it is worth to point out that the seabed soil over the pipeline is also not liquefied even though this part of seabed soil is directly applied by the wave current hydrodynamic loading this phenomenon is attributed to that the upward floating of the pipeline brings extrusion effect to the seabed soil over the pipeline making the effective stress in it is compressive with a great magnitude this high stress zone over the pipeline actually can be clearly observed in the i 1 distribution in fig 12 even though the l p in the surrounding seabed soil of the pipeline does not exceed the set critical value 0 86 liquefaction does not occur it does not mean that the stiffness of the surrounding seabed soil not to attenuate actually softening is always occurring in the surrounding seabed soil of the pipeline accompanying the accumulation of pore pressure and reduction of effective stress the interaction between the pipeline and its surrounding seabed soil must be properly considered in computation otherwise the computational results is not reliable and convincing or even wrong there is no unified standard for the artificial selection of the value of i 1 c r i t i c a l in the domain of offshore geotechnics so far as stated above the size and the shape of the predicted liquefaction zone will largely depend on the selected value of i 1 c r i t i c a l in theory soil can become fully liquefied only when the i 1 reduces to zero from a great initial value however it is difficult for seabed soil to reach this extreme state in which i 1 0 kpa actually large deformation in seabed foundation would have occurred before i 1 approaching zero presenting the liquefaction characteristics of soil under this situation liquefaction is deemed has been occurred in the perspective of engineering practices therefore the value of i 1 c r i t i c a l absolutely can not be set as zero otherwise there would be on liquefaction occurs in seabed foundation under any hydrodynamic loading on the other hand the reasonable selection of the value of i 1 c r i t i c a l decided by engineers and scientists needs based on the engineering experiences and experimental data together in this study we set the value of i 1 c r i t i c a l as 1 0 kpa to predict the liquefaction zone distribution near to the pipeline as shown in fig 15 it is observed that the distribution of the liquefaction zone predicted adopting i 1 is similar with that predicted adopting l p the only differences include 1 the liquefaction depth is about the 1 2 m which is much less that in fig 14 2 the area of the non liquefied zone surrounding the pipeline is significantly smaller than that predicted adopting l p it is indicated that the effective stress based criteria adopting l p and i 1 are both acceptable to predict the liquefaction zone surrounding the pipeline even though there is intensive soil structure interaction 5 5 effect of the pipeline gas system in the practice of engineering marine pipeline is not only used to transport crude oil but also natural gas density is 0 7174 kg m3 at 1 atm pressure in this study the wave current induced dynamics of the pipeline gas system buried in the same loosely deposited seabed foundation is also investigated to seek the differences of dynamics between the pipeline oil system and the pipeline gas system applied by hydrodynamic loading firstly the distribution of displacements pore pressure and effective stresses of the pipeline gas seabed system at the initial state as have been shown in figs 16 and 17 are compared with that of the pipeline oil seabed system in fig 16 it is found that the distribution of the initial displacement is completely different with that if crude oil is transported in the pipeline in the case crude oil is transported the downward subsidence of the pipeline at the initial state is about 28 2 mm which is more than the subsidence of its surrounding seabed soil see fig 4 in zhang et al 2019 it means that the pipeline oil system slightly sinks downward relative to its surrounding soil caused by the considerable weight of the pipeline oil system oppositely the downward subsidence of the pipeline is only 27 mm which is less than the subsidence of its surrounding seabed soil as illustrated in fig 16 it means that the pipeline gas system slightly floats upward relative to its surrounding soil of course this phenomenon is due to that the density of natural gas is much less than that of crude oil the weight of the pipeline gas system is certainly less than that of pipeline oil system however the buoyancy applied by the hydrostatic water pressure on the steel pipeline is the same due to the fact that the volume of pore water expelled by the pipeline has no change as a result the pipeline gas system certainly will have a strong trend to float upward even at the initial state exactly because of this upward floating trend of the pipeline gas system the low stress zone beneath the pipeline is larger in size than that if crude oil is transported see fig 5 in zhang et al 2019 as demonstrated in fig 17 also due to this slight sinking and slight floating of the pipeline relative to its surrounding seabed soil the distribution of the initial horizontal displacement around the pipeline is significantly different however they both have symmetry along x 100 m similarly it is observed in fig 17 that the distribution of pore pressure in the seabed is also layered without any excess pore pressure the distribution of the initial shear stress τ x z around the pipeline shown in fig 17 is also different with the distribution where crude oil is transported the domain of influence of τ x z beneath the pipeline is obviously larger than that over the pipeline nevertheless the domain of influence of the initial τ x z beneath and over the pipeline basically is same for pipeline oil system this difference is also caused by the slight sinking and slight floating of the pipeline relative to its surrounding seabed soil at the initial state the comparison of the time history of the wave current induced displacement of the pipeline is illustrated in fig 18 it is observed that the difference of the horizontal displacement of the pipeline is minor however the difference of the vertical displacement is significant between the pipeline oil system and the pipeline gas system whether it is crude oil or natural gas transported the pipeline firstly sinks relative to its initial position under hydrodynamic loading in the early stage until to the moment when the upward buoyancy applied on the pipeline become greater than the gravity of the pipeline oil gas system after that the pipeline will gradually float up to the end of computation the pipeline transporting natural gas floats up about 100 mm relative to its initial position which is much greater than that of the pipeline transporting crude oil about 25 mm as illustrated in fig 19 the difference of the upward buoyancy applied on the pipeline by the wave current induced excess pore pressure is not very significant however the gravity of the pipeline gas system is much less than that of the pipeline oil system as a result the pipeline transporting natural gas certainly will float up much more this substantial floating of the pipeline gas system with a magnitude of 100 mm will extrude the seabed soil over the pipeline with a more obvious way making the seabed over the pipeline hunch more significantly than that if crude oil is transported as that demonstrated in fig 20 it is worth to point out that a pipeline could float up to the surface and finally seating on seabed this penetration process of the pipeline actually is very difficult to be numerically modelled due to the fact the fe method is not good at handling such great distortion of mesh adopting ale method although cel method could handle large deformation problems to some extends the complicated fluid solid interaction structure soil interaction as well as nonlinear dynamic behaviours can not be effectively handled by cel method fig 21 illustrates the time history comparison of the wave current induced pore pressure effective stress and void ratio at the typical position d it is found that the time history of the pore pressure and shear stress basically is the same for the pipeline oil gas systems due to the greater gravity of the pipeline oil system the initial mean effective stress i 1 at the position d under the pipeline is greater than that if natural gas is transported in addition to this point there is no essential difference on the time history of i 1 the most significant difference is presented on the time history of void ratio at the position d under the pipeline the seabed soil dilates very significantly regardless of crude oil or natural gas being transported accompanying the floating up of the pipeline however the magnitude of dilation of the seabed soil under the pipeline transporting natural gas is much greater than that if crude oil is transported this phenomenon is attributed to the much more greater magnitude of the upward floating of the pipeline transporting natural gas as analyzed above it is indispensable to compare the distribution of liquefaction zone in the seabed soil around the pipeline in which crude oil or natural gas is transported fig 22 shows the liquefaction zone predicted by adopting i 1 the second effective stress based criterion it is observed that the liquefaction zone around the pipeline gas system basically is the same with that illustrated in fig 15 only the upper seabed soil with a thickness about 1 4 m away from the pipeline gas system becomes liquefied the seabed soil around the pipeline gas system is also not liquefied overall the biggest difference on the dynamics of the pipeline and its surrounding seabed soil between the pipeline gas system and the pipeline oil system is reflected on the upward floating of the pipeline driven by the excess pore pressure induced by hydrodynamic loading 5 6 post densification once the hydrodynamic loading stopping to apply the accumulated excess pore pressure in seabed soil will gradually dissipate accompanying the gradual drainage of pore water out of seabed through the seabed surface in this process the effective stress in seabed soil will increase correspondingly and the offshore structures built on or buried in seabed foundation will also correspondingly subside finally the seabed foundation soil will become more dense and get higher bearing capacity once the excess pore pressure is completely dissipated fig 23 demonstrates the post densification precess of the pore pressure dissipation effective stress growth as well as the subsidence of the pipeline transporting crude oil or natural gas it is observed that the pore pressure indeed gradually dissipates and the effective stress gradually grows in the surrounding seabed soil of the pipeline the pipeline indeed gradually subsides downward after the wave current stopping to apply hydrodynamic loading this post densification process of the pipeline oil gas seabed system is an important result for the problem of offshore pipeline dynamics due to the fact there is no attention has been paid on the issue in previous literature it will promote us to further understand the mechanism and dynamics characteristics of offshore pipeline subjected to ocean wave hydrodynamic loading 6 conclusion in this study the dynamics of a pipeline transporting crude oil or natural gas shallowly buried in loosely deposited seabed foundation under third order ocean wave current loading is numerically investigated adopting the integrated model fssi cas 2d which was firstly developed by jeng et al 2013 and ye et al 2013b specially for the problem of fluid structure seabed foundation interaction through comprehensive analysis for the computational results the following recognitions are obtained 1 the pore pressure in the surrounding seabed soil of the shallowly buried pipeline does not accumulate significantly however the effective stress reduces about 50 80 relative to its initial value it is indicated that stiffness softening has occurred in the surrounding seabed soil of the pipeline this softening provides extremely favorable conditions for the horizontal vertical vibrations and the upward floating of pipeline the significant floating up of the pipeline results in the occurrence of large deformation in the surrounding seabed soil the soil over the pipeline gradually becomes denser meanwhile the soil beneath the pipeline significantly dilates accompanying the upward floating of the pipeline 2 the buoyancy applied on the pipeline is not a constant but is gradually increased under continuous hydrodynamic loading the increase of the buoyancy is attributed to the accumulation of the pore pressure in the surrounding seabed soil around the pipeline the pipeline sinks downward relative to its initial position at the early stage regardless of transporting crude oil or natural gas until to the moment when the upward buoyancy applied on the pipeline become greater than the gravity of the pipeline oil gas system after that the pipeline continuously floats up driven by the significant buoyancy it is noted that the magnitude of floating displacement of the pipeline transporting natural gas is much greater than the pipeline transporting crude oil due to the much lighter weight of natural gas than that of crude oil this substantial floating of the pipeline gas system extrudes the seabed soil over the pipeline with a more obvious way making the seabed over the pipeline hunch more significantly than that if crude oil is transported 3 two effective stress based criteria are proposed to judge the occurrence of soil liquefaction their own advantages and disadvantages all have been presented in the study adopting the two criteria the liquefaction zone in the seabed soil closed to the pipeline is successfully predicted it is found that the surrounding seabed soil around the pipeline does not become liquefied only the soil in the upper seabed with shallow depth away from the pipeline becomes liquefied with a liquefaction depth 1 2 1 5 m additionally the shapes and the sizes of the liquefaction zone predicted adopting the two proposed effective stress based criteria are basically the same without significant difference it is indicated that the two effective stress based criteria adopting l p and i 1 are both acceptable to predict the liquefaction zone surrounding the pipeline 4 through the comparative analysis between the pipeline oil seabed system and the pipeline gas seabed system it is found that the biggest difference on the dynamics of the pipeline and its surrounding seabed soil between them is reflected on the upward floating of the pipeline driven by the excess pore pressure induced by hydrodynamic loading secondly the magnitude of dilation of the seabed soil under the pipeline transporting natural gas is much greater than that if crude oil is transported 5 there is basically little attention has been paid on the consolidation process of seabed foundation after wave stopping to apply in previous literature the post densification process of the pipeline oil gas seabed system is firstly presented in this study it will promote us to further understand the mechanism and dynamics characteristics of offshore pipeline subjected to ocean wave hydrodynamic loading 6 the computational results show that the integrated mode fssi cas 2d has successfully and subtly captured a series of nonlinear physical phenomena of the intensive interaction between the pipeline transporting crude oil or natural gas and the loosely deposited seabed soil e g the vibration sinking and floating of the pipeline the large deformation liquefaction in the surrounding seabed soil etc it is indicated that the integrated model fssi cas 2d developed by ye et al 2013b and jeng et al 2013 has an advantage to investigate the complicated interaction between fluid structure seabed foundation 7 it is essential to point out that this work is just an early work in the field of numerical analysis of the dynamics of submarine pipelines as well as in the area of evaluation of the stability of submarine pipelines under hydrodynamic load the main purpose is to comprehensively understand the basic mechanism how a pipeline buried in loose seabed floor responds to hydrodynamic load under some ideal conditions there should be certain gap with the application in practical engineering because either there are a number of conditions set in the numerical modelling are slightly different with the realistic conditions or some important factors that could affect the dynamics of pipelines are not taken into consideration in this study e g the complex topography of seabed floor affected by scouring the effect of pipeline laying ploughing or jetting backfilling on the mechanical properties of the surrounding soil of pipelines and the axial effect on the behaviour of pipelines upheaval bulking caused

infrastructure has led to the use of seawater and sea sand concrete swssc in coastal areas guo et al 2018 the degradation of steel reinforcement due to corrosion poses a sizeable impact on the deterioration of reinforced concrete rc structures thus leading to cost effectiveness of projects because of frequent maintenance and repair angst 2018 while investigating different case studies of premature deterioration of rc structures 70 90 cases reported the corrosion mechanism as one of the major causes of deterioration koch et al 2002 over the past three decades glass fiber reinforced polymer gfrp bars owing to their corrosion resistivity being lightweight ease of handling and high strength cost ratio have replaced steel reinforcement in many engineering structures mittal et al 2015 uomoto et al 2002 gfrp bars are extensively used as internal reinforcement in concrete bridge beams tunnel linings waterfront structures bridge decks marine aquariums electrical substations and retrofitting historical buildings trejo et al 2000 frp reinforced seawater and sea sand concrete frp swssc combines the advantages of corrosion free frp bars in the marine environment and the direct utilisation of seawater and sea sand which can lead to a more sustainable and economic efficient construction material ahmed et al 2020 frp swssc composite possesses the resource is environmentally beneficial and also bears desirable durability performance li et al 2020 due to the widespread adoption of gfrp bars they are subjected to harsh environmental conditions alkaline saline and marine environments swssc and its prevailing environment are alkaline in moist conditions whereas ph values of moist concrete ranges from 10 5 to 13 diamond 1981 robert et al 2009 taylor 1987 among the conditioning environments the alkaline and moist concrete environment were found as the most pernicious for matrix and fiber chen et al 2007 fergani et al 2018 kamal and boulfiza 2011 robert et al 2009 serbescu et al 2015 mechanical properties of gfrp have been reported by numerous researchers ahmed et al 2020 al salloum et al 2013 bazli et al 2017 bazli et al 2020 benmokrane et al 2017a benmokrane et al 2015 benmokrane et al 2017b chen et al 2006 chen et al 2007 d antino et al 2018 dong et al 2018 el hassan et al 2017 el hassan and el maaddawy 2019 huang et al 2018 jia et al 2020 kim

and lin 2017 yang et al 2018 and it was found that these bars degrade in various harsh environments tensile strength ts inter laminar shear strength flexural strength and bond strength were reported in the past studies for evaluating the durability aspect previously the behavior of ts was investigated al salloum et al 2013 benmokrane et al 2015 2017b chen et al 2006 2007 el hassan et al 2017 fergani et al 2018 kim et al 2008 robert and benmokrane 2010 2013 2013 robert et al 2009 sawpan et al 2014 inside an alkaline environment furthermore degradation of ts of gfrp bars depends on several factors which include the exposure temperature kamal and boulfiza 2011 ph of conditioning environment chen et al 2006 2007 the moisture content of the surrounding concrete robert and benmokrane 2013 robert et al 2009 the sustained stress level benmokrane et al 2002 debaiky et al 2006 the bar diameter benmokrane et al 2017b micelli 2004 the type of resin benmokrane et al 2015 2017a and the conditioning duration al salloum et al 2013 gfrp is made up of glass fibers that are impregnated in a specific type of resin the most commonly used glass fibers include e glass and electrical grade corrosion resistant fibers wallenberger et al 2001 while different types of resins used are epoxy vinyl ester and polyester benmokrane et al 1996 many studies abbasi and hogg 2005 al salloum et al 2013 al zahrani et al 2002 chen et al 2007 kim et al 2008 won et al 2008 evaluated the durability of gfrp bars incorporating e glass fibers impregnated in vinyl ester resin using different volume fraction of glass fibers the degradation of gfrp occurs when free hydroxide ion oh in moist or alkaline media enters the polymer matrix and molecules of the longer polymer polymer chain are broken through the hydrolysis reaction consequently further water molecules and free oh tends to ingress into the fiber which breaks the secondary polymer chains thus creating voids this phenomenon is called plasticization chen et al 2007 according to the arrhenius equation moisture ingress into the bar increases with an increase in conditioning temperature in the presence of moisture the glass fiber reacts with water to release alkali oh hence deteriorating the glass fiber by dissolution in water i e leaching the leaching process increases the ph of the surrounding media and affects the silica network resulting in the dissolution of fiber inside alkaline media i e etching leaching and etching processes aggravate in moist and alkaline media kamal and boulfiza 2011 fergani et al 2018 investigated gfrp bars containing vinyl ester as a matrix in alkaline media subjected to temperatures of 20 40 and 60 c for 365 days energy dispersive x rays analysis and scanning electron microscopy analysis clearly showed the dissolution of glass fiber in the ultimate conditioning environment for a given type of glass fiber impregnated in a specific type of resin the degradation of the tensile strength of the bar depends on the diameter of the bar ph of the alkaline solution the volume fraction of the fibers the conditioning temperature and the duration of immersion the smaller diameter of the bars exhibit a high surface to volume s v ratio and are more susceptible to moisture absorption benmokrane et al 2017b besides the degradation of the gfrp bars initiates from the interface of alkaline medium and the bar hence smaller diameter bars will result in increased degradation of tensile strength after degradation of the peripheral fibers benmokrane et al 2017b reported the negative impact of larger diameter bars on residual tensile strength due to shear lag effect moreover a high alkaline environment aggravates both the leaching and etching due to high ph chen et al 2007 similarly gfrp bars having variable volume fraction of glass fibers are susceptible to variable degradation gfrp bars containing smaller volume fraction of fibers lead to higher volume of resin material resin is susceptible to severe degradation by moisture in comparison to fibers akepati et al 2012 sciolti et al 2010 an increase in conditioning temperature and exposure duration poses a decreasing effect on the tensile strength degradation of gfrp bars almusallam et al 2013 degradation of the bar in concrete is a long term phenomenon and it requires a long duration to investigate the durability of the bar to accelerate the degradation rate of gfrp bars laboratory ageing tests were performed by researchers to assess the short term tensile strength retention of gfrp bars in the alkaline environment at elevated temperatures well below their transition temperatures al salloum et al 2013 chen et al 2006 2007 kim et al 2008 wang et al 2017b gfrp alone and concrete embedded bars were subjected to combined harsh alkaline environments ph 12 6 13 alongside the elevated temperatures aci 440 3r 12 recommends a standard accelerating ageing test which includes elevated temperature conditioning at 20 40 and 60 c for up to 183 days besides few studies also considered an elevated temperature of 80 c kim et al 2008 robert and benmokrane 2013 the short term accelerated data is predicted for long term performance with the help of the arrhenius equation bai et al 2008 chen et al 2007 dejke and tepfers 2001 tu et al 2019 zhou et al 2011 it infers that accelerating ageing requires extensive testing under controlled environment for a long duration the current advancement in the field of artificial intelligence ai has enabled reliable and explicit models for structural engineering problems gholampour et al 2017 different ai tools namely artificial neural network ann genetic algorithms gas genetic programming gp genetic expression programming gep and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis were employed by researchers for solving complex engineering problems akande et al 2014 başyigit et al 2010 jeyasehar and sumangala 2006 lee 2003 naderpour and mirrashid 2019 sarir et al 2019a 2019b shahmansouri et al 2019 shariati et al 2019 2020 sobhani et al 2010 topçu et al 2009 zhang et al 2020 gep overcomes the shortcomings of gas and gp and it is comparatively two to four times faster and more efficacious ferreira 2006 gep utilizes the best fit populations of individuals using genetic variation with the help of genetic operators to yield output data mitchell 1998 whereas ann recognizes the pattern of input variables using neurons and passes it on to the hidden layer depending on the importance of inputs in desired output data anfis uses the degree of truth between 0 and 1 of the input parameters to transform it to the desired output using an interconnected neural network hence utilizing the benefit of both fuzzy logic and the neural network jang 1993 several researchers have previously köroğlu 2019 naderpour and alavi 2017 yan and lin 2016 yan et al 2017 studied the bond strength of gfrp bars in concrete using ai techniques katsuki and uomoto 2004 measured the depth of penetration of the alkaline solution into the bar and assumed that the affected portion lacks any tensile strength based on the diffusion model fick s first law a model was developed for evaluating residual tensile strength at a specific temperature however the predicted model omitted the effect of changing temperature to the authors best knowledge no model is available to date on the degradation of the tensile strength of the gfrp bar in alkaline environment under accelerating ageing incorporating artificial intelligence techniques therefore the current study concentrates on developing a model for the tensile strength retention 1 of gfrp bars conditioned in accelerating ageing in bare condition tests by using ann gep and anfis for this purpose a comprehensive database was collected from internationally published papers finally the performance of the model was validated using various statistical checks 1 t e n s i l e s t r e n g t h re t e n t i o n t s r re s i d u a l t e n s i l e s t r e n g t h a f t e r c o n d i t i o n i n g t e n s i l e s t r e n g t h o f c o n t r o l l e d s a m p l e s 2 research methodology the experimental database used in the study and the development of ai models are present in the section 2 1 experimental database the data of accelerating ageing tests on gfrp bars subjected to alkaline environments under elevated temperatures in bare condition were collected from the literature abbasi and hogg 2005 aguiniga gaona 2004 al salloum et al 2013 al zahrani et al 2002 chen et al 2006 2007 jin et al 2020 kim et al 2008 won et al 2008 the data set includes a total of 100 data points acquired from averaging the results achieved of 328 tested specimens whose details are provided in appendix as table 1 a 70 of the data points were used for training of the models whereas the remaining 30 were equally divided into validation and testing sets respectively table 2 a in appendix the reason for limited data points is due to the restrictions of the developed model for gfrp bars made up of e glass fibers impregnated in vinyl ester resin conditioned in harsh environment and bare conditions the ratio of the number of data points to the number of input variables used in the current study for modeling is well within the prescribed limits in existing literature frank and todeschini 1994 gandomi and roke 2015 all inputs used in the models have already been reported by the researchers in the literature with the exception of volume fraction vf which is not directly reported this particular parameter is calculated from volume fraction by mass using the density of vinyl ester resin and density of the fiber it is worthy of mentioning that literature comprises two types of conditioning accelerating aging tests of bare gfrp bars in a harsh alkaline environment and gfrp embedded in concrete and then subjected to alkaline conditions the former is an aggressive environment as compared to the latter because of the additional protection of gfrp provided by concrete moreover stressed and unstressed specimens during conditioning also manifested different results fergani et al 2018 the current study focused on the first type of conditioning i e bare gfrp bars conditioned in alkaline environments under elevated temperature in unstressed conditions the results of such a conditioning type would be conservative in estimating the service life of gfrp bars different types of fibers and resins were used in the manufacturing of gfrp bars during the pultrusion process but the current study focuses on gfrp bars made up of e glass fibers impregnated in vinyl ester resin a separate study is though required for the bars embedded in concrete and subjected to an alkaline environment under elevated temperatures moreover the variation in the results of stressed and unstressed conditions and the effects of types of fibers and resin matrices could also be studied the tensile strength retention given by 1 is considered as a function of the diameter of the bar db the volume fraction vf of the e glass fibers ph of the solution the temperature in c temp and the time t in days table 2 manifests water absorption of gfrp bars with the increase in diameter of the bar astm 2010 recommends a specific temperature of 23 c for a duration of 24 h for moisture absorption at saturation the percentage increase in water absorption is not much significant as compared to moisture absorption after 24 h in this regard robert et al 2010 found no significant difference in moisture uptake of gfrp beyond 30 days of immersion at 23 40 and 60 c temperatures however moisture uptake of gfrp bars at 80 c linearly increased for up to 50 days beyond which the curve flattened the absorption of moisture is greatly dependent upon temperature diameter of the bar as well as the duration of conditioning which subsequently affects the retention of tensile strength hence the effect of moisture uptake is indirectly incorporated using diameter of the bar temperature and duration of conditioning the distribution of these input parameters is shown in fig 1 it shows slightly right skewness for diameter of the bar volume fraction of fibers temperature and duration of exposure whereas slightly left skewness for ph and tsr the distribution is supported by the values of the statistical functions skewness and kurtosis as shown in table 1 it also presents the ranges of input and output variables feed into the models the collected data includes conditioning at temperatures well below the glass transition temperature tg of resin material it is recommended to use these given ranges of input variables for reliable prediction of the output variable 2 2 development of ai models 2 2 1 rationalization of input variables as mentioned above in section 2 1 the tensile strength retention tsr of the gfrp bar depends on the input variables expressed in 2 all of these input parameters in the development of the models were selected after performing a critical and extensive literature review the moisture ingress into the bar depends directly on the surface to volume ratio s v of the bar 3 table 2 shows the variation of moisture absorption versus the change in diameter of the gfrp bars with almost similar fiber content by weight benmokrane et al 2017b consequently moisture ingress affects the degradation of gfrp bars furthermore the moisture ingress initiates from the peripheral circumference of the bar hence outer fibers are susceptible to degrade faster than the inner fibers the deteriorated outer portion is bigger for the smaller diameter of the bar as compared to the larger diameter bar on the other hand the shear lag effect due to stress concentration at the outer fibers has a negative impact on the residual tensile strength of larger diameter bars achillides and pilakoutas 2004 benmokrane et al 2017b castro and carino 1998 hence it cannot be confirmed from the literature that increasing bar diameter has a negative or positive impact on the residual tensile strength therefore incorporation of the diameter as an input with the known output is a desideratum variable 2 t s r f d b v f p h t e m p t 3 s v π d b l b π d b 2 4 l b 4 d b a similar concept of stiffness attracts the load applies to the gfrp bar which comprises high stiffness fibers and low stiffness resin matrix being the major contributor to the stiffness of the bar the central part of the load is carried by fibers hence the major tensile strength of the bar is developed mainly by fibers the resin material transfers the load from one fiber to another and it is more susceptible to degradation due to plasticization in contrast to the fibers a smaller volume fraction of fibers leads to a larger volume fraction of resin matrix the degradation of resin matrix reduces its load transfer capability and therefore decreases the tensile strength of the bar the ph of the conditioning solution intensifies the mechanism of degradation in the presence of free oh ions the resin matrix reacts to form a hydrolysis product furthermore the dissolution of glass also occurs in a high ph environment chen et al 2007 witnessed a tensile strength loss of 36 and 27 for gfrp vinyl ester bars after conditioning at 60 c for 70 days accelerating ageing in normal concrete pore solution ph 13 6 and high performance concrete pore solution ph 12 7 respectively the temperature and duration of conditioning are among the most critical factors in the degradation of gfrp bars the rate of degradation can be increased by increasing the temperature according to the arrhenius equation 4 where k is the degradation rate and is defined as the inverse of time needed for a mechanical property to degrade to a given value 100 loss for service life prediction e a is the activation energy r is the universal gas constant t is the temperature in kelvin arrhenius equation was modified by chen et al 2006 based on the study conducted by phani and bose 1987 which was used by several researchers for predicting the degraded tensile strength of gfrp bars davalos et al 2012 wang et al 2017b 2018b the equation proposed by chen et al 2006 was modified by tu et al 2019 for determining tensile strength degradation based on elastic modulus degradation of gfrp bars also the timeshift factor tsf was introduced by dejke dejke and tepfers 2001 for long term prediction of mechanical properties of gfrp bars all these models require extensive laboratory ageing testing for long term prediction of durability of gfrp the current study aimed to develop a model based on the existing literature that can quickly foresee the tensile strength retention and later on can be used for service life prediction of the gfrp bars 4 1 k 1 a exp e a r t 2 2 2 artificial intelligence ai approaches firstly gep model was developed using a random distribution of data points among the training and validation sets using genexprotools the advantage of gep to present the model in a simple mathematical equation can be used for practical purposes with a high degree of accuracy the gep model was primarily used in the current study to predict the tsr in the form of a mathematical equation iqbal et al 2020 the notable features of the gep model were finally chosen after several runs of the model based on different linking functions of ets number of genes number of chromosomes head size and the functions used in the model the increased number of chromosomes head size and the number of genes enhance the complexity of the model the number of genes indicates the number of ets in the model considering the complexity of output mathematical equation the current model was developed using 3 genes and 100 chromosomes within the sub ets the linking functions x 1 3 inv x 2 were used and the sub ets were linked with addition the rest of the features used in the gep model is listed in table 3 secondly the ann model was developed by a random data distribution of training validation and testing data points in a predetermined ratio listed in table 4 using the input output fitting curve nn tool the levenberg marquardt algorithm was used in the model because of its precision and efficacy fast convergence in fewer epochs as compared to other algorithms daliakopoulos et al 2005 the 10 number of neurons in the hidden layer were selected on trial and error basis to avoid overfitting of the model thirdly the three data sets training validation and testing distributed by ann were employed for anfis modeling to compare the results grid partitioning was used for generating a fuzzy inference system fis a hybrid method of fis optimization was used for training fis details can be seen in table 5 regarding setting parameters for anfis model the ann and the anfis models were developed by using machine learning and fuzzy logic tools of matlab r2020b respectively 2 2 3 evaluation criteria the ai models developed were evaluated using correlation coefficient r gandomi and alavi 2012 mean absolute error mae willmott and matsuura 2005 willmott et al 2009 root mean square error rmse chai et al 2013 mckeen et al 2005 savage et al 2013 relative squared error rse relative root mean square error rrmse iqbal et al 2020 and performance indicator ρ babanajad et al 2017 iqbal et al 2020 the performance indicator was used to evaluate the performance of both r and rmse the mathematical expressions for these parameters are presented in 5 to 10 5 r i 1 n e i e i m i m i i 1 n e i e i 2 m i m i 2 6 m a e i 1 n e i m i n 7 r m s e i 1 n e i m i 2 n 8 r s e i 1 n e i m i 2 i 1 n e m i 2 9 r r m s e 1 e i 1 n e i m i 2 n 10 ρ r r m s e 1 r where ei and mi are nth experimental and model tsr respectively e i and m i denote the average values of experimental and model tsr respectively n is the number of samples in the data set low values of mae rmse rse rrmse and high value of r depict an accurate interpretation of the model the values of r ranges from 0 to 1 the former indicates perfect correlation while the latter implies no correlation between the inputs and outputs the value of r greater than 0 8 represents a relatively high level of accuracy in estimating the predicted values babanajad et al 2017 taylor 1990 however other statistical checks i e rmse and mae shall be used to evaluate the accuracy of the model heddam et al 2019 as mentioned in section 2 3 gep and ann were allowed to generate their training and validation sets through random selection in this exercise the training model tends to overfit during repeated training thus maximizing the error in the validation testing data set gandomi and alavi 2012 to counter it a model with minimum objective function obf needs to be selected among the trials gandomi and roke 2015 the value of the objective function ranges from 0 to maximum and the value approaching zero represents the relatively excellent model the objective function 11 was adopted to take into account both the number of training data set and validation data as well as the values of r and rrmse hence it can reflect the overall performance of the model iqbal et al 2020 11 o b f n t n v n ρ t 2 n v n ρ v where the subscripts t and v represent the training and validation data respectively and n denotes the total number of sample points in addition to the above mentioned fitting parameters the slope of the regression line experimental vs predicted was also used to evaluate the performance of the models 3 results and discussions 3 1 comparison between predicted and experimental results the predicted results of the models were plotted against experimental results and are shown in fig 2 all three models are strongly correlating with the experimental results i e 0 91 0 83 and 0 83 slopes of the regression line for training sets of ann gep and anfis the validation and testing data sets also showed a strong correlation of the slopes of the regression line as compared to the ideal fit 1 1 slope as depicted in fig 2 the testing data yielded 0 80 0 72 and 0 93 slopes of the regression line whereas these values are 0 89 0 81 and 0 93 for the validation data for the ann gep and anfis models respectively the results of mae i e 1 89 5 28 and 2 24 tsr for training sets of ann gep and anfis respectively also reflect the close agreement of predicted results to the experimental values the extent of errors mae rse rrmse is minimum for training data set succeeded by testing validation data sets in case of ann a similar pattern was observed for the anfis model whereas the gep model showed minimum errors in the testing data set followed by the training and validation data sets this behavior of gep interprets that the extent of non overfitting is maximum in the gep model and it was achieved because of monitoring the best fitness value at the interface of genexprotools during modeling moreover the values of correlation coefficient r i e 0 95 0 93 and 0 85 for training data sets of ann gep and anfis respectively represent a strong degree of correlation among the variables babanajad et al 2017 it is pertinent to mention that more than 90 of the data points are scattered in the range of 60 100 tsr the same data scatter was observed for experimental results as depicted in fig 5 fig 3 illustrates an error histogram of the three models which shows that almost 70 of the data predicted by the models yields an error in the range of 4 to 4 babanajad et al 2017 identified that a ratio of objects to the selected parameters shall be minimum equals to 5 in order to ensure the reliability of the final models in the current work the ratio is 100 5 20 which is far beyond the minimum requirement 3 2 formulation of tsr gep was primarily used for generating the empirical relationships among the five inputs and the output tsr in a form of mathematical expression the output of the gep algorithm for tsr is presented in the form of an expression tree as shown in fig 4 it can be seen that ets comprise three sub ets depending upon 3 genes used in the gep model moreover the linking functions reflected in the ets are the same as the ones used in the model listed as table 3 the variables d0 d1 d2 d3 and d4 in ets are db vf ph temp and t respectively the constants c2 c3 and c7 in sub et are 1 89 2 45 and 7 68 respectively the constants c8 c5 c7 and c1 in sub et 2 are 9 36 5 64 2 24 and 5 52 respectively the constants c4 in sub et 3 is 3 58 these constants are determined by the matlab code of the proposed model the matlab model derived from the gep algorithm and the ets was used to develop the mathematical relationship among the variables equations 12 15 can be used to predict the tsr of gfrp bars impregnated in vinyl ester resin in an alkaline environment the reliability of the model mainly depends on the number of data points gholampour et al 2017 the current model satisfies the minimum requirement of the ideal model as described in section 3 4 frank and todeschini 1994 gandomi and roke 2015 12 t s r x y z 13 x 1 p h 1 89

6 the importance is further reflected from training validation while its combination is almost similar all input variables except ph have a significant role in the residual tensile strength of conditioned gfrp bars the importance of ph in the developed model is substantially minimal it may be attributed to the database of ph considered in this study ph 12 13 6 both extremes of the ph lie in a high alkaline environment the diameter of the bar and volume fraction directly contributed to tsr while ph of the solution temperature and duration of conditioning were found to have an inverse relation with tsr 3 4 performance evaluation of models a minimum ratio was proposed between data points and the number of input variables as 3 for an acceptable model for the ideal model this ratio was proposed as 5 gandomi and roke 2015 100 data points and 5 input variables were used for developing models hence the ratio in this study is comparable to the ideal one statistical parameters used for the evaluation of models are shown in table 7 and table 8 3 4 1 ann model the x y plot of experimental vs predicted tsr showed a high slope of regression plot of 0 91 as compared to the 1 1 ideal fit plot of training data set representing strong prognostic efficacy of the model it can also be seen from the results presented in fig 2 that a strong correlation exists between the predicted and experimental results of training validation and testing data sets the values of r for training validation and testing data sets are 0 95 0 85 and 0 93 respectively the values of r show that the model is trained with a strong correlation between predicted and observed values the values of mae observed for training validation and testing data sets are 1 89 6 02 and 5 53 respectively the magnitude of mae rse and rmse reflects slight errors in the model the values of rmse are greater than mae by definition chai and draxler 2014 the magnitude of ρ is 0 057 0 060 and 0 056 for the three data sets which are close to zero the magnitude of the objective function obf for the current model is 0 049 satisfying the criteria that the model is not overfitted similar results of ρ were reported in the literature as well azim et al 2020 the complete data set along with the model errors are reported in fig 5 almost 75 of the data points lie within absolute error of 4 tsr fig 3 thus the current model can be satisfactorily used for testing a new data set 3 4 2 gep model the scatter diagram of experimental vs predicted tsr of the gep model on the x y cartesian plane resulted in a slope of 0 83 of a regression line for the training data set fig 2 as manifested from table 7 the values of r are 0 86 0 95 and 0 93 it demonstrates a strong correlation between predicted and observed values from the experiments in comparison to ann a higher magnitude of mae i e 5 28 and 6 52 was observed for the training and testing data set while a relatively lower magnitude of 4 20 was observed for the validation data set the values of rse for the gep model were slightly higher as compared to the ann model whereas the values of rmse were almost identical the values of ρ and obf are in line with the ann model which is in close agreement with those in the literature azim et al 2020 iqbal et al 2020 notably the current model can also be used for the prediction of tsr of conditioned gfrp bars 3 4 3 anfis model the scatter of the experimental vs predicted graph resulted in a slope of 0 83 0 93 and 0 81 for training testing and validation data sets respectively fig 2 the data points distributed by ann among training testing and validation data sets were fed into the anfis model but the results of the anfis model were not precisely matching the ann model the values of r are 0 93 0 80 and 0 84 which represents a strong correlation between the experimental and predicted values in comparison to gep and ann the magnitude of mae rse and rmse are comparable to gep and slightly higher than ann the values of ρ are almost identical to the values obtained from ann and gep the magnitude of obf is 0 049 which is in line with the literature representing no overfitting of the trained model 3 5 comparison of the models the comparison of the three models is depicted in fig 6 for each model isolated plots were plotted because of the differences in order of training testing and validation data sets it can be seen that all models have closely followed the experimental curve for the training set the ann model resulted in the highest correlation coefficient followed by the anfis and gep models the ann and anfis models are more trained as compared to the gep model thus affecting the values of r in testing and validation sets the gep model followed a similar pattern of mean absolute error mae in all the three data sets in contrast the ann and anfis models resulted in relatively smaller mae in the training data set and higher mae for validation and testing data sets the values of ρ are explicitly similar for all the training sets of the three models in terms of accuracy and errors the ann model is the premier model whereas the gep model surpasses the efficacy degree of the other models by yielding a simple mathematical prediction formula similar results were reported in the previous research azimi pour and eskandari naddaf 2018 çanakcı et al 2009 emamian and eskandari naddaf 2019 golafshani et al 2020 jumaa and yousif 2018 4 concluding remarks the current study presents a mathematical solution by developing models based on artificial intelligence to find the tsr of bare gfrp bars which are conditioned in accelerating ageing tests under high temperatures in alkaline concrete environment the following conclusions can be drawn from this study based on the extensive literature covered and the collection of data points it was inferred that almost 95 of the data points lie in the range of 60 100 tsr it reflects that most of the literature reported the residual tensile strength of conditioned gfrp bars above 60 retention irrespective of ageing conditions a strong correlation coefficient r 0 8 was observed for training testing and validation data sets of all three models the values of r manifest a strong correlation of the model predictions with the experimental values the regression plot of experimental vs predicted results for the training set of the ann model yielded a slope of 0 91 1 for ideal fit followed by the slope of 0 83 achieved for the gep and anfis models the results reflect that the models are trained with a close agreement to the experimental values and can be used for the prediction of new data sets while comparing the error analysis of the training sets of the models the ann model resulted in the lowest statistical errors succeeded by the anfis model and the gep model the gep model excels in the other models by providing a simple prediction formula large diameters of gfrp bars and or high volume fractions of fibers have positive contributions to tsr while high temperatures and or long conditioning duration contribute negatively the prediction equations given by the gep model can be easily used for the forecast of the tsr these results can be extrapolated for service life prediction using the arrhenius equation the current study covers the degradation model for e glass gfrp bars impregnated in vinyl ester resin conditioned in an alkaline environment in bare conditions having ph ranging from 12 to 13 6 and a temperature range of 20 80 c the study considered the diameter of the bars ranging from 9 53 mm to 16 mm by considering the volume fraction of the fibers it was assumed to cover indirectly the void content in the bar produced during the manufacturing process the tensile strength of the gfrp bar is one of the vital durability metrics other durability metrics include bond durability of gfrp in the concrete environment interlaminar shear strength ilss and flexural strength a similar type of study along with experimental validation is required for other durability metrics to assess the bond durability using ai techniques the surface of the bar smooth sand coated helically wounded as an input variable need to be considered in the model besides separate studies are required for other types of frp bars impregnated in different types of resins credit authorship contribution statement

20704,based on a comprehensive literature study the potential variables that can affect the durability of gfrp bars under a harsh alkaline environment especially seawater and sea sand concrete swssc environment were investigated and reported in this paper the study presents a new strategy for finding tensile strength retention tsr using empirical models based on the strong non linear ability of artificial intelligence techniques i e artificial neuro networking ann gene expression programming gep and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis the diameter of gfrp bars the volume fraction of glass fibers the ph value of solutions the temperature and the duration of conditioning were considered as input parameters to find tsr of aged gfrp bars statistical checks evaluated the trained models and the results demonstrate that the models provide a reliable estimate of tsr a simple mathematical prediction formula was developed using the gep model that can quickly foresee the tsr for aged gfrp bar in comparison with the gep model the ann model and the anfis model provided slightly better results the parametric study indicates that the large diameter of bars and the high volume fraction of fibers have positive effects on the tsr while the high temperature and the long duration of conditioning have negative influences keywords frp seawater and sea sand concrete material properties degradation artificial intelligence 1 introduction the marine infrastructure a vital factor in a country s economic development includes seaports off shore wind structures subsea structures and telecom structures these structures are largely far from the mainland and lack construction material freshwater aggregates nie et al 2020 this results in a significant amount of consumption of river sand and freshwater for the production of concrete which in turn has serious environmental impacts on the river ecosystem xiao et al 2017 in addition the rising demand for developing infrastructure has led to the use of seawater and sea sand concrete swssc in coastal areas guo et al 2018 the degradation of steel reinforcement due to corrosion poses a sizeable impact on the deterioration of reinforced concrete rc structures thus leading to cost effectiveness of projects because of frequent maintenance and repair angst 2018 while investigating different case studies of premature deterioration of rc structures 70 90 cases reported the corrosion mechanism as one of the major causes of deterioration koch et al 2002 over the past three decades glass fiber reinforced polymer gfrp bars owing to their corrosion resistivity being lightweight ease of handling and high strength cost ratio have replaced steel reinforcement in many engineering structures mittal et al

beneficial and also bears desirable durability performance li et al 2020 due to the widespread adoption of gfrp bars they are subjected to harsh environmental conditions alkaline saline and marine environments swssc and its prevailing environment are alkaline in moist conditions whereas ph values of moist concrete ranges from 10 5 to 13 diamond 1981 robert et al 2009 taylor 1987 among the conditioning environments the alkaline and moist concrete environment were found as the most pernicious for matrix and fiber chen et al 2007 fergani et al 2018 kamal and boulfiza 2011 robert et al 2009 serbescu et al 2015 mechanical properties of gfrp have been reported by numerous researchers ahmed et al 2020 al salloum et al 2013 bazli et al 2017 bazli et al 2020 benmokrane et al 2017a benmokrane et al 2015 benmokrane et al 2017b chen et al 2006 chen et al 2007 d antino et al 2018 dong et al 2018 el hassan et al 2017 el hassan and el maaddawy 2019 huang et al 2018 jia et al 2020 kim

and lin 2017 yang et al 2018 and it was found that these bars degrade in various harsh environments tensile strength ts inter laminar shear strength flexural strength and bond strength were reported in the past studies for evaluating the durability aspect previously the behavior of ts was investigated al salloum et al 2013 benmokrane et al 2015 2017b chen et al 2006 2007 el hassan et al 2017 fergani et al 2018 kim et al 2008 robert and benmokrane 2010 2013 2013 robert et al 2009 sawpan et al 2014 inside an alkaline environment furthermore degradation of ts of gfrp bars depends on several factors which include the exposure temperature kamal and boulfiza 2011 ph of conditioning environment chen et al 2006 2007 the moisture content of the surrounding concrete robert and benmokrane 2013 robert et al 2009 the sustained stress level benmokrane et al 2002 debaiky et al 2006 the bar diameter benmokrane et al 2017b micelli 2004 the type of resin benmokrane et al 2015 2017a and the conditioning duration al salloum et al 2013 gfrp is made up of glass fibers that are impregnated in a specific type of resin the most commonly used glass fibers include e glass and electrical grade corrosion resistant fibers wallenberger et al 2001 while different types of resins used are epoxy vinyl ester and polyester benmokrane et al 1996 many studies abbasi and hogg 2005 al salloum et al 2013 al zahrani et al 2002 chen et al 2007 kim et al 2008 won et al 2008 evaluated the durability of gfrp bars incorporating e glass fibers impregnated in vinyl ester resin using different volume fraction of glass fibers the degradation of gfrp occurs when free hydroxide ion oh in moist or alkaline media enters the polymer matrix and molecules of the longer polymer polymer chain are broken through the hydrolysis reaction consequently further water molecules and free oh tends to ingress into the fiber which breaks the secondary polymer chains thus creating voids this phenomenon is called plasticization chen et al 2007 according to the arrhenius equation moisture ingress into the bar increases with an increase in conditioning temperature in the presence of moisture the glass fiber reacts with water to release alkali oh hence deteriorating the glass fiber by dissolution in water i e leaching the leaching process increases the ph of the surrounding media and affects the silica network resulting in the dissolution of fiber inside alkaline media i e etching leaching and etching processes aggravate in moist and alkaline media kamal and boulfiza 2011 fergani et al 2018 investigated gfrp bars containing vinyl ester as a matrix in alkaline media subjected to temperatures of 20 40 and 60 c for 365 days energy dispersive x rays analysis and scanning electron microscopy analysis clearly showed the dissolution of glass fiber in the ultimate conditioning environment for a given type of glass fiber impregnated in a specific type of resin the degradation of the tensile strength of the bar depends on the diameter of the bar ph of the alkaline solution the volume fraction of the fibers the conditioning temperature and the duration of immersion the smaller diameter of the bars exhibit a high surface to volume s v ratio and are more susceptible to moisture absorption benmokrane et al 2017b besides the degradation of the gfrp bars initiates from the interface of alkaline medium and the bar hence smaller diameter bars will result in increased degradation of tensile strength after degradation of the peripheral fibers benmokrane et al 2017b reported the negative impact of larger diameter bars on residual tensile strength due to shear lag effect moreover a high alkaline environment aggravates both the leaching and etching due to high ph chen et al 2007 similarly gfrp bars having variable volume fraction of glass fibers are susceptible to variable degradation gfrp bars containing smaller volume fraction of fibers lead to higher volume of resin material resin is susceptible to severe degradation by moisture in comparison to fibers akepati et al 2012 sciolti et al 2010 an increase in conditioning temperature and exposure duration poses a decreasing effect on the tensile strength degradation of gfrp bars almusallam et al 2013 degradation of the bar in concrete is a long term phenomenon and it requires a long duration to investigate the durability of the bar to accelerate the degradation rate of gfrp bars laboratory ageing tests were performed by researchers to assess the short term tensile strength retention of gfrp bars in the alkaline environment at elevated temperatures well below their transition temperatures al salloum et al 2013 chen et al 2006 2007 kim et al 2008 wang et al 2017b gfrp alone and concrete embedded bars were subjected to combined harsh alkaline environments ph 12 6 13 alongside the elevated temperatures aci 440 3r 12 recommends a standard accelerating ageing test which includes elevated temperature conditioning at 20 40 and 60 c for up to 183 days besides few studies also considered an elevated temperature of 80 c kim et al 2008 robert and benmokrane 2013 the short term accelerated data is predicted for long term performance with the help of the arrhenius equation bai et al 2008 chen et al 2007 dejke and tepfers 2001 tu et al 2019 zhou et al 2011 it infers that accelerating ageing requires extensive testing under controlled environment for a long duration the current advancement in the field of artificial intelligence ai has enabled reliable and explicit models for structural engineering problems gholampour et al 2017 different ai tools namely artificial neural network ann genetic algorithms gas genetic programming gp genetic expression programming gep and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis were employed by researchers for solving complex engineering problems akande et al 2014 başyigit et al 2010 jeyasehar and sumangala 2006 lee 2003 naderpour and mirrashid 2019 sarir et al 2019a 2019b shahmansouri et al 2019 shariati et al 2019 2020 sobhani et al 2010 topçu et al 2009 zhang et al 2020 gep overcomes the shortcomings of gas and gp and it is comparatively two to four times faster and more efficacious ferreira 2006 gep utilizes the best fit populations of individuals using genetic variation with the help of genetic operators to yield output data mitchell 1998 whereas ann recognizes the pattern of input variables using neurons and passes it on to the hidden layer depending on the importance of inputs in desired output data anfis uses the degree of truth between 0 and 1 of the input parameters to transform it to the desired output using an interconnected neural network hence utilizing the benefit of both fuzzy logic and the neural network jang 1993 several researchers have previously köroğlu 2019 naderpour and alavi 2017 yan and lin 2016 yan et al 2017 studied the bond strength of gfrp bars in concrete using ai techniques katsuki and uomoto 2004 measured the depth of penetration of the alkaline solution into the bar and assumed that the affected portion lacks any tensile strength based on the diffusion model fick s first law a model was developed for evaluating residual tensile strength at a specific temperature however the predicted model omitted the effect of changing temperature to the authors best knowledge no model is available to date on the degradation of the tensile strength of the gfrp bar in alkaline environment under accelerating ageing incorporating artificial intelligence techniques therefore the current study concentrates on developing a model for the tensile strength retention 1 of gfrp bars conditioned in accelerating ageing in bare condition tests by using ann gep and anfis for this purpose a comprehensive database was collected from internationally published papers finally the performance of the model was validated using various statistical checks 1 t e n s i l e s t r e n g t h

experimental database used in the study and the development of ai models are present in the section 2 1 experimental database the data of accelerating ageing tests on gfrp bars subjected to alkaline environments under elevated temperatures in bare condition were collected from the literature abbasi and hogg 2005 aguiniga gaona 2004 al salloum et al 2013 al zahrani et al 2002 chen et al 2006 2007 jin et al 2020 kim et al 2008 won et al 2008 the data set includes a total of 100 data points acquired from averaging the results achieved of 328 tested specimens whose details are provided in appendix as table 1 a 70 of the data points were used for training of the models whereas the remaining 30 were equally divided into validation and testing sets respectively table 2 a in appendix the reason for limited data points is due to the restrictions of the developed model for gfrp bars made up of e glass fibers impregnated in vinyl ester resin conditioned in harsh environment and bare conditions the ratio of the number of data points to the number of input variables used in the current study for modeling is well within the prescribed limits in existing literature frank and todeschini 1994 gandomi and roke 2015 all inputs used in the models have already been reported by the researchers in the literature with the exception of volume fraction vf which is not directly reported this particular parameter is calculated from volume fraction by mass using the density of vinyl ester resin and density of the fiber it is worthy of mentioning that literature comprises two types of conditioning accelerating aging tests of bare gfrp bars in a harsh alkaline environment and gfrp embedded in concrete and then subjected to alkaline conditions the former is an aggressive environment as compared to the latter because of the additional protection of gfrp provided by concrete moreover stressed and unstressed specimens during conditioning also manifested different results fergani et al 2018 the current study focused on the first type of conditioning i e bare gfrp bars conditioned in alkaline environments under elevated temperature in unstressed conditions the results of such a conditioning type would be conservative in estimating the service life of gfrp bars different types of fibers and resins were used in the manufacturing of gfrp bars during the pultrusion process but the current study focuses on gfrp bars made up of e glass fibers impregnated in vinyl ester resin a separate study is though required for the bars embedded in concrete and subjected to an alkaline environment under elevated temperatures moreover the variation in the results of stressed and unstressed conditions and the effects of types of fibers and resin matrices could also be studied the tensile strength retention given by 1 is considered as a function of the diameter of the bar db the volume fraction vf of the e glass fibers ph of the solution the temperature in c temp and the time t in days table 2 manifests water absorption of gfrp bars with the increase in diameter of the bar astm 2010 recommends a specific temperature of 23 c for a duration of 24 h for moisture absorption at saturation the percentage increase in water absorption is not much significant as compared to moisture absorption after 24 h in this regard robert et al 2010 found no significant difference in moisture uptake of gfrp beyond 30 days of immersion at 23 40 and 60 c temperatures however moisture uptake of gfrp bars at 80 c linearly increased for up to 50 days beyond which the curve flattened the absorption of moisture is greatly dependent upon temperature diameter of the bar as well as the duration of conditioning which subsequently affects the retention of tensile strength hence the effect of moisture uptake is indirectly incorporated using diameter of the bar temperature and duration of conditioning the distribution of these input parameters is shown in fig 1 it shows slightly right skewness for diameter of the bar volume fraction of fibers temperature and duration of exposure whereas slightly left skewness for ph and tsr the distribution is supported by the values of the statistical functions skewness and kurtosis as shown in table 1 it also presents the ranges of input and output variables feed into the models the collected data includes conditioning at temperatures well below the glass transition temperature tg of resin material it is recommended to use these given ranges of input variables for reliable prediction of the output variable 2 2 development of ai models 2 2 1 rationalization of input variables as mentioned above in section 2 1 the tensile strength retention tsr of the gfrp bar depends on the input variables expressed in 2 all of these input parameters in the development of the models were selected after performing a critical and extensive literature review the moisture ingress into the bar depends directly on the surface to volume ratio s v of the bar 3 table 2 shows the variation of moisture absorption versus the change in diameter of the gfrp bars with almost similar fiber content by weight benmokrane et al 2017b consequently moisture ingress affects the degradation of gfrp bars furthermore the moisture ingress initiates from the peripheral circumference of the bar hence outer fibers are susceptible to degrade faster than the inner fibers the deteriorated outer portion is bigger for the smaller diameter of the bar as compared to the larger diameter bar on the other hand the shear lag effect due to stress concentration at the outer fibers has a negative impact on the residual tensile strength of larger diameter bars achillides and pilakoutas 2004 benmokrane et al 2017b castro and carino 1998 hence it cannot be confirmed from the literature that increasing bar diameter has a negative or positive impact on the residual tensile strength therefore incorporation of the diameter as an input with the known output is a desideratum variable 2 t s r f d b v f p h t e m p t 3 s v π d b l b π d b 2 4 l b 4 d b a similar concept of stiffness attracts the load applies to the gfrp bar which comprises high stiffness fibers and low stiffness resin matrix being the major contributor to the stiffness of the bar the central part of the load is carried by fibers hence the major tensile strength of the bar is developed mainly by fibers the resin material transfers the load from one fiber to another and it is more susceptible to degradation due to plasticization in contrast to the fibers a smaller volume fraction of fibers leads to a larger volume fraction of resin matrix the degradation of resin matrix reduces its load transfer capability and therefore decreases the tensile strength of the bar the ph of the conditioning solution intensifies the mechanism of degradation in the presence of free oh ions the resin matrix reacts to form a hydrolysis product furthermore the dissolution of glass also occurs in a high ph environment chen et al 2007 witnessed a tensile strength loss of 36 and 27 for gfrp vinyl ester bars after conditioning at 60 c for 70 days accelerating ageing in normal concrete pore solution ph 13 6 and high performance concrete pore solution ph 12 7 respectively the temperature and duration of conditioning are among the most critical factors in the degradation of gfrp bars the rate of degradation can be increased by increasing the temperature according to the arrhenius equation 4 where k is the degradation rate and is defined as the inverse of time needed for a mechanical property to degrade to a given value 100 loss for service life prediction e a is the activation energy r is the universal gas constant t is the temperature in kelvin arrhenius equation was modified by chen et al 2006 based on the study conducted by phani and bose 1987 which was used by several researchers for predicting the degraded tensile strength of gfrp bars davalos et al 2012 wang et al 2017b 2018b the equation proposed by chen et al 2006 was modified by tu et al 2019 for determining tensile strength degradation based on elastic modulus degradation of gfrp bars also the timeshift factor tsf was introduced by dejke dejke and tepfers 2001 for long term prediction of mechanical properties of gfrp bars all these models require extensive laboratory ageing testing for long term prediction of durability of gfrp the current study aimed to develop a model based on the existing literature that can quickly foresee the tensile strength retention and later on can be used for service life prediction of the gfrp bars 4 1 k 1 a exp e a r t 2 2 2 artificial intelligence ai approaches firstly gep model was developed using a random distribution of data points among the training and validation sets using genexprotools the advantage of gep to present the model in a simple mathematical equation can be used for practical purposes with a high degree of accuracy the gep model was primarily used in the current study to predict the tsr in the form of a mathematical equation iqbal et al 2020 the notable features of the gep model were finally chosen after several runs of the model based on different linking functions of ets number of genes number of chromosomes head size and the functions used in the model the increased number of chromosomes head size and the number of genes enhance the complexity of the model the number of genes indicates the number of ets in the model considering the complexity of output mathematical equation the current model was developed using 3 genes and 100 chromosomes within the sub ets the linking functions x 1 3 inv x 2 were used and the sub ets were linked with addition the rest of the features used in the gep model is listed in table 3 secondly the ann model was developed by a random data distribution of training validation and testing data points in a predetermined ratio listed in table 4 using the input output fitting curve nn tool the levenberg marquardt algorithm was used in the model because of its precision and efficacy fast convergence in fewer epochs as compared to other algorithms daliakopoulos et al 2005 the 10 number of neurons in the hidden layer were selected on trial and error basis to avoid overfitting of the model thirdly the three data sets training validation and testing distributed by ann were employed for anfis modeling to compare the results grid partitioning was used for generating a fuzzy inference system fis a hybrid method of fis optimization was used for training fis details can be seen in table 5 regarding setting parameters for anfis model the ann and the anfis models were developed by using machine learning and fuzzy logic tools of matlab r2020b respectively 2 2 3 evaluation criteria the ai models developed were evaluated using correlation coefficient r gandomi and alavi 2012 mean absolute error mae willmott and matsuura 2005 willmott et al 2009 root mean square error rmse chai et al 2013 mckeen et al 2005 savage et al 2013 relative squared error rse relative root mean square error rrmse iqbal et al 2020 and performance indicator ρ babanajad et al 2017 iqbal et al 2020 the performance indicator was used to evaluate the performance of both r and rmse the mathematical expressions for these parameters are presented in 5 to 10 5 r i 1 n e i e i m i m i i 1 n e i e i 2 m i m i 2 6 m a e i 1 n e i m i n 7 r m s e i 1 n e i m i 2 n 8 r s e i 1 n e i m i 2 i 1 n e m i 2 9 r r m s e 1 e i 1 n e i m i 2 n 10 ρ r r m s e 1 r where ei and mi are nth experimental and model tsr respectively e i and m i denote the average values of experimental and model tsr respectively n is the number of samples in the data set low values of mae rmse rse rrmse and high value of r depict an accurate interpretation of the model the values of r ranges from 0 to 1 the former indicates perfect correlation while the latter implies no correlation between the inputs and outputs the value of r greater than 0 8 represents a relatively high level of accuracy in estimating the predicted values babanajad et al 2017 taylor 1990 however other statistical checks i e rmse and mae shall be used to evaluate the accuracy of the model heddam et al 2019 as mentioned in section 2 3 gep and ann were allowed to generate their training and validation sets through random selection in this exercise the training model tends to overfit during repeated training thus maximizing the error in the validation testing data set gandomi and alavi 2012 to counter it a model with minimum objective function obf needs to be selected among the trials gandomi and roke 2015 the value of the objective function ranges from 0 to maximum and the value approaching zero represents the relatively excellent model the objective function 11 was adopted to take into account both the number of training data set and validation data as well as the values of r and rrmse hence it can reflect the overall performance of the model iqbal et al 2020 11 o b f n t n v n ρ t 2 n v n ρ v where the subscripts t and v represent the training and validation data respectively and n denotes the total number of sample points in addition to the above mentioned fitting parameters the slope of the regression line experimental vs predicted was also used to evaluate the performance of the models 3 results and discussions 3 1 comparison between predicted and experimental results the predicted results of the models were plotted against experimental results and are shown in fig 2 all three models are strongly correlating with the experimental results i e 0 91 0 83 and 0 83 slopes of the regression line for training sets of ann gep and anfis the validation and testing data sets also showed a strong correlation of the slopes of the regression line as compared to the ideal fit 1 1 slope as depicted in fig 2 the testing data yielded 0 80 0 72 and 0 93 slopes of the regression line whereas these values are 0 89 0 81 and 0 93 for the validation data for the ann gep and anfis models respectively the results of mae i e 1 89 5 28 and 2 24 tsr for training sets of ann gep and anfis respectively also reflect the close agreement of predicted results to the experimental values the extent of errors mae rse rrmse is minimum for training data set succeeded by testing validation data sets in case of ann a similar pattern was observed for the anfis model whereas the gep model showed minimum errors in the testing data set followed by the training and validation data sets this behavior of gep interprets that the extent of non overfitting is maximum in the gep model and it was achieved because of monitoring the best fitness value at the interface of genexprotools during modeling moreover the values of correlation coefficient r i e 0 95 0 93 and 0 85 for training data sets of ann gep and anfis respectively represent a strong degree of correlation among the variables babanajad et al 2017 it is pertinent to mention that more than 90 of the data points are scattered in the range of 60 100 tsr the same data scatter was observed for experimental results as depicted in fig 5 fig 3 illustrates an error histogram of the three models which shows that almost 70 of the data predicted by the models yields an error in the range of 4 to 4 babanajad et al 2017 identified that a ratio of objects to the selected parameters shall be minimum equals to 5 in order to ensure the reliability of the final models in the current work the ratio is 100 5 20 which is far beyond the minimum requirement 3 2 formulation of tsr gep was primarily used for generating the empirical relationships among the five inputs and the output tsr in a form of mathematical expression the output of the gep algorithm for tsr is presented in the form of an expression tree as shown in fig 4 it can be seen that ets comprise three sub ets depending upon 3 genes used in the gep model moreover the linking functions reflected in the ets are the same as the ones used in the model listed as table 3 the variables d0 d1 d2 d3 and d4 in ets are db vf ph temp and t respectively the constants c2 c3 and c7 in sub et are 1 89 2 45 and 7 68 respectively the constants c8 c5 c7 and c1 in sub et 2 are 9 36 5 64 2 24 and 5 52 respectively the constants c4 in sub et 3 is 3 58 these constants are determined by the matlab code of the proposed model the matlab model derived from the gep algorithm and the ets was used to develop the mathematical relationship among the variables equations 12 15 can be used to predict the tsr of gfrp bars impregnated in vinyl ester resin in an alkaline environment the reliability of the model mainly depends on the number of data points gholampour et al 2017 the current model satisfies the minimum requirement of the ideal model as described in section 3 4 frank and todeschini 1994 gandomi and roke 2015 12 t s r x y z 13 x 1 p h 1 89

6 the importance is further reflected from training validation while its combination is almost similar all input variables except ph have a significant role in the residual tensile strength of conditioned gfrp bars the importance of ph in the developed model is substantially minimal it may be attributed to the database of ph considered in this study ph 12 13 6 both extremes of the ph lie in a high alkaline environment the diameter of the bar and volume fraction directly contributed to tsr while ph of the solution temperature and duration of conditioning were found to have an inverse relation with tsr 3 4 performance evaluation of models a minimum ratio was proposed between data points and the number of input variables as 3 for an acceptable model for the ideal model this ratio was proposed as 5 gandomi and roke 2015 100 data points and 5 input variables were used for developing models hence the ratio in this study is comparable to the ideal one statistical parameters used for the evaluation of models are shown in table 7 and table 8 3 4 1 ann model the x y plot of experimental vs predicted tsr showed a high slope of regression plot of 0 91 as compared to the 1 1 ideal fit plot of training data set representing strong prognostic efficacy of the model it can also be seen from the results presented in fig 2 that a strong correlation exists between the predicted and experimental results of training validation and testing data sets the values of r for training validation and testing data sets are 0 95 0 85 and 0 93 respectively the values of r show that the model is trained with a strong correlation between predicted and observed values the values of mae observed for training validation and testing data sets are 1 89 6 02 and 5 53 respectively the magnitude of mae rse and rmse reflects slight errors in the model the values of rmse are greater than mae by definition chai and draxler 2014 the magnitude of ρ is 0 057 0 060 and 0 056 for the three data sets which are close to zero the magnitude of the objective function obf for the current model is 0 049 satisfying the criteria that the model is not overfitted similar results of ρ were reported in the literature as well azim et al 2020 the complete data set along with the model errors are reported in fig 5 almost 75 of the data points lie within absolute error of 4 tsr fig 3 thus the current model can be satisfactorily used for testing a new data set 3 4 2 gep model the scatter diagram of experimental vs predicted tsr of the gep model on the x y cartesian plane resulted in a slope of 0 83 of a regression line for the training data set fig 2 as manifested from table 7 the values of r are 0 86 0 95 and 0 93 it demonstrates a strong correlation between predicted and observed values from the experiments in comparison to ann a higher magnitude of mae i e 5 28 and 6 52 was observed for the training and testing data set while a relatively lower magnitude of 4 20 was observed for the validation data set the values of rse for the gep model were slightly higher as compared to the ann model whereas the values of rmse were almost identical the values of ρ and obf are in line with the ann model which is in close agreement with those in the literature azim et al 2020 iqbal et al 2020 notably the current model can also be used for the prediction of tsr of conditioned gfrp bars 3 4 3 anfis model the scatter of the experimental vs predicted graph resulted in a slope of 0 83 0 93 and 0 81 for training testing and validation data sets respectively fig 2 the data points distributed by ann among training testing and validation data sets were fed into the anfis model but the results of the anfis model were not precisely matching the ann model the values of r are 0 93 0 80 and 0 84 which represents a strong correlation between the experimental and predicted values in comparison to gep and ann the magnitude of mae rse and rmse are comparable to gep and slightly higher than ann the values of ρ are almost identical to the values obtained from ann and gep the magnitude of obf is 0 049 which is in line with the literature representing no overfitting of the trained model 3 5 comparison of the models the comparison of the three models is depicted in fig 6 for each model isolated plots were plotted because of the differences in order of training testing and validation data sets it can be seen that all models have closely followed the experimental curve for the training set the ann model resulted in the highest correlation coefficient followed by the anfis and gep models the ann and anfis models are more trained as compared to the gep model thus affecting the values of r in testing and validation sets the gep model followed a similar pattern of mean absolute error mae in all the three data sets in contrast the ann and anfis models resulted in relatively smaller mae in the training data set and higher mae for validation and testing data sets the values of ρ are explicitly similar for all the training sets of the three models in terms of accuracy and errors the ann model is the premier model whereas the gep model surpasses the efficacy degree of the other models by yielding a simple mathematical prediction formula similar results were reported in the previous research azimi pour and eskandari naddaf 2018 çanakcı et al 2009 emamian and eskandari naddaf 2019 golafshani et al 2020 jumaa and yousif 2018 4 concluding remarks the current study presents a mathematical solution by developing models based on artificial intelligence to find the tsr of bare gfrp bars which are conditioned in accelerating ageing tests under high temperatures in alkaline concrete environment the following conclusions can be drawn from this study based on the extensive literature covered and the collection of data points it was inferred that almost 95 of the data points lie in the range of 60 100 tsr it reflects that most of the literature reported the residual tensile strength of conditioned gfrp bars above 60 retention irrespective of ageing conditions a strong correlation coefficient r 0 8 was observed for training testing and validation data sets of all three models the values of r manifest a strong correlation of the model predictions with the experimental values the regression plot of experimental vs predicted results for the training set of the ann model yielded a slope of 0 91 1 for ideal fit followed by the slope of 0 83 achieved for the gep and anfis models the results reflect that the models are trained with a close agreement to the experimental values and can be used for the prediction of new data sets while comparing the error analysis of the training sets of the models the ann model resulted in the lowest statistical errors succeeded by the anfis model and the gep model the gep model excels in the other models by providing a simple prediction formula large diameters of gfrp bars and or high volume fractions of fibers have positive contributions to tsr while high temperatures and or long conditioning duration contribute negatively the prediction equations given by the gep model can be easily used for the forecast of the tsr these results can be extrapolated for service life prediction using the arrhenius equation the current study covers the degradation model for e glass gfrp bars impregnated in vinyl ester resin conditioned in an alkaline environment in bare conditions having ph ranging from 12 to 13 6 and a temperature range of 20 80 c the study considered the diameter of the bars ranging from 9 53 mm to 16 mm by considering the volume fraction of the fibers it was assumed to cover indirectly the void content in the bar produced during the manufacturing process the tensile strength of the gfrp bar is one of the vital durability metrics other durability metrics include bond durability of gfrp in the concrete environment interlaminar shear strength ilss and flexural strength a similar type of study along with experimental validation is required for other durability metrics to assess the bond durability using ai techniques the surface of the bar smooth sand coated helically wounded as an input variable need to be considered in the model besides separate studies are required for other types of frp bars impregnated in different types of resins credit authorship contribution statement
