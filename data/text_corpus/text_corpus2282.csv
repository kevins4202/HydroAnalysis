11410,due to current water shortages the use of water from wastewater treatment plants wwtps for horticultural crop irrigation is becoming increasingly common this practice implies the risk of introducing pharmaceutical compounds into the food chain the main aim of this work was to study the accumulation of two drugs in lettuces and their subsequent transfer into the food chain the study focused on two widely used drugs the anticonvulsant carbamazepine cbz and the anti inflammatory diclofenac dcf with different physicochemical properties in terms of their hydrophobicity and solubility in water three varieties of lettuce were selected and irrigated with water containing a mixture of the two pharmaceutical compounds at different concentrations the results show the leaves presented the highest levels of uptake and greatest bioconcentration factors in the case of cbz however in the case of dcf by contrast the highest uptake levels and greatest bioconcentration factors were observed in the roots for cbz the cleaf croot ratio was greater than 1 indicating good root to leaf drug translocation whereas all cleaf croot ratios were less than 1 for dcf from the data acquired our evaluation suggests that the concentrations of cbz and dcf detected in the edible part of the lettuces do not imply any risk to human health keywords pharmaceuticals human health risk wastewater treatment plants wwtps effluents irrigation 1 introduction the world s freshwater resources are limited and represent only a small fraction of the total water reserves oki and kanae 2006 seventy percent of the world s freshwater is used for crop irrigation 20 in industry and 10 is allocated to domestic use zimmerman et al 2008 pressure on water resources will continue to grow due to an ever increasing population and climate change gerland et al 2014 responsible techniques must be implemented to avoid water contamination for example those used in the management of cow manure hanifzadeh et al 2017 for direct application without any treatment where most nutrients in the manure are normally washed into rivers and lakes where they cause eutrophication and potentially jeopardize the quality of drinking water wastewater treatment eliminates the environmental and social problems derived from wastewater release into water resources nowadays we can use wastewater treatment processes to satisfy the growing demand that cities agriculture and industry place on our water supplies in arid and semi arid zones elgallal et al 2016 reclaimed water can be used in large scale biomass and lipid production from microalgae hanifzadeh et al 2018 and this process represents a valuable resource in meeting water demands as it helps relieve shortages and pressure on water supplies most irrigation with wastewater takes place in peri urban belts around cities where there is an easily accessible supply of wwtp effluent hamilton et al 2007 the agricultural use of reclaimed water is common practice in mediterranean countries particularly greece italy and spain and it is increasingly used to irrigate crops intended for human consumption gatta et al 2016 pedrero et al 2010 libutti et al 2018 however the use of reclaimed water from wwtps represents a dilemma because different studies have shown that wwtps are insufficient when it comes to the elimination of pharmaceuticals gros et al 2010 veterinary products and other emerging organic contaminants calderón preciado et al 2012 goldstein et al 2014 macherius et al 2012 malchi et al 2014 wu et al 2014 from urban wastewater as some of these compounds have been detected in wastewater used for agricultural irrigation calderón preciado et al 2011a kümmerer 2009 this in conjunction with the complex molecular structure of pharmaceutical products and their low maximum concentration in water means they could be entering the environment primarily by means of these effluents the emerging contaminants most frequently observed in wwtp effluents are analgesics antibacterials antibiotics antidepressants anti inflammatories antipyretics beta blockers lipid lowering drugs steroids stimulants and tranquilizers flyborg et al 2010 hörsing et al 2011 kasprzyk hordern et al 2007 mendez et al 2016 miege et al 2008 radjenovic et al 2007 rosal et al 2010 the pharmaceuticals in this study were selected based on their i presence at the inlets of different wwtps 420 ng l 1 for cbz and 250 ng l 1 for dcf petrovic et al 2005 ii presence in surface and groundwaters in germany hirsch et al 1999 putschew et al 2000 ternes 1998 ternes and hirsch 2000 holland belfroid et al 1999 switzerland soulet et al 2002 italy castiglioni et al 2004 usa drewes et al 2001 kolpin et al 2002 canada miao et al 2004 ternes et al 1999 china chen et al 2011 sui et al 2010 yuan et al 2013 and brazil ternes et al 1999 iii potential effects on human health in the specific case of spain certain pharmaceutical compounds have been detected in the effluent from various wwtps approximately 20 pharmaceutical compounds were identified at 18 sampling points along the ebro river petrovic et al 2005 another study revealed a total of 20 pharmaceuticals in seawater and 14 in sediments collected from a mediterranean coastal lagoon moreno gonzález et al 2015 while cbz and dcf were identified and quantified in the influents and effluents of 12 wwtps in the region of murcia murcia spain fernández lópez et al 2016 there is therefore a need to evaluate the behavior of cbz and dcf and the potential health risks they could imply if they enter into the food chain drug toxicity studies have been conducted on cbz and dcf and their potential risk to human health has also been evaluated individuals exposed to carbamazepine especially asians bearing hla b1502 alleles are prone to severe hypersensitivity reactions thorn et al 2011 in pregnant women carbamazepine is considered potentially teratogenic especially at high doses tomson et al 2011 dcf induces gastrointestinal tract toxicity with clinical symptoms of small intestinal ulcers bleeding perforation and strictures davies et al 2000 wolfe et al 1999 the accumulation of drugs in plants has been widely documented in several studies calderón preciado et al 2011b goldstein et al 2014 shenker et al 2011 wu et al 2010 wu et al 2012a wu et al 2014 various studies have demonstrated that crops can uptake and bioaccumulate cbz and dcf herklotz et al 2010 winker et al 2010 zhang et al 2012 this implies humans may potentially be exposed to these pharmaceuticals by consuming crops irrigated with wastewater and further research is necessary to ensure this does not pose a risk to human health given the above the objective of this study was to evaluate cbz and dcf uptake in three varieties of lettuce irrigated with water containing a mixture of the two compounds at different concentrations as well as to evaluate the potential risk to human health resulting from their incorporation into the food chain 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals analyzed the anticonvulsant carbamazepine c4021 1g and the anti inflammatory diclofenac d6899 10g both purchased from sigma aldrich steinheim germany were selected so that we could compare the behavior root surface biosorption and translocation into the plant of two drugs with different physicochemical properties table 1 shows the structure and physicochemical properties of the pharmaceutical products 2 2 experimental design the experiment was conducted in the summer of 2016 june august in a greenhouse 37 47 48 88 n 0 57 33 63 w owned by the spanish national research council s segura center of soil science and applied biology cebas csic the greenhouse was located in facilities adjacent to the roldán lo ferro and balsicas wwtp murcia spain at natural light and at temperatures ranging from 25 to 41 c according to data recorded by cebas csic s weather station the water used in the experiment was the effluent from the roldán lo ferro and balsicas wwtp which receives wastewater from the communities of lo ferro roldán and balsicas murcia spain the reclaimed water is used for agricultural purposes the wwtp features a primary physicochemical treatment a secondary system consisting of an activated sludge bioreactor a tertiary treatment based on uv irradiation and it has a design capacity of 5500 m3 day 1 water from the wwtp was analyzed appendix a table s1 and the results at the time of the study did not reveal the presence of cbz and dcf as their concentrations were below the limits of detection appendix a table s2 the greenhouse s surface having an area of 680 m2 was divided into six plots fig 1 in which three varieties of lettuce were planted iceberg var gitana il mini romaine var jabera mrl and oak leaf var kiprien oll the lettuces were planted on a coconut fiber substrate appendix a table s3 in bags measuring 100 20 15 cm the plants were placed 0 25 m apart and watered by drip irrigation with four drippers per bag each operating at a flow rate of 3 l h 1 to study the degree of drugs absorption by the three varieties of lettuce the plants were irrigated with a nutrient solution appendix a table s4 dispersed in wwpt effluent containing different concentrations of cbz and dcf the six greenhouse plots were divided into five experimental subplots according to the drug concentration in the water used to irrigate the three lettuce varieties one subplot was a blank drug free irrigation water while the other four were irrigated at different drug concentrations 30 60 120 and 210 μg l 1 each subplot contained eight plants of each lettuce variety we prepared three replicates of each experimental subplot distributed randomly in an attempt to prevent and mitigate potential effects of the spatial situation inside the greenhouse an irrigation regime of 8 liters per unit per day 1 liter per plant per day was applied the mixtures of the two drugs at different concentrations were prepared in black glass jars to protect them from sunlight and prevent their degradation reclaimed wastewater was collected from the wwtp twice weekly to minimize any changes occurring while the water was stored in a tank near the greenhouse shenker et al 2011 all containers used to prepare the drug mixtures were washed thoroughly with methanol and acetone before use in order to eliminate any residues that could affect the study results the plants were irrigated with the drug mixtures for a period of 13 days starting from six weeks after sowing the experiment lasted a total of eight weeks 2 3 extraction and uplc analysis at the end of the experiment plants from each variety were randomly selected and harvested from the middle row to avoid border effects and roots and leaves were analyzed the roots were rinsed with deionized water to remove any remaining coconut fiber substrate the roots and leaves were cut into small pieces freeze dried and stored at 20 c until analysis samples were ground to a fine powder with a porcelain mortar according to described method of wu et al 2013 vegetable tissue was extracted as follows wu et al 2012b 0 2 g of lettuce plant sample was placed in a 50 ml glass centrifuge tube spiked with deuterated pharmaceuticals as recovery surrogates extracted with 20 ml methyl tert butyl ether in an ultrasonic bath 50 60 hz for 20 min and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 20 min the supernatant was decanted into a 40 ml glass vial and the residue extracted using 20 ml acetonitrile the combined extracts were dried under nitrogen at 30 c and re dissolved in 1 ml methanol followed by the addition of 20 ml deionized water the aqueous solution was loaded onto a hydrophilic lipophilic balance cartridge oasis hlb 60 mg 3 ml extraction cartridges from waters corporation dublin ireland and preconditioned with 5 ml methyl tert butyl ether 5 ml methanol and 5 ml deionized water samples were loaded onto the cartridges at 15 ml min after which the cartridges

the resulting extract was concentrated to dryness with a gentle stream of nitrogen the extract was brought up to a final volume of 1 ml with methanol finally the samples were filtered through nylon filters 25 mm 0 45 μm pore size before instrumental analysis the samples were analyzed with an acquity uplc i class system and hr qtof ms maxis series bruker daltonik gmbh german as described by martínez alcalá et al 2017 2 4 quality control extraction recoveries for the target pharmaceuticals were determined in water and vegetable tissues by adding samples n 3 at 30 μg l 1 of cbz and 150 μg l 1 of dcf the recoveries were determined by comparing a spiked duplicate of the sample before and after the solid phase extraction procedure and calculated by internal standard calibration furthermore unspiked sample duplicates were analyzed to determine the concentrations appendix a tables s2 and s5 show the limits of detection lod and limits of quantification loq of cbz and dcf in

regression coefficients between the applied dose of pharmaceuticals and the concentration found in each compartment concentration and uptake data are presented as average standard deviation unless otherwise stated the significance level was p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 presence of cbz and dcf in plant organs leaves of the mini romaine variety exhibited the highest concentrations of cbz and dcf whereas the roots of the other two varieties presented the highest cbz concentration and the of the mini romaine variety accumulated the most amount of dcf in all the three varieties of lettuce cbz was found at higher concentrations in the leaves than in the roots figs 2 and 3 in the present study the concentration of cbz log kow 2 3 pka 13 9 in the leaves was found to average 46 more than the roots the higher cbz concentration in the leaves was due to its neutral charge and intermediate hydrophobicity the behavior we observed for cbz is supported by numerous other publications herklotz et al 2010 shenker et al 2011 tanoue et al 2012 wu et al 2013 in experiments on soy plants irrigated with 10 μg l 1 of cbz the drug was mainly found to accumulate in the leaves 216 75 ng g 1 dw wu et al 2010 other research involving cucumbers irrigated with reclaimed water added with 1 g l 1 of cbz observed between 19 and 39 μg g 1 dw of the drug in the leaves and 2 4 5 μg g 1 dw in the roots shenker et al 2011 in the case of hydrophobic drugs such as dcf log kow 4 they are readily absorbed by the roots zhang et al 2012 the concentration of dcf was higher in the roots than in the leaves figs 4 and 5 suggesting that dcf was absorbed by the roots and then transported to the leaves with a relatively slow translocation process in this study the dcf concentration log kow 4 5 pka 4 4 in the roots was found to average 89 more than the leaves this observation has already been corroborated by other studies which indicate that hydrophobic chemicals are so strongly bound to the surface of the roots that it hinders their translocation into the plant schnoor et al 1995 drug evapotranspiration and soil retention must be taken into account when considering drug uptake by plants for example evapotranspiration correlates with the uptake of neutral and ionic pharmaceutical products by vegetable tissues dodgen et al 2015 neutral compounds can cross cell membranes more easily than ionic compounds malchi et al 2014 this explains why cbz is easily translocated and accumulates in the leaves due to the water transpiration current pharmaceuticals are subject to transport and biodegradation when they enter soil in addition highly hydrophobic pharmaceuticals such as dcf with strong soil adsorption may have a relatively low bioavailability for plant absorption while pharmaceuticals with intermediate hydrophobicity such as cbz may have a relatively high bioavailability due to its weak soil adsorption characteristics tanoue et al 2012 in conclusion intermediate hydrophobic compounds cbz could translocate more easily than the highly hydrophobic compounds dcf tanoue et al 2012 3 2 bioconcentration factors bcfs cbz and dcf bioconcentration factors were calculated from eq 1 and according to the cbz and dcf concentrations in the respective plant tissues 1 b c f l k g concentration in plant tissue μ g kg dry weight concentration in nutrient solution μ g l appendix a table s7 in the supplementary material presents the bcf values for cbz and dcf in the roots and leaves of the three lettuce varieties the highest bcfs in the leaves were between 0 53 and 0 83 for cbz and the lowest which ranged from 0 to 0 03 occurred in plants irrigated with dcf values in the roots ranged between 0 23 and 0 43 in the case of cbz while for dcf they ranged from 0 18 to 0 25 our results are consistent with those reported by briggs et al 1982 and topp et al 1986 and suggest that dcf s higher uptake capacity in the roots in comparison with the leaves can be attributed to its high hydrophobicity and low solubility in water 2 37 mg l 1 at 25 c in turn this means that chemicals with a log kow 4 such as dcf have a high retention potential in plant roots pharmaceutical compounds have been shown kumar and gupta 2016 to be absorbed at different rates in different plant compartments in function of their physicochemical properties log kow molecular weight etc and our results confirm these observations 3 3 leaf root concentration ratio cleaf croot the leaf root concentration ratio cleaf croot was calculated to assess the root to leaf translocation potential for cbz and dcf figs 6 and 7 for cbz the cleaf croot ratio was 1 in all cases indicating good root to leaf drug translocation contrastingly in the case of dcf all cleaf croot ratios were 1 this implies that dcf translocation was limited probably due to its lipophilicity which means that root to leave translocation is considered a passive process that depends on the drug s physicochemical properties simonich and hites 1995 these results agree with those published by briggs et al 1982 who showed that the efficiency of the root to leaf translocation of a chemical substance is independent of its concentration in the external solution 3 4 calculation of risk to human health the ultimate aim of this study was to determine whether the accumulation of cbz and dcf in edible parts of lettuces constitutes a potential risk to human health due to their incorporation into the food chain this evaluation took into account the worst exposure scenario using the highest concentrations of cbz and dcf observed in the lettuce leaves figs 2 and 4 daily human intake of each drug for each variety of lettuce was estimated by multiplying the concentration calculated for the edible portion ng g 1 by average lettuce consumption 7 0 g day for a 70 kg individual national center for environmental assessment 2011 taking into consideration the acceptable daily intakes for cbz and dcf bruce et al 2010 which indicate the maximum amount of product a person can ingest per day we can see from table 2 that the estimated quantities of cbz and dcf ingested per day are below the acceptable limits therefore the present study shows that the daily consumption of lettuce irrigated with regenerated water mixed with cbz does not represent a threat to health as the daily quantity of cbz consumed by a person weighing 70 0 kg is estimated to be 145 67 ng kg 1 mini romaine lettuce while the maximum acceptable daily intake is 340 ng kg 1 in the case of dcf the estimated daily quantity ingested is well below the acceptable limits the estimated daily intake of dcf consumed by a person weighing 70 0 kg is 8 22 ng kg 1 mini romaine lettuce whereas the maximum acceptable daily intake is 67 000 ng kg 1 so the daily consumption of lettuce irrigated with regenerated water mixed with dcf does not represent a threat to health although our results suggest the consumption of lettuces irrigated with wastewater can be considered safe this study only covers two pharmaceuticals in three varieties of lettuce therefore more research such as the work proposed herein is required to estimate the level of human exposure to these and other pharmaceuticals due to the consumption of crops irrigated with water reclaimed from wwtps and to ensure correct agricultural use of wastewater without posing any risk to human health 4 conclusions this study has demonstrated the uptake capacity of cbz and dcf by roots and leaves of three varieties of lettuce in comparison with the roots in the case of cbz the leaves presented the highest levels of uptake and greatest bcfs due to the drug s neutral charge and intermediate hydrophobicity while for dcf the highest uptake levels and bcfs were observed in the roots due to its high hydrophobicity and low solubility in water this pattern was observed also in the cleaf croot ratio which was higher than 1 for cbz indicating good root to leaf translocation of cbz but by contrast all cleaf croot ratios were lesser than 1 for dcf suggesting dcf translocation was limited the objective of this paper was to evaluate the human health risk posed by cbz and dcf absorbed in lettuces our study has revealed that introduction of cbz and dcf through the food chain pathway does not imply any risk to human health due to that the estimated daily quantity of drug consumed of cbz and are below the maximum acceptable daily intake more research such as the one proposed in this study are very necessary to studied in the future and ensure the correct use of wastewater in agricultural crops without any risk to human health acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the personnel at the roldán lo ferro and balsicas wwtp

and dcf whereas the roots of the other two varieties presented the highest cbz concentration and the of the mini romaine variety accumulated the most amount of dcf in all the three varieties of lettuce cbz was found at higher concentrations in the leaves than in the roots figs 2 and 3 in the present study the concentration of cbz log kow 2 3 pka 13 9 in the leaves was found to average 46 more than the roots the higher cbz concentration in the leaves was due to its neutral charge and intermediate hydrophobicity the behavior we observed for cbz is supported by numerous other publications herklotz et al 2010 shenker et al 2011 tanoue et al 2012 wu et al 2013 in experiments on soy plants irrigated with 10 μg l 1 of cbz the drug was mainly found to accumulate in the leaves 216 75 ng g 1 dw wu et al 2010 other research involving cucumbers irrigated with reclaimed water added with 1 g l 1 of cbz observed between 19 and 39 μg g 1 dw of the drug in the leaves and 2 4 5 μg g 1 dw in the roots shenker et al 2011 in the case of hydrophobic drugs such as dcf log kow 4 they are readily absorbed by the roots zhang et al 2012 the concentration of dcf was higher in the roots than in the leaves figs 4 and 5 suggesting that dcf was absorbed by the roots and then transported to the leaves with a relatively slow translocation process in this study the dcf concentration log kow 4 5 pka 4 4 in the roots was found to average 89 more than the leaves this observation has already been corroborated by other studies which indicate that hydrophobic chemicals are so strongly bound to the surface of the roots that it hinders their translocation into the plant schnoor et al 1995 drug evapotranspiration and soil retention must be taken into account when considering drug uptake by plants for example evapotranspiration correlates with the uptake of neutral and ionic pharmaceutical products by vegetable tissues dodgen et al 2015 neutral compounds can cross cell membranes more easily than ionic compounds malchi et al 2014 this explains why cbz is easily translocated and accumulates in the leaves due to the water transpiration current pharmaceuticals are subject to transport and biodegradation when they enter soil in addition highly hydrophobic pharmaceuticals such as dcf with strong soil adsorption may have a relatively low bioavailability for plant absorption while pharmaceuticals with intermediate hydrophobicity such as cbz may have a relatively high bioavailability due to its weak soil adsorption characteristics tanoue et al 2012 in conclusion intermediate hydrophobic compounds cbz could translocate more easily than the highly hydrophobic compounds dcf tanoue et al 2012 3 2 bioconcentration factors bcfs cbz and dcf bioconcentration factors were calculated from eq 1 and according to the cbz and dcf concentrations in the respective plant tissues 1 b c f l k g concentration in plant tissue μ g kg dry weight concentration in nutrient solution μ g l appendix a table s7 in the supplementary material presents the bcf values for cbz and dcf in the roots and leaves of the three lettuce varieties the highest bcfs in the leaves were between 0 53 and 0 83 for cbz and the lowest which ranged from 0 to 0 03 occurred in plants irrigated with dcf values in the roots ranged between 0 23 and 0 43 in the case of cbz while for dcf they ranged from 0 18 to 0 25 our results are consistent with those reported by briggs et al 1982 and topp et al 1986 and suggest that dcf s higher uptake capacity in the roots in comparison with the leaves can be attributed to its high hydrophobicity and low solubility in water 2 37 mg l 1 at 25 c in turn this means that chemicals with a log kow 4 such as dcf have a high retention potential in plant roots pharmaceutical compounds have been shown kumar and gupta 2016 to be absorbed at different rates in different plant compartments in function of their physicochemical properties log kow molecular weight etc and our results confirm these observations 3 3 leaf root concentration ratio cleaf croot the leaf root concentration ratio cleaf croot was calculated to assess the root to leaf translocation potential for cbz and dcf figs 6 and 7 for cbz the cleaf croot ratio was 1 in all cases indicating good root to leaf drug translocation contrastingly in the case of dcf all cleaf croot ratios were 1 this implies that dcf translocation was limited probably due to its lipophilicity which means that root to leave translocation is considered a passive process that depends on the drug s physicochemical properties simonich and hites 1995 these results agree with those published by briggs et al 1982 who showed that the efficiency of the root to leaf translocation of a chemical substance is independent of its concentration in the external solution 3 4 calculation of risk to human health the ultimate aim of this study was to determine whether the accumulation of cbz and dcf in edible parts of lettuces constitutes a potential risk to human health due to their incorporation into the food chain this evaluation took into account the worst exposure scenario using the highest concentrations of cbz and dcf observed in the lettuce leaves figs 2 and 4 daily human intake of each drug for each variety of lettuce was estimated by multiplying the concentration calculated for the edible portion ng g 1 by average lettuce consumption 7 0 g day for a 70 kg individual national center for environmental assessment 2011 taking into consideration the acceptable daily intakes for cbz and dcf bruce et al 2010 which indicate the maximum amount of product a person can ingest per day we can see from table 2 that the estimated quantities of cbz and dcf ingested per day are below the acceptable limits therefore the present study shows that the daily consumption of lettuce irrigated with regenerated water mixed with cbz does not represent a threat to health as the daily quantity of cbz consumed by a person weighing 70 0 kg is estimated to be 145 67 ng kg 1 mini romaine lettuce while the maximum acceptable daily intake is 340 ng kg 1 in the case of dcf the estimated daily quantity ingested is well below the acceptable limits the estimated daily intake of dcf consumed by a person weighing 70 0 kg is 8 22 ng kg 1 mini romaine lettuce whereas the maximum acceptable daily intake is 67 000 ng kg 1 so the daily consumption of lettuce irrigated with regenerated water mixed with dcf does not represent a threat to health although our results suggest the consumption of lettuces irrigated with wastewater can be considered safe this study only covers two pharmaceuticals in three varieties of lettuce therefore more research such as the work proposed herein is required to estimate the level of human exposure to these and other pharmaceuticals due to the consumption of crops irrigated with water reclaimed from wwtps and to ensure correct agricultural use of wastewater without posing any risk to human health 4 conclusions this study has demonstrated the uptake capacity of cbz and dcf by roots and leaves of three varieties of lettuce in comparison with the roots in the case of cbz the leaves presented the highest levels of uptake and greatest bcfs due to the drug s neutral charge and intermediate hydrophobicity while for dcf the highest uptake levels and bcfs were observed in the roots due to its high hydrophobicity and low solubility in water this pattern was observed also in the cleaf croot ratio which was higher than 1 for cbz indicating good root to leaf translocation of cbz but by contrast all cleaf croot ratios were lesser than 1 for dcf suggesting dcf translocation was limited the objective of this paper was to evaluate the human health risk posed by cbz and dcf absorbed in lettuces our study has revealed that introduction of cbz and dcf through the food chain pathway does not imply any risk to human health due to that the estimated daily quantity of drug consumed of cbz and are below the maximum acceptable daily intake more research such as the one proposed in this study are very necessary to studied in the future and

11411,this manuscript presents an economic assessment of two lettuce production systems soil cultivation sc and nutrient film technique nft under three supply scenarios considering increasing desalinated seawater dsw availability in the nft system the yield the water productivity the total cost the revenue and the profit were 5 5 3 5 5 9 5 7 and 3 5 times higher than in the sc system respectively the financial assessment showed a net present value npv in the nft system 3 1 times higher than in the sc system which indicated that the nft system could be a more interesting strategy than sc however the internal rate of return in the sc system was 4 times higher than in the nft system which showed the significantly higher economic profitability of sc investments and the higher profitability risk of the nft system in this sense the higher investment and operational costs in the nft system led to a lower ratio of profit total costs 0 079 versus 0 134 which under non limiting conditions positioned the latter above the nft system the sensitivity analysis to the price of dsw showed a negative npv in the sc cultivation under 100 of irrigation with dsw from a water price of 1 1 m3 such a negative npv was reached from 1 6 m3 in the nft system regarding the sensitivity analysis for lettuce yield the npv became negative in the sc system at a yield of 36 000 kg ha and in the nft system under 100 of irrigation with dsw when yield was less than 215 000 kg ha year in short the results indicated that the nft system should only be positioned above the sc system under an expected scenario of limited water and land and or the need to preserve environmentally vulnerable areas keywords nutrient film technique water productivity net present value outflow inflow analysis desalinated seawater 1 introduction the world population is expected to exceed 9 billion people by 2050 this will require extending the land equipped for irrigation by some 32 million hectares to guarantee an increase in overall food production of some 70 faures et al 2013 feeding this increasing population will only be possible under an intensive irrigated agriculture based scenario however in arid and semiarid regions water is generally becoming scarce and the pressure on water resources is becoming more severe this usually leads to imbalances between renewable resources and total demands jeopardizing the sustainability of irrigated agriculture its resilience and hence food production this is the case of the segura river basin srb located in southeastern spain where irrigated agriculture is one of the basic pillars of the regional economic growth in the srb feeding this increasing population confronts on the one hand the current and expected limitation of the conventional water resources availability it is of note that the srb with an annual structural water deficit above 400 hm3 chs 2015 is one of the regions with the largest water deficits in europe eu and the first in spain on the other hand conventional practices currently carried out in irrigated lands have led to serious environmental consequences such as i limited control in the use of water and fertilisers ii high concentrations of nutrients and pesticides in runoff iii severe underground water pollution and iv soil degradation accompanied by erosion among others killebrew and wolff 2010 lages et al 2015 under this panorama the continuity of irrigated agriculture in arid and semiarid regions must obligatorily explore other options clear candidates are i the use of non conventional water resources such as desalinated seawater dsw martínez alvarez et al 2017 and ii the use of other irrigation system alternatives such as soilless systems i e hydroponic systems and even nutrient film technique systems nft martinez mate et al 2018 in the latter water and nutrients flow through channels where plants have their root systems in direct contact with the nutrient solution albright and langhans 1996 desalinated seawater represents an abundant coastal and steady water source which effectively removes the climatological and hydrological constraints however the high energy requirements associated to its production 4 45 kw h m3 seem to be its main limitation as compared to other conventional water resources i e from 0 06 kw h m3 for surface water to 1 21 kw h m3 for desalinated brackish water which is obviously transferred to the water cost 0 70 m3 of dsw in the srb martin gorriz et al 2014 martínez alvarez et al 2017 on evaluating the agronomic and economic implications of using dsw for irrigation are few and far between for instance ben gal et al 2009 on the border between israel and jordan just south of the black sea adjusted the nutritional quality mainly ca mg and s of dsw with an initial electrical conductivity ec 0 4 ds m and used it to irrigate a greenhouse pepper crop in their experiment the yield was increased by almost 50 while the water applied for irrigation was reduced by half however the associated cost of fertilizing with ca mg and s minerals was high around 0 43 m3 i e 3017 ha compared two tomato production systems in southwest iran one under irrigation with underground water with an ec 5 8 ds m and the other under irrigation with a mix of underground water 42 ec 5 8 ds m and dsw 58 ec 0 21 ds m their results showed that the cost of the system irrigated with dsw 6244 ha was higher than that of the conventional system 5099 ha however the specific cost per kg of tomato produced was lower in the desalinated water irrigation system 0 077 kg than in the conventional irrigation system 0 088 kg as yield was notably increased due to the better water quality additionally hydroponic systems and nft systems may support continuous production almost throughout the whole year and allow a better management of the nutrient solution increasing the efficiency in water and fertiliser use and obtaining higher yields as compared to conventional soil cultivation sc icarda aprp 2000 brechner and both 2014 based on the advantages and drawbacks mentioned as well as on others farmers should be provided with valuable information concerning environmental and economic implications in order to have criteria that allow them to decide on the most feasible option under a water scarcity situation without these analyses farmers may be reluctant to change to other more productive and efficient irrigation systems and water resources alcon et al 2013a in this sense while energy and greenhouse gas emissions associated to the use of dsw and nft systems have recently been analysed in martinez mate et al 2018 positioning the nft system over soil cultivation their economic viability is largely unknown such an economic analysis would rapidly enable the associated inflows and outflows associated to each system to be identified and immediate and decisive action be taken this criteria based decision will clearly help growers to manage and use the available resources more efficiently favouring their maximisation and increasing the level of the production systems while simultaneously reducing costs santos and junqueira 2004 in this context the specific aims of this study were i to evaluate the economic feasibility of implementing nft systems as compared to sc and ii to quantify the effect of incorporating dsw for irrigation into the outflows the inflows and a financial assessment for this purpose lettuce was the crop selected since it is the winter vegetable with the highest production and surface area in the region and is one of the most important leafy vegetable crops with a global production of 38 6 million tons in 2014 faostat 2014 additionally it can be readily grown in both soil cultivation and in soilless culture 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and water supply scenarios the study was performed in the semiarid segura river basin srb located in south eastern spain in the basin the latest official estimation is that available water resources amount to 1602 mm3 y which includes surface water groundwater water and water transferred from central spain through the inter basin tagus segura t s aqueduct as conventional resources and reclaimed water and desalinated seawater as non conventional water resources chs 2015 the srb is characterised by a marked structural water deficit of about 400 mm3 y which easily exceeds 600 mm3 y when dry years occur in the srb and or in central spain the water shortage situation mentioned and its effects on agriculture s sustainability are being partially compensated by the dsw currently supplied for agricultural use in the basin 158 mm3 y martínez alvarez et al 2017 to carry out the analyses the campo de cartagena irrigation district within the srb has been selected as the target area for the present study since it i is representative of the intensive export oriented horticulture in the basin ii is frequently subjected to water supply shortages iii uses a wide range of water sources and iv is the largest irrigation district in the srb soto garcía et al 2013 the selected irrigation district provides farmers with water by means of a collective pressurised network on rotational scheduling and the allocated water is then stored in on farm artificial ponds under these conditions farmers need to re pressurise the irrigation system with their own pumping systems for drip irrigation focusing on the water scarcity circumstances outlined above the following three desalinated seawater dsw supply scenarios have been considered in this study martinez mate et al 2018 they are based on the water availability forecasts estimated by cedex 2011 report and considering the srb water balance martínez alvarez et al 2017 1 9 dsw this represents the baseline scenario in which the use of dsw is marginal only accounting for 9 of the water demand and hence we assume that all water resources for irrigation come from surface and ground water resources 854 mm3 y irrigation returns 124 mm3 y reclaimed water 144 mm3 y desalination 158 mm3 y inter basin tagus segura water transfer 322 mm3 y and overexploitation of aquifers and deficit irrigation 400 mm3 y 2 50 dsw we assume 0 mm3 y of water transfer from the tagus basin no overexploitation of underground water resources and no deficit irrigation i e 722 mm3 y of irrigation supply should be dsw about 50 of the water demand 3 100 dsw we assume 0 mm3 y of water transfer from the tagus basin no overexploitation of underground water resources and no deficit irrigation and 0 mm3 y from surface and ground water i e 1576 mm3 y of irrigation supply should be dsw 100 of the water demand 2 2 description of the production systems production systems were inventoried according to the following categories raw materials labour and machinery table 1 for sc production the data for the analysis were provided by farm managers in the campo de cartagena irrigation district and amopa 2006 data for the nft production were collected on two existing commercial farms currently using nft systems for lettuce in the srb it should be noted that values are presented per year i e for the sc system we considered 2 cycles per year and for the nft system 9 cycles per year 2 2 1 raw materials raw materials involved the plantlets the irrigation water the electric energy the diesel the fertilisers the manure and the plant protection products table 1 for sc cultivation two cycles of lettuce were carried out which represented 310 000 plantlets ha in the case of nft a total of nine cycles with 1 485 000 plantlets ha were considered lettuce cultivated in sc consumed 3700 m3 ha year of water for irrigation whereas in nft the water consumption was 6750 m3 ha year regarding electricity farmers usually receive water from the collective pressurised network of the irrigator s community on rotational scheduling and store it in on farm ponds therefore under such conditions farmers need to spend electric energy to re pressurise the irrigation system with their own pumping systems for sc cultivation previous studies have established the average energy consumption for drip irrigation in southeast of spain to be 0 17 kw h m3 soto garcía et al 2013 in the case of nft a value of 4 42 kw h m3 was selected martinez mate et al 2018 diesel was that used by machinery in its operations i e 641 l ha year and 132 l ha year for sc and nft respectively the sc system received a different amount and type of fertilisers to those used in nft in addition the implementation of dsw in 50 dsw and 100 dsw also modified the type and amount of fertilisers applied table 2 pest control practices were those commonly used by growers in the area in sc no weeds were allowed to develop within the fields 2 2 2 machinery in the sc system machinery totalled 73 h ha and included the preparation of the soil for the transplantation 30 h ha manure distribution 4 h ha the lettuce transplantation 9 h ha the application of pesticides 5 h ha the harvest 23 h ha and the burying of lettuce remains after harvest 2 h ha table 1 in the nft system machinery which totalled 116 h ha was only used for the application of insecticides i e 58 treatments of 2 h ha per treatment 2 2 3 labour in the sc system labour totalled 1024 h ha table 1 this included the time associated directly to the machinery activities 73 h ha and those attributed to the support to the machinery activities i e the soil tillage 19 h ha the application of ground manure 7 h ha the application of pesticides 104 h ha the formation of the crop beds 18 h ha support to transplantation 222 h ha installation of irrigation pipes 39 h ha manual weeding 144 h ha support to harvest 396 h ha and the withdrawal of irrigation pipes 2 h ha amopa 2006 data not shown in the nft system labour totalled 6912 h ha and included 900 h ha for system installation and maintenance 2310 h ha for lettuce transplantation 3162 h ha for harvesting and 540 h ha for other maintenance tasks application of pesticides and fertilizers renewal data not shown 2 3 discounted cash flow and outflow inflow analysis a discounted cash flow analysis dcfa to assess the inflows and outflows of the four irrigation strategies assessed in this study was carried out the dcfa by comparing the expected benefits and costs and related cash inflows and outflows of a given initiative or investment considering the life span of the investment ifac 2008 may be a suitable tool for farmers to evaluate the feasibility of implementing different system scenarios following other previous research pérez pérez et al 2010 alcon et al 2013b maestre valero et al 2016 it has been assumed that the investment and the variable costs in this study are provided by the farmer s own funds and hence there is no financial funding to assess the economic feasibility of an investment the internal rate of return irr the net present value npv and the payback period pb years of the different initiatives were examined npv aggregates all inflows i and outflows o given in a certain period of time usually measured in years t applied to a discount rate r minus the investment costs ics 1 n p v i c s t t 1 i t o t 1 r t where i t o t denotes the expected cash flows in the period assessed r is the desired return that could be represented by the specific return an investor expects for an alternative investment with similar risk or the interest rate on debt in this dcfa r was set at 4 according to european commission 2014 the irr is the interest rate at which discounted cash outflows equal discounted cash inflows of the investment irr is commonly used to evaluate the desirability of investments or projects such that when the irr of an investment exceeds its capital cost it is economically profitable the pb period refers to the time period required for the return on an investment to repay the amount corresponding to the original investment the economic profitability of the initial investment has been estimated for a life period of 20 years which is the usual time horizon for the most durable parts of the irrigation system maestre valero et al 2016 additionally an economic outflow inflow analysis was performed to determine the following indicators profit as the difference between the cash flow of inflows and outflows profit operational costs as the relationship between the profit and the capital circulating in each annual cycle profit total costs as the relationship between the profit and the total cost tc in each annual cycle and break even cost as the price per kilo of lettuce above which the business begins to generate profit blanco 1994 layard and glaister 1994 cantero 1996 it should be noted that the proportional part of the investment taken in a year considering the lifespan of the elements infrastructure and materials involved and per ha was also considered as a part of the costs in this analysis 2 3 1 inflows total income was calculated as the product between the lettuce production and the sale prices according to farmers in the region i e 0 04 lettuce for lettuces weighing less than 120 g and 0 09 lettuce for lettuces weighting more than 120 g this latter value was in close agreement with that officially published by the government of the region of murcia carm 2017 i e a price for lettuce 0 10 0 03 lettuce calculated as the average of all the origin prices between november 2016 and november 2017 in the sc system from 90 of commercial lettuces 80 of lettuces were considered to have a weight of 167 g lettuce 6 lettuces kg and the rest 100 g lettuce 10 lettuces kg in the nft system the uniformity of water application is notably higher than that in sc cultivation and hence after removing non commercial lettuces 5 of plants all lettuces were considered to have 167 g 6 lettuces kg personal communication no increase of yield has been considered in the analysis due to the implementation of 50 or 100 of dsw in 50 dsw and 100 dsw scenarios respectively 2 3 2 outflows outflows must distinguish between investment costs ics and operational costs oc ics refer to the value of the initial investment that enables the activity start up while the operational costs correspond to the cash flow necessary for the proper running and development of the activity 2 3 2 1 investment in this study the initial ic for the two irrigation systems comprised the cost of both the labour as well as the assets needed to establish the irrigation system and associated infrastructures table 3 2 3 2 1 1 soil cultivation considering an average farm area of 10 ha the total ics have been estimated to be 98 788 of which 20 000 are associated to the construction of a shed for equipment and irrigation control 40 000 to the irrigation equipment and system and 38 788 to the agricultural water reservoir with a capacity of 10 000 m3 such a capacity has been defined considering the storing of enough water to irrigate for 21 consecutive days during the period of highest crop water demand in an agronomical year up to three growing cycles for sc vegetable crops mainly lettuce broccoli potatoes melon and watermelon are possible a common practice among farmers in the campo de cartagena irrigation district is to crop lettuce lettuce melon in an agronomical year consequently lettuce is cultivated twice a year in the same field with a growing cycle of between 56 and 98 days martinez mate et al 2018 therefore bearing in mind the percentage of land occupation by lettuce and melon crops in a year 60 of the investment has been attributed to lettuce with the remaining 40 being assigned to the melon crop 2 3 2 1 2 soilless culture nutrient film technique the construction of a shed for equipment and irrigation control 20 000 and the agricultural water reservoir 38 788 were considered as equal to the sc system and considering a surface of 10 ha the rest of the elements were determined for a surface area of 1 ha 28 900 for irrigation structures 82 956 for pumping and irrigation system and 12 435 for the drainage network the total investment cost for 1 ha of nft system was 130 170 2 3 2 2 operational costs the ocs cover all inputs used in the annual productive process and have been considered within four categories which include raw materials labour and machinery table 4 to compute the oc unit prices have been considered constant throughout the project lifespan with 2017 being taken as the reference year it should be noted that the costs for taxes and insurance were not considered in this study 2 3 2 2 1 raw materials each plantlet cost was selected at 0 013 plantlet according to market prices in 9 dsw an average water price of 0 19 0 06 m3 was selected according to the water price in the last 5 years prior to the use of the dsw in the campo de cartagena irrigation district in 100 dsw an average water price of 0 70 m3 was selected according to martínez alvarez et al 2017 in 50 dsw we selected a water price of 0 44 m3 computed as the average of water prices of 9 dsw and 100 dsw the price of electricity 0 11 kw h was obtained from the national institute of statistics ine 2017 diesel was valued at 1 l prices of fertilisers and pesticides were selected according to the market 2 3 2 2 2 labour the labour cost was selected at 8 h 2 3 2 2 3 machinery in the sc system the hourly cost for machinery used for the preparation of the soil for the transplantation was selected at 34 h the distribution of manure was valued at 39 h the lettuce transplantation hourly cost was 25 h the application of pesticides was valued at 24 h the hourly cost for the harvesting was 30 h lastly the burying of lettuce remains after harvest was valued at 27 h in the nft system an hourly value of 24 h was selected as the only machinery used in this production system was that associated to the application of insecticides 3 results and discussion 3 1 outflow inflow analysis table 5 shows the ics ocs revenues and profits for the sc and the nft lettuce production systems for 9 dsw 50 dsw and 100 dsw scenarios considering the mean value for the three dsw scenarios in the sc system the tc i e the ic plus the oc was on average 19 753 994 ha year with a revenue from the lettuce production of 22 360 ha year which generated a profit of 2608 994 ha year such a profit was to a certain extent lower than that calculated by capra et al 2008 for lettuce production under sc in eastern sicily italy as the yield was significantly lower in our study in the case of nft these values were notably higher than those calculated for the sc system i e 117 947 2039 ha year 127 221 ha year and 9275 2039 ha year respectively table 5 it is of note that in the sc system the profit total cost ratio was 0 137 0 058 whereas in the nft system that value was reduced to 0 095 0 023 which indicated the higher profitability of the sc system per cost unit the break even cost in the sc and the nft systems was similar 0 530 0 027 kg and 0 501 0 009 kg in the case of the sc system the ic 416 ha year only represented 2 11 0 11 of the tc whereas in the nft system that figure represented 16 5 0 28 fig 1 in both the sc and the nft systems the highest ocs were labour 41 5 2 09 and 46 9 0 81 of the tc and plantlets 20 4 1 03 and 16 4 0 28 of the tc respectively our results for sc cultivation were in close concordance with those published in rezende et al 2011 who performing an economic analysis of open field lettuce production in sao paulo also indicated that human labour and plantlets were the highest ocs with 41 5 and 23 4 of the ocs respectively similarly galinato and miles 2013 evaluated the economic profitability of growing open field lettuce in western washington and reported that the total human labour cost comprised more than 50 of the total production costs these results indicate that the first actions to reduce ocs should focus mainly on the lowering of the plantlet cost and especially on increasing the efficiency of the human labour in the case of the nft system an exhaustive literature search has demonstrated the non existence of financial assessments associated to nft production in open field therefore the reliability and representativeness of our data for nft cannot be compared to other studies as has been done for sc cultivation the representation of the irrigation water and fertilisers in the tcs ranged between 9 1 and 17 8 of the tc in the sc system and between 11 1 and 14 1 of the tc in the nft system under 9 dsw and 100 dsw respectively consequently only slight differences in the tcs between scenarios were observed as other costs such as labour and plantlets were far more representative table 5 accordingly the implementation of 50 or 100 of dsw for irrigation and the adaptation of the fertigation programmes to the different water supply scenarios only produced small increases in the ocs table 5 as already observed in other studies karami et al 2017 in the case of the sc irrigation with dsw within the ocs irrigation water and fertilisers increased from 1712 ha year in 9 dsw when 0 of dsw was used to 3698 ha year in 100 dsw when 100 of dsw was used this represented an increase of 8 7 of the tc in the case of the nft system those values were 12 894 ha year in 9 dsw and 16 933 ha year in 100 dsw this represented an increase of 10 9 of the tc the variation of fertilisers among water supply scenarios is shown in table 2 such an increase in the use of fertilisers when dsw was the only water resource used for irrigation has also been previously documented in ben gal et al 2009 for pepper in the northern arava valley in our study such a small variation among scenarios could justify that the use of dsw for irrigation valued in this study at 0 70 m3 is not the most significant limiting factor from the economic point of view even when dsw is the only available water resource for irrigation 3 2 discounted cash flow table 6 shows the npv the irr and the payback period for the sc and nft lettuce production systems for 9 dsw 50 dsw and 100 dsw scenarios for the simulated 20 year period the ic and ocs in the nft system were around 5 9 times higher than in the sc system table 5 and the time required to recover the ic was between 3 and 4 years in the sc system and between 6 and 8 years in the nft system this can be explained by the lower ratios of revenue nft revenue sc and profit nft profit sc compared to tc nft tc sc table 5 regardless of the water supply scenarios npv in the nft system 107 221 27 715 ha was 3 1 times higher than the npv in sc system 33 981 13 503 ha which could indicate that for the simulation for the 20 year period the nft system is a more interesting enterprise than sc cultivation however in the sc system the irr was 4 times higher than in the nft system which showed the significantly higher profitability of the sc investments this makes sense as the tcs during the 20 year simulation in the sc system amounted to only 395 050 19 871 ha with a total revenue of 447 203 ha whereas those values in the nft system were much higher 2 358 935 40 787 ha and 2 544 428 ha respectively data not shown accordingly a lettuce production management error that may compromise for instance 50 of annual production in the sc system i e 1 cycle 21 427 kg ha year and in the nft system i e about 4 5 cycles 117 797 kg ha year would lead to negative revenues for the sc system 8572 994 ha year and the nft system 54 336 2039 ha year regarding the different water supply scenarios analysed the implementation of 50 or 100 of dsw for irrigation and the adaptation of the fertigation programmes to the different water supply scenarios did produce high reductions in the npv or the irr table 6 consequently our results demonstrated that bearing in mind the following assumptions i fixed buying prices for irrigation tw 0 19 m3 and dsw 0 70 m3 and ii a fixed selling lettuce price of 0 54 kg for lettuces of 167 g and 0 40 kg for lettuces of 100 g a farmer with a great purchasing capacity and a well established agronomic knowledge in nft system management could assume the risk of cultivating lettuce under the nft system on the contrary a farmer with reduced purchasing capacity or without sound knowledge in nft systems should cultivate under sc systems additionally the nft system could be justified under scenarios such as i a lack of agricultural land availability due to its higher yield 235 595 kg ha in nft versus 42 854 kg ha in sc ii a lack of water availability due to its higher water productivity 34 9 kg m3 in nft versus 10 1 kg m3 in sc and or iii the cultivation in environmentally vulnerable zones since according to martinez mate et al 2018 who evaluated the energy and greenhouse gas emissions of lettuce production using the same database used in this study not only does the nft system not use the soil for cultivation but also requires less specific energy 4 87 mj kg in the nft system versus 5 29 mj kg in the sc system and produces less specific greenhouse gas emissions 0 12 kgco2eq kg in the nft system versus 0 26 kgco2eq kg in the sc system than the sc cultivation martinez mate et al 2018 3 3 sensitivity analysis under a water scarcity context such as the one facing the region of this study not only will water become increasingly scarce and of worse quality hence limiting the growing production of food stuffs ayers and westcot 1985 but also its cost for irrigation will increase martínez alvarez et al 2014 consequently a sensitivity analysis of the feasibility of the sc and nft lettuce production systems to varying dsw prices and lettuce yield will allow possible impacts on the dcfa and hence in the profitability to be identified with this aim dsw prices were varied between 0 5 and 4 m3 while keeping the remaining variables constant in addition lettuce yield was varied between 20 000 and 50 000 kg ha year in the sc system and between 175 000 and 250 000 kg ha year in the nft system fig 2 a and b show the sensitivity analysis of npv derived for a 20 year time period to dsw prices and lettuce yield respectively for the three water supply scenarios regarding the effect of the dsw price variation on the profitability in the case of the sc cultivation the npv became negative in 50 dsw for a dsw price of 2 1 m3 and in 100 dsw for a water price of 1 1 m3 in the case of the nft system the npv became negative in 50 dsw for a dsw price of 3 2 m3 and in 100 dsw for a water price of 1 6 m3 in 100 dsw these dsw prices are quite close to the current and expected dsw prices which indicates that agriculture irrigated with only dsw could be feasible in both sc and nft systems if the water price does not exceed those limits concerning the effect of the lettuce yield variation on the profitability in the case of the sc cultivation the npv became negative at a yield of 36 000 kg ha year i e 18 000 kg ha cycle regardless of the water supply scenario in the case of the nft system negative npv values were observed only in 100 dsw when the yield was lower than 215 000 kg ha year i e 23 888 kg ha cycle 4 conclusions the economic feasibility of two lettuce production systems soil cultivation sc and nutrient film technique nft has been analysed under three supply scenarios considering increasing desalinated seawater dsw availability the low representation of the irrigation water and the fertilisers within the total costs has avoided the great differences in the total costs among scenarios as other costs such as labour and plantlets are far more representative the implementation of the nft system involves a notable increase in both the investment as well as the operational costs compared to the sc system however as the revenue has also significantly increased the profit in the nft system has still been higher than in the sc system in spite of these results it is of note that the higher profit total cost ratio and internal rate of return in the sc system has indicated the higher profitability of the sc system compared to the nft system under a scenario in which 100 of dsw is required for irrigation of lettuce water price thresholds of 1 1 m3 and 1 6 m3 are required in sc and nft systems respectively for the investment to be feasible on the other hand under a situation of lack of agricultural land or water availability and or the need for the preservation of environmentally vulnerable areas the nft could be positioned over the sc system due to its higher yield and water productivity and lower specific energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions one must bear in mind that due to its high profitability risk nft systems should only be managed by farmers with a great purchasing capacity and well established agronomic knowledge in the nft system management acknowledgments this work was supported by the fundación séneca agencia de ciencia y tecnología de la región

11411,this manuscript presents an economic assessment of two lettuce production systems soil cultivation sc and nutrient film technique nft under three supply scenarios considering increasing desalinated seawater dsw availability in the nft system the yield the water productivity the total cost the revenue and the profit were 5 5 3 5 5 9 5 7 and 3 5 times higher than in the sc system respectively the financial assessment showed a net present value npv in the nft system 3 1 times higher than in the sc system which indicated that the nft system could be a more interesting strategy than sc however the internal rate of return in the sc system was 4 times higher than in the nft system which showed the significantly higher economic profitability of sc investments and the higher profitability risk of the nft system in this sense the higher investment and operational costs in the nft system led to a lower ratio of profit total costs 0 079 versus 0 134 which under non limiting conditions positioned the latter above the nft system the sensitivity analysis to the price of dsw showed a negative npv in the sc cultivation under 100 of irrigation with dsw from a water price of 1 1 m3 such a negative npv was reached from 1 6 m3 in the nft system regarding the sensitivity analysis for lettuce yield the npv became negative in the sc system at a yield of 36 000 kg ha and in the nft system under 100 of irrigation with dsw when yield was less than 215 000 kg ha year in short the results indicated that the nft system should only be positioned above the sc system under an expected scenario of limited water and land and or the need to preserve environmentally vulnerable areas keywords nutrient film technique water productivity net present value outflow inflow analysis desalinated seawater 1 introduction the world population is expected to exceed 9 billion people by 2050 this will require extending the land equipped for irrigation by some 32 million hectares to guarantee an increase in overall food production of some 70 faures et al 2013 feeding this increasing population will only be possible under an intensive irrigated agriculture based scenario however in arid and semiarid regions water is generally becoming scarce and the pressure on water resources is becoming more severe this usually leads to imbalances between renewable resources and total demands jeopardizing the sustainability of irrigated agriculture its resilience and hence food production this is the case of the segura river basin srb located in southeastern spain where irrigated agriculture is one of the basic pillars of the regional economic growth in the srb feeding this increasing population confronts on the one hand the current and expected limitation of the conventional water resources availability it is of note that the srb with an annual structural water deficit above 400 hm3 chs 2015 is one of the regions with the largest water deficits in europe eu and the first in spain on the other hand conventional practices currently carried out in irrigated lands have led to serious environmental consequences such as i limited control in the use of water and fertilisers ii high concentrations of nutrients and pesticides in runoff iii severe underground water pollution and iv soil degradation accompanied by erosion among others killebrew and wolff 2010 lages et al 2015 under this panorama the continuity of irrigated agriculture in arid and semiarid regions must obligatorily explore other options clear candidates are i the use of non conventional water resources such as desalinated seawater dsw martínez alvarez et al 2017 and ii the use of other irrigation system alternatives such as soilless systems i e hydroponic systems and even nutrient film technique systems nft martinez mate et al 2018 in the latter water and nutrients flow through channels where plants have their root systems in direct contact with the nutrient solution albright and langhans 1996 desalinated seawater represents an abundant coastal and steady water source which effectively removes the climatological and hydrological constraints however the high energy requirements associated to its production 4 45 kw h m3 seem to be its main limitation as compared to other conventional water resources i e from 0 06 kw h m3 for surface water to 1 21 kw h m3 for desalinated brackish water which is obviously transferred to the water cost 0 70 m3 of dsw in the srb martin gorriz et al 2014 martínez alvarez et al 2017 on evaluating the agronomic and economic implications of using dsw for irrigation are few and far between for instance ben gal et al 2009 on the border between israel and jordan just south of the black sea adjusted the nutritional quality mainly ca mg and s of dsw with an initial electrical conductivity ec 0 4 ds m and used it to irrigate a greenhouse pepper crop in their experiment the yield was increased by almost 50 while the water applied for irrigation was reduced by half however the associated cost of fertilizing with ca mg and s minerals was high around 0 43 m3 i e 3017 ha compared two tomato production systems in southwest iran one under irrigation with underground water with an ec 5 8 ds m and the other under irrigation with a mix of underground water 42 ec 5 8 ds m and dsw 58 ec 0 21 ds m their results showed that the cost of the system irrigated with dsw 6244 ha was higher than that of the conventional system 5099 ha however the specific cost per kg of tomato produced was lower in the desalinated water irrigation system 0 077 kg than in the conventional irrigation system 0 088 kg as yield was notably increased due to the better water quality additionally hydroponic systems and nft systems may support continuous production almost throughout the whole year and allow a better management of the nutrient solution increasing the efficiency in water and fertiliser use and obtaining higher yields as compared to conventional soil cultivation sc icarda aprp 2000 brechner and both 2014 based on the advantages and drawbacks mentioned as well as on others farmers should be provided with valuable information concerning environmental and economic implications in order to have criteria that allow them to decide on the most feasible option under a water scarcity situation without these analyses farmers may be reluctant to change to other more productive and efficient irrigation systems and water resources alcon et al 2013a in this sense while energy and greenhouse gas emissions associated to the use of dsw and nft systems have recently been analysed in martinez mate et al 2018 positioning the nft system over soil cultivation their economic viability is largely unknown such an economic analysis would rapidly enable the associated inflows and outflows associated to each system to be identified and immediate and decisive action be taken this criteria based decision will clearly help growers to manage and use the available resources more efficiently favouring their maximisation and increasing the level of the production systems while simultaneously reducing costs santos and junqueira 2004 in this context the specific aims of this study were i to evaluate the economic feasibility of implementing nft systems as compared to sc and ii to quantify the effect of incorporating dsw for irrigation into the outflows the inflows and a financial assessment for this purpose lettuce was the crop selected since it is the winter vegetable with the highest production and surface area in the region and is one of the most important leafy vegetable crops with a global production of 38 6 million tons in 2014 faostat 2014 additionally it can be readily grown in both soil cultivation and in soilless culture 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and water supply scenarios the study was performed in the semiarid segura river basin srb located in south eastern spain in the basin the latest official estimation is that available water resources amount to 1602 mm3 y which includes surface water groundwater water and water transferred from central spain through the inter basin tagus segura t s aqueduct as conventional resources and reclaimed water and desalinated seawater as non conventional water resources chs 2015 the srb is characterised by a marked structural water deficit of about 400 mm3 y which easily exceeds 600 mm3 y when dry years occur in the srb and or in central spain the water shortage situation mentioned and its effects on agriculture s sustainability are being partially compensated by the dsw currently supplied for agricultural use in the basin 158 mm3 y martínez alvarez et al 2017 to carry out the analyses the campo de cartagena irrigation district within the srb has been selected as the target area for the present study since it i is representative of the intensive export oriented horticulture in the basin ii is frequently subjected to water supply shortages iii uses a wide range of water sources and iv is the largest irrigation district in the srb soto garcía et al 2013 the selected irrigation district provides farmers with water by means of a collective pressurised network on rotational scheduling and the allocated water is then stored in on farm artificial ponds under these conditions farmers need to re pressurise the irrigation system with their own pumping systems for drip irrigation focusing on the water scarcity circumstances outlined above the following three desalinated seawater dsw supply scenarios have been considered in this study martinez mate et al 2018 they are based on the water availability forecasts estimated by cedex 2011 report and considering the srb water balance martínez alvarez et al 2017 1 9 dsw this represents the baseline scenario in which the use of dsw is marginal only accounting for 9 of the water demand and hence we assume that all water resources for irrigation come from surface and ground water resources 854 mm3 y irrigation returns 124 mm3 y reclaimed water 144 mm3 y desalination 158 mm3 y inter basin tagus segura water transfer 322 mm3 y and overexploitation of aquifers and deficit irrigation 400 mm3 y 2 50 dsw we assume 0 mm3 y of water transfer from the tagus basin no overexploitation of underground water resources and no deficit irrigation i e 722 mm3 y of irrigation supply should be dsw about 50 of the water demand 3 100 dsw we assume 0 mm3 y of water transfer from the tagus basin no overexploitation of underground water resources and no deficit irrigation and 0 mm3 y from surface and ground water i e 1576 mm3 y of irrigation supply should be dsw 100 of the water demand 2 2 description of the production systems production systems were inventoried according to the following categories raw materials labour and machinery table 1 for sc production the data for the analysis were provided by farm managers in the campo de cartagena irrigation district and amopa 2006 data for the nft production were collected on two existing commercial farms currently using nft systems for lettuce in the srb it should be noted that values are presented per year i e for the sc system we considered 2 cycles per year and for the nft system 9 cycles per year 2 2 1 raw materials raw materials involved the plantlets the irrigation water the electric energy the diesel the fertilisers the manure and the plant protection products table 1 for sc cultivation two cycles of lettuce were carried out which represented 310 000 plantlets ha in the case of nft a total of nine cycles with 1 485 000 plantlets ha were considered lettuce cultivated in sc consumed 3700 m3 ha year of water for irrigation whereas in nft the water consumption was 6750 m3 ha year regarding electricity farmers usually receive water from the collective pressurised network of the irrigator s community on rotational scheduling and store it in on farm ponds therefore under such conditions farmers need to spend electric energy to re pressurise the irrigation system with their own pumping systems for sc cultivation previous studies have established the average energy consumption for drip irrigation in southeast of spain to be 0 17 kw h m3 soto garcía et al 2013 in the case of nft a value of 4 42 kw h m3 was selected martinez mate et al 2018 diesel was that used by machinery in its operations i e 641 l ha year and 132 l ha year for sc and nft respectively the sc system received a different amount and type of fertilisers to those used in nft in addition the implementation of dsw in 50 dsw and 100 dsw also modified the type and amount of fertilisers applied table 2 pest control practices were those commonly used by growers in the area in sc no weeds were allowed to develop within the fields 2 2 2 machinery in the sc system machinery totalled 73 h ha and included the preparation of the soil for the transplantation 30 h ha manure distribution 4 h ha the lettuce transplantation 9 h ha the application of pesticides 5 h ha the harvest 23 h ha and the burying of lettuce remains after harvest 2 h ha table 1 in the nft system machinery which totalled 116 h ha was only used for the application of insecticides i e 58 treatments of 2 h ha per treatment 2 2 3 labour in the sc system labour totalled 1024 h ha table 1 this included the time associated directly to the machinery activities 73 h ha and those attributed to the support to the machinery activities i e the soil tillage 19 h ha the application of ground manure 7 h ha the application of pesticides 104 h ha the formation of the crop beds 18 h ha support to transplantation 222 h ha installation of irrigation pipes 39 h ha manual weeding 144 h ha support to harvest 396 h ha and the withdrawal of irrigation pipes 2 h ha amopa 2006 data not shown in the nft system labour totalled 6912 h ha and included 900 h ha for system installation and maintenance 2310 h ha for lettuce transplantation 3162 h ha for harvesting and 540 h ha for other maintenance tasks application of pesticides and fertilizers renewal data not shown 2 3 discounted cash flow and outflow inflow analysis a discounted cash flow analysis dcfa to assess the inflows and outflows of the four irrigation strategies assessed in this study was carried out the dcfa by comparing the expected benefits and costs and related cash inflows and outflows of a given initiative or investment considering the life span of the investment ifac 2008 may be a suitable tool for farmers to evaluate the feasibility of implementing different system scenarios following other previous research pérez pérez et al 2010 alcon et al 2013b maestre valero et al 2016 it has been assumed that the investment and the variable costs in this study are provided by the farmer s own funds and hence there is no financial funding to assess the economic feasibility of an investment the internal rate of return irr the net present value npv and the payback period pb years of the different initiatives were examined npv aggregates all inflows i and outflows o given in a certain period of time usually measured in years t applied to a discount rate r minus the investment costs ics 1 n p v i c s t t 1 i t o t 1 r t where i t o t denotes the expected cash flows in the period assessed r is the desired return that could be represented by the specific return an investor expects for an alternative investment with similar risk or the interest rate on debt in this dcfa r was set at 4 according to european commission 2014 the irr is the interest rate at which discounted cash outflows equal discounted cash inflows of the investment irr is commonly used to evaluate the desirability of investments or projects such that when the irr of an investment exceeds its capital cost it is economically profitable the pb period refers to the time period required for the return on an investment to repay the amount corresponding to the original investment the economic profitability of the initial investment has been estimated for a life period of 20 years which is the usual time horizon for the most durable parts of the irrigation system maestre valero et al 2016 additionally an economic outflow inflow analysis was performed to determine the following indicators profit as the difference between the cash flow of inflows and outflows profit operational costs as the relationship between the profit and the capital circulating in each annual cycle profit total costs as the relationship between the profit and the total cost tc in each annual cycle and break even cost as the price per kilo of lettuce above which the business begins to generate profit blanco 1994 layard and glaister 1994 cantero 1996 it should be noted that the proportional part of the investment taken in a year considering the lifespan of the elements infrastructure and materials involved and per ha was also considered as a part of the costs in this analysis 2 3 1 inflows total income was calculated as the product between the lettuce production and the sale prices according to farmers in the region i e 0 04 lettuce for lettuces weighing less than 120 g and 0 09 lettuce for lettuces weighting more than 120 g this latter value was in close agreement with that officially published by the government of the region of murcia carm 2017 i e a price for lettuce 0 10 0 03 lettuce calculated as the average of all the origin prices between november 2016 and november 2017 in the sc system from 90 of commercial lettuces 80 of lettuces were considered to have a weight of 167 g lettuce 6 lettuces kg and the rest 100 g lettuce 10 lettuces kg in the nft system the uniformity of water application is notably higher than that in sc cultivation and hence after removing non commercial lettuces 5 of plants all lettuces were considered to have 167 g 6 lettuces kg personal communication no increase of yield has been considered in the analysis due to the implementation of 50 or 100 of dsw in 50 dsw and 100 dsw scenarios respectively 2 3 2 outflows outflows must distinguish between investment costs ics and operational costs oc ics refer to the value of the initial investment that enables the activity start up while the operational costs correspond to the cash flow necessary for the proper running and development of the activity 2 3 2 1 investment in this study the initial ic for the two irrigation systems comprised the cost of both the labour as well as the assets needed to establish the irrigation system and associated infrastructures table 3 2 3 2 1 1 soil cultivation considering an average farm area of 10 ha the total ics have been estimated to be 98 788 of which 20 000 are associated to the construction of a shed for equipment and irrigation control 40 000 to the irrigation equipment and system and 38 788 to the agricultural water reservoir with a capacity of 10 000 m3 such a capacity has been defined considering the storing of enough water to irrigate for 21 consecutive days during the period of highest crop water demand in an agronomical year up to three growing cycles for sc vegetable crops mainly lettuce broccoli potatoes melon and watermelon are possible a common practice among farmers in the campo de cartagena irrigation district is to crop lettuce lettuce melon in an agronomical year consequently lettuce is cultivated twice a year in the same field with a growing cycle of between 56 and 98 days martinez mate et al 2018 therefore bearing in mind the percentage of land occupation by lettuce and melon crops in a year 60 of the investment has been attributed to lettuce with the remaining 40 being assigned to the melon crop 2 3 2 1 2 soilless culture nutrient film technique the construction of a shed for equipment and irrigation control 20 000 and the agricultural water reservoir 38 788 were considered as equal to the sc system and considering a surface of 10 ha the rest of the elements were determined for a surface area of 1 ha 28 900 for irrigation structures 82 956 for pumping and irrigation system and 12 435 for the drainage network the total investment cost for 1 ha of nft system was 130 170 2 3 2 2 operational costs the ocs cover all inputs used in the annual productive process and have been considered within four categories which include raw materials labour and machinery table 4 to compute the oc unit prices have been considered constant throughout the project lifespan with 2017 being taken as the reference year it should be noted that the costs for taxes and insurance were not considered in this study 2 3 2 2 1 raw materials each plantlet cost was selected at 0 013 plantlet according to market prices in 9 dsw an average water price of 0 19 0 06 m3 was selected according to the water price in the last 5 years prior to the use of the dsw in the campo de cartagena irrigation district in 100 dsw an average water price of 0 70 m3 was selected according to martínez alvarez et al 2017 in 50 dsw we selected a water price of 0 44 m3 computed as the average of water prices of 9 dsw and 100 dsw the price of electricity 0 11 kw h was obtained from the national institute of statistics ine 2017 diesel was valued at 1 l prices of fertilisers and pesticides were selected according to the market 2 3 2 2 2 labour the labour cost was selected at 8 h 2 3 2 2 3 machinery in the sc system the hourly cost for machinery used for the preparation of the soil for the transplantation was selected at 34 h the distribution of manure was valued at 39 h the lettuce transplantation hourly cost was 25 h the application of pesticides was valued at 24 h the hourly cost for the harvesting was 30 h lastly the burying of lettuce remains after harvest was valued at 27 h in the nft system an hourly value of 24 h was selected as the only machinery used in this production system was that associated to the application of insecticides 3 results and discussion 3 1 outflow inflow analysis table 5 shows the ics ocs revenues and profits for the sc and the nft lettuce production systems for 9 dsw 50 dsw and 100 dsw scenarios considering the mean value for the three dsw scenarios in the sc system the tc i e the ic plus the oc was on average 19 753 994 ha year with a revenue from the lettuce production of 22 360 ha year which generated a profit of 2608 994 ha year such a profit was to a certain extent lower than that calculated by capra et al 2008 for lettuce production under sc in eastern sicily italy as the yield was significantly lower in our study in the case of nft these values were notably higher than those calculated for the sc system i e 117 947 2039 ha year 127 221 ha year and 9275 2039 ha year respectively table 5 it is of note that in the sc system the profit total cost ratio was 0 137 0 058 whereas in the nft system that value was reduced to 0 095 0 023 which indicated the higher profitability of the sc system per cost unit the break even cost in the sc and the nft systems was similar 0 530 0 027 kg and 0 501 0 009 kg in the case of the sc system the ic 416 ha year only represented 2 11 0 11 of the tc whereas in the nft system that figure represented 16 5 0 28 fig 1 in both the sc and the nft systems the highest ocs were labour 41 5 2 09 and 46 9 0 81 of the tc and plantlets 20 4 1 03 and 16 4 0 28 of the tc respectively our results for sc cultivation were in close concordance with those published in rezende et al 2011 who performing an economic analysis of open field lettuce production in sao paulo also indicated that human labour and plantlets were the highest ocs with 41 5 and 23 4 of the ocs respectively similarly galinato and miles 2013 evaluated the economic profitability of growing open field lettuce in western washington and reported that the total human labour cost comprised more than 50 of the total production costs these results indicate that the first actions to reduce ocs should focus mainly on the lowering of the plantlet cost and especially on increasing the efficiency of the human labour in the case of the nft system an exhaustive literature search has demonstrated the non existence of financial assessments associated to nft production in open field therefore the reliability and representativeness of our data for nft cannot be compared to other studies as has been done for sc cultivation the representation of the irrigation water and fertilisers in the tcs ranged between 9 1 and 17 8 of the tc in the sc system and between 11 1 and 14 1 of the tc in the nft system under 9 dsw and 100 dsw respectively consequently only slight differences in the tcs between scenarios were observed as other costs such as labour and plantlets were far more representative table 5 accordingly the implementation of 50 or 100 of dsw for irrigation and the adaptation of the fertigation programmes to the different water supply scenarios only produced small increases in the ocs table 5 as already observed in other studies karami et al 2017 in the case of the sc irrigation with dsw within the ocs irrigation water and fertilisers increased from 1712 ha year in 9 dsw when 0 of dsw was used to 3698 ha year in 100 dsw when 100 of dsw was used this represented an increase of 8 7 of the tc in the case of the nft system those values were 12 894 ha year in 9 dsw and 16 933 ha year in 100 dsw this represented an increase of 10 9 of the tc the variation of fertilisers among water supply scenarios is shown in table 2 such an increase in the use of fertilisers when dsw was the only water resource used for irrigation has also been previously documented in ben gal et al 2009 for pepper in the northern arava valley in our study such a small variation among scenarios could justify that the use of dsw for irrigation valued in this study at 0 70 m3 is not the most significant limiting factor from the economic point of view even when dsw is the only available water resource for irrigation 3 2 discounted cash flow table 6 shows the npv the irr and the payback period for the sc and nft lettuce production systems for 9 dsw 50 dsw and 100 dsw scenarios for the simulated 20 year period the ic and ocs in the nft system were around 5 9 times higher than in the sc system table 5 and the time required to recover the ic was between 3 and 4 years in the sc system and between 6 and 8 years in the nft system this can be explained by the lower ratios of revenue nft revenue sc and profit nft profit sc compared to tc nft tc sc table 5 regardless of the water supply scenarios npv in the nft system 107 221 27 715 ha was 3 1 times higher than the npv in sc system 33 981 13 503 ha which could indicate that for the simulation for the 20 year period the nft system is a more interesting enterprise than sc cultivation however in the sc system the irr was 4 times higher than in the nft system which showed the significantly higher profitability of the sc investments this makes sense as the tcs during the 20 year simulation in the sc system amounted to only 395 050 19 871 ha with a total revenue of 447 203 ha whereas those values in the nft system were much higher 2 358 935 40 787 ha and 2 544 428 ha respectively data not shown accordingly a lettuce production management error that may compromise for instance 50 of annual production in the sc system i e 1 cycle 21 427 kg ha year and in the nft system i e about 4 5 cycles 117 797 kg ha year would lead to negative revenues for the sc system 8572 994 ha year and the nft system 54 336 2039 ha year regarding the different water supply scenarios analysed the implementation of 50 or 100 of dsw for irrigation and the adaptation of the fertigation programmes to the different water supply scenarios did produce high reductions in the npv or the irr table 6 consequently our results demonstrated that bearing in mind the following assumptions i fixed buying prices for irrigation tw 0 19 m3 and dsw 0 70 m3 and ii a fixed selling lettuce price of 0 54 kg for lettuces of 167 g and 0 40 kg for lettuces of 100 g a farmer with a great purchasing capacity and a well established agronomic knowledge in nft system management could assume the risk of cultivating lettuce under the nft system on the contrary a farmer with reduced purchasing capacity or without sound knowledge in nft systems should cultivate under sc systems additionally the nft system could be justified under scenarios such as i a lack of agricultural land availability due to its higher yield 235 595 kg ha in nft versus 42 854 kg ha in sc ii a lack of water availability due to its higher water productivity 34 9 kg m3 in nft versus 10 1 kg m3 in sc and or iii the cultivation in environmentally vulnerable zones since according to martinez mate et al 2018 who evaluated the energy and greenhouse gas emissions of lettuce production using the same database used in this study not only does the nft system not use the soil for cultivation but also requires less specific energy 4 87 mj kg in the nft system versus 5 29 mj kg in the sc system and produces less specific greenhouse gas emissions 0 12 kgco2eq kg in the nft system versus 0 26 kgco2eq kg in the sc system than the sc cultivation martinez mate et al 2018 3 3 sensitivity analysis under a water scarcity context such as the one facing the region of this study not only will water become increasingly scarce and of worse quality hence limiting the growing production of food stuffs ayers and westcot 1985 but also its cost for irrigation will increase martínez alvarez et al 2014 consequently a sensitivity analysis of the feasibility of the sc and nft lettuce production systems to varying dsw prices and lettuce yield will allow possible impacts on the dcfa and hence in the profitability to be identified with this aim dsw prices were varied between 0 5 and 4 m3 while keeping the remaining variables constant in addition lettuce yield was varied between 20 000 and 50 000 kg ha year in the sc system and between 175 000 and 250 000 kg ha year in the nft system fig 2 a and b show the sensitivity analysis of npv derived for a 20 year time period to dsw prices and lettuce yield respectively for the three water supply scenarios regarding the effect of the dsw price variation on the profitability in the case of the sc cultivation the npv became negative in 50 dsw for a dsw price of 2 1 m3 and in 100 dsw for a water price of 1 1 m3 in the case of the nft system the npv became negative in 50 dsw for a dsw price of 3 2 m3 and in 100 dsw for a water price of 1 6 m3 in 100 dsw these dsw prices are quite close to the current and expected dsw prices which indicates that agriculture irrigated with only dsw could be feasible in both sc and nft systems if the water price does not exceed those limits concerning the effect of the lettuce yield variation on the profitability in the case of the sc cultivation the npv became negative at a yield of 36 000 kg ha year i e 18 000 kg ha cycle regardless of the water supply scenario in the case of the nft system negative npv values were observed only in 100 dsw when the yield was lower than 215 000 kg ha year i e 23 888 kg ha cycle 4 conclusions the economic feasibility of two lettuce production systems soil cultivation sc and nutrient film technique nft has been analysed under three supply scenarios considering increasing desalinated seawater dsw availability the low representation of the irrigation water and the fertilisers within the total costs has avoided the great differences in the total costs among scenarios as other costs such as labour and plantlets are far more representative the implementation of the nft system involves a notable increase in both the investment as well as the operational costs compared to the sc system however as the revenue has also significantly increased the profit in the nft system has still been higher than in the sc system in spite of these results it is of note that the higher profit total cost ratio and internal rate of return in the sc system has indicated the higher profitability of the sc system compared to the nft system under a scenario in which 100 of dsw is required for irrigation of lettuce water price thresholds of 1 1 m3 and 1 6 m3 are required in sc and nft systems respectively for the investment to be feasible on the other hand under a situation of lack of agricultural land or water availability and or the need for the preservation of environmentally vulnerable areas the nft could be positioned over the sc system due to its higher yield and water productivity and lower specific energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions one must bear in mind that due to its high profitability risk nft systems should only be managed by farmers with a great purchasing capacity and well established agronomic knowledge in the nft system management acknowledgments this work was supported by the fundación séneca agencia de ciencia y tecnología de la región

11412,subirrigation is employed to supply water to crop root zones via subsurface drainage systems which are typically installed for the purpose of excess soil water removal crop yield increases due to subirrigation have been demonstrated in numerous studies but there is limited information regarding yield under future climate conditions when growing season conditions are expected to be drier in the u s corn belt drainmod was calibrated and validated for three locations with different soil series in northwest ohio and used to investigate maize relative yield differences between subirrigation and free subsurface drainage for historic 1984 2013 and future 2041 2070 climate conditions for historic conditions the mean maize relative yield increased by 27 with subirrigation on the nappanee loam soil but had minimal effect on the paulding clay and hoytville silty clay soils maize relative yield under free subsurface drainage is predicted to decrease in the future causing the relative yield difference between free subsurface drainage and subirrigation practices to nearly double from 9 to 16 between the historic and future periods consequently the subirrigation practice can potentially mitigate adverse future climate change impacts on maize yield in northwest ohio keywords drainage maumee drainmod hoytville nappanee paulding 1 introduction although the u s corn belt generally receives sufficient annual precipitation to satisfy the total annual crop evapotranspiration demands disparities exist between crop water demands and effective water availability during the drier months of the growing season irrigation is often used on agricultural lands to supplement precipitation and maintain appropriate soil water during periods of high crop water demands in the u s corn belt supplemental water supply to maize zea mays through irrigation may help mitigate the impacts of drought on yield therefore helping to sustain or increase agricultural productivity baker et al 2012 irrigation can be implemented using several available methods including sprinkler drip and subirrigation subirrigation has considerable potential in the u s corn belt because it relies on subsurface drainage systems to supply water directly to the crop root zone brown et al 1997 therefore minimizing irrigation water losses as well as irrigation system installation and operation costs the application of water below the ground surface during subirrigation helps raise and maintain the water table at an appropriate depth in the crop root zone cooper et al 1992 the subsurface drainage system serves a dual purpose of a channel network to provide root zone drainage during wet periods or irrigation during periods of drought more than 30 of agricultural lands in the u s corn belt have subsurface drainage systems some of which can be retrofitted for subirrigation zucker and brown 1998 drainage system retrofitting usually involves reducing drain spacing by installing new drain lines between old ones to more effectively distribute water horizontally within the soil profile during subirrigation and to more quickly drain water from the soil in response to large rainfall events subirrigation capable fields are not only operated in subirrigation mode but also controlled drainage and free subsurface drainage modes as the need arises in free subsurface drainage systems the soil profile is allowed to drain freely to the depth of the drains during controlled drainage the drainage depth is regulated at a controlled structure most often installed at the subsurface drainage system outlet but without the addition of supplemental water on subirrigation capable fields water can be supplied continuously to the root zone during the growing season or can be interrupted by short periods of free or controlled subsurface drainage in this paper the term subirrigation refers to the period during which water is supplied to the crop whereas subirrigation practice refers to the water management practice that includes subirrigation free and or controlled subsurface drainage studies of the effectiveness of subirrigation practice on maize yield have generally found that the yield increased significantly and stabilized at a high level under subirrigation practice cooper et al 1999 found that maize production on ravenna silt loam and hoytville silty clay loam soils in ohio was 2900 kg ha to 3750 kg ha higher under subirrigation practice mainly during dry years in 1998 drury et al 2009 found that maize yield was significantly lower under subirrigation practice on brookston clay loam soil at woodslee ontario and suggested the large august precipitation as well as the tile spacing and depth as plausible causes for the lower yield on omulga silt loam soil in southern ohio fisher et al 1999 found that maize yield was 19 greater under subirrigation practice than under free subsurface drainage maize yield was found to be 64 larger under subirrigation practice in a sandy loam soil in southwestern ontario ng et al 2002 and 2 8 to 13 8 greater in eastern ontario mejia et al 2000 other studies also based on field experiments used wetland reservoir complexes where runoff and subsurface drainage water was captured and recycled back into the subsurface drainage system at holiday beach ontario tan et al 2007 found that maize yield under subirrigation practice was 91 larger than under free subsurface drainage during dry years and 7 22 larger during wet years in northwest ohio allred et al 2014 used a water capture and recycle system designated wetland reservoir subirrigation system wrsis on three different soil types and found that maize yield increased by 19 1 with the implementation of subirrigation practice field measurements need to be extended by modeling studies to predict the impact of subirrigation under future climate conditions maize yield performance under subirrigation practice has also been investigated through drainmod simulations drainmod is a field hydrology water balance computer model that simulates free subsurface drainage controlled drainage and subirrigation either as single water table management practices or in combination with one another skaggs et al 2012 murugaboopathi et al 1995 conducted a study based on a 37 year period 1950 1986 simulation with uncalibrated drainmod using the rains and portsmouth sandy loam soils found in north carolina and found that subirrigation practice had a 21 maize relative yield advantage over free subsurface drainage the study in northwest ohio by allred et al 2014 measured crop yield impacts at three sites with different soils for twelve years baule et al 2017 utilized results from allred et al and regional climate model output to evaluate the impact of growing season precipitation on yields at the three sites and how yields will respond under projected climate conditions as the u s corn belt is expected to experience annual shifts in temperature solar radiation and precipitation regimes in the near term and further into the future toward warmer and wetter conditions karl et al 2009 pryor et al 2014 research needs to be conducted to define the benefits of subirrigation practice for maintaining or increasing maize yield under future climate the goal of this study was to investigate the potential maize relative yield that could be expected in northwest ohio with subirrigation practice in comparison to free subsurface drainage under historic 1984 2013 and future climate conditions 2041 2070 2 material and methods 2 1 study location the sites simulated in this study are located in fulton defiance and van wert counties in northwest ohio fig 1 at each site similar fields with free subsurface drainage and no irrigation were used as controls runoff and subsurface drainage water were collected at each site and routed to a wetland reservoir complex and from there used to subirrigate the crops on the subirrigated fields because drainmod does not simulate water capture and recycling the wetland reservoir was not simulated in this work the objective of subirrigation was to maintain the water table depth above the drains at 25 cm below ground surface during the growing season may september therefore depending on the frequency and the depth of precipitation events the water table management of the subirrigated fields varied between free subsurface drainage controlled drainage and subirrigation the non subirrigated fields were under free subsurface drainage year round the sites were in operation between 1996 and 2008 during which maize and soybeans were grown in rotation the system is described more fully in allred et al 2014 2 2 subirrigation and crop relative yield simulation with drainmod drainmod simulates subirrigation in shallow soils with impermeable layers a modification of the water movement rate model developed by ernst 1974 is implemented to estimate the rate at which water moves into the soil profile from the drains and to determine the depth of the water table at the end of each simulated day skaggs 1981 the user enters the dates at which control weir levels or water table management practice are changed the new weir depth below ground surface and the new water table management practice the control weir is raised above the drain level to create controlled drainage or subirrigation conditions and is lowered to the drain level to create free drainage conditions besides its hydrologic simulation capability drainmod predicts crop relative yield response to the soil water regime based on a stress day index method evans et al 1991 therefore drainmod can be used to quantify the relative yield response of various water management systems and strategies the relative yield can be defined as the ratio of the yield under a particular set of stress excess water drought planting delay to the maximum yield potential of a field drainmod calculates crop relative yield from simulated stresses using the simulated amount and duration of excess water above a defined water table threshold drought intensity and duration and extent of the planting delay during a given simulated year the overall crop relative yield is estimated using eq 1 1 y r y r w y r d y r p where yr w is the relative yield with only excess water stress yr d is the relative yield with only drought stress and yr p is the relative yield that would result from planting delay only yr w yr d and yr p are estimated using linear functions based on the magnitude of wet and drought stresses that occurred during the growing season and on the planting delay singh et al 2006 evans et al 1991 kanwar et al 1994 mukhtar et al 1990 and shaw 1978 provided detailed information on the estimation of the crop relative yield and proposed several linear functions to relate wet and drought stresses to relative yield previous studies showed that drainmod crop relative yield predictions approached field measurements based estimates depending on the growing season conditions ale et al 2009 kanwar et al 1994 satchithanantham and ranjan 2015 wang et al 2006 2 3 drainmod setup a draimod realization was setup for each location inputs of drainage design according to the conceptual representation shown in fig 2 and water table management strategy soil and crop parameters and weather data are required to simulate a subirrigation system 2 3 1 drainage system design the values of the subsurface drainage system parameters used in this work are presented in table 1 while the drainage systems on the experimental fields were generally designed based on drainage coefficients of 3 8 5 1 cm d 1 allred et al 2014 a drainage coefficient of 5 1 cm d 1 was simulated at the 3 sites at defiance the soil conductivity greatly decreased at 76 cm below ground surface so drains were simulated above that depth while at fulton and van wert 84 cm was used at each site the drains were either 10 cm diameter corrugated plastic pipes or clay tiles therefore their effective radius was 0 51 cm as recommended by skaggs 1980 information regarding the subirrigation pump flow rate was not reported therefore 16 cm d 1 representing twice the estimated value of the maximum daily evapotranspiration etp at the three sites was conservatively selected as the maximum capacity of the subirrigation pump under the assumption that evapotranspiration needs during drought spells are satisfied exclusively by water supplied via subirrigation 2 3 2 soil data the major soil series found at the defiance fulton and van wert sites are paulding clay nappanee loam and hoytville silty clay respectively allred et al 2014 soil survey staff 2013 these soils are characterized by the presence of a clay subsoil that forms an impeding layer for root growth and water flow the paulding clay soil series is a dense glacio lacustrine deposit mostly located on lake plains and characterized by a very low permeability a very poor drainage and frequent ponding and a significant shrink swell potential making it prone for large crack development during drying located on lake plains as well the nappanee loam soil series is also a dense glacio lacustrine deposit characterized by a flat topography a somewhat poor drainage a moderate shrink swell potential with a low ponding potential and a moderately low to high conductivity soil survey staff 2013 the hoytville silty clay soil series is also located on lake plains and also characterized by a flat topography the hoytville silty clay soil series is a dense glacio lacustrine deposit as well and characterized by a low to moderate conductivity a very poor drainage and frequent ponding soil survey staff 2013 the ponding potential description of the soil series served as base for surface storage parameter values selection table 1 based on the recommendations from skaggs 1980 and workman and fausey 1985 soil texture and hydraulic properties obtained from the ssurgo database of the 3 sites and from previous onsite measurements are reported in table 2 besides the hydraulic conductivity of the soil profiles soil water characteristics green ampt infiltration model parameters the drainage volume water table depth and the water upflux water table depth relationships were needed to run drainmod the soil utility package included in drainmod was used to estimate these hydraulic properties based on pedotransfer function parameters obtained using the pedotransfer estimation software rosetta schaap et al 2001 the pedotransfer function parameters were estimated in rosetta using the texture and water holding capacity of the soil series 2 3 3 crop and trafficability parameter relative yield simulation in drainmod requires the soil root zone water content at wilting point the drought period susceptibility factor the desired planting date the growing season length the limiting water table depth and the effective root depth vs days after planting relationship skaggs 1980 initial values of soil water content at wilting point were selected from the ssurgo database and were calibrated table 3 between 1997 and 2006 the average planting date at the experimental sites was may 10th therefore this date was selected as the desired planting date a growing season length of 136 days was selected as suggested by barker et al 2005 based on the selected planting window and the growing season length the simulations were conducted over a cropping window extending from april to october the effective root depth vs days after planting relationship is used by drainmod to define the depth at which water is imported to satisfy evapotranspiration etp needs the effective rooting depth increases along the growing season and an effective maximum depth of 45 cm may be reached for maize approximately 80 days after planting skaggs 1980 however the growth rate and the maximum growth is affected by the presence of physical and chemical barriers as well as water table depth in this work maximum effective root depth values greater than 25 cm caused large excess moisture stresses independently of the simulated soil types leading to simulated extended planting delays or absence of planting therefore a maximum effective root depth of 25 cm was used for the 3 sites a fallow period effective root depth of 3 cm and a crop yield limiting water table depth of 30 cm were selected as recommended by skaggs 1980 for maize field trafficability parameters strongly affect field work and consequently the planting day drainmod delays planting until soil moisture satisfies the constraints imposed by the trafficability parameters such as the minimum required air volume to work land the minimum rain to delay work and the delay after rain to restart work the trafficability parameter values used in this study were derived from nolte et al 1983 for the minimum soil air volume required to complete field operations 1 5 cm and 2 cm were used for the planting and the harvest periods respectively planting and harvest operations were delayed for 2 days for daily precipitation amounts larger than 1 cm and 0 5 cm respectively larger daily precipitation amounts above which field operations were delayed were considered based on nolte et al 1983 observations and expert recommendations but resulted in large excess moisture stresses 2 3 4 climate data two periods were simulated in this work a historic period from 1984 to 2013 and a future period from 2041 to 2070 for each site observed daily precipitation and temperature data for 1984 2013 were obtained from the global historic climatology network daily menne et al 2012 the mean growing season precipitation amounts may september calculated from the observed daily precipitation data were 45 cm for defiance and fulton and 50 cm for van wert drainmod requires hourly precipitation data which was not available for any of the sites hourly precipitation were estimated using the disaggregation utility available in drainmod that evenly distributes the daily rainfall over the user defined duration ale et al 2009 singh et al 2006 skaggs et al 2012 it was assumed that daily precipitation events likely occurred between 12 00 pm and 6 00 pm accordingly the daily precipitation amounts were disaggregated within that time window daily etp estimates were calculated for each site using the priestly taylor method priestley and taylor 1972 daily precipitation and temperature data came from the nearest weather station to each site while daily solar radiation values used for the etp calculation were obtained from the gridded climatology resource for agro climatology white et al 2011 as no in situ observations of solar radiation were available projected climate data from the general circulation model regional climate model combinations crcm cgcm3 rcm3 gfdl and mm5i hadcm3 forced by the special report on emissions scenario a2 scenario ipcc 2007 were selected to evaluate the impacts of a variety of different projected future climate regimes over northwest ohio the climate model derived projections for daily precipitation temperature and solar radiation were obtained from the north american regional climate change assessment program narccap mearns et al 2009 for the historic period 1971 2000 and the future period 2041 2070 the projections were analyzed for biases and corrected using the relative deviations between the observed and the projected data during the historic period priestly taylor method was used as well to estimate the daily etp for the future period 2 4 calibration and validation drainmod was calibrated and validated to simulate the daily water table depths observed at defiance in 2004 and 2006 respectively and the annual relative yields calculated from annual yields observed at each site between 1996 and 2008 by allred et al 2014 for each site observation based annual relative yields were calculated as the ratio between the observed annual yields and the largest yield observed during the experimental period at the corresponding site refer to supplemental information for full details the parameter estimation program pest doherty 2002 was linked to drainmod and used to adjust the pedotransfer function pore tortuosity and connection coefficient the shape parameter α and the lateral and overall saturated hydraulic conductivity by soil layer table 2 adjusting these parameters resulted in modifying the relationship between the water table depth and the volume of water drained as well as the upflux and the green ampt model parameters for the purpose of improving the fit between observed and modeled daily water table depth for fulton and van wert the pedotransfer function parameter values yielded by rosetta were not modified due to the lack of hydrologic observation data yield prediction parameters table 3 were adjusted to replicate the observation based annual relative yields the coefficients proposed by kanwar et al 1994 for wet stress and shaw 1978 for drought stress were used to initiate the relative yield simulation and were adjusted within the ranges shown in table 3 using the linked pest drainmod model an initial value of 1 was selected for drought period susceptibility factor and was also adjusted 2 5 long term simulations free subsurface drainage and subirrigation practices were simulated for each of the three sites for 1 the period 1984 2013 using observed weather data and 2 the period 2041 2070 using the three model based climate projections for free subsurface drainage the system was allowed to drain freely year round subirrigation was implemented by setting the drainage control weir at 25 cm below ground surface from june 15th to september 25th and water is added from september 25th to june 14th water is allowed to drain freely and subirrigation is not implemented the effect of subirrigation practice on the hydrologic regime of the experimental fields under 1984 2013 and 2041 2070 climate conditions was analyzed using t tests to compare the mean water table depth drainage runoff and subirrigation between the two water table management practices at each site anova test with tukey procedures were used at 5 significance level to assess the relative yield difference between the historic and the future period and the impacts of growing season precipitation regime on relative yield 3 results and discussion 3 1 projected climatological changes the climate projections indicated substantial changes in growing season climate when compared to historical values particularly in terms of temperature table 4 growing season max min and mean temperatures are projected to increase at similar magnitude by the mid 21st century while precipitation projections are mixed for future growing seasons the cumulative distribution of the growing season precipitation estimated from the projected data for the future period indicates that the crcm cgcm3 growing season precipitation is closely distributed around a mean value whereas those projected by mm5i hadcm3 and rcm3 gfdl are highly variable fig 3 mm5i hadcm3 had the largest range in growing season precipitation distribution of the three models as a result of these projected changes in temperature and solar radiation etp is also expected to increase during the growing season 3 2 drainmod performance assessment details of drainmod calibration and validation results with supporting figures are presented in the supplementary material of this paper only a brief summary is presented here the predicted daily water table depth at defiance generally approached the observations with mean absolute error of 7 2 cm for calibration and 14 cm for validation daily nse for water table depth at defiance was 0 35 for calibration and 3 84 for validation attempts to further reduce the errors between the observed and the modeled water table depth especially for 2006 validation were unsuccessful and conflicted with observation based annual relative yields predicted relative yields generally approached observation based relative yields fig 4 the mean absolute errors between simulated and observation based maize relative yield varied between 8 11 for subirrigation practice and 10 to 13 for free subsurface drainage 3 3 impacts of subirrigation practice on hydrology 3 3 1 water table subirrigation is expected to raise the water table during the growing season thereby increasing crop yield however at defiance very low soil lateral hydraulic conductivity limited the effectiveness of subirrigation fig 5 in 2004 the water table level at the start of the subirrigation period shaded was at the level of the weir and was able to remain at this height but in 2005 and 2006 the rise of the water table was slow after the inception of subirrigation and it took almost the entire subirrigation period for the water table to reach the weir level as a result only 36 mm of water could be added to the profile through subirrigation table 5 and there was little impact of subirrigation on hydrology or relative crop yield at the defiance site at fulton and van wert faster water table responses to subirrigation were simulated due to the higher soil lateral hydraulic conductivity the average difference in water table depth between subirrigation practice and free subsurface drainage during the growing season was significant table 5 and ranged from 17 cm to 52 cm indicating that subirrigation effectively raised the water table depth at these two sites hydrology of the subirrigated fields also differed from the free draining fields during the non growing season when no subirrigation took place due to the difference in drain spacing by design a narrower spacing is used in the subirrigated fields to increase the distribution rate of water within the soil profile during subirrigation events allred et al 2014 as a result the water table was generally deeper in the subirrigated fields in the non growing season with the depth difference between the two practices ranging from 3 cm to 19 cm the difference at defiance was the lowest due to the very slow hydraulic conductivity under future climate conditions daily water table depths in the subirrigated fields followed the same pattern shallower during the growing season and deeper during the non growing season except at defiance where the difference was not significant p value 0 05 table 5 in general the water table depth did not differ significantly between historic and future climate 3 3 2 drain flow and runoff drain flow was higher in the subirrigated fields during both growing and non growing seasons table 5 due to the narrower drain spacing surface runoff was also higher in the subirrigated fields during the growing season probably due to the higher soil moisture content resulting from the subirrigation but lower during the non growing season due to the increased drain flow resulting in lower soil moisture ng et al 2002 also found that the cumulative drain flow from the subirrigated fields was slightly larger than that from free draining fields drury et al 2009 found that runoff was larger under subirrigation but in contrast to this site drainage was lower probably because the drain spacing was the same et was higher during the growing season as expected since the subirrigation provided more of the crop water needs and similar in both fields during the non growing season similar results regarding drainage runoff and et apply to historic as well as future conditions hence although the distribution of seasonal precipitation is expected to change with the future period expected to frequently receive larger precipitation during the growing season fig 3 no significant impacts on mean water table depth mean drainage mean runoff and mean subirrigation patterns are expected 3 4 impacts of subirrigation practice on maize relative yield under historic conditions 3 4 1 annual relative yields crop yield response to subirrigation differed among the three sites fig 6 at defiance the low conductivity soils resulted in little response to subirrigation with relative yield under free drainage and subirrigation almost identical allred et al 2014 observed similar response to subirrigation practice at defiance 3 relative yield difference murugaboopathi et al 1995 also found that maize subirrigation practice in low conductivity soils tended to result in low relative yields in their north carolina soils the greatest impact of subirrigation was found at the fulton site where the overall relative yield difference for the simulated period was 26 5 this is very similar to the 27 relative yield difference observed by allred et al 2014 at this site for the 1998 2008 period subirrigation had less impact at van wert because relative yields under free subsurface drainage i e without irrigation were considerably higher than at fulton the mean annual relative yields were 80 for subirrigation and 79 for free subsurface drainage with a non significant difference of 1 fig 6 p value 0 6 while the relative yield difference between the two managements reported by allred et al 2014 was 7 3 4 2 effects of dry years and wet years at both fulton and van wert the annual relative yields under the two management practices varied inversely correlation coefficients 0 63 and 0 55 for fulton and van wert respectively fig 7 this means that wet years which resulted in higher relative yields in free draining fields actually lowered the relative yield in the subirrigated fields this impact was further explored by comparing the relative annual yields based on the growing season precipitation fig 7 at defiance the difference in relative yield between the two practices was not significant in wet or dry years due to low conductivity soils as discussed previously at the fulton site crop yield benefited from subirrigation in both dry and wet years with the strongest response in dry years as expected the yield benefits in wet years are likely due to the narrower drain spacing at van wert crop yield benefited from subirrigation in dry years but declined in wet years a supplemental addition of water via subirrigation during periods of frequent rainfall events potentially increases the risks of root zone flooding and crop respiration disruption which can lead to lower crop yield in practice and as always recommended the farmer would be expected to actively manage subirrigation during the growing season by discontinuing the water supply and lowering the control weir in response to large rainfall events allred et al 2003 active management of subirrigation systems during the growing season with regard to rainfall events prevents root zone flooding problems and in fact leads to modest crop yield increases in subirrigated fields during wet growing seasons allred et al 2014 however this was not simulated results show that implementing subirrigation at defiance and van wert during wet years may not benefit maize unless an intermittent or active management of the subirrigation system is conducted 3 5 implication of climate change on the relative yield differences the difference between the relative yield simulated for free drainage and subirrigation was affected by changes in climate conditions fig 6 table 6 at defiance fulton and van wert the difference between the mean relative yield under subirrigation practice and that under free subsurface drainage was 2 10 and 8 larger during the future period as compared to the historic period respectively the increase in relative yield difference is generally due to the expected drop in relative yield under free subsurface drainage whereas relative yield under subirrigation practice will remain unchanged lower non irrigated yields in northeast ohio under future conditions 2041 2060 were also found in a simulation study conducted with dssat decision support system for agro technology transfer by brumbelow and georgakakos 2001 using the epic agroecosystem model izaurralde et al 2003 and brown and rosenberg 1999 found that maize yield will potentially increase along with atmospheric co2 increase in the corn belt under future conditions but assessed that projected water stress and evapotranspiration increase will negatively affect maize yield therefore there is a potential for alleviating the impacts of climate change through the implementation of subirrigation practice that provides enough soil moisture at the appropriate time to compensate for the increased water demands by introducing subirrigation in their management farmers in rainfed areas can lower the threats of occasional droughts and maintain high yields 4 limitations drainmod estimates the relative yield only as a function of the intensity and duration of wet and dry stresses and planting delays predicted for the growing season potential stresses such as diseases and nutrient availability are not simulated while salinity stress which can be simulated by drainmod is unlikely in humid ohio conditions therefore a 100 relative yield indicates the maximum yield that could be obtained during a growing season if there was neither wet nor dry stresses during the growing season and if planting occurred on time in reality other factors may occur during the growing season that affect crop yield drainmod is being modified to address the potential impacts of other factors on crop yield by incorporation of a crop model dssat negm et al 2014a 2014b a climate factor that was not simulated here but that may strongly affect maize growth and yield is atmospheric concentration of co2 which is highly relevant to crop yield under future conditions although this study was instrumental at defining the potential implications of climate change on maize relative yield under subirrigation practice in northern ohio factors such as adaptive agricultural management response to climate change planting date shifts cultivars changes etc were not considered further studies that combine the potential impacts of these factors will provide a more complete picture of the climate change impact on maize relative yield under subirrigation practice in northern ohio 5 conclusion this paper provides the result of a simulation study conducted with drainmod to investigate the effects of subirrigation practice on maize yield under historic 1984 2013 and future 2041 2070 climate conditions the three sites studied here showed a range of responses to subirrigation leading to the following conclusions at sites with low soil hydraulic conductivity defiance subirrigation may have little effect site selection is critical to identify suitable soils with moderate to high lateral hydraulic conductivities crop yield response to subirrigation can be as high as 26 5 at sites that respond well to subirrigation such as fulton future benefits are expected to increase long term average benefits of 26 5 under historic precipitation may increase to 36 under future climate conditions at fulton crop yield increased in both dry and wet years indicating that the soils responded positively to subirrigation and were not unduly harmed by excess water at sites that generally do not require irrigation for high yields van wert crop yield increased in dry years but decreased in wet years demonstrating the importance of actively managing the water control structures to limit excess water effects crop yields under free subsurface drainage are expected to decline under future climate conditions but subirrigation can maintain yields at their historic level on soils that respond well to subirrigation the mean relative yield difference between subirrigation and free drainage will potentially nearly double from 15 to 24 between the historic period and the future period at the three sites reported here drain spacing was narrower in the subirrigated fields resulting in higher drain flow but lower surface runoff during the non growing season larger drain flow can increase the potential for nutrient export however capturing and recycling water and nutrients as was done at these sites can be used to curb the negative environmental impacts of narrower drain spacing overall maize relative yield increases can be expected with subirrigation practice on suitable soils the simulations with future climate projections 2041 2070 indicated that maize relative yield will potentially drop in the future but subirrigation practice may help alleviate the impacts of climate change by holding relative yields at the level observed during the historic period acknowledgements the authors extend their gratitude to the ohio agricultural research and development center

11412,subirrigation is employed to supply water to crop root zones via subsurface drainage systems which are typically installed for the purpose of excess soil water removal crop yield increases due to subirrigation have been demonstrated in numerous studies but there is limited information regarding yield under future climate conditions when growing season conditions are expected to be drier in the u s corn belt drainmod was calibrated and validated for three locations with different soil series in northwest ohio and used to investigate maize relative yield differences between subirrigation and free subsurface drainage for historic 1984 2013 and future 2041 2070 climate conditions for historic conditions the mean maize relative yield increased by 27 with subirrigation on the nappanee loam soil but had minimal effect on the paulding clay and hoytville silty clay soils maize relative yield under free subsurface drainage is predicted to decrease in the future causing the relative yield difference between free subsurface drainage and subirrigation practices to nearly double from 9 to 16 between the historic and future periods consequently the subirrigation practice can potentially mitigate adverse future climate change impacts on maize yield in northwest ohio keywords drainage maumee drainmod hoytville nappanee paulding 1 introduction although the u s corn belt generally receives sufficient annual precipitation to satisfy the total annual crop evapotranspiration demands disparities exist between crop water demands and effective water availability during the drier months of the growing season irrigation is often used on agricultural lands to supplement precipitation and maintain appropriate soil water during periods of high crop water demands in the u s corn belt supplemental water supply to maize zea mays through irrigation may help mitigate the impacts of drought on yield therefore helping to sustain or increase agricultural productivity baker et al 2012 irrigation can be implemented using several available methods including sprinkler drip and subirrigation subirrigation has considerable potential in the u s corn belt because it relies on subsurface drainage systems to supply water directly to the crop root zone brown et al 1997 therefore minimizing irrigation water losses as well as irrigation system installation and operation costs the application of water below the ground surface during subirrigation helps raise and maintain the water table at an appropriate depth in the crop root zone cooper et al 1992 the subsurface drainage system serves a dual purpose of a channel network to provide root zone drainage during wet periods or irrigation during periods of drought more than 30 of agricultural lands in the u s corn belt have subsurface drainage systems some of which can be retrofitted for subirrigation zucker and brown 1998 drainage system retrofitting usually involves reducing drain spacing by installing new drain lines between old ones to more effectively distribute water horizontally within the soil profile during subirrigation and to more quickly drain water from the soil in response to large rainfall events subirrigation capable fields are not only operated in subirrigation mode but also controlled drainage and free subsurface drainage modes as the need arises in free subsurface drainage systems the soil profile is allowed to drain freely to the depth of the drains during controlled drainage the drainage depth is regulated at a controlled structure most often installed at the subsurface drainage system outlet but without the addition of supplemental water on subirrigation capable fields water can be supplied continuously to the root zone during the growing season or can be interrupted by short periods of free or controlled subsurface drainage in this paper the term subirrigation refers to the period during which water is supplied to the crop whereas subirrigation practice refers to the water management practice that includes subirrigation free and or controlled subsurface drainage studies of the effectiveness of subirrigation practice on maize yield have generally found that the yield increased significantly and stabilized at a high level under subirrigation practice cooper et al 1999 found that maize production on ravenna silt loam and hoytville silty clay loam soils in ohio was 2900 kg ha to 3750 kg ha higher under subirrigation practice mainly during dry years in 1998 drury et al 2009 found that maize yield was significantly lower under subirrigation practice on brookston clay loam soil at woodslee ontario and suggested the large august precipitation as well as the tile spacing and depth as plausible causes for the lower yield on omulga silt loam soil in southern ohio fisher et al 1999 found that maize yield was 19 greater under subirrigation practice than under free subsurface drainage maize yield was found to be 64 larger under subirrigation practice in a sandy loam soil in southwestern ontario ng et al 2002 and 2 8 to 13 8 greater in eastern ontario mejia et al 2000 other studies also based on field experiments used wetland reservoir complexes where runoff and subsurface drainage water was captured and recycled back into the subsurface drainage system at holiday beach ontario tan et al 2007 found that maize yield under subirrigation practice was 91 larger than under free subsurface drainage during dry years and 7 22 larger during wet years in northwest ohio allred et al 2014 used a water capture and recycle system designated wetland reservoir subirrigation system wrsis on three different soil types and found that maize yield increased by 19 1 with the implementation of subirrigation practice field measurements need to be extended by modeling studies to predict the impact of subirrigation under future climate conditions maize yield performance under subirrigation practice has also been investigated through drainmod simulations drainmod is a field hydrology water balance computer model that simulates free subsurface drainage controlled drainage and subirrigation either as single water table management practices or in combination with one another skaggs et al 2012 murugaboopathi et al 1995 conducted a study based on a 37 year period 1950 1986 simulation with uncalibrated drainmod using the rains and portsmouth sandy loam soils found in north carolina and found that subirrigation practice had a 21 maize relative yield advantage over free subsurface drainage the study in northwest ohio by allred et al 2014 measured crop yield impacts at three sites with different soils for twelve years baule et al 2017 utilized results from allred et al and regional climate model output to evaluate the impact of growing season precipitation on yields at the three sites and how yields will respond under projected climate conditions as the u s corn belt is expected to experience annual shifts in temperature solar radiation and precipitation regimes in the near term and further into the future toward warmer and wetter conditions karl et al 2009 pryor et al 2014 research needs to be conducted to define the benefits of subirrigation practice for maintaining or increasing maize yield under future climate the goal of this study was to investigate the potential maize relative yield that could be expected in northwest ohio with subirrigation practice in comparison to free subsurface drainage under historic 1984 2013 and future climate conditions 2041 2070 2 material and methods 2 1 study location the sites simulated in this study are located in fulton defiance and van wert counties in northwest ohio fig 1 at each site similar fields with free subsurface drainage and no irrigation were used as controls runoff and subsurface drainage water were collected at each site and routed to a wetland reservoir complex and from there used to subirrigate the crops on the subirrigated fields because drainmod does not simulate water capture and recycling the wetland reservoir was not simulated in this work the objective of subirrigation was to maintain the water table depth above the drains at 25 cm below ground surface during the growing season may september therefore depending on the frequency and the depth of precipitation events the water table management of the subirrigated fields varied between free subsurface drainage controlled drainage and subirrigation the non subirrigated fields were under free subsurface drainage year round the sites were in operation between 1996 and 2008 during which maize and soybeans were grown in rotation the system is described more fully in allred et al 2014 2 2 subirrigation and crop relative yield simulation with drainmod drainmod simulates subirrigation in shallow soils with impermeable layers a modification of the water movement rate model developed by ernst 1974 is implemented to estimate the rate at which water moves into the soil profile from the drains and to determine the depth of the water table at the end of each simulated day skaggs 1981 the user enters the dates at which control weir levels or water table management practice are changed the new weir depth below ground surface and the new water table management practice the control weir is raised above the drain level to create controlled drainage or subirrigation conditions and is lowered to the drain level to create free drainage conditions besides its hydrologic simulation capability drainmod predicts crop relative yield response to the soil water regime based on a stress day index method evans et al 1991 therefore drainmod can be used to quantify the relative yield response of various water management systems and strategies the relative yield can be defined as the ratio of the yield under a particular set of stress excess water drought planting delay to the maximum yield potential of a field drainmod calculates crop relative yield from simulated stresses using the simulated amount and duration of excess water above a defined water table threshold drought intensity and duration and extent of the planting delay during a given simulated year the overall crop relative yield is estimated using eq 1 1 y r y r w y r d y r p where yr w is the relative yield with only excess water stress yr d is the relative yield with only drought stress and yr p is the relative yield that would result from planting delay only yr w yr d and yr p are estimated using linear functions based on the magnitude of wet and drought stresses that occurred during the growing season and on the planting delay singh et al 2006 evans et al 1991 kanwar et al 1994 mukhtar et al 1990 and shaw 1978 provided detailed information on the estimation of the crop relative yield and proposed several linear functions to relate wet and drought stresses to relative yield previous studies showed that drainmod crop relative yield predictions approached field measurements based estimates depending on the growing season conditions ale et al 2009 kanwar et al 1994 satchithanantham and ranjan 2015 wang et al 2006 2 3 drainmod setup a draimod realization was setup for each location inputs of drainage design according to the conceptual representation shown in fig 2 and water table management strategy soil and crop parameters and weather data are required to simulate a subirrigation system 2 3 1 drainage system design the values of the subsurface drainage system parameters used in this work are presented in table 1 while the drainage systems on the experimental fields were generally designed based on drainage coefficients of 3 8 5 1 cm d 1 allred et al 2014 a drainage coefficient of 5 1 cm d 1 was simulated at the 3 sites at defiance the soil conductivity greatly decreased at 76 cm below ground surface so drains were simulated above that depth while at fulton and van wert 84 cm was used at each site the drains were either 10 cm diameter corrugated plastic pipes or clay tiles therefore their effective radius was 0 51 cm as recommended by skaggs 1980 information regarding the subirrigation pump flow rate was not reported therefore 16 cm d 1 representing twice the estimated value of the maximum daily evapotranspiration etp at the three sites was conservatively selected as the maximum capacity of the subirrigation pump under the assumption that evapotranspiration needs during drought spells are satisfied exclusively by water supplied via subirrigation 2 3 2 soil data the major soil series found at the defiance fulton and van wert sites are paulding clay nappanee loam and hoytville silty clay respectively allred et al 2014 soil survey staff 2013 these soils are characterized by the presence of a clay subsoil that forms an impeding layer for root growth and water flow the paulding clay soil series is a dense glacio lacustrine deposit mostly located on lake plains and characterized by a very low permeability a very poor drainage and frequent ponding and a significant shrink swell potential making it prone for large crack development during drying located on lake plains as well the nappanee loam soil series is also a dense glacio lacustrine deposit characterized by a flat topography a somewhat poor drainage a moderate shrink swell potential with a low ponding potential and a moderately low to high conductivity soil survey staff 2013 the hoytville silty clay soil series is also located on lake plains and also characterized by a flat topography the hoytville silty clay soil series is a dense glacio lacustrine deposit as well and characterized by a low to moderate conductivity a very poor drainage and frequent ponding soil survey staff 2013 the ponding potential description of the soil series served as base for surface storage parameter values selection table 1 based on the recommendations from skaggs 1980 and workman and fausey 1985 soil texture and hydraulic properties obtained from the ssurgo database of the 3 sites and from previous onsite measurements are reported in table 2 besides the hydraulic conductivity of the soil profiles soil water characteristics green ampt infiltration model parameters the drainage volume water table depth and the water upflux water table depth relationships were needed to run drainmod the soil utility package included in drainmod was used to estimate these hydraulic properties based on pedotransfer function parameters obtained using the pedotransfer estimation software rosetta schaap et al 2001 the pedotransfer function parameters were estimated in rosetta using the texture and water holding capacity of the soil series 2 3 3 crop and trafficability parameter relative yield simulation in drainmod requires the soil root zone water content at wilting point the drought period susceptibility factor the desired planting date the growing season length the limiting water table depth and the effective root depth vs days after planting relationship skaggs 1980 initial values of soil water content at wilting point were selected from the ssurgo database and were calibrated table 3 between 1997 and 2006 the average planting date at the experimental sites was may 10th therefore this date was selected as the desired planting date a growing season length of 136 days was selected as suggested by barker et al 2005 based on the selected planting window and the growing season length the simulations were conducted over a cropping window extending from april to october the effective root depth vs days after planting relationship is used by drainmod to define the depth at which water is imported to satisfy evapotranspiration etp needs the effective rooting depth increases along the growing season and an effective maximum depth of 45 cm may be reached for maize approximately 80 days after planting skaggs 1980 however the growth rate and the maximum growth is affected by the presence of physical and chemical barriers as well as water table depth in this work maximum effective root depth values greater than 25 cm caused large excess moisture stresses independently of the simulated soil types leading to simulated extended planting delays or absence of planting therefore a maximum effective root depth of 25 cm was used for the 3 sites a fallow period effective root depth of 3 cm and a crop yield limiting water table depth of 30 cm were selected as recommended by skaggs 1980 for maize field trafficability parameters strongly affect field work and consequently the planting day drainmod delays planting until soil moisture satisfies the constraints imposed by the trafficability parameters such as the minimum required air volume to work land the minimum rain to delay work and the delay after rain to restart work the trafficability parameter values used in this study were derived from nolte et al 1983 for the minimum soil air volume required to complete field operations 1 5 cm and 2 cm were used for the planting and the harvest periods respectively planting and harvest operations were delayed for 2 days for daily precipitation amounts larger than 1 cm and 0 5 cm respectively larger daily precipitation amounts above which field operations were delayed were considered based on nolte et al 1983 observations and expert recommendations but resulted in large excess moisture stresses 2 3 4 climate data two periods were simulated in this work a historic period from 1984 to 2013 and a future period from 2041 to 2070 for each site observed daily precipitation and temperature data for 1984 2013 were obtained from the global historic climatology network daily menne et al 2012 the mean growing season precipitation amounts may september calculated from the observed daily precipitation data were 45 cm for defiance and fulton and 50 cm for van wert drainmod requires hourly precipitation data which was not available for any of the sites hourly precipitation were estimated using the disaggregation utility available in drainmod that evenly distributes the daily rainfall over the user defined duration ale et al 2009 singh et al 2006 skaggs et al 2012 it was assumed that daily precipitation events likely occurred between 12 00 pm and 6 00 pm accordingly the daily precipitation amounts were disaggregated within that time window daily etp estimates were calculated for each site using the priestly taylor method priestley and taylor 1972 daily precipitation and temperature data came from the nearest weather station to each site while daily solar radiation values used for the etp calculation were obtained from the gridded climatology resource for agro climatology white et al 2011 as no in situ observations of solar radiation were available projected climate data from the general circulation model regional climate model combinations crcm cgcm3 rcm3 gfdl and mm5i hadcm3 forced by the special report on emissions scenario a2 scenario ipcc 2007 were selected to evaluate the impacts of a variety of different projected future climate regimes over northwest ohio the climate model derived projections for daily precipitation temperature and solar radiation were obtained from the north american regional climate change assessment program narccap mearns et al 2009 for the historic period 1971 2000 and the future period 2041 2070 the projections were analyzed for biases and corrected using the relative deviations between the observed and the projected data during the historic period priestly taylor method was used as well to estimate the daily etp for the future period 2 4 calibration and validation drainmod was calibrated and validated to simulate the daily water table depths observed at defiance in 2004 and 2006 respectively and the annual relative yields calculated from annual yields observed at each site between 1996 and 2008 by allred et al 2014 for each site observation based annual relative yields were calculated as the ratio between the observed annual yields and the largest yield observed during the experimental period at the corresponding site refer to supplemental information for full details the parameter estimation program pest doherty 2002 was linked to drainmod and used to adjust the pedotransfer function pore tortuosity and connection coefficient the shape parameter α and the lateral and overall saturated hydraulic conductivity by soil layer table 2 adjusting these parameters resulted in modifying the relationship between the water table depth and the volume of water drained as well as the upflux and the green ampt model parameters for the purpose of improving the fit between observed and modeled daily water table depth for fulton and van wert the pedotransfer function parameter values yielded by rosetta were not modified due to the lack of hydrologic observation data yield prediction parameters table 3 were adjusted to replicate the observation based annual relative yields the coefficients proposed by kanwar et al 1994 for wet stress and shaw 1978 for drought stress were used to initiate the relative yield simulation and were adjusted within the ranges shown in table 3 using the linked pest drainmod model an initial value of 1 was selected for drought period susceptibility factor and was also adjusted 2 5 long term simulations free subsurface drainage and subirrigation practices were simulated for each of the three sites for 1 the period 1984 2013 using observed weather data and 2 the period 2041 2070 using the three model based climate projections for free subsurface drainage the system was allowed to drain freely year round subirrigation was implemented by setting the drainage control weir at 25 cm below ground surface from june 15th to september 25th and water is added from september 25th to june 14th water is allowed to drain freely and subirrigation is not implemented the effect of subirrigation practice on the hydrologic regime of the experimental fields under 1984 2013 and 2041 2070 climate conditions was analyzed using t tests to compare the mean water table depth drainage runoff and subirrigation between the two water table management practices at each site anova test with tukey procedures were used at 5 significance level to assess the relative yield difference between the historic and the future period and the impacts of growing season precipitation regime on relative yield 3 results and discussion 3 1 projected climatological changes the climate projections indicated substantial changes in growing season climate when compared to historical values particularly in terms of temperature table 4 growing season max min and mean temperatures are projected to increase at similar magnitude by the mid 21st century while precipitation projections are mixed for future growing seasons the cumulative distribution of the growing season precipitation estimated from the projected data for the future period indicates that the crcm cgcm3 growing season precipitation is closely distributed around a mean value whereas those projected by mm5i hadcm3 and rcm3 gfdl are highly variable fig 3 mm5i hadcm3 had the largest range in growing season precipitation distribution of the three models as a result of these projected changes in temperature and solar radiation etp is also expected to increase during the growing season 3 2 drainmod performance assessment details of drainmod calibration and validation results with supporting figures are presented in the supplementary material of this paper only a brief summary is presented here the predicted daily water table depth at defiance generally approached the observations with mean absolute error of 7 2 cm for calibration and 14 cm for validation daily nse for water table depth at defiance was 0 35 for calibration and 3 84 for validation attempts to further reduce the errors between the observed and the modeled water table depth especially for 2006 validation were unsuccessful and conflicted with observation based annual relative yields predicted relative yields generally approached observation based relative yields fig 4 the mean absolute errors between simulated and observation based maize relative yield varied between 8 11 for subirrigation practice and 10 to 13 for free subsurface drainage 3 3 impacts of subirrigation practice on hydrology 3 3 1 water table subirrigation is expected to raise the water table during the growing season thereby increasing crop yield however at defiance very low soil lateral hydraulic conductivity limited the effectiveness of subirrigation fig 5 in 2004 the water table level at the start of the subirrigation period shaded was at the level of the weir and was able to remain at this height but in 2005 and 2006 the rise of the water table was slow after the inception of subirrigation and it took almost the entire subirrigation period for the water table to reach the weir level as a result only 36 mm of water could be added to the profile through subirrigation table 5 and there was little impact of subirrigation on hydrology or relative crop yield at the defiance site at fulton and van wert faster water table responses to subirrigation were simulated due to the higher soil lateral hydraulic conductivity the average difference in water table depth between subirrigation practice and free subsurface drainage during the growing season was significant table 5 and ranged from 17 cm to 52 cm indicating that subirrigation effectively raised the water table depth at these two sites hydrology of the subirrigated fields also differed from the free draining fields during the non growing season when no subirrigation took place due to the difference in drain spacing by design a narrower spacing is used in the subirrigated fields to increase the distribution rate of water within the soil profile during subirrigation events allred et al 2014 as a result the water table was generally deeper in the subirrigated fields in the non growing season with the depth difference between the two practices ranging from 3 cm to 19 cm the difference at defiance was the lowest due to the very slow hydraulic conductivity under future climate conditions daily water table depths in the subirrigated fields followed the same pattern shallower during the growing season and deeper during the non growing season except at defiance where the difference was not significant p value 0 05 table 5 in general the water table depth did not differ significantly between historic and future climate 3 3 2 drain flow and runoff drain flow was higher in the subirrigated fields during both growing and non growing seasons table 5 due to the narrower drain spacing surface runoff was also higher in the subirrigated fields during the growing season probably due to the higher soil moisture content resulting from the subirrigation but lower during the non growing season due to the increased drain flow resulting in lower soil moisture ng et al 2002 also found that the cumulative drain flow from the subirrigated fields was slightly larger than that from free draining fields drury et al 2009 found that runoff was larger under subirrigation but in contrast to this site drainage was lower probably because the drain spacing was the same et was higher during the growing season as expected since the subirrigation provided more of the crop water needs and similar in both fields during the non growing season similar results regarding drainage runoff and et apply to historic as well as future conditions hence although the distribution of seasonal precipitation is expected to change with the future period expected to frequently receive larger precipitation during the growing season fig 3 no significant impacts on mean water table depth mean drainage mean runoff and mean subirrigation patterns are expected 3 4 impacts of subirrigation practice on maize relative yield under historic conditions 3 4 1 annual relative yields crop yield response to subirrigation differed among the three sites fig 6 at defiance the low conductivity soils resulted in little response to subirrigation with relative yield under free drainage and subirrigation almost identical allred et al 2014 observed similar response to subirrigation practice at defiance 3 relative yield difference murugaboopathi et al 1995 also found that maize subirrigation practice in low conductivity soils tended to result in low relative yields in their north carolina soils the greatest impact of subirrigation was found at the fulton site where the overall relative yield difference for the simulated period was 26 5 this is very similar to the 27 relative yield difference observed by allred et al 2014 at this site for the 1998 2008 period subirrigation had less impact at van wert because relative yields under free subsurface drainage i e without irrigation were considerably higher than at fulton the mean annual relative yields were 80 for subirrigation and 79 for free subsurface drainage with a non significant difference of 1 fig 6 p value 0 6 while the relative yield difference between the two managements reported by allred et al 2014 was 7 3 4 2 effects of dry years and wet years at both fulton and van wert the annual relative yields under the two management practices varied inversely correlation coefficients 0 63 and 0 55 for fulton and van wert respectively fig 7 this means that wet years which resulted in higher relative yields in free draining fields actually lowered the relative yield in the subirrigated fields this impact was further explored by comparing the relative annual yields based on the growing season precipitation fig 7 at defiance the difference in relative yield between the two practices was not significant in wet or dry years due to low conductivity soils as discussed previously at the fulton site crop yield benefited from subirrigation in both dry and wet years with the strongest response in dry years as expected the yield benefits in wet years are likely due to the narrower drain spacing at van wert crop yield benefited from subirrigation in dry years but declined in wet years a supplemental addition of water via subirrigation during periods of frequent rainfall events potentially increases the risks of root zone flooding and crop respiration disruption which can lead to lower crop yield in practice and as always recommended the farmer would be expected to actively manage subirrigation during the growing season by discontinuing the water supply and lowering the control weir in response to large rainfall events allred et al 2003 active management of subirrigation systems during the growing season with regard to rainfall events prevents root zone flooding problems and in fact leads to modest crop yield increases in subirrigated fields during wet growing seasons allred et al 2014 however this was not simulated results show that implementing subirrigation at defiance and van wert during wet years may not benefit maize unless an intermittent or active management of the subirrigation system is conducted 3 5 implication of climate change on the relative yield differences the difference between the relative yield simulated for free drainage and subirrigation was affected by changes in climate conditions fig 6 table 6 at defiance fulton and van wert the difference between the mean relative yield under subirrigation practice and that under free subsurface drainage was 2 10 and 8 larger during the future period as compared to the historic period respectively the increase in relative yield difference is generally due to the expected drop in relative yield under free subsurface drainage whereas relative yield under subirrigation practice will remain unchanged lower non irrigated yields in northeast ohio under future conditions 2041 2060 were also found in a simulation study conducted with dssat decision support system for agro technology transfer by brumbelow and georgakakos 2001 using the epic agroecosystem model izaurralde et al 2003 and brown and rosenberg 1999 found that maize yield will potentially increase along with atmospheric co2 increase in the corn belt under future conditions but assessed that projected water stress and evapotranspiration increase will negatively affect maize yield therefore there is a potential for alleviating the impacts of climate change through the implementation of subirrigation practice that provides enough soil moisture at the appropriate time to compensate for the increased water demands by introducing subirrigation in their management farmers in rainfed areas can lower the threats of occasional droughts and maintain high yields 4 limitations drainmod estimates the relative yield only as a function of the intensity and duration of wet and dry stresses and planting delays predicted for the growing season potential stresses such as diseases and nutrient availability are not simulated while salinity stress which can be simulated by drainmod is unlikely in humid ohio conditions therefore a 100 relative yield indicates the maximum yield that could be obtained during a growing season if there was neither wet nor dry stresses during the growing season and if planting occurred on time in reality other factors may occur during the growing season that affect crop yield drainmod is being modified to address the potential impacts of other factors on crop yield by incorporation of a crop model dssat negm et al 2014a 2014b a climate factor that was not simulated here but that may strongly affect maize growth and yield is atmospheric concentration of co2 which is highly relevant to crop yield under future conditions although this study was instrumental at defining the potential implications of climate change on maize relative yield under subirrigation practice in northern ohio factors such as adaptive agricultural management response to climate change planting date shifts cultivars changes etc were not considered further studies that combine the potential impacts of these factors will provide a more complete picture of the climate change impact on maize relative yield under subirrigation practice in northern ohio 5 conclusion this paper provides the result of a simulation study conducted with drainmod to investigate the effects of subirrigation practice on maize yield under historic 1984 2013 and future 2041 2070 climate conditions the three sites studied here showed a range of responses to subirrigation leading to the following conclusions at sites with low soil hydraulic conductivity defiance subirrigation may have little effect site selection is critical to identify suitable soils with moderate to high lateral hydraulic conductivities crop yield response to subirrigation can be as high as 26 5 at sites that respond well to subirrigation such as fulton future benefits are expected to increase long term average benefits of 26 5 under historic precipitation may increase to 36 under future climate conditions at fulton crop yield increased in both dry and wet years indicating that the soils responded positively to subirrigation and were not unduly harmed by excess water at sites that generally do not require irrigation for high yields van wert crop yield increased in dry years but decreased in wet years demonstrating the importance of actively managing the water control structures to limit excess water effects crop yields under free subsurface drainage are expected to decline under future climate conditions but subirrigation can maintain yields at their historic level on soils that respond well to subirrigation the mean relative yield difference between subirrigation and free drainage will potentially nearly double from 15 to 24 between the historic period and the future period at the three sites reported here drain spacing was narrower in the subirrigated fields resulting in higher drain flow but lower surface runoff during the non growing season larger drain flow can increase the potential for nutrient export however capturing and recycling water and nutrients as was done at these sites can be used to curb the negative environmental impacts of narrower drain spacing overall maize relative yield increases can be expected with subirrigation practice on suitable soils the simulations with future climate projections 2041 2070 indicated that maize relative yield will potentially drop in the future but subirrigation practice may help alleviate the impacts of climate change by holding relative yields at the level observed during the historic period acknowledgements the authors extend their gratitude to the ohio agricultural research and development center

11413,achieving higher productivity in irrigated rice production is becoming ever more important a modified rice cultivation method the system of rice intensification sri recommends keeping rice fields moist but unflooded during the crop s vegetative stage usually with alternate wetting and drying awd then maintaining shallow flooding during the post vegetative stage of crop growth however no evidence is available on how flooding paddy fields continuously vs alternately during the post vegetative stage under sri might influence the crops physiology root growth grain yield and water productivity field experiments were conducted to investigate the impacts of two alternative crop management systems namely sri and conventional management practice cmp under different water management treatments during the vegetative stage continuous flooding cf vs awd and then during post vegetative stage cf vs awd 1 dad days after disappearance of ponded water 3 dad or 5 dad sri practices compared to cmp methods significantly improved plants root growth and xylem exudation rate leaf area index and light interception by the crop canopy plus photosynthesis rate at the grain filling stage resulting in higher grain yield overall this modified method of rice crop management produced 58 higher grain yield with 16 less water across all water management treatments significantly more grain was produced per unit of water applied with sri management 6 3 kg ha mm 1 compared to cmp 3 3 kg grain ha mm 1 the highest grain yield with sri 6 2 t ha 1 and the greatest water productivity 6 7 kg ha

response to modified management practices and alternative irrigation schedules indicated how phenotypic and physiological performances can be improved for a given genotype combining changes in crop and water management can improve water productivity as well as grain yield keywords alternate wetting and drying awd crop management physiology rice oryza sativa l system of rice intensification sri 1 introduction feeding the world s growing population is a major challenge godfray et al 2010 present standard methods for growing rice oryza sativa l a staple food for billions requires large amounts of water by 2035 the world will need to produce 116 million additional tons of rice for its greater population grisp global rice science partnership 2013 and this must be achieved under conditions of greater water scarcity and climate change fao 2012 godfray 2011 the currently prevailing system for growing irrigated rice is to flood paddy fields maintaining standing water throughout the crop s growth cycle and then to drain water from the fields 1 2 weeks before harvesting bouman et al 2007 in flooded rice paddies a large amount of the water supplied is non productive due to large losses through runoff evaporation seepage and percolation grisp 2013 in the future there simply will not be enough water in many areas to sustain this kind of irrigated rice production producing more grain with reduced amounts of water must be done in a sustainable way and without environmental harm yang and zhang 2010 researchers have been developing a number of water saving technologies such as alternate wetting and drying belder et al 2004 bouman and tuong 2001 saturated soil culture tuong et al 2004 direct dry seeding tabbal et al 2002 aerobic rice culture kato et al 2009 and drip sprinkler systems sharda et al 2017 these methods have been found to reduce water use and improve water productivity but their effects on grain yield have remained uncertain bouman et al 2007 and the extent to which these techniques are economically remunerative remains unclear the system of rice intensification sri a modified rice cultivation methodology developed in madagascar has been introduced in many rice producing countries uphoff 2012 sri practices include transplanting younger seedlings with wider spacing than in conventional methods leading to much reduced plant densities by 4 5th to 9 10th less active soil aeration and keeping paddy fields unflooded just moist during the vegetative stage of crop growth stoop et al 2002 this combination of practices has been reported to increase the yields of irrigated rice by 20 50 or more while reducing water requirements by 20 35 jagannath et al 2013 kassam et al 2011 thakur et al 2011 wu and uphoff 2015 originally sri as developed empirically in madagascar recommended applying small amounts of water each day to well leveled fields just enough water to keep the soil moist and meet the plants and soil organisms basic needs le minimum de l eau laulanié 1993 while such careful daily water management contributed to increased grain yields it required considerable additional efforts by farmers therefore many developed their own labor reducing schedules of alternative wetting and drying awd a study of sri water management in madagascar found that farmers who used sri methods varied the length of their alternating wet and dry periods between 1 10 days mchugh et al 2002 moreover these schedules were developed more for farmers convenience than for calculated productivity as initially developed sri recommended maintaining just a thin layer of water 2 3 cm on fields after the crop s panicle initiation stoop et al 2002 however this specification has never been tested systematically while previous research stoop et al 2009 would question its effectiveness under conditions of limited water supplies and hence a need to maximize water productivity as in major parts of india any possible savings in water use become increasingly important most evaluations on the effects of different water management regimes for sri have tested awd irrigation practices or maintaining saturated soil just during the vegetative stage comparing it with conventional flooding the conventional management practices cmp approach chapagain and yamaji 2010 krupnik et al 2012 lin et al 2009 singh 2013 thakur et al 2014 zhao et al 2009 in some cases significant savings in irrigation water have been reported while yield differences remained negligible chapagain and yamaji 2010 krupnik et al 2012 singh 2013 other studies have reported both significant yield increase and water savings under sri management lin et al 2009 thakur et al 2014 zhao et al 2009 stoop et al 2009 have suggested that the responses have often been misinterpreted because of confounding between experimental and non experimental factors for instance between the irrigation regime being evaluated and certain non experimental factors like plant density and or the age of transplanted seedlings there could be considerable savings of irrigation water in the post vegetative stage with some optimization of awd as compared with continuous flooding for sri an irrigation regime providing water at 3 dad days after disappearance of ponded water has been recommended for the vegetative phase followed then by shallow flooding of the field with 2 3 cm water during the post vegetative stage thakur et al 2014 in view of the attractive yields reported for sri in general there is reason to consider whether water use could be further optimized by keeping sri fields just moist or awd instead of being flooded also during the post vegetative stage post vegetative stage of water management deserves systematic investigation because in many countries it is during the latter stages of rice plant growth that the crop encounters greater water scarcity and stress in india this can be due either to lesser rainfall during the rainy season july october or higher temperatures during the winter season october march these stresses have crucial impacts on eventual yield as water scarcity is becoming a major concern in so many countries the question arises whether any further reductions can be made in the amount of water applied during the post vegetative stage under sri management without incurring some grain yield loss making modifications in the water management regime during the post vegetative phase could greatly increase water use efficiency research done thus far on water optimization under sri crop management has not focused on how to reduce water applications after panicle initiation without suffering yield loss and possibly making some gains in yield this investigation was designed to assess the impacts of two alternative crop management systems namely sri and conventional management practice cmp under different water management during first the vegetative stage continuous flooding cf with cmp and 3 dad with sri and then during the post vegetative stage either cf or irrigation at 1 dad 3 dad or 5 dad 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site a field experiment was conducted for two rabi dry seasons january may during the years 2014 and 2015 at the research farm of the icar indian institute of water management mendhasal in khurda district of odisha state india 20 30 n 87 48 102 e the soils at the experimental site have been classified as aeric haplaquepts sandy clay loam 61 sand 17 silt and 22 clay with a ph of 5 9 2 2 experimental design and treatments the design was constructed to evaluate the physiological and morphological effects of different crop and water management practices in irrigated rice production the split plot design had three replications with sub plot sizes of 20 10 m all sub plots were surrounded by bunds 30 cm wide followed by irrigation channels 50 cm wide then again by bunds 30 cm wide to prevent lateral water seepage and nutrient diffusion between plots the two crop production systems were assessed in the main plots the system of rice intensification sri and conventional management practice cmp in the sub plots within each block four different water management treatments were implemented during the post vegetative growth stage cf continuous flooding and water applications either 1 3 or 5 days after disappearance dad of ponded or standing water in the field during the preceding vegetative stage the cmp plots were kept continuously flooded while the sri plots received irrigation water following 3 dad schedule treatment details are described in table 1 2 3 crop management with different cultivation practices the experiment used a medium duration rice cv surendra 130 135 days duration a popular photo insensitive variety grown by farmers in the eastern part of india seeds were germinated in the shade and then broadcasted on nursery beds on january 10 2014 in the first year and january 12 2015 in the second year in the sri plots 12 day old single seedlings at a spacing of 20 20 cm were transplanted within 30 min after removal from the nursery on january 22 2014 and january 24 2015 in the cmp plots 25 day old seedlings three per hill were transplanted at a spacing of 20 10 cm on february 4 2014 and february 6 2015 plant densities for the two crop production systems were thus respectively 25 and 150 plants m 2 for the sri and cmp plots giving the cmp plots six times more plants than sri on an area basis it should be noted that the sri spacing used in this experiment was 20 closer than usually recommended for sri because earlier studies in this location had shown 20 20 cm spacing to be optimum with this particular medium duration variety under the local soil and climatic conditions thakur et al 2010a on the sri plots weeds were removed by using a mechanical weeder at 10 20 and 30 days after transplanting dat while in cmp plots three hand weedings were done at the same dat intervals fertilizer use was standard across all the plots since as noted above nutrient management was not made a factor in this experiment fully decomposed farmyard manure fym was applied 5 t ha 1 along with chemical fertilizers 80 kg n 40 kg p2o5 and 40 kg k2o ha 1 using urea diammonium phosphate and muriate of potash as sources the entire amount of phosphorus was applied at the time of final land preparation while n and k were applied in three splits i e 25 at 10 days after transplanting dat 50 at tillering stage and 25 at panicle initiation pi stage the sri recommendation favors organic over chemical fertilization but we did not make this practice an additional factor in the present trials 2 4 water management treatments a cemented distribution channel was used to supply water to the main plot channel and subsequently to the respective plots the first irrigation for the sri plots was applied at 5 days after transplanting to moisten the field without ponding then at 10 days after transplanting a second irrigation of 5 cm water depth was applied after that water was applied at 3 dad of ponded water during the entire vegetative stage of crop growth up to the panicle initiation pi stage in an earlier study it had been found that highest crop productivity for sri was achieved with irrigation at 3 dad under sri management during the vegetative stage of crop growth thakur et al 2014 in the comparable cmp treatments 5 cm of standing water was maintained throughout the vegetative period from transplanting to the crop s pi stage then after panicle initiation 65 days after sowing das four different water management treatments were implemented during the post vegetative stage continuous flooding cf and irrigation at 1 3 or 5 days after the disappearance dad of standing water in the field all plots were drained 7 days before harvesting 2 5 sampling and measurements we evaluated the effects of the differing treatments on agronomic morphological and physiological parameters that are closely associated with rice plant growth and crop performance root dry weight xylem exudation rate leaf area index lai light interception by canopy lic leaf greenness spad leaf photosynthetic rate grain filling rate yield components and water productivity yoshida 1981 fageria 2007 2 5 1 measurement of root weight density and xylem exudation rate three hills with average number of tillers were selected at the panicle initiation 65 das and grain filling stages 110 das from each replicate plot for root sampling root samples were collected through the monolith method each sampler centered over one transplanted hill the dimensions of the monolith sampler used were 20 20 cm to 45 cm depth for the sri crop and 20 10 cm to 45 cm depth for cmp crops therefore the soil volume excavated to collect root samples under sri was 18 000 cm3 and 9000 cm3 under cmp root samples were washed carefully in a bucket separating entire roots by straining roots were dried in an oven at 70 c for 48 h and root weight was recorded at the constant weight shashidhar et al 2012 root weight density rwd was calculated by dividing the root dry weight by the soil volume and expressed as mg cm 3 the amount of xylem exudates transferred upward from roots to shoots and the rate of exudation is a reflection of plant size as well as of the level of physiological activity of roots amounts of xylem exudates were measured at both the pi and grain filling stages from three hills having an average number of tillers in each plot using the methodology described in san oh et al 2004 all the tillers of a hill were cut at 10 cm above the soil surface and pre weighed cotton wool along with a polythene bag was wrapped to the cut end of each tiller and secured with tape after 24 h the polythene bag with cotton wool was detached and weighed the amount weight of xylem exudate was calculated by subtracting the weight of the bag with cotton wool initial from the weight of the bag with cotton wool after 24 h exudation rate was calculated by dividing xylem exudation amount by the time period 2 5 2 measurement of leaf area index and light interception by the canopy leaf area of five hills from each plot was measured during the grain filling stage 110 das using a leaf area meter model licor 3100 area meter usa leaf area index was then calculated by dividing the leaf area by the land area light interception by the canopy was measured with a line quantum sensor 400 700 nm model li 1400 li cor usa on a bright sunny day between 11 30 a m to 12 00 noon at the same stage by

greenness or leaf chlorophyll content uddling et al 2007 and the photosynthesis rates of leaves were measured during the grain filling stage 110 das in 10 flag leaves and 10 fourth leaves of plants in every replicated plot by using a chlorophyll meter model spad 502 plus konica minolta sensing japan and a portable photosynthesis system model ciras 2 pp systems u k respectively 2 5 4 measurement of grain filling rate of main panicle in each plot 30 main tillers excluding border rows were tagged as panicles emerged from the flag leaf sheaths panicles were removed from the base point of three randomly selected main tillers at 7 d intervals after flowering until maturity to monitor post flowering changes in main panicle weight panicle dry weight was measured after drying in a forced air drier at 80 c for 48 h at each date of harvest between flowering and physiological maturity beyond flowering there was no further significant increase in chaff weight i e rachis and glumes without grain the final grain yield per panicle was calculated as the difference between panicle dry weight at maturity and at flowering grain filling rate was calculated by subtracting the dry weight of main panicles at flowering from dry weight of main panicles at maturity divided by the number of days in between ehdaie et al 2008 2 5 5 measurements of yield and yield components in each plot an area 3 3 m excluding border rows was harvested to determine yield per unit area with harvested paddy grain yield adjusted to 14 5 grain moisture content before harvesting the average numbers of panicles was determined from a representative square meter area from each plot the number of grains per panicle and the number of filled grains were counted for each panicle individually harvested from a square meter area ripening percentage of grains was calculated by dividing the number of filled grains by the total number of grains 2 5 6 measurement of water applied and water productivity to measure the amount of water applied to plots during each irrigation trapezoidal rbc flumes 13 17 02 rbc eijkelkamp agrisearch equipment the netherlands were installed in the cemented channel and water flow was measured the amount of water applied during each irrigation was calculated using water flow rate and the duration of water application the total quantity of water applied throughout the cropping season was summed and water productivity was calculated by a standard methodology reported in detail elsewhere thakur et al 2014 rainfall during the experimental periods of 2014 and 2015 was 207 0 and 197 6 mm respectively a variance of only 5 water productivity was estimated as grain yield divided by total water used rainfall irrigation and expressed as kg ha mm 1 2 6 statistical analysis experimental data obtained for different parameters were analyzed statistically using the analysis of variance anova technique as applicable to split plot design gomez and gomez 1984 duncan s multiple range test dmrt was employed to assess differences between the treatment means at a 5 probability level all statistical analyses were performed using sas 9 2 for windows sas institute inc cary nc usa all the data were statistically analyzed considering year as a source of variation in addition to cultivation system cs and water management w treatments the main effects of year y and the interaction effects between year and cs y cs year and water management y w and three factor interaction y cs w were all non significant at p 0 05 for all parameters considered in the present study this with the year effect being non significant accordingly the data reported in this paper are averages from the two years of trials 3 results 3 1 effects on grain yield water requirements and water productivity cultivation systems and post vegetative phase water management treatments were both found to have significant impacts on grain yield water use and water productivity for cmp grain yield was the highest with the 1 dad treatment 4 06 t ha 1 while the yield under sri methods was highest with 3 dad irrigation intervals 6 21 t ha 1 across the various water management treatments evaluated sri methods gave 58 higher average yield than cmp practices total water use with cmp was 1128 mm while water use with sri management during the whole crop cycle was 939 mm table 2 with sri compared to cmp there was thus a saving of 189 mm water 16 this water saving was mainly due to differences in the vegetative stage treatments i e 3 dad under sri management vs continuous flooding under cmp the range of water saving estimated under post vegetative stage treatments of 5 dad vs cf under the two cultivation systems was 63 100 mm if a comparison is made between conventional flooded rice and sri having a 3 dad irrigation schedule the best for sri a significant amount of water was saved i e 250 mm 20 across all water management treatments water productivity was significantly higher under sri management 6 3 kg ha mm 1 as compared to cmp 3 3 kg ha mm 1 sri grown rice plants were thus almost twice as efficient in utilizing water for the production of grain under cmp the highest water productivity was obtained with 1 dad treatment 3 5 kg ha mm 1 while under sri the greatest water productivity was achieved with 3 dad treatment 6 7 kg ha mm 1 almost double 3 2 effects on grain yield components grain yield performance is determined by different yield components like number of panicles m 2 total number of grains panicle 1 grain filling and 1000 grain weight in the present experiment all varied significantly p 0 05 in response to the method of rice cultivation table 3 cultivation system significantly affected the number of panicles per hill as well as on an area basis with sri management the number of panicles per hill was more than double that for rice grown under cmp however on a unit area basis panicle numbers were only 9 higher in sri plots than in cmp plots mainly due to the greater number of hills and of plants in the latter post vegetative stage water management treatments had no significant effect on the number of panicles either per hill or per unit area except for panicle number the other yield components number of grains panicle grain filling and 1000 grain weight varied significantly in response to the water management practices imposed after panicle initiation table 3 under cmp the 3 fold increase in the number of plants per hill and a 6 fold increase in the overall number of plants on a unit surface area basis was associated with a highly significant decrease in grain yield under sri management grains per panicle and grain filling were significantly higher with the 3 dad treatment than with the other water management treatments under cmp cultivation the highest values were recorded with cf and 1 dad irrigation grain filling under sri was significantly greater with the 3 dad treatment while it was higher with the 1 dad treatment under cmp with the increasing moisture stress of 5 dad irrigation both grain filling and grain weight were seen to be reduced with both cultivation systems 3 3 effects on root growth root weight density and xylem exudation rate crops grown with sri practices and 3 dad alternate wetting and drying during the vegetative stage had significantly greater weight of roots at the pi stage both per hill and per unit area table 4 this occurred even though sri plots had only one plant per hill while cmp plots had three plants per hill and twice as many hills on average sri plants had nearly 2 5 times more roots hills 1 at the pi stage than did the cmp hills 1 and on a unit area basis the sri plant roots were 34 more this reflects among other things the effects of reduced interplant competition due to fewer plants under sri no significant effects of the different post vegetative water management treatments on roots dry weight were recorded following the pi stage when the four different water treatments were superimposed when root growth was measured at the grain filling stage after imposing the different post vegetative water management treatments there were observable and significant effects of the water management treatments on roots growth with sri methods the highest root dry weight was observed with the 3 dad treatment both per hill and on an area basis under cmp management there were no significant differences found in plant roots dry weight between continuous flooding and 1 dad treatments while there was a decline in roots dry weight with both the 3 dad and 5 dad treatments table 4 a similar trend was found with root weight density which was found to be significantly higher under sri than cmp at both the pi and grain filling stages also post vegetative stage water management significantly affected rwd and was maximum in the 3 dad treatment of sri the xylem exudate data presented in table 5 show the amounts of exudates that moved upward towards the shoot during a 24 h period of time the flow when measured on a per hill basis was significantly higher even more than double in sri plants compared to the plants under conventional flooding method on an area basis also the xylem flow was greater under sri by 16 than in crops being grown under cmp table 5 at the grain filling stage the amount of xylem exudation in sri grown plants was 1 5 times more than in cmp plants on a per hill basis and 25 greater on an area basis the different post vegetative water management treatments had a significant effect on exudate amounts greatest for sri with 3 dad treatment followed by cmp with 1 dad and sri with 1 dad treatments on a per hill basis xylem exudation rate was nearly 3 times faster under sri than cmp at both stages of measurements across all water management treatments overall on an area basis the xylem exudation rate under sri was calculated to be 25 faster than for crops under cmp 6 4 g m 2 h 1 vs 5 1 g m 2 h 1 during the grain filling stage 3 4 effects on leaf area index and light interception by crop canopy leaf area index lai and light interception by canopy lic when measured at the grain filling stage showed sri crops to have significantly greater values across all of the treatments similar to other parameters measured under sri cultivation the highest lai and lic were found with the 3 dad water management treatment while under cmp these values were highest with the 1 dad treatment fig 1 the lower levels of leaf area and light interception under the water constrained conditions of the 5 dad treatment were mainly attributable to greater senescence and dying off of the lower leaves under both cultivation practices which caused a decrease in root development as reflected in the data in table 4 3 5 effects on spad values and leaf photosynthesis rate overall the leaves of the sri plants had significantly higher spad values than did those of cmp plants indicating that sri leaves were greener compared to cmp leaves fig 2 across all the water management treatments the flag leaf and the fourth leaf of sri plants compared to those of cmp plants had higher spad values by 22 and 34 respectively the spad values in both the flag and fourth leaves were found to be the highest with 3 dad under sri and with 1 dad treatments under cmp the latter were always significantly lower than for the sri treatment reflecting differences in the sri and cmp phenotypes resulting from treatment effects during the grain filling stage cultivation methods were found to have a significant effect on photosynthesis rates in both flag leaves and fourth leaves fig 3 overall the flag leaves of sri plants had a photosynthesis rate 22 higher and the fourth leaves had a 19 higher rate compared to the flag and fourth leaves of cmp rice plants also the different water management treatments during the post vegetative stage had significant impacts on the photosynthesis rates in the flag and fourth leaves during the grain filling stage under both cultivation systems an important difference in sri plants both flag and fourth leaves had significantly higher photosynthesis rates under the 3 dad treatment compared to others while with cmp methods plants under the 1 dad treatment had a higher photosynthesis rate than with the other irrigation treatments these trends in leaf photosynthesis rate were consistent with the spad values measured for the different treatments with both cultivation systems the lowest rate of photosynthesis was found in rice plants grown under the 5 dad treatment which was the treatment with the most water stress this rate remained significantly higher in sri treatments than for cmp which again may be explained by the improved root development and activity tables 4 and 5 3 6 effects on main stem panicle weight and grain filling rate gfr there were significant differences between the two crop management systems and the four water management treatments with regard to main panicle dry weight fig 4 and their grain filling rate fig 5 overall at the time of flowering anthesis the dry weight of the main panicle that includes empty grains chaff was 746 mg under cmp and 929 mg under sri so the latter was 25 heavier during the initial 7 days after anthesis daa the panicle weight increased at a high rate in all of the treatments fig 4 shows two pairs of curves distinctly different for sri and cmp in panicles grown in cmp plots the weight of grain increased up to 21 daa but after this there were no significant increases the slopes of the sri curves show grain filling continuing at a higher rate and for a longer period than for cmp rice plants under sri practice in contrast to cmp the increase in grain weight continued up to 28 or 35 daa in most of the treatments except in those with 5 dad irrigation in sri plots with 5 dad irrigation which initially showed the most rapid growth of panicle weight the curve s leveling off after 21 daa may be due to unsupportive root functioning and a lower rate of leaf photosynthesis at the time of harvest the average main panicle dry weight was 50 more under sri management than with cmp i e 4599 mg vs 3056 mg among the different water management treatments the highest main panicle dry weight with cmp was achieved with 1 dad water management 3240 mg and with sri at 3 dad scheduling 4921 mg similarly the weight of grain yield per main panicle under cmp was 2310 mg compared with 3670 mg under sri across all water management treatments sri plants had a gfr of 104 8 mg day 1 panicle 1 for the main panicle 59 higher than the gfr for cmp plants which was 66 0 mg day 1 panicle 1 water management during the post vegetative stage thus had a significant effect on the grain filling rate of the main panicle fig 5 under sri management the highest gfr was found with the 3 dad treatment while the highest gfr under cmp methods was achieved with the 1 dad treatment this was consistent with the many preceding measurements reported 4 discussion much of the burden for promoting rice production in the future will rest on developing better integrated soil crop management systems chen et al 2011 and promoting water saving irrigation the system of rice intensification is a method of rice cultivation that can be part of such a strategy fao 2016 through research and extension over the past decade it has been extensively documented that sri ideas and methods can improve productivity by using less external inputs and by reducing the consumption of water jagannath et al 2013 lin et al 2009 satyanarayana et al 2007 sinha and talati 2007 thakur et al 2011 2014 uphoff 2012 the purpose of this investigation was to evaluate whether further water savings might be possible within the sri management framework particularly during the post vegetative stage and whether observed yield and water productivity improvements could be explained through demonstrable impacts on crop growth and physiology in the present trials sri produced 58 higher grain yield compared with cmp table 2 many earlier studies have also shown sri methods giving 20 50 higher yield and even more jagannath et al 2013 satyanarayana et al 2007 sinha and talati 2007 thakur et al 2011 obviously the percentage increase will vary depending on the cultivation systems with which it is compared the latter varying greatly between regions and farmers however increases of more than 20 over already high levels have been reported on a large scale in china wu and uphoff 2015 zheng et al 2013 these yield increases are achieved while water consumption is greatly reduced particularly important in a water scarce country like iraq hameed et al 2013 the present study recorded similar results that can be explained by the morphological and physiological changes associated with changes in plant phenotypes under sri practices the changes in water management practices during the post vegetative stage had a significant impact on grain filling rate and hence on panicle dry weight moisture reduction beyond a certain point during the post vegetative stage was seen to set in on all plants however cultivated but this was evident earlier with cmp grown plants whose root systems were less well developed and less functional rice plants grown with cmp methods having less root growth evidently started experiencing moisture stress beyond 1 dad irrigation while for sri plants this constraint set in beyond 3 dad irrigation this effect correlated with measurements on declining root growth and root activity decreasing green leaf area lowered photosynthesis rate and enhanced senescence these morpho physiological changes led to a lowering of dry weight of the main panicle to a slowing down of the grain filling rate and ultimately to less grain yield it is interesting to note that even at 5 dad the sri plots still yielded significantly more than from any of the cmp treatments table 2 this indicates a greater resilience of sri plants to withstand moisture stress these results may have relevance also to the widespread rainfed rice systems which experience water stress mostly during their post vegetative stage of crop growth and which will have more resilience if they grow larger root systems the significantly larger root systems that had been developed during the vegetative phase up to the pi stage resulted from the preceding practices that are introduced under sri these include transplanting young single seedlings at wider spacing enhancing soil fertility with organic amendments regular mechanical weeding and alternate wetting and drying irrigation during the vegetative growth stage rather than continuous flooding a major factor will have been the greatly reduced plant density that has been responsible for a relatively unrestricted and remarkable root development table 4 but aerobic soil conditions and active soil aeration that promote the growth and functioning of beneficial soil organisms including possibly as symbiotic endophytes uphoff et al 2013 could be playing a role in this better crop performance a hypothesis that warrants more investigation under conventional cultivation in contrast older seedlings are transplanted 3 or 4 together in more closely spaced hills with the field kept flooded throughout the vegetative stage these practices result in poor root growth under cmp both on a per hill basis and on an area basis which accelerates the degeneration of rice root systems kar et al 1974 with obviously adverse effects on root activity yang et al 2004 this is reflected in reduced exudation rates and quantities table 5 under sri management greater root growth and activity of individual plants and of the crop as a whole become much more efficient in using the natural resources as well as in plants uptake of mineral fertilizer thakur et al 2013 sri practices presumably establish a more favourable root soil interface in terms of soil microbiology and aeration however there is not much research on this or on how alternate wetting and drying irrigation facilitates better root growth under sri compared to cmp in terms of grain yield different researchers comparing awd with cf have reported some contradictory results for example yao et al 2012 found no difference in yield between awd and continuously flooded rice however awd in their evaluation saved 24 38 irrigation water and had higher water productivity than continuously flooded rice recently carrijo et al 2017 found no significant yield reductions under mild awd with 23 4 water saving but a 22 6 yield penalty under severe awd compared with continuous flooding in rice these comparisons were made however without taking into account the probably confounding effects of plant density and moisture stress factors stoop et al 2009 and without considering the impact of greater root growth as results under sri due to its management modifications wang et al 2016 and yang et al 2017 have reported without reference to or use of sri methods that alternate wetting and moderate drying is better for rice crop growth than either continuous flooding or alternate wetting and severe drying in terms of higher grain yield and greater water use efficiency wue in rice according to yang et al 2017 moderate awd enhances grain yield and wue mainly due to improved vegetative growth root growth canopy structure and enhanced carbon remobilization from vegetative tissues to grain also elevated phyto hormonal levels particularly increase in abscisic acid aba levels during soil drying and then cytokinin levels during re watering transplanting young seedlings under sri methods influences their quick establishment in the main field by avoiding trauma to their roots and canopies during their uprooting from the nursery this helps the seedlings to resume their growth quickly and grow greater root mass pasuquin et al 2008 also transplanting single seedlings with wider spacing minimizes competition for nutrients water solar energy and other requirements such practices create more favourable environments for plant growth the significance of the expanded root systems was illustrated in our trial by the increase in xylem exudates transported from the roots upward towards the shoots during the grain filling stage these were significantly more under sri than under cmp the greater root growth and activity in addition to better extraction of water and nutrients also improves the transport of cytokinins towards the shoot san oh et al 2004 2006 it is well known that cytokinins delay leaf senescence and maintain the greenness of leaves as was recorded in both the flag leaf and the fourth lower leaf of sri plants in this study fig 2 also cytokinins are associated with increased chlorophyll content in the leaves thakur et al 2010b 2011 maintenance of a higher leaf chlorophyll level results in higher rates of photosynthesis during grain filling fig 3 the incipient grains received a greater supply of carbohydrates from photosynthesis while also more of these were sent to the roots for the maintenance of their activity metabolism hence an expanded and active root system as developed under awd methods of irrigation with moderate drying of the soil significantly affects a crop s above ground physiology and performance zhang et al 2009 for example have reported similar effects of a moderate wetting and drying regime when compared with continuous flooding they also showed the significant effects of water management on root oxidation activity cytokinin concentrations in the roots and shoots leaf photosynthetic rate and the activities of key enzymes involved in sucrose to starch conversion in grains a resultant effect of root growth and physiology on crop grain yield was an increase of 11 with awd practices and in water use efficiency of 55 zhang et al 2009 similarly other researchers also found that post anthesis alternate wetting and moderate soil drying elevates cytokinin levels in the rice shoot at the same time improving sink strength grain filling rate and grain weight of inferior spikelets zhang et al 2010 2012 all this ultimately resulted in higher grain yield the amount of light intercepted by the canopy is positively correlated with the leaf area of the crop and this relates directly to plant growth san oh et al 2004 in this present study rice plants grown with sri methods had significantly greater leaf area as well as more light interception by the canopy compared with the cmp crop during the grain filling stage this was achieved in spite of the six fold reduction in plant density m 2 in the sri treatments the higher leaf area with sri management was mainly due to delayed senescence of the lower leaves and to greater leaf size which resulted in increased light interception thakur et al 2011 the sri grown plants also had a more open canopy with more erect leaves a structure that facilitated higher light interception and minimized shading of the lower leaves of the crop thakur et al 2016 all these effects are associated with the drastic reduction in the number of plants per unit area which allows the rice plants to function physiologically more efficiently than under conventional management during the vegetative growth phase and subsequent panicle initiation the plant s potential yielding capacity is determined the post vegetative phase that follows determines the extent to which this potential gets realized unconstrained grain filling is the decisive process which correlates with the crop s yield performance many researchers have explored the relationship between photosynthesis and related parameters in the leaves i e source factors vis à vis the grain filling process sink factors which determines ultimate grain yield we have observed that under sri management higher leaf chlorophyll content and a faster rate of photosynthesis led to more rapid grain filling by about 59 fig 5 this relationship also confirmed that leaf photosynthetic rates are positively related with chlorophyll meter values park and lee 2003a the stay green characteristics of sri plants during grain filling reflected in their spad values contributed to higher grain yield delayed senescence of both upper and lower leaves as analyzed by park and lee 2003b is associated with the higher grain yield observed under sri management figs 2 and 3 enhanced photosynthetic rate in the lower leaves also provides an increased supply of carbohydrates to the roots thereby enhancing their metabolism and prolonging their longevity improved shoot characteristics and functioning due to the receipt of more nutrients water and plant hormones then translates into an overall increase in biomass production and in plants grain filling processes samejima et al 2004 zhang et al 2009 a similar result has been reported by chen et al 2013 on increases in biomass accumulation before the heading stage and the subsequent improved utilization of photosynthates during the grain filling stage the underlying reasons might be due to some reorientation in the translocation process in plants earlier yang et al 2003 demonstrated that a properly controlled water deficit during grain filling could enhance the remobilization of pre stored carbon in the stems which greatly increased the plant s grain filling rate in our study a controlled but not excessive water deficit had no yield constraining effect up to 1 dad irrigation for the cmp plants nor up to 3 dad irrigation for the sri crop however remobilization of carbohydrate reserves stored in the leaf sheath and stem for grain filling under sri management has not been studied specifically this is an important area of research for making crops more heat or drought resistant through modifications in irrigation and other crop management practices apart from the rate of grain filling variations in the duration of grain filling are also an important factor that can account at least in part for differences in grain yield extension of the grain filling period can provide rice plants with more access to ambient resources for prolonged grain growth in this way achieving higher yield yang et al 2008 although it is clear that sri practices have an effect on the grain filling rate see fig 4 it would be good to know more about how the duration of grain filling is affected by crop or water management practices yield components such as the number of panicles and the number of grains per panicle are determined mostly by growth processes that begin before anthesis in our study when alternative water management practices were introduced during the post vegetative stage there were no significant differences detected in the numbers of panicles per plant and grains per panicle however our trials showed a consistent pattern of better crop performance and higher grain yield from sri compared with cmp crop management and best cmp performance was consistently with irrigation provided at 1 dad in the post vegetative phase rather that maintaining continuous flooding and for sri the best scheduling was with 3 dad during both the post vegetative and vegetative phases 5 conclusions enhancing water productivity in rice production will continue to be a matter of great concern to researchers farmers and policy makers in order to produce more grain with less water more crop per drop in the present study we demonstrated that sri practices induce rather different phenotypic responses in rice plants both morphologically and physiologically one of the most important findings was that water productivity could be enhanced by about 90 when using the suite of practices that constitute sri in our trials these methods reached a productivity of 6 3 kg ha mm 1 compared to 3 3 kg ha mm 1 with cmp under sri management with 16 less irrigation water there was on average a 58 enhancement of grain yield alternate wetting and drying together with sri management practices had significant and multiple beneficial effects on grain yield as well as on water saving and water productivity sri crops were able to achieve greater grain yield even with reduced applications of water due to their more vigorous root growth greater root activity delayed leaf senescence and higher photosynthetic rate and greater rate of grain filling compared with cmp rice crops these results were obtained in spite of the drastic six fold reduction in the number of plants m 2 under sri practice under such management the best results in terms of yield water saving and productivity from sandy clay loam soil with a medium duration variety were obtained by maintaining a 3 dad irrigation regime throughout the entire cropping season instead of flooding the rice field continuously including during the post vegetative stage based on our results the current sri recommendation for maintaining a shallow layer of water on the field after panicle initiation could well be revised this would further increase sri s water saving without any yield penalty indeed with an enhancement of yield further studies are required regarding the effect of sri on the remobilization of carbohydrate reserves stored in leaf sheaths and stems during grain filling especially during terminal heat or water stress the impact of crop management practices on grain filling duration under sri management should also be researched studies on sri s yield and water productivity performance using other water saving irrigation methods like drip or sprinkler systems should also be investigated possibly together with sri management both of these methods and new irrigation technology could be made more productive in terms of their use of land labor and especially water

11413,achieving higher productivity in irrigated rice production is becoming ever more important a modified rice cultivation method the system of rice intensification sri recommends keeping rice fields moist but unflooded during the crop s vegetative stage usually with alternate wetting and drying awd then maintaining shallow flooding during the post vegetative stage of crop growth however no evidence is available on how flooding paddy fields continuously vs alternately during the post vegetative stage under sri might influence the crops physiology root growth grain yield and water productivity field experiments were conducted to investigate the impacts of two alternative crop management systems namely sri and conventional management practice cmp under different water management treatments during the vegetative stage continuous flooding cf vs awd and then during post vegetative stage cf vs awd 1 dad days after disappearance of ponded water 3 dad or 5 dad sri practices compared to cmp methods significantly improved plants root growth and xylem exudation rate leaf area index and light interception by the crop canopy plus photosynthesis rate at the grain filling stage resulting in higher grain yield overall this modified method of rice crop management produced 58 higher grain yield with 16 less water across all water management treatments significantly more grain was produced per unit of water applied with sri management 6 3 kg ha mm 1 compared to cmp 3 3 kg grain ha mm 1 the highest grain yield with sri 6 2 t ha 1 and the greatest water productivity 6 7 kg ha

response to modified management practices and alternative irrigation schedules indicated how phenotypic and physiological performances can be improved for a given genotype combining changes in crop

introduction feeding the world s growing population is a major challenge godfray et al 2010 present standard methods for growing rice oryza sativa l a staple food for billions requires large amounts of water by 2035 the world will need to produce 116 million additional tons of rice for its greater population grisp global rice science partnership 2013 and this must be achieved under conditions of greater water scarcity and climate change fao 2012 godfray 2011 the currently prevailing system for growing irrigated rice is to flood paddy fields maintaining standing water throughout the crop s growth cycle and then to drain water from the fields 1 2 weeks before harvesting bouman et al 2007 in flooded rice paddies a large amount of the water supplied is non productive due to large losses through runoff evaporation seepage and percolation grisp 2013 in the future there simply will not be enough water in many areas to sustain this kind of irrigated rice production producing more grain with reduced amounts of water must be done in a sustainable way and without environmental harm yang and zhang 2010 researchers have been developing a number of water saving technologies such as alternate wetting and drying belder et al 2004 bouman and tuong 2001 saturated soil culture tuong et al 2004 direct dry seeding tabbal et al 2002 aerobic rice culture kato et al 2009 and drip sprinkler systems sharda et al 2017 these methods have been found to reduce water use and improve water productivity but their effects on grain yield have remained uncertain bouman et al 2007 and the extent to which these techniques are economically remunerative remains unclear the system of rice intensification sri a modified rice cultivation methodology developed in madagascar has been introduced in many rice producing countries uphoff 2012 sri practices include transplanting younger seedlings with wider spacing than in conventional methods leading to much reduced plant densities by 4 5th to 9 10th less active soil aeration and keeping paddy fields unflooded just moist during the vegetative stage of crop growth stoop et al 2002 this combination of practices has been reported to increase the yields of irrigated rice by 20 50 or more while reducing water requirements by 20 35 jagannath et al 2013 kassam et al 2011 thakur et al 2011 wu and uphoff 2015 originally sri as developed empirically in madagascar recommended applying small amounts of water each day to well leveled fields just enough water to keep the soil moist and meet the plants and soil organisms basic needs le minimum de l eau laulanié 1993 while such careful daily water management contributed to increased grain yields it required considerable additional efforts by farmers therefore many developed their own labor reducing schedules of alternative wetting and drying awd a study of sri water management in madagascar found that farmers who used sri methods varied the length of their alternating wet and dry periods between 1 10 days mchugh et al 2002 moreover these schedules were developed more for farmers convenience than for calculated productivity as initially developed sri recommended maintaining just a thin layer of water 2 3 cm on fields after the crop s panicle initiation stoop et al 2002 however this specification has never been tested systematically while previous research stoop et al 2009 would question its effectiveness under conditions of limited water supplies and hence a need to maximize water productivity as in major parts of india any possible savings in water use become increasingly important most evaluations on the effects of different water management regimes for sri have tested awd irrigation practices or maintaining saturated soil just during the vegetative stage comparing it with conventional flooding the conventional management practices cmp approach chapagain and yamaji 2010 krupnik et al 2012 lin et al 2009 singh 2013 thakur et al 2014 zhao et al 2009 in some cases significant savings in irrigation water have been reported while yield differences remained negligible chapagain and yamaji 2010 krupnik et al 2012 singh 2013 other studies have reported both significant yield increase and water savings under sri management lin et al 2009 thakur et al 2014 zhao et al 2009 stoop et al 2009 have suggested that the responses have often been misinterpreted because of confounding between experimental and non experimental factors for instance between the irrigation regime being evaluated and certain non experimental factors like plant density and or the age of transplanted seedlings there could be considerable savings of irrigation water in the post vegetative stage with some optimization of awd as compared with continuous flooding for sri an irrigation regime providing water at 3 dad days after disappearance of ponded water has been recommended for the vegetative phase followed then by shallow flooding of the field with 2 3 cm water during the post vegetative stage thakur et al 2014 in view of the attractive yields reported for sri in general there is reason to consider whether water use could be further optimized by keeping sri fields just moist or awd instead of being flooded also during the post vegetative stage post vegetative stage of water management deserves systematic investigation because in many countries it is during the latter stages of rice plant growth that the crop encounters greater water scarcity and stress in india this can be due either to lesser rainfall during the rainy season july october or higher temperatures during the winter season october march these stresses have crucial impacts on eventual yield as water scarcity is becoming a major concern in so many countries the question arises whether any further reductions can be made in the amount of water applied during the post vegetative stage under sri management without incurring some grain yield loss making modifications in the water management regime during the post vegetative phase could greatly increase water use efficiency research done thus far on water optimization under sri crop management has not focused on how to reduce water applications after panicle initiation without suffering yield loss and possibly making some gains in yield this investigation was designed to assess the impacts of two alternative crop management systems namely sri and conventional management practice cmp under different water management during first the vegetative stage continuous flooding cf with cmp and 3 dad with sri and then during the post vegetative stage either cf or irrigation at 1 dad 3 dad or 5 dad 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site a field experiment was conducted for two rabi dry seasons january may during the years 2014 and 2015 at the research farm of the icar indian institute of water management mendhasal in khurda district of odisha state india 20 30 n 87 48 102 e the soils at the experimental site have been classified as aeric haplaquepts sandy clay loam 61 sand 17 silt and 22 clay with a ph of 5 9 2 2 experimental design and treatments the design was constructed to evaluate the physiological and morphological effects of different crop and water management practices in irrigated rice production the split plot design had three replications with sub plot sizes of 20 10 m all sub plots were surrounded by bunds 30 cm wide followed by irrigation channels 50 cm wide then again by bunds 30 cm wide to prevent lateral water seepage and nutrient diffusion between plots the two crop production systems were assessed in the main plots the system of rice intensification sri and conventional management practice cmp in the sub plots within each block four different water management treatments were implemented during the post vegetative growth stage cf continuous flooding and water applications either 1 3 or 5 days after disappearance dad of ponded or standing water in the field during the preceding vegetative stage the cmp plots were kept continuously flooded while the sri plots received irrigation water following 3 dad schedule treatment details are described in table 1 2 3 crop management with different cultivation practices the experiment used a medium duration rice cv surendra 130 135 days duration a popular photo insensitive variety grown by farmers in the eastern part of india seeds were germinated in the shade and then broadcasted on nursery beds on january 10 2014 in the first year and january 12 2015 in the second year in the sri plots 12 day old single seedlings at a spacing of 20 20 cm were transplanted within 30 min after removal from the nursery on january 22 2014 and january 24 2015 in the cmp plots 25 day old seedlings three per hill were transplanted at a spacing of 20 10 cm on february 4 2014 and february 6 2015 plant densities for the two crop production systems were thus respectively 25 and 150 plants m 2 for the sri and cmp plots giving the cmp plots six times more plants than sri on an area basis it should be noted that the sri spacing used in this experiment was 20 closer than usually recommended for sri because earlier studies in this location had shown 20 20 cm spacing to be optimum with this particular medium duration variety under the local soil and climatic conditions thakur et al 2010a on the sri plots weeds were removed by using a mechanical weeder at 10 20 and 30 days after transplanting dat while in cmp plots three hand weedings were done at the same dat intervals fertilizer use was standard across all the plots since as noted above nutrient management was not made a factor in this experiment fully decomposed farmyard manure fym was applied 5 t ha 1 along with chemical fertilizers 80 kg n 40 kg p2o5 and 40 kg k2o ha 1 using urea diammonium phosphate and muriate of potash as sources the entire amount of phosphorus was applied at the time of final land preparation while n and k were applied in three splits i e 25 at 10 days after transplanting dat 50 at tillering stage and 25 at panicle initiation pi stage the sri recommendation favors organic over chemical fertilization but we did not make this practice an additional factor in the present trials 2 4 water management treatments a cemented distribution channel was used to supply water to the main plot channel and subsequently to the respective plots the first irrigation for the sri plots was applied at 5 days after transplanting to moisten the field without ponding then at 10 days after transplanting a second irrigation of 5 cm water depth was applied after that water was applied at 3 dad of ponded water during the entire vegetative stage of crop growth up to the panicle initiation pi stage in an earlier study it had been found that highest crop productivity for sri was achieved with irrigation at 3 dad under sri management during the vegetative stage of crop growth thakur et al 2014 in the comparable cmp treatments 5 cm of standing water was maintained throughout the vegetative period from transplanting to the crop s pi stage then after panicle initiation 65 days after sowing das four different water management treatments were implemented during the post vegetative stage continuous flooding cf and irrigation at 1 3 or 5 days after the disappearance dad of standing water in the field all plots were drained 7 days before harvesting 2 5 sampling and measurements we evaluated the effects of the differing treatments on agronomic morphological and physiological

number of tillers were selected at the panicle initiation 65 das and grain filling stages 110 das from each replicate plot for root sampling root samples were collected through the monolith method each sampler centered over one transplanted hill the dimensions of the monolith sampler used were 20 20 cm to 45 cm depth for the sri crop and 20 10 cm to 45 cm depth for cmp crops therefore the soil volume excavated to collect root samples under sri was 18 000 cm3 and 9000 cm3 under cmp root samples were washed carefully in a bucket separating entire roots by straining roots were dried in an oven at 70 c for 48 h and root weight was recorded at the constant weight shashidhar et al 2012 root weight density rwd was calculated by dividing the root dry weight by the soil volume and expressed as mg cm 3 the amount of xylem exudates transferred upward from roots to shoots and the rate of exudation is a reflection of plant size as well as of the level of physiological activity of roots amounts of xylem exudates were measured at both the pi and grain filling stages from three hills having an average number of tillers in each plot using the methodology described in san oh et al 2004 all the tillers of a hill were cut at 10 cm above the soil surface and pre weighed cotton wool along with a polythene bag was wrapped to the cut end of each tiller and secured with tape after 24 h the polythene bag with cotton wool was detached and weighed the amount weight of xylem exudate was calculated by subtracting the weight of the bag with cotton wool initial from the weight of the bag with cotton wool after 24 h exudation rate was calculated by dividing xylem exudation amount by the time period 2 5 2 measurement of leaf area index and light interception by the canopy leaf area of five

grain filling rate of main panicle in each plot 30 main tillers excluding border rows were tagged as panicles emerged from the flag leaf sheaths panicles were removed from the base point of three randomly selected main tillers at 7 d intervals after flowering until maturity to monitor post flowering changes in main panicle weight panicle dry weight was measured after drying in a forced air drier at 80 c for 48 h at each date of harvest between flowering and physiological maturity beyond flowering there was no further significant increase in chaff weight i e rachis and glumes without grain the final grain yield per panicle was calculated as the difference between panicle dry weight at maturity and at flowering grain filling rate was calculated by subtracting the dry weight of main panicles at flowering from dry weight of main panicles at maturity divided by the number of days in between ehdaie et al 2008 2 5 5 measurements of yield and yield components in each plot an area 3 3 m excluding border rows was harvested to determine yield per unit area with harvested paddy grain yield adjusted to 14 5 grain moisture content before harvesting the average numbers of panicles was determined from a representative square meter area from each plot the number of grains per panicle and the number of filled grains were counted for each panicle individually harvested from a square meter area ripening percentage of grains was calculated by dividing the number of filled grains by the total number of grains 2 5 6 measurement of water applied and water productivity to measure the amount of water applied to plots during each irrigation trapezoidal rbc flumes 13 17 02 rbc eijkelkamp agrisearch equipment the netherlands were installed in the cemented channel and water flow was measured the amount of water applied during each irrigation was calculated using water flow rate and the duration of water application the total quantity of water applied throughout the cropping season was summed and water productivity was calculated by a standard methodology reported in detail elsewhere thakur et al 2014 rainfall during the experimental periods of 2014 and 2015 was 207 0 and 197 6 mm respectively a variance of only 5 water productivity was estimated as grain yield divided by total water used rainfall irrigation and expressed as kg ha mm 1 2 6 statistical analysis experimental data obtained for different parameters were analyzed statistically using the analysis of variance anova technique as applicable to split plot design gomez and gomez 1984 duncan s multiple

all the data were statistically analyzed considering year as a source of variation in addition to cultivation system cs and water management w treatments the main effects of year y and the interaction effects between year and cs y cs year and water management y w and three factor interaction y cs w were all non significant at p 0 05 for all parameters considered in the present study this with the year effect being non significant accordingly the data reported in this paper are averages from the two years of trials 3 results 3 1 effects on grain yield water requirements and water productivity cultivation systems and post vegetative phase water management treatments were both found to have significant impacts on grain yield water use and water productivity for cmp grain yield was the highest with the 1 dad treatment 4 06 t ha 1 while the yield under sri methods was highest with 3 dad irrigation intervals 6 21 t ha 1 across the various water management treatments evaluated sri methods gave 58 higher average yield than cmp practices total water use with cmp was 1128 mm while water use with sri management during the whole crop cycle was 939 mm table 2 with sri compared to cmp there was thus a saving of 189 mm water 16 this water saving was mainly due to differences in the vegetative stage treatments i e 3 dad under sri management vs continuous flooding under cmp the range of water saving estimated under post vegetative stage treatments of 5 dad vs cf under the two cultivation systems was 63 100 mm if a comparison is made between conventional flooded rice and sri having a 3 dad irrigation schedule the best for sri a significant amount of water was saved i e 250 mm 20 across all water management treatments water productivity was significantly higher under sri management 6 3 kg ha mm 1 as compared to cmp 3 3 kg ha mm 1 sri grown rice plants were thus almost twice as efficient in utilizing water for the production of grain under cmp the highest water productivity was obtained with 1 dad treatment 3 5 kg ha mm 1 while under sri the greatest water productivity was achieved with 3 dad treatment 6 7 kg ha mm 1 almost double 3 2 effects on grain yield components grain yield performance is determined by different yield components like number of panicles m 2 total number of grains panicle 1 grain filling and 1000 grain weight in the present experiment all varied significantly p 0 05 in response to the method of rice cultivation table 3 cultivation system significantly affected the number of panicles per hill as well as on an area basis with sri management the number of panicles per hill was more than double that for rice grown under cmp however on a unit area basis panicle numbers were only 9 higher in sri plots than in cmp plots mainly due to the greater number of hills and of plants in the latter post vegetative stage water management treatments had no significant effect on the number of panicles either per hill or per unit area except for panicle number the other yield components number of grains panicle grain filling and 1000 grain weight varied significantly in response to the water management practices imposed after panicle initiation table 3 under cmp the 3 fold increase in the number of plants per hill and a 6 fold increase in the overall number of plants on a unit surface area basis was associated with a highly significant decrease in grain yield under sri management grains per panicle and grain filling were significantly higher with the 3 dad treatment than with the other water management treatments under cmp cultivation the highest values were recorded with cf and 1 dad irrigation grain filling under sri was significantly greater with the 3 dad treatment while it was higher with the 1 dad treatment under cmp with the increasing moisture stress of 5 dad irrigation both grain filling and grain weight were seen to be reduced with both cultivation systems 3 3 effects on root growth root weight density and xylem exudation rate crops grown with sri practices and 3 dad alternate wetting and drying during the vegetative stage had significantly greater weight of roots at the pi stage both per hill and per unit area table 4 this occurred even though sri plots had only one plant per hill while cmp plots had three plants per hill and twice as many hills on average sri plants had nearly 2 5 times more roots hills 1 at the pi stage than did the cmp hills 1 and on a unit area basis the sri plant roots were 34 more this reflects among other things the effects of reduced interplant competition due to fewer plants under sri no significant effects of the different post vegetative water management treatments on roots dry weight were recorded following the pi stage when the four different water treatments were superimposed when root growth was measured at the grain filling stage after imposing the different post vegetative water management treatments there were observable and significant effects of the water management treatments on roots growth with sri methods the highest root dry weight was observed with the 3 dad treatment both per hill and on an area basis under cmp management there were no significant differences found in plant roots dry weight between continuous flooding and 1 dad treatments while there was a decline in roots dry weight with both the 3 dad and 5 dad treatments table 4 a similar trend was found with root weight density which was found to be significantly higher under sri than cmp at both the pi and grain filling stages also post vegetative stage water management significantly affected rwd and was maximum in the 3 dad treatment of sri the xylem exudate data presented in table 5 show the amounts of exudates that moved upward towards the shoot during a 24 h period of time the flow when measured on a per hill basis was significantly higher even more than double in sri plants compared to the plants under conventional flooding method on an area basis also the xylem flow was greater under sri by 16 than in crops being grown under cmp table 5 at the grain filling stage the amount of xylem exudation in sri grown plants was 1 5 times more than in cmp plants on a per hill basis and 25 greater on an area basis the different post vegetative water management treatments had a significant effect on exudate amounts greatest for sri with 3 dad treatment followed by cmp with 1 dad and sri with 1 dad treatments on a per hill basis xylem exudation rate was nearly 3 times faster under sri than cmp at both stages of measurements across all water management treatments overall on an area basis the xylem exudation rate under sri was calculated to be 25 faster than for crops under cmp 6 4 g m 2 h 1 vs 5 1 g m 2 h 1 during the grain filling stage 3 4 effects on leaf area index and light interception by crop canopy leaf area index lai and light interception by canopy lic when measured at the grain filling stage showed sri crops to have significantly greater values across all of the treatments similar to other parameters measured under sri cultivation the highest lai and lic were found with the 3 dad water management treatment while under cmp these values were highest with the 1 dad treatment fig 1 the lower levels of leaf area and light interception under the water constrained conditions of the 5 dad treatment were mainly attributable to greater senescence and dying off of the lower leaves under both cultivation practices which caused a decrease in root development as reflected in the data in table 4 3 5 effects on spad values and leaf photosynthesis rate overall the leaves of the sri plants had significantly higher spad values than did those of cmp plants indicating that sri leaves were greener compared to cmp leaves fig 2 across all the water management treatments the flag leaf and the fourth leaf of sri plants compared to those of cmp plants had higher spad values by 22 and 34 respectively the spad values in both the flag and fourth leaves were found to be the highest with 3 dad under sri and with 1 dad treatments under cmp the latter were always significantly lower than for the sri treatment reflecting differences in the sri and cmp phenotypes resulting from treatment effects during the grain filling stage cultivation methods were found to have a significant effect on photosynthesis rates in both flag leaves and fourth leaves fig 3 overall the flag leaves of sri plants had a photosynthesis rate 22 higher and the fourth leaves had a 19 higher rate compared to the flag and fourth leaves of cmp rice plants also the different water management treatments during the post vegetative stage had significant impacts on the photosynthesis rates in the flag and fourth leaves during the grain filling stage under both cultivation systems an important difference in sri plants both flag and fourth leaves had significantly higher photosynthesis rates under the 3 dad treatment compared to others while with cmp methods plants under the 1 dad treatment had a higher photosynthesis rate than with the other irrigation treatments these trends in leaf photosynthesis rate were consistent with the spad values measured for the different treatments with both cultivation systems the lowest rate of photosynthesis was found in rice plants grown under the 5 dad treatment which was the treatment with the most water stress this rate remained significantly higher in sri treatments than for cmp which again may be explained by the improved root development and activity tables 4 and 5 3 6 effects on main stem panicle weight and grain filling rate gfr there were significant differences between the two crop management systems and the four water management treatments with regard to main panicle dry weight fig 4 and their grain filling rate fig 5 overall at the time of flowering anthesis the dry weight of the main panicle that includes empty grains chaff was 746 mg under cmp and 929 mg under sri so the latter was 25 heavier during the initial 7 days after anthesis daa the panicle weight increased at a high rate in all of the treatments fig 4 shows two pairs of curves distinctly different for sri and cmp in panicles grown in cmp plots the weight of grain increased up to 21 daa but after this there were no significant increases the slopes of the sri curves show grain filling continuing at a higher rate and for a longer period than for cmp rice plants under sri practice in contrast to cmp the increase in grain weight continued up to 28 or 35 daa in most of the treatments except in those with 5 dad irrigation in sri plots with 5 dad irrigation which initially showed the most rapid growth of panicle weight the curve s leveling off after 21 daa may be due to unsupportive root functioning and a lower rate of leaf photosynthesis at the time of harvest the average main panicle dry weight was 50 more under sri management than with cmp i e 4599 mg vs 3056 mg among the different water management treatments the highest main panicle dry weight with cmp was achieved with 1 dad water management 3240 mg and with sri at 3 dad scheduling 4921 mg similarly the weight of grain yield per main panicle under cmp was 2310 mg compared with 3670 mg under sri across all water management treatments sri plants had a gfr of 104 8 mg day 1 panicle 1 for the main panicle 59 higher than the gfr for cmp plants which was 66 0 mg day 1 panicle 1 water management during the post vegetative stage thus had a significant effect on the grain filling rate of the main panicle fig 5 under sri management the highest gfr was found with the 3 dad treatment while the highest gfr under cmp methods was achieved with the 1 dad treatment this was consistent with the many preceding measurements reported 4 discussion much of the burden for promoting rice production in the future will rest on developing better integrated soil crop management systems chen et al 2011 and promoting water saving irrigation the system of rice intensification is a method of rice cultivation that can be part of such a strategy fao 2016 through research and extension over the past decade it has been extensively documented that sri ideas and methods can improve productivity by using less external inputs and by reducing the consumption of water jagannath et al 2013 lin et al 2009 satyanarayana et al 2007 sinha and talati 2007 thakur et al 2011 2014 uphoff 2012 the purpose of this investigation was to evaluate whether further water savings might be possible within the sri management framework particularly during the post vegetative stage and whether observed yield and water productivity improvements could be explained through demonstrable impacts on crop growth and physiology in the present trials sri produced 58 higher grain yield compared with cmp table 2 many earlier studies have also shown sri methods giving 20 50 higher yield and even more jagannath et al 2013 satyanarayana et al 2007 sinha and talati 2007 thakur et al 2011 obviously the percentage increase will vary depending on the cultivation systems with which it is compared the latter varying greatly between regions and farmers however increases of more than 20 over already high levels have been reported on a large scale in china wu and uphoff 2015 zheng et al 2013 these yield increases are achieved while water consumption is greatly reduced particularly important in a water scarce country like iraq hameed et al 2013 the present study recorded similar results that can be explained by the morphological and physiological changes associated with changes in plant phenotypes under sri practices the changes in water management practices during the post vegetative stage had a significant impact on grain filling rate and hence on panicle dry weight moisture reduction beyond a certain point during the post vegetative stage was seen to set in on all plants however cultivated but this was evident earlier with cmp grown plants whose root systems were less well developed and less functional rice plants grown with cmp methods having less root growth evidently started experiencing moisture stress beyond 1 dad irrigation while for sri plants this constraint set in beyond 3 dad irrigation this effect correlated with measurements on declining root growth and root activity decreasing green leaf area lowered photosynthesis rate and enhanced senescence these morpho physiological changes led to a lowering of dry weight of the main panicle to a slowing down of the grain filling rate and ultimately to less grain yield it is interesting to note that even at 5 dad the sri plots still yielded significantly more than from any of the cmp treatments table 2 this indicates a greater resilience of sri plants to withstand moisture stress these results may have relevance also to the widespread rainfed rice systems which experience water stress mostly during their post vegetative stage of crop growth and which will have more resilience if they grow larger root systems the significantly larger root systems that had been developed during the vegetative phase up to the pi stage resulted from the preceding practices that are introduced under sri these include transplanting young single seedlings at wider spacing enhancing soil fertility with organic amendments regular mechanical weeding and alternate wetting and drying irrigation during the vegetative growth stage rather than continuous flooding a major factor will have been the greatly reduced plant density that has been responsible for a relatively unrestricted and remarkable root development table 4 but aerobic soil conditions and active soil aeration that promote the growth and functioning of beneficial soil organisms including possibly as symbiotic endophytes uphoff et al 2013 could be playing a role in this better crop performance a hypothesis that warrants more investigation under conventional cultivation in contrast older seedlings are transplanted 3 or 4 together in more closely spaced hills with the field kept flooded throughout the vegetative stage these practices result in poor root growth under cmp both on a per hill basis and on an area basis which accelerates the degeneration of rice root systems kar et al 1974 with obviously adverse effects on root activity yang et al 2004 this is reflected in reduced exudation rates and quantities table 5 under sri management greater root growth and activity of individual plants and of the crop as a whole become much more efficient in using the natural resources as well as in plants uptake of mineral fertilizer thakur et al 2013 sri practices presumably establish a more favourable root soil interface in terms of soil microbiology and aeration however there is not much research on this or on how alternate wetting and drying irrigation facilitates better root growth under sri compared to cmp in terms of grain yield different researchers comparing awd with cf have reported some contradictory results for example yao et al 2012 found no difference in yield between awd and continuously flooded rice however awd in their evaluation saved 24 38 irrigation water and had higher water productivity than continuously flooded rice recently carrijo et al 2017 found no significant yield reductions under mild awd with 23 4 water saving but a 22 6 yield penalty under severe awd compared with continuous flooding in rice these comparisons were made however without taking into account the probably confounding effects of plant density and moisture stress factors stoop et al 2009 and without considering the impact of greater root growth as results under sri due to its management modifications wang et al 2016 and yang et al 2017 have reported without reference to or use of sri methods that alternate wetting and moderate drying is better for rice crop growth than either continuous flooding or alternate wetting and severe drying in terms of higher grain yield and greater water use efficiency wue in rice according to yang et al 2017 moderate awd enhances grain yield and wue mainly due to improved vegetative growth root growth canopy structure and enhanced carbon remobilization from vegetative tissues to grain also elevated phyto hormonal levels particularly increase in abscisic acid aba levels during soil drying and then cytokinin levels during re watering transplanting young seedlings under sri methods influences their quick establishment in the main field by avoiding trauma to their roots and canopies during their uprooting from the nursery this helps the seedlings to resume their growth quickly and grow greater root mass pasuquin et al 2008 also transplanting single seedlings with wider spacing minimizes competition for nutrients water solar energy and other requirements such practices create more favourable environments for plant growth the significance of the expanded root systems was illustrated in our trial by the increase in xylem exudates transported from the roots upward towards the shoots during the grain filling stage these were significantly more under sri than under cmp the greater root growth and activity in addition to better extraction of water and nutrients also improves the transport of cytokinins towards the shoot san oh et al 2004 2006 it is well known that cytokinins delay leaf senescence and maintain the greenness of leaves as was recorded in both the flag leaf and the fourth lower leaf of sri plants in this study fig 2 also cytokinins are associated with increased chlorophyll content in the leaves thakur et al 2010b 2011 maintenance of a higher leaf chlorophyll level results in higher rates of photosynthesis during grain filling fig 3 the incipient grains received a greater supply of carbohydrates from photosynthesis while also more of these were sent to the roots for the maintenance of their activity metabolism hence an expanded and active root system as developed under awd methods of irrigation with moderate drying of the soil significantly affects a crop s above ground physiology and performance zhang et al 2009 for example have reported similar effects of a moderate wetting and drying regime when compared with continuous flooding they also showed the significant effects of water management on root oxidation activity cytokinin concentrations in the roots and shoots leaf photosynthetic rate and the activities of key enzymes involved in sucrose to starch conversion in grains a resultant effect of root growth and physiology on crop grain yield was an increase of 11 with awd practices and in water use efficiency of 55 zhang et al 2009 similarly other researchers also found that post anthesis alternate wetting and moderate soil drying elevates cytokinin levels in the rice shoot at the same time improving sink strength grain filling rate and grain weight of inferior spikelets zhang et al 2010 2012 all this ultimately resulted in higher grain yield the amount of light intercepted by the canopy is positively correlated with the leaf area of the crop and this relates directly to plant growth san oh et al 2004 in this present study rice plants grown with sri methods had significantly greater leaf area as well as more light interception by the canopy compared with the cmp crop during the grain filling stage this was achieved in spite of the six fold reduction in plant density m 2 in the sri treatments the higher leaf area with sri management was mainly due to delayed senescence of the lower leaves and to greater leaf size which resulted in increased light interception thakur et al 2011 the sri grown plants also had a more open canopy with more erect leaves a structure that facilitated higher light interception and minimized shading of the lower leaves of the crop thakur et al 2016 all these effects are associated with the drastic reduction in the number of plants per unit area which allows the rice plants to function physiologically more efficiently than under conventional management during the vegetative growth phase and subsequent panicle initiation the plant s potential yielding capacity is determined the post vegetative phase that follows determines the extent to which this potential gets realized unconstrained grain filling is the decisive process which correlates with the crop s yield performance many researchers have explored the relationship between photosynthesis and related parameters in the leaves i e source factors vis à vis the grain filling process sink factors which determines ultimate grain yield we have observed that under sri management higher leaf chlorophyll content and a faster rate of photosynthesis led to more rapid grain filling by about 59 fig 5 this relationship also confirmed that leaf photosynthetic rates are positively related with chlorophyll meter values park and lee 2003a the stay green characteristics of sri plants during grain filling reflected in their spad values contributed to higher grain yield delayed senescence of both upper and lower leaves as analyzed by park and lee 2003b is associated with the higher grain yield observed under sri management figs 2 and 3 enhanced photosynthetic rate in the lower leaves also provides an increased supply of carbohydrates to the roots thereby enhancing their metabolism and prolonging their longevity improved shoot characteristics and functioning due to the receipt of more nutrients water and plant hormones then translates into an overall increase in biomass production and in plants grain filling processes samejima et al 2004 zhang et al 2009 a similar result has been reported by chen et al 2013 on increases in biomass accumulation before the heading stage and the subsequent improved utilization of photosynthates during the grain filling stage the underlying reasons might be due to some reorientation in the translocation process in plants earlier yang et al 2003 demonstrated that a properly controlled water deficit during grain filling could enhance the remobilization of pre stored carbon in the stems which greatly increased the plant s grain filling rate in our study a controlled but not excessive water deficit had no yield constraining effect up to 1 dad irrigation for the cmp plants nor up to 3 dad irrigation for the sri crop however remobilization of carbohydrate reserves stored in the leaf sheath and stem for grain filling under sri management has not been studied specifically this is an important area of research for making crops more heat or drought resistant through modifications in irrigation and other crop management practices apart from the rate of grain filling variations in the duration of grain filling are also an important factor that can account at least in part for differences in grain yield extension of the grain filling period can provide rice plants with more access to ambient resources for prolonged grain growth in this way achieving higher yield yang et al 2008 although it is clear that sri practices have an effect on the grain filling rate see fig 4 it would be good to know more about how the duration of grain filling is affected by crop or water management practices yield components such as the number of panicles and the number of grains per panicle are determined mostly by growth processes that begin before anthesis in our study when alternative water management practices were introduced during the post vegetative stage there were no significant differences detected in the numbers of panicles per plant and grains per panicle however our trials showed a consistent pattern of better crop performance and higher grain yield from sri compared with cmp crop management and best cmp performance was consistently with irrigation provided at 1 dad in the post vegetative phase rather that maintaining continuous flooding and for sri the best scheduling was with 3 dad during both the post vegetative and vegetative phases 5 conclusions enhancing water productivity in rice production will continue to be a matter of great concern to researchers farmers and policy makers in order to produce more grain with less water more crop per drop in the present study we demonstrated that sri practices induce rather different phenotypic responses in rice plants both morphologically and physiologically one of the most important findings was that water productivity could be enhanced by about 90 when using the suite of practices that constitute sri in our trials these methods reached a productivity of 6 3 kg ha mm 1 compared to 3 3 kg ha mm 1 with cmp under sri management with 16 less irrigation water there was on average a 58 enhancement of grain yield alternate wetting and drying together with sri management practices had significant and multiple beneficial effects on grain yield as well as on water saving and water productivity sri crops were able to achieve greater grain yield even with reduced applications of water due to their more vigorous root growth greater root activity delayed leaf senescence and higher photosynthetic rate and greater rate of grain filling compared with cmp rice crops these results were obtained in spite of the drastic six fold reduction in the number of plants m 2 under sri practice under such management the best results in terms of yield water saving and productivity from sandy clay loam soil with a medium duration variety were obtained by maintaining a 3 dad irrigation regime throughout the entire cropping season instead of flooding the rice field continuously including during the post vegetative stage based on our results the current sri recommendation for maintaining a shallow layer of water on the field after panicle initiation could well be revised this would further increase sri s water saving without any yield penalty indeed with an enhancement of yield further studies are required regarding the effect of sri on the remobilization of carbohydrate reserves stored in leaf sheaths and stems during grain filling especially during terminal heat or water stress the impact of crop management practices on grain filling duration under sri management should also be researched studies on sri s yield and water productivity performance using other water saving irrigation methods like drip or sprinkler systems should also be investigated possibly together with sri management both of these methods and new irrigation technology could be made more productive in terms of their use of land labor and especially water

11414,selection of an appropriate combination of flow rate and time to cut off is critical to the achievement of high performance furrow irrigation for the cotton growing regions of australia the ready availability of land and the relative scarcity of water impose a constraint not present in all surface irrigation areas in this situation the objective is to improve water use efficiency by maximising application efficiency in this paper simulations employing this strategy and historical furrow irrigation data have shown that application efficiency increases with flow rate up to a point where no further increase in efficiency is possible they have also shown that for any field there is a simple linear relationship between time to cut off and the time for the advance to reach mid way down the field this relationship provides a simple and robust guide for the selection of time to cut off that requires no knowledge of the flow rate or soil moisture deficit application of the relationship delivers a significant increase in efficiency over that resulting from usual grower practice keywords furrow irrigation cut off time irrigation performance infiltration 1 introduction furrow irrigation is the one of the most widely used methods of irrigation in the world despite its often low irrigation efficiency and high labour requirements in australia it is the predominant method for irrigation of cotton up to 500 000 ha annually a large proportion of which is grown on heavy cracking clay soils koech et al 2010 a decade ago smith et al 2005 showed that irrigation application efficiencies in the australian cotton industry were previously a low 48 on average but varied widely from 17 to 100 deep drainage below the root zone that is a depth of infiltration in excess of the soil moisture deficit was identified as a major contributor to these low efficiencies averaging 42 5 mm per irrigation in traditional practice growers have tended to run their irrigation until the advance down the majority of furrows has reached the end of the field this ensures that the entire field receives the depth of water required to fully replenish the root zone soil moisture deficit that is the requirement efficiency was at or near 100 however the effect is a significant loss of water to runoff and deep drainage and hence relatively low application efficiencies and low water use efficiencies the data presented by smith et al 2005 also show that by increasing the furrow inflow rates to 6 l s and reducing the time to cut off tco commensurately the average application efficiency across the industry could be increased up to about 75 by decreasing both the runoff and deep drainage although the range of application efficiency values would still be excessive industry wide adoption of improved practices higher flow rates and shorter durations has been estimated bda group 2007 to have saved the cotton industry 400 gl over a 16 year period or 28 5 gl annum and has contributed to industry improvement in wue of 10 with anticipation of another 10 improvement in wue by 2014 the gains in performance have been substantiated by more recent evaluations of furrow irrigation performance by montgomery and wigginton 2008 that have shown average application efficiencies in the cotton industry currently exceeding 70 raising efficiency further can only come about by managing each individual irrigation by varying flow rate and tco to give optimum performance for the prevailing conditions simulations performed using historical data smith et al 2005 khatri and smith 2007 have shown that application efficiencies in excess of 85 are possible by this means traditionally inflow rates are set at the start of the season by selection of the size of the over bank siphons used to supply each furrow optimum cut off times often occur before the advance has reached the end of the field making them difficult to estimate by growers who typically judge cut off from experience with previous irrigations few if any growers use objective methods of estimating the preferred tco the challenge in providing guidance to growers is accommodating all the different combinations of the variables that control irrigation performance namely field length and slope flow rate infiltration surface roughness and soil moisture deficit various means for estimating optimal or preferred times to cut off have been developed including hydrodynamic simulation modelling such as sirmod walker 2003 winsrfr bautista et al 2009 and sisco gillies and smith 2015 or design charts of varying complexity e g elliott et al 1983 strelkoff 1985 raine et al 1998 all tend to be data intensive and require skill in the operation of software or the ability to undertake complex calculations each of which makes them unattractive to farmers a method for the real time selection of tco has been developed and tested khatri and smith 2007 smith et al 2013 koech et al 2014a b that requires measurements only of the inflow rate and advance to a single point the main features of this optimization process are the use of a model infiltration curve and a scaling process to describe the current soil infiltration characteristic measurement of the inflow rate to the furrows measurement of the water advance at a point approximately midway down the furrow and a hydraulic simulation program based on the full hydrodynamic model to predict the optimum time to cut off this method has been shown to give substantially improved irrigation performance however because of the computations required it is suitable only for automated systems more recently smith et al 2013 proposed relatively simple guidelines for bay irrigated crops and pasture developed from full hydrodynamic simulations in the form of plots of advance rate versus tco for various soil types flow rates bay lengths and crop densities both of the above approaches rely on the notion that the irrigation advance trajectory integrates the effect of all of the controlling variables it is therefore hypothesized that some knowledge of this trajectory gained during an irrigation event should be able to be used by growers to estimate with sufficient accuracy the preferred time to cut off for that irrigation hence the objective of the paper is to investigate the relationship between advance rate and the preferred tco for furrow irrigation on cracking clay soils and to compare the performance of alternative methods for estimating tco 2 methodology 2 1 field data data used in this study were selected from the many individual furrow irrigation evaluations that have been conducted by the ncea since 1998 in the cotton growing areas of southern queensland and northern nsw and which are available from the isid database roth et al 2014 all irrigations were performed under normal commercial conditions with inflow rates and cut off times as normally used by the farmer measurements were conducted using the irrimate surface irrigation evaluation system developed by the ncea as described by dalton et al 2001 and raine et al 2005 the data that were recorded typically included inflow hydrographs furrow dimensions and advance times for up to six locations along the furrow length in some cases runoff hydrographs were also measured field t17 is situated close to goondiwindi in southern queensland australia on a grey vertisol cracking clay soil in this case the data used cover a total of five irrigation events with the advance down four furrows observed during each event the inflow rates varied from irrigation to irrigation 5 4 7 1 l s and were constant throughout each event field d is situated on a cracking clay soil black vertisol on the darling downs of southern queensland measurements were available from four furrows over five consecutive irrigation events although data from only two events are used in this paper inflow hydrographs were available for all furrows but showed no significant temporal variation during the irrigations inflow rates were also similar between furrows and between irrigations runoff hydrographs from every furrow were measured close to the end of the field using trapezoidal flumes however the short storage phase prevented the onset of steady runoff rates and hence did not permit direct identification of the steady or final infiltration rate for both fields t17 and d the crop row spacing was 1 m and irrigated furrow spacing 2 m they were selected because the evaluations covered multiple irrigations and multiple furrows field t17 data were used to establish the relationship between advance time and tco data from both fields were used to compare the performance of the alternative methods for selecting tco to further explore the performance of the simpler methods for selecting tco evaluation data from single irrigations in a number of individual furrows from across the cotton growing region were also used table 1 summarises the data for each field showing the range of lengths and slopes along with the flow rates soil moisture deficits and times to cut off employed by the growers some of these data were also used in previous studies by smith et al 2005 khatri and smith 2006 and gillies et al 2011 2 2 data analysis the data analysis in this paper was conducted in five stages i determination of the spatially averaged infiltration parameters for each irrigation of each furrow ii simulation of each irrigation to determine the actual performance application efficiency obtained during the evaluation that is under usual farmer management iii optimisation of each irrigation at various flow rates to ascertain the maximum efficiency attainable and how performance varies with inflow rate iv investigation of the relationship between advance time to a set point in the field and the preferred time to cut off tco for the various flow rates and v comparison of alternative methods that could be used for estimating tco the detailed methodology for each stage and the results obtained are presented in the following sections the modelling tool used in stages i iv was the surface irrigation simulation calibration and optimisation sisco model of gillies and smith 2015 sisco is a numerical solution of the full hydrodynamic equations for spatially varied unsteady channel flow the model is capable of performing three different functions firstly it can simulate the irrigation advance down an irrigation furrow or bay for this it requires the flow rate steady or variable into the furrow the soil infiltration characteristic and the resistance provided to the flow by the bed of the furrow this resistance is indicated by the manning n the roughness term in the widely used manning equation from the simulation the model can calculate the usual array of performance parameters application efficiency ea requirement efficiency er uniformity du runoff volume deep percolation for this an estimate of the soil moisture deficit for the furrow is required secondly sisco is self calibrating that is it can estimate the soil infiltration parameters for the furrow and the manning n from a known inflow hydrograph and any or all of advance data tail water runoff and flow depths measured during an irrigation event calibration is an automated iterative process involving repeated simulations while varying the infiltration parameters and manning n until the best possible fit is obtained between the measured and simulated data finally once calibrated the model can determine the optimum values for irrigation variables such as flow rate and time to cut off of the irrigation flow that will give the best or preferred irrigation performance according to a user specified objective function in all cases the model requires physical characteristics of the furrow field i e length furrow spacing and cross section shape and the longitudinal slope of the furrow 3 furrow infiltration parameters and simulation of actual irrigations the soil infiltration characteristic for each furrow and each irrigation averaged over the length of the furrow is described in the sisco model by the kostiakov lewis equation 1 i k τ a f o τ where i is the cumulative depth of infiltration m3 m length a and k are fitted parameters fo is the final or steady infiltration rate m2 min m length and τ is the infiltration time min the infiltration parameters of eq 1 were evaluated for every furrow irrigation using the calibration function in the sisco model for field t17 the infiltration parameters were estimated using only advance data while for field d advance data and runoff hydrographs were available in all cases the manning roughness coefficient n was assumed to be 0 04 as there was insufficient data available from each event to allow reliable estimation of n during the calibration this is the value that most often results from the sisco calibration for bare furrows it is also recommended by the us soil conservation service for smooth bare soil clemmens 2003 and also suggested by asae 2003 although cotton was being grown on the hills between the furrows the beds of the furrows were bare and smooth from preceding irrigations it is worth noting that the furrow hydraulics behaviour is insensitive to small changes in the manning n mcclymont et al 1996 examplesof the resulting cumulative infiltration curves for field t17 are presented in figs 1 and 2 they show characteristics typical of cracking clay soils with a significant rapid initial depth of infiltration caused by the filling of cracks followed by a relatively low steady infiltration rate the differences in magnitude between furrows fig 1 are typical of the spatial variability experienced in any irrigated field while the differences between irrigations for a given furrow fig 2 are largely a reflection of the variation in soil moisture deficits and hence crack volume the slight differences in the shape of the infiltration functions might be real but could also be an artefact of the calibration process for example remembering that the infiltration curves are the result of a best fit between measured and simulated advance data the differences might be caused by small variations with time in the inflow rate which was assumed constant at this site the infiltration curves also suggest that the deficits vary more than indicated by the growers estimates for a cracking clay soil the crack volume as indicated by the initial rapid depth of infiltration is typically two thirds or greater of the soil moisture deficit see smith et al 2005 the assumed deficit for irrigation 5 at field t17 was 64 mm however based on the initial rapid infiltration crack volume at this site a deficit of less than 40 mm is indicated the spread of the infiltration curves for this furrow suggest a difference in the soil moisture deficits irrigation 3 to irrigation 5 of about 50 mm the linear infiltration curves that resulted for irrigations 4 and 7 are not an uncommon outcome of the calibration on heavy cracking clay soils many of which were evident in the more extensive study of smith et al 2005 while some small degree of curvature would be expected a very low value approaching zero for the kostiakov lewis parameter a the calibration sometimes gives a zero value for this parameter and hence a linear infiltration curve numerous other researchers see austin and prendergast 1997 have observed a similar linear or near linear infiltration characteristic for australian heavy cracking clay soils although the soil at field d was described as a cracking clay the infiltration characteristics estimated from the irrigation advance show no rapid initial infiltration and hence no evidence of cracking behaviour and are more indicative of a permeable clay soil fig 3 the kostiakov lewis parameter values for this soil parameter a approaching 0 5 and relatively high continuing infiltration fo are also indicative of a non cracking soil curves for the individual irrigations and individual furrows mostly showed a similar shape as with field t17 and again the magnitudes differed substantially due to changes in moisture content although much of the cotton in australia is grown on cracking clay soils the infiltration curves for field d suggest that not all will display the expected cracking type infiltration characteristic this has significant implications for irrigation management as will be demonstrated in the later sections of this paper once the soil infiltration parameters had been estimated the sisco model was then used to simulate the actual irrigations using the measured flow rate and the farmer s tco and to calculate the performance parameters application efficiency ea requirement efficiency er uniformity du runoff volume deep percolation for the actual irrigations these were taken to represent the results for the farmers usual management the results of these simulations for field t17 are presented later in tables 2 4 they show that the actual performance achieved under farmer management is typified by relatively low and highly variable application efficiencies 4 optimisation each irrigation event in each individual furrow was simulated for a range of flow rates in order to determine the optimal tco for each flow rate the optimisation strategy chosen for this analysis was to select the tco that gave maximum application efficiency for the given flow rate and a runoff volume equal to 5 of the inflow volume the purpose of this target runoff volume was to provide a small margin of safety to ensure the advance would always reach the end of the field the optimisation objective used in studies such as this is always subjective individual researchers and growers place different values on the key performance parameters depending on their particular circumstances it is not uncommon for example for the requirement efficiency to be set at 100 meaning complete replenishment of the soil moisture deficit over the entire length of the field e g feyen and zerihun 1999 such a strategy inevitably results in substantial runoff volumes deep percolation losses and reduced application efficiency and arguably is not a valid strategy when water is limiting as well as reduced application efficiency it also leads to reduced water use efficiency wue this was well illustrated by uniwater 2008 who showed substantial increases in wue on irrigated lucerne by reducing cut off times below those required for an er of 100 the only consequence of this strategy is that the next irrigation might need to be sooner than would otherwise be required an alternative strategy sometimes used is to maximise uniformity e g finger and morris 2012 this is only valid if er is substantially less than 100 if er is close to 100 then the uniformity of moisture added to storage in the root zone is by definition at or very near 100 in this situation the uniformity of infiltration is irrelevant examples of the results of the optimisations undertaken for the present study are presented in figs 4 and 5 as plots of the key performance measures ea er and tco versus flow rate for one irrigation event in one furrow from each of fields t17 and d respectively they show as in all irrigations simulated that the application efficiencies initially rise with increasing flow rate until reaching a plateau at some particular flow rate the magnitude of this flow rate where the plateau commences is a function of the soil type surface roughness field length and deficit being higher for the more permeable soils denser crops longer fields and higher deficits smith et al 2013 it is worth noting here that a different optimisation strategy such as used by feyen and zerihun 1999 will lead to a different relationship between ea and flow rate in their case efficiency reached a peak at a relatively low flow rate and declined with increasing flow rate figs 4 and 5 also show the times to cut off tco the times for the advance to reach the mid point of the field t50 and the advance distances xco corresponding to the time to cut off for each flow rate there was one very significant difference between the optimisation results for field d fig 5 and those for field t17 fig 4 for field d the optimum tco exceeded the advance time to the end of the field for all irrigations the effect of flow rate on application efficiency is sufficiently clear to suggest preferred flow rates in the vicinity of 6 l s for the 1160 m long furrows of field t17 and 4 l s for the shorter furrows of field d at these flow rates the irrigation durations tco were typically between 7 10 h for field t17 6 8 h for field d because runoff was set to 5 to ensure the advance reached the end of the field the maximum application efficiency possible was 95 at or just before the point of maximum ea the requirement efficiency er was generally adequate 95 although it was substantially lower for at least one irrigation which will be shown later to be caused by a substantial overestimate of the soil moisture deficit for that irrigation on both soils the longitudinal uniformity of infiltrated depths represented by du was relatively insensitive to changes in flow rate moreover at the higher flow rates required to maximise application efficiency du was also tending toward a maximum there is little that can be done to improve du however the effective uniformity of the moisture added to the root zone can be increased by over irrigating but this comes at substantial cost to the application efficiency through the generation of substantial deep percolation losses this is not a valid strategy in a water scarce environment for this reason du will not be considered any further in this paper 5 relationship between advance time and time to cut off to be effective procedures or guidelines for selection of tco need to be simple to apply involve the minimum of measurement and calculation on the part of farmers but at the same time be adaptive to changes in the key variables of flow rate infiltration and soil moisture deficit the advance rate tends to integrate the effects of these variables it is something that irrigators can measure relatively simply it is also assumed that irrigators will at least be able to estimate the inflow rate into their furrows from the above optimisations for field t17 plots of advance time to the half distance along the furrow t50 versus the optimal time to cut off tco were prepared for one furrow irrigation 3 furrow 2 for various flow rates and infiltration magnitudes fig 6 and various furrow lengths fig 7 fig 6 shows that for this particular furrow and the previously defined optimisation strategy there is a linear relationship between the advance time and the tco that will result in maximum application efficiency across a wide range of flow rates 4 7 l s and infiltration magnitudes k and fo scaled by factors from 0 5 to 2 in this latter case the shape of the cumulative infiltration curve is maintained and only the magnitude is varied this is in effect equivalent to varying the soil moisture deficit which for a cracking clay soil is assumed to be a multiple of the crack volume and which in this case is approximated by the k parameter in eq 1 the distance used for the advance time was selected arbitrarily but in all cases t50 is much less than the tco hence giving time for the farmer to make the necessary control decision the results suggest that the relationship between advance and tco is independent of the soil moisture deficit and the infiltration characteristic which means that an irrigator on these soils does not need to know the value of either variable to apply the relationship it is worth noting here that the relationship is independent of the deficit simply because the requirement efficiency er is not considered in the optimisation strategy use of a different optimisation strategy might also result in a non linear relationship between t50 and tco however the relationship between t50 and tco does change for different length furrows fig 7 when data from all furrows and all irrigations from field t17 are used substantial scatter occurs around the line of best fit fig 8 this is assumed to be due to variations in the shape of the cumulative infiltration curves between furrows and between irrigations some of which may be real and some an artefact of the sisco calibration process this scatter adds an element of uncertainty and will result in a loss of efficiency if the relationship is used as intended to control irrigations in large groups of furrows however the 5 runoff used in the simulations leading to this relationship provides some margin of safety and should ensure that the irrigation replenishes the soil moisture deficit adequately if this is not sufficient the margin could be increased thus increasing tco by a similar proportion the penalty is a reduction in application efficiency the data from field t17 suggest a relationship between tco and t50 for that field of 2 t c o 2 35 t 50 90 2 for the same soil in a field of different length a more general relationship that accounts for field length is suggested 3 t c o 2 35 t 50 0 11 l where l is the length of the field the data for field d fig 9 similarly show a straight line relationship tco and t50 although the scatter around the line of best fit is substantial at the lower flow rates in this case the equation of the line of best fit 4 t c o 4 11 t 50 70 9 gives a much larger tco for any given advance time compared to that for the cracking soil of field t17 6 comparison of methods for selecting time to cut off three methods for estimating tco were selected for comparison they are a cut off when the advance reaches a set distance along the furrow b cut off according to the relationships between tco and t50 developed in section 5 and c cut off determined by the real time optimisation of koech et al 2014a b fields t17 and d only for purposes of replicating the working of a practical control system one furrow at each site was designated as the control furrow that is the furrow that would contain the advance sensor located at the set distance for method a or at the mid point along the furrow for the other two methods these were selected arbitrarily and for field t17 it was furrow 2 and for field d it was furrow 1 the infiltration characteristic used as the model curve in the real time optimisation was that for the first irrigation in the nominated control furrow the optimisation strategy for the real time optimisation was the same as in the individual optimisations in section 3 that is maximisation of ea and with 5 runoff based on the simulations for field t17 the set distance was selected as 90 of the length flow rates used in the comparison were 6 l s for field t17 and 4 l s for field d for each irrigation and each of the three methods tco was determined from a single advance measurement in the control furrow that tco was then used to simulate that irrigation in each of the four furrows in the group this gave performance that would have been obtained in that particular irrigation in each of the four furrows and also the average performance for the group the results for field t17 are presented in tables 2 4 along with the farmer performance and maximum possible performance achievable by optimisation of each furrow individually these data show that for this field each of the three methods for selecting tco gave very similar performance in all cases it was better than that achieved under usual farmer management and was very close to the optimum performance for the furrows taken individually this is not surprising given that the guideline equation and the choice of the 90 set distance were based on the data from this site the exception was the real time optimisation for irrigation 5 as indicated earlier the soil moisture deficit provided by the grower 64 mm was substantially greater than that 40 mm indicated by the infiltration characteristics for that event hence the optimisation resulted in an excessive tco in its attempt to achieve an er of 90 in the control furrow changing the optimisation strategy to one of maximising ea and ensuring 5 runoff gave a much improved result as seen in the final column of tables 2 4 for field d acceptable performance was given by both the real time optimisation and the tco t50 relationship table 5 the slight difference between the two approaches was due to the different optimisation strategy used with the real time optimisation aiming to maintain er above 90 from section 5 it appears that the main determinant of the relationship between tco and t50 is the shape of the infiltration characteristic hence if it can be assumed for example that all of the cracking soil types have infiltration curves of similar shape then the relationship developed for field t17 might be applicable for all cracking soils to test this notion data from single irrigation events in individual furrows from 10 farms across the cotton growing region that had infiltration characteristics which displayed a cracking behaviour were used in each case the irrigations were controlled using times to cut off based on the set distance l90 and the relationship between tco and t50 eq 2 with the results presented in table 6 for purposes of comparison the actual measured farmer managed performance and the optimum performance for that furrow irrigation determined using the previously define optimisation strategy are also presented the results in table 6 show a wide spread of farmer performance with application efficiencies from a very poor 25 up to very good performance with efficiencies between 80 and 90 in all cases both the set distance and tco t50 relationship options typically outperformed the grower although the performance was sometimes well below optimum and in some cases the advance failed to reach the end of the field taken over all furrows performance of the two methods was generally similar however in the individual cases one method often outperformed the other although neither was consistently better this suggests that the two methods react differently to the slight differences in the shape of the infiltration characteristic for the different furrows 7 discussion the methods available to predict tco vary substantially in the degree of sophistication or smarts that is in the extent of the sensing and computation required unexpectedly the accuracy of the estimate and the subsequent irrigation performance achieved was not directly related to the level of sophistication the determining factor was how well the particular system adapted to the prevailing conditions for example to changes in the soil infiltration characteristic between irrigations as a result of changes in the soil moisture deficit or to changes in the flow rate between irrigations for bay irrigation of pasture or fodder crops the method has also to adapt to changes in the vegetation density surface resistance to the flow however this is relatively unimportant in furrow irrigation where the surface condition does not change materially with time one control strategy commonly used in currently available automation systems is where the irrigation is shut off at a pre set time irrespective of conditions in this case selection of the time to cut off depends entirely on the skill and experience of the grower it is non adaptive and consequently would be expected to give highly variable performance however the grower can provide some level of adaptation by altering the set times after observing the irrigation behaviour i e advance rate on the first set to be irrigated this approach was not considered in the present study of the alternatives considered in this study the simplest is to cut off when the advance reaches a pre set distance down the furrow for field t17 at 90 of the field length the speed of advance and hence the time for the advance to reach the set cut off distance is a function of the flow rate soil infiltration properties soil moisture deficit and to a lesser degree field slope and surface roughness consequently this approach is crudely adaptive and this is demonstrated in the good performance it delivered for the heavy cracking soils of field t17 and the various individual furrows while it performed well in these situations it is not known how universally applicable the 90 distance is and what factors other than shape of the infiltration curve might cause that optimal cut off distance to vary the 90 cut off time approach is also desirable over the t50 approach in terms of ease of detection a sensor placed at 90 of the length could be connected through buried cable to a logging or radio device outside the field whereas sensing at the t50 distance would require installation of this device in the middle of the field posing a problem for machinery operations the failure of the advance to reach the end of the field in furrows 61 74 and ba suggests that some fields will require a different set distance for optimal performance however no common cause is evident on the permeable non cracking soil of site d the optimum time to cut off occurred after the advance had reached the end of the field hence the set distance approach was not applicable it also suggests that the set distance might not be an option for other non cracking soils unlike other approaches the use of the set distance does not allow the system to predict the cut off time in advance in many instances it is beneficial to have advance knowledge of the cut off time so that changes can be made to the distribution system upstream or the field or in the case of manually controlled irrigations the farmer has sufficient time to get to the field in time to shut it off one factor that affects the choice of the set distance is the surface roughness as described by the manning n smith et al 2013 consequently this approach is likely to be less effective in situations where there is considerable variation in n such as in bay irrigation or furrows with high trash loads because of the difficulty in separating the opposing effects of changes in infiltration and crop density for example an increased infiltration rate as a result of a drier soil profile slows the advance to the cut off point thus allowing greater infiltration to occur to satisfy the greater deficit that is the system is adapting in the correct direction however a higher surface resistance i e trash or thick pasture also slows the advance causing more water to infiltrate resulting in over irrigation and also causing more water to be on the bay when cut off occurs resulting in a greater volume of runoff in that case the method is adapting in the wrong direction the simple relationships between tco and t50 observed in this study and the optimisation using hydrodynamic simulation can both be considered as methods of real time prediction of tco both use data collected during an irrigation to control that irrigation both require some prior knowledge of the infiltration behaviour of the soil e g from a single evaluation of a previous irrigation at the site both also require at the very least measurement of the rate of advance during the irrigation that is being managed real time optimisation using the hydrodynamic simulation also requires measurement of the inflow rate and knowledge of the soil moisture deficit both of these methods adapt to changes in flow rate soil properties and soil moisture deficit and would be expected to give consistently good irrigation performance as seen from the results above the real time optimisation delivered excellent irrigation performance for both fields t17 and d supporting the conclusions of koech et al 2014a b the exception was irrigation 5 on field t17 where a substantial error in estimation of the deficit caused significant error in calculation of tco by the real time optimisation this indicates that the increased sophistication and greater data requirements of the real time optimisation makes it susceptible to significant errors in the data the positive for this method was that it worked well for both the cracking t17 and non cracking d infiltration characteristics the robustness and simplicity of a relationship between tco and t50 is a distinct advantage once the relationship is established for a field the grower or automation system only has to monitor the advance to the half way point of the field no knowledge of the flow rate and soil moisture deficit is required however a disadvantage of this approach is that a constant inflow rate is assumed whereas hydrodynamic simulation can readily accommodate inflows that all too often vary with time further testing is required to determine if the approach can accommodate variable inflow rates and if performance can be improved by moving the control point further down the field the simple relationship between tco and t50 will change and likely no longer be linear for different optimisation strategies for example inclusion of er in the optimisation will cause the relationship to be sensitive to the soil moisture deficit fortunately the optimisation strategy adopted here neglecting er should be suitable for most cracking clay soils as the deficit is typically mostly replenished in a short period after wetting the choice of 5 runoff in this study is based on previous experience by the authors it would be important to investigate whether this 5 limit is satisfactory to account for the range of variability of furrow behaviour expected in a typical irrigation anecdotal evidence suggests that this 5 is insufficient to address the systematic variability due to controlled traffic further work is also required to determine whether these simple relationships between tco and t50 are field specific or can be applied more generally for example the results for the individual furrows on the cracking clay soils suggest that the relationship developed for field t17 works reasonably across other cracking clay soils and might form the basis for a general relationship the greater variety of infiltration characteristics found in the non cracking soils poses a more difficult task to develop any generalised approach for these soils 8 conclusions optimisations were performed on historical data from a number of individual furrows with the objective of maximising application efficiency whilst ensuring water reaches the end of the field they showed that the application efficiency increases with flow rate until it reaches a plateau beyond which increases in flow rate result in no further increase in efficiency further increases in flow rate only serve to reduce the requirement or storage efficiency to undesirable levels the point where maximum application efficiency first occurs defines the preferred flow rate for a field the optimisations performed using the adopted strategy also showed that for any field there appears to be a linear relationship between time to cut off and the time of advance to the mid way point down the field thus providing a simple guideline for selection of time to cut off evaluation of one irrigation event on the particular field is all that is required to establish this relationship once established its application requires measurement only of the t50 advance time knowledge of the flow rate or soil moisture deficit is not required differences in the relationship for cracking and non cracking soils suggest that the shape of the infiltration characteristic is the main factor in determining the relationship crucially this prediction of time to cut off can be performed well in advance of when the control decision must be implemented simulations that replicated the control of groups of furrows showed that use of the simple relationship between tco and t50 would deliver performance well in excess of that from current grower practice performance achieved was equivalent to that delivered by the more data and computationally intensive hydrodynamic based real time optimisation acknowledgements this work was carried out as part of a project on the development of a smart automation system for the furrow irrigation of cotton funded by the cotton research and development corporation 
11414,selection of an appropriate combination of flow rate and time to cut off is critical to the achievement of high performance furrow irrigation for the cotton growing regions of australia the ready availability of land and the relative scarcity of water impose a constraint not present in all surface irrigation areas in this situation the objective is to improve water use efficiency by maximising application efficiency in this paper simulations employing this strategy and historical furrow irrigation data have shown that application efficiency increases with flow rate up to a point where no further increase in efficiency is possible they have also shown that for any field there is a simple linear relationship between time to cut off and the time for the advance to reach mid way down the field this relationship provides a simple and robust guide for the selection of time to cut off that requires no knowledge of the flow rate or soil moisture deficit application of the relationship delivers a significant increase in efficiency over that resulting from usual grower practice keywords furrow irrigation cut off time irrigation performance infiltration 1 introduction furrow irrigation is the one of the most widely used methods of irrigation in the world despite its often low irrigation efficiency and high labour requirements in australia it is the predominant method for irrigation of cotton up to 500 000 ha annually a large proportion of which is grown on heavy cracking clay soils koech et al 2010 a decade ago smith et al 2005 showed that irrigation application efficiencies in the australian cotton industry were previously a low 48 on average but varied widely from 17 to 100 deep drainage below the root zone that is a depth of infiltration in excess of the soil moisture deficit was identified as a major contributor to these low efficiencies averaging 42 5 mm per irrigation in traditional practice growers have tended to run their irrigation until the advance down the majority of furrows has reached the end of the field this ensures that the entire field receives the depth of water required to fully replenish the root zone soil moisture deficit that is the requirement efficiency was at or near 100 however the effect is a significant loss of water to runoff and deep drainage and hence relatively low application efficiencies and low water use efficiencies the data presented by smith et al 2005 also show that by increasing the furrow inflow rates to 6 l s and reducing the time to cut off tco commensurately the average application efficiency across the industry could be increased up to about 75 by decreasing both the runoff and deep drainage although the range of application efficiency values would still be excessive industry wide adoption of improved practices higher flow rates and shorter durations has been estimated bda group 2007 to have saved the cotton industry 400 gl over a 16 year period or 28 5 gl annum and has contributed to industry improvement in wue of 10 with anticipation of another 10 improvement in wue by 2014 the gains in performance have been substantiated by more recent evaluations of furrow irrigation performance by montgomery and wigginton 2008 that have shown average application efficiencies in the cotton industry currently exceeding 70 raising efficiency further can only come about by managing each individual irrigation by varying flow rate and tco to give optimum performance for the prevailing conditions simulations performed using historical data smith et al 2005 khatri and smith 2007 have shown that application efficiencies in excess of 85 are possible by this means traditionally inflow rates are set at the start of the season by selection of the size of the over bank siphons used to supply each furrow optimum cut off times often occur before the advance has reached the end of the field making them difficult to estimate by growers who typically judge cut off from experience with previous irrigations few if any growers use objective methods of estimating the preferred tco the challenge in providing guidance to growers is accommodating all the different combinations of the variables that control irrigation performance namely field length and slope flow rate infiltration surface roughness and soil moisture deficit various means for estimating optimal or preferred times to cut off have been developed including hydrodynamic simulation modelling such as sirmod walker 2003 winsrfr bautista et al 2009 and sisco gillies and smith 2015 or design charts of varying complexity e g elliott et al 1983 strelkoff 1985 raine et al 1998 all tend to be data intensive and require skill in the operation of software or the ability to undertake complex calculations each of which makes them unattractive to farmers a method for the real time selection of tco has been developed and tested khatri and smith 2007 smith et al 2013 koech et al 2014a b that requires measurements only of the inflow rate and advance to a single point the main features of this optimization process are the use of a model infiltration curve and a scaling process to describe the current soil infiltration characteristic measurement of the inflow rate to the furrows measurement of the water advance at a point approximately midway down the furrow and a hydraulic simulation program based on the full hydrodynamic model to predict the optimum time to cut off this method has been shown to give substantially improved irrigation performance however because of the computations required it is suitable only for automated systems more recently smith et al 2013 proposed relatively simple guidelines for bay irrigated crops and pasture developed from full hydrodynamic simulations in the form of plots of advance rate versus tco for various soil types flow rates bay lengths and crop densities both of the above approaches rely on the notion that the irrigation advance trajectory integrates the effect of all of the controlling variables it is therefore hypothesized that some knowledge of this trajectory gained during an irrigation event should be able to be used by growers to estimate with sufficient accuracy the preferred time to cut off for that irrigation hence the objective of the paper is to investigate the relationship between advance rate and the preferred tco for furrow irrigation on cracking clay soils and to compare the performance of alternative methods for estimating tco 2 methodology 2 1 field data data used in this study were selected from the many individual furrow irrigation evaluations that have been conducted by the ncea since 1998 in the cotton growing areas of southern queensland and northern nsw and which are available from the isid database roth et al 2014 all irrigations were performed under normal commercial conditions with inflow rates and cut off times as normally used by the farmer measurements were conducted using the irrimate surface irrigation evaluation system developed by the ncea as described by dalton et al 2001 and raine et al 2005 the data that were recorded typically included inflow hydrographs furrow dimensions and advance times for up to six locations along the furrow length in some cases runoff hydrographs were also measured field t17 is situated close to goondiwindi in southern queensland australia on a grey vertisol cracking clay soil in this case the data used cover a total of five irrigation events with the advance down four furrows observed during each event the inflow rates varied from irrigation to irrigation 5 4 7 1 l s and were constant throughout each event field d is situated on a cracking clay soil black vertisol on the darling downs of southern queensland measurements were available from four furrows over five consecutive irrigation events although data from only two events are used in this paper inflow hydrographs were available for all furrows but showed no significant temporal variation during the irrigations inflow rates were also similar between furrows and between irrigations runoff hydrographs from every furrow were measured close to the end of the field using trapezoidal flumes however the short storage phase prevented the onset of steady runoff rates and hence did not permit direct identification of the steady or final infiltration rate for both fields t17 and d the crop row spacing was 1 m and irrigated furrow spacing 2 m they were selected because the evaluations covered multiple irrigations and multiple furrows field t17 data were used to establish the relationship between advance time and tco data from both fields were used to compare the performance of the alternative methods for selecting tco to further explore the performance of the simpler methods for selecting tco evaluation data from single irrigations in a number of individual furrows from across the cotton growing region were also used table 1 summarises the data for each field showing the range of lengths and slopes along with the flow rates soil moisture deficits and times to cut off employed by the growers some of these data were also used in previous studies by smith et al 2005 khatri and smith 2006 and gillies et al 2011 2 2 data analysis the data analysis in this paper was conducted in five stages i determination of the spatially averaged infiltration parameters for each irrigation of each furrow ii simulation of each irrigation to determine the actual performance application efficiency obtained during the evaluation that is under usual farmer management iii optimisation of each irrigation at various flow rates to ascertain the maximum efficiency attainable and how performance varies with inflow rate iv investigation of the relationship between advance time to a set point in the field and the preferred time to cut off tco for the various flow rates and v comparison of alternative methods that could be used for estimating tco the detailed methodology for each stage and the results obtained are presented in the following sections the modelling tool used in stages i iv was the surface irrigation simulation calibration and optimisation sisco model of gillies and smith 2015 sisco is a numerical solution of the full hydrodynamic equations for spatially varied unsteady channel flow the model is capable of performing three different functions firstly it can simulate the irrigation advance down an irrigation furrow or bay for this it requires the flow rate steady or variable into the furrow the soil infiltration characteristic and the resistance provided to the flow by the bed of the furrow this resistance is indicated by the manning n the roughness term in the widely used manning equation from the simulation the model can calculate the usual array of performance parameters application efficiency ea requirement efficiency er uniformity du runoff volume deep percolation for this an estimate of the soil moisture deficit for the furrow is required secondly sisco is self calibrating that is it can estimate the soil infiltration parameters for the furrow and the manning n from a known inflow hydrograph and any or all of advance data tail water runoff and flow depths measured during an irrigation event calibration is an automated iterative process involving repeated simulations while varying the infiltration parameters and manning n until the best possible fit is obtained between the measured and simulated data finally once calibrated the model can determine the optimum values for irrigation variables such as flow rate and time to cut off of the irrigation flow that will give the best or preferred irrigation performance according to a user specified objective function in all cases the model requires physical characteristics of the furrow field i e length furrow spacing and cross section shape and the longitudinal slope of the furrow 3 furrow infiltration parameters and simulation of actual irrigations the soil infiltration characteristic for each furrow and each irrigation averaged over the length of the furrow is described in the sisco model by the kostiakov lewis equation 1 i k τ a f o τ where i is the cumulative depth of infiltration m3 m length a and k are fitted parameters fo is the final or steady infiltration rate m2 min m length and τ is the infiltration time min the infiltration parameters of eq 1 were evaluated for every furrow irrigation using the calibration function in the sisco model for field t17 the infiltration parameters were estimated using only advance data while for field d advance data and runoff hydrographs were available in all cases the manning roughness coefficient n was assumed to be 0 04 as there was insufficient data available from each event to allow reliable estimation of n during the calibration this is the value that most often results from the sisco calibration for bare furrows it is also recommended by the us soil conservation service for smooth bare soil clemmens 2003 and also suggested by asae 2003 although cotton was being grown on the hills between the furrows the beds of the furrows were bare and smooth from preceding irrigations it is worth noting that the furrow hydraulics behaviour is insensitive to small changes in the manning n mcclymont et al 1996 examplesof the resulting cumulative infiltration curves for field t17 are presented in figs 1 and 2 they show characteristics typical of cracking clay soils with a significant rapid initial depth of infiltration caused by the filling of cracks followed by a relatively low steady infiltration rate the differences in magnitude between furrows fig 1 are typical of the spatial variability experienced in any irrigated field while the differences between irrigations for a given furrow fig 2 are largely a reflection of the variation in soil moisture deficits and hence crack volume the slight differences in the shape of the infiltration functions might be real but could also be an artefact of the calibration process for example remembering that the infiltration curves are the result of a best fit between measured and simulated advance data the differences might be caused by small variations with time in the inflow rate which was assumed constant at this site the infiltration curves also suggest that the deficits vary more than indicated by the growers estimates for a cracking clay soil the crack volume as indicated by the initial rapid depth of infiltration is typically two thirds or greater of the soil moisture deficit see smith et al 2005 the assumed deficit for irrigation 5 at field t17 was 64 mm however based on the initial rapid infiltration crack volume at this site a deficit of less than 40 mm is indicated the spread of the infiltration curves for this furrow suggest a difference in the soil moisture deficits irrigation 3 to irrigation 5 of about 50 mm the linear infiltration curves that resulted for irrigations 4 and 7 are not an uncommon outcome of the calibration on heavy cracking clay soils many of which were evident in the more extensive study of smith et al 2005 while some small degree of curvature would be expected a very low value approaching zero for the kostiakov lewis parameter a the calibration sometimes gives a zero value for this parameter and hence a linear infiltration curve numerous other researchers see austin and prendergast 1997 have observed a similar linear or near linear infiltration characteristic for australian heavy cracking clay soils although the soil at field d was described as a cracking clay the infiltration characteristics estimated from the irrigation advance show no rapid initial infiltration and hence no evidence of cracking behaviour and are more indicative of a permeable clay soil fig 3 the kostiakov lewis parameter values for this soil parameter a approaching 0 5 and relatively high continuing infiltration fo are also indicative of a non cracking soil curves for the individual irrigations and individual furrows mostly showed a similar shape as with field t17 and again the magnitudes differed substantially due to changes in moisture content although much of the cotton in australia is grown on cracking clay soils the infiltration curves for field d suggest that not all will display the expected cracking type infiltration characteristic this has significant implications for irrigation management as will be demonstrated in the later sections of this paper once the soil infiltration parameters had been estimated the sisco model was then used to simulate the actual irrigations using the measured flow rate and the farmer s tco and to calculate the performance parameters application efficiency ea requirement efficiency er uniformity du runoff volume deep percolation for the actual irrigations these were taken to represent the results for the farmers usual management the results of these simulations for field t17 are presented later in tables 2 4 they show that the actual performance achieved under farmer management is typified by relatively low and highly variable application efficiencies 4 optimisation each irrigation event in each individual furrow was simulated for a range of flow rates in order to determine the optimal tco for each flow rate the optimisation strategy chosen for this analysis was to select the tco that gave maximum application efficiency for the given flow rate and a runoff volume equal to 5 of the inflow volume the purpose of this target runoff volume was to provide a small margin of safety to ensure the advance would always reach the end of the field the optimisation objective used in studies such as this is always subjective individual researchers and growers place different values on the key performance parameters depending on their particular circumstances it is not uncommon for example for the requirement efficiency to be set at 100 meaning complete replenishment of the soil moisture deficit over the entire length of the field e g feyen and zerihun 1999 such a strategy inevitably results in substantial runoff volumes deep percolation losses and reduced application efficiency and arguably is not a valid strategy when water is limiting as well as reduced application efficiency it also leads to reduced water use efficiency wue this was well illustrated by uniwater 2008 who showed substantial increases in wue on irrigated lucerne by reducing cut off times below those required for an er of 100 the only consequence of this strategy is that the next irrigation might need to be sooner than would otherwise be required an alternative strategy sometimes used is to maximise uniformity e g finger and morris 2012 this is only valid if er is substantially less than 100 if er is close to 100 then the uniformity of moisture added to storage in the root zone is by definition at or very near 100 in this situation the uniformity of infiltration is irrelevant examples of the results of the optimisations undertaken for the present study are presented in figs 4 and 5 as plots of the key performance measures ea er and tco versus flow rate for one irrigation event in one furrow from each of fields t17 and d respectively they show as in all irrigations simulated that the application efficiencies initially rise with increasing flow rate until reaching a plateau at some particular flow rate the magnitude of this flow rate where the plateau commences is a function of the soil type surface roughness field length and deficit being higher for the more permeable soils denser crops longer fields and higher deficits smith et al 2013 it is worth noting here that a different optimisation strategy such as used by feyen and zerihun 1999 will lead to a different relationship between ea and flow rate in their case efficiency reached a peak at a relatively low flow rate and declined with increasing flow rate figs 4 and 5 also show the times to cut off tco the times for the advance to reach the mid point of the field t50 and the advance distances xco corresponding to the time to cut off for each flow rate there was one very significant difference between the optimisation results for field d fig 5 and those for field t17 fig 4 for field d the optimum tco exceeded the advance time to the end of the field for all irrigations the effect of flow rate on application efficiency is sufficiently clear to suggest preferred flow rates in the vicinity of 6 l s for the 1160 m long furrows of field t17 and 4 l s for the shorter furrows of field d at these flow rates the irrigation durations tco were typically between 7 10 h for field t17 6 8 h for field d because runoff was set to 5 to ensure the advance reached the end of the field the maximum application efficiency possible was 95 at or just before the point of maximum ea the requirement efficiency er was generally adequate 95 although it was substantially lower for at least one irrigation which will be shown later to be caused by a substantial overestimate of the soil moisture deficit for that irrigation on both soils the longitudinal uniformity of infiltrated depths represented by du was relatively insensitive to changes in flow rate moreover at the higher flow rates required to maximise application efficiency du was also tending toward a maximum there is little that can be done to improve du however the effective uniformity of the moisture added to the root zone can be increased by over irrigating but this comes at substantial cost to the application efficiency through the generation of substantial deep percolation losses this is not a valid strategy in a water scarce environment for this reason du will not be considered any further in this paper 5 relationship between advance time and time to cut off to be effective procedures or guidelines for selection of tco need to be simple to apply involve the minimum of measurement and calculation on the part of farmers but at the same time be adaptive to changes in the key variables of flow rate infiltration and soil moisture deficit the advance rate tends to integrate the effects of these variables it is something that irrigators can measure relatively simply it is also assumed that irrigators will at least be able to estimate the inflow rate into their furrows from the above optimisations for field t17 plots of advance time to the half distance along the furrow t50 versus the optimal time to cut off tco were prepared for one furrow irrigation 3 furrow 2 for various flow rates and infiltration magnitudes fig 6 and various furrow lengths fig 7 fig 6 shows that for this particular furrow and the previously defined optimisation strategy there is a linear relationship between the advance time and the tco that will result in maximum application efficiency across a wide range of flow rates 4 7 l s and infiltration magnitudes k and fo scaled by factors from 0 5 to 2 in this latter case the shape of the cumulative infiltration curve is maintained and only the magnitude is varied this is in effect equivalent to varying the soil moisture deficit which for a cracking clay soil is assumed to be a multiple of the crack volume and which in this case is approximated by the k parameter in eq 1 the distance used for the advance time was selected arbitrarily but in all cases t50 is much less than the tco hence giving time for the farmer to make the necessary control decision the results suggest that the relationship between advance and tco is independent of the soil moisture deficit and the infiltration characteristic which means that an irrigator on these soils does not need to know the value of either variable to apply the relationship it is worth noting here that the relationship is independent of the deficit simply because the requirement efficiency er is not considered in the optimisation strategy use of a different optimisation strategy might also result in a non linear relationship between t50 and tco however the relationship between t50 and tco does change for different length furrows fig 7 when data from all furrows and all irrigations from field t17 are used substantial scatter occurs around the line of best fit fig 8 this is assumed to be due to variations in the shape of the cumulative infiltration curves between furrows and between irrigations some of which may be real and some an artefact of the sisco calibration process this scatter adds an element of uncertainty and will result in a loss of efficiency if the relationship is used as intended to control irrigations in large groups of furrows however the 5 runoff used in the simulations leading to this relationship provides some margin of safety and should ensure that the irrigation replenishes the soil moisture deficit adequately if this is not sufficient the margin could be increased thus increasing tco by a similar proportion the penalty is a reduction in application efficiency the data from field t17 suggest a relationship between tco and t50 for that field of 2 t c o 2 35 t 50 90 2 for the same soil in a field of different length a more general relationship that accounts for field length is suggested 3 t c o 2 35 t 50 0 11 l where l is the length of the field the data for field d fig 9 similarly show a straight line relationship tco and t50 although the scatter around the line of best fit is substantial at the lower flow rates in this case the equation of the line of best fit 4 t c o 4 11 t 50 70 9 gives a much larger tco for any given advance time compared to that for the cracking soil of field t17 6 comparison of methods for selecting time to cut off three methods for estimating tco were selected for comparison they are a cut off when the advance reaches a set distance along the furrow b cut off according to the relationships between tco and t50 developed in section 5 and c cut off determined by the real time optimisation of koech et al 2014a b fields t17 and d only for purposes of replicating the working of a practical control system one furrow at each site was designated as the control furrow that is the furrow that would contain the advance sensor located at the set distance for method a or at the mid point along the furrow for the other two methods these were selected arbitrarily and for field t17 it was furrow 2 and for field d it was furrow 1 the infiltration characteristic used as the model curve in the real time optimisation was that for the first irrigation in the nominated control furrow the optimisation strategy for the real time optimisation was the same as in the individual optimisations in section 3 that is maximisation of ea and with 5 runoff based on the simulations for field t17 the set distance was selected as 90 of the length flow rates used in the comparison were 6 l s for field t17 and 4 l s for field d for each irrigation and each of the three methods tco was determined from a single advance measurement in the control furrow that tco was then used to simulate that irrigation in each of the four furrows in the group this gave performance that would have been obtained in that particular irrigation in each of the four furrows and also the average performance for the group the results for field t17 are presented in tables 2 4 along with the farmer performance and maximum possible performance achievable by optimisation of each furrow individually these data show that for this field each of the three methods for selecting tco gave very similar performance in all cases it was better than that achieved under usual farmer management and was very close to the optimum performance for the furrows taken individually this is not surprising given that the guideline equation and the choice of the 90 set distance were based on the data from this site the exception was the real time optimisation for irrigation 5 as indicated earlier the soil moisture deficit provided by the grower 64 mm was substantially greater than that 40 mm indicated by the infiltration characteristics for that event hence the optimisation resulted in an excessive tco in its attempt to achieve an er of 90 in the control furrow changing the optimisation strategy to one of maximising ea and ensuring 5 runoff gave a much improved result as seen in the final column of tables 2 4 for field d acceptable performance was given by both the real time optimisation and the tco t50 relationship table 5 the slight difference between the two approaches was due to the different optimisation strategy used with the real time optimisation aiming to maintain er above 90 from section 5 it appears that the main determinant of the relationship between tco and t50 is the shape of the infiltration characteristic hence if it can be assumed for example that all of the cracking soil types have infiltration curves of similar shape then the relationship developed for field t17 might be applicable for all cracking soils to test this notion data from single irrigation events in individual furrows from 10 farms across the cotton growing region that had infiltration characteristics which displayed a cracking behaviour were used in each case the irrigations were controlled using times to cut off based on the set distance l90 and the relationship between tco and t50 eq 2 with the results presented in table 6 for purposes of comparison the actual measured farmer managed performance and the optimum performance for that furrow irrigation determined using the previously define optimisation strategy are also presented the results in table 6 show a wide spread of farmer performance with application efficiencies from a very poor 25 up to very good performance with efficiencies between 80 and 90 in all cases both the set distance and tco t50 relationship options typically outperformed the grower although the performance was sometimes well below optimum and in some cases the advance failed to reach the end of the field taken over all furrows performance of the two methods was generally similar however in the individual cases one method often outperformed the other although neither was consistently better this suggests that the two methods react differently to the slight differences in the shape of the infiltration characteristic for the different furrows 7 discussion the methods available to predict tco vary substantially in the degree of sophistication or smarts that is in the extent of the sensing and computation required unexpectedly the accuracy of the estimate and the subsequent irrigation performance achieved was not directly related to the level of sophistication the determining factor was how well the particular system adapted to the prevailing conditions for example to changes in the soil infiltration characteristic between irrigations as a result of changes in the soil moisture deficit or to changes in the flow rate between irrigations for bay irrigation of pasture or fodder crops the method has also to adapt to changes in the vegetation density surface resistance to the flow however this is relatively unimportant in furrow irrigation where the surface condition does not change materially with time one control strategy commonly used in currently available automation systems is where the irrigation is shut off at a pre set time irrespective of conditions in this case selection of the time to cut off depends entirely on the skill and experience of the grower it is non adaptive and consequently would be expected to give highly variable performance however the grower can provide some level of adaptation by altering the set times after observing the irrigation behaviour i e advance rate on the first set to be irrigated this approach was not considered in the present study of the alternatives considered in this study the simplest is to cut off when the advance reaches a pre set distance down the furrow for field t17 at 90 of the field length the speed of advance and hence the time for the advance to reach the set cut off distance is a function of the flow rate soil infiltration properties soil moisture deficit and to a lesser degree field slope and surface roughness consequently this approach is crudely adaptive and this is demonstrated in the good performance it delivered for the heavy cracking soils of field t17 and the various individual furrows while it performed well in these situations it is not known how universally applicable the 90 distance is and what factors other than shape of the infiltration curve might cause that optimal cut off distance to vary the 90 cut off time approach is also desirable over the t50 approach in terms of ease of detection a sensor placed at 90 of the length could be connected through buried cable to a logging or radio device outside the field whereas sensing at the t50 distance would require installation of this device in the middle of the field posing a problem for machinery operations the failure of the advance to reach the end of the field in furrows 61 74 and ba suggests that some fields will require a different set distance for optimal performance however no common cause is evident on the permeable non cracking soil of site d the optimum time to cut off occurred after the advance had reached the end of the field hence the set distance approach was not applicable it also suggests that the set distance might not be an option for other non cracking soils unlike other approaches the use of the set distance does not allow the system to predict the cut off time in advance in many instances it is beneficial to have advance knowledge of the cut off time so that changes can be made to the distribution system upstream or the field or in the case of manually controlled irrigations the farmer has sufficient time to get to the field in time to shut it off one factor that affects the choice of the set distance is the surface roughness as described by the manning n smith et al 2013 consequently this approach is likely to be less effective in situations where there is considerable variation in n such as in bay irrigation or furrows with high trash loads because of the difficulty in separating the opposing effects of changes in infiltration and crop density for example an increased infiltration rate as a result of a drier soil profile slows the advance to the cut off point thus allowing greater infiltration to occur to satisfy the greater deficit that is the system is adapting in the correct direction however a higher surface resistance i e trash or thick pasture also slows the advance causing more water to infiltrate resulting in over irrigation and also causing more water to be on the bay when cut off occurs resulting in a greater volume of runoff in that case the method is adapting in the wrong direction the simple relationships between tco and t50 observed in this study and the optimisation using hydrodynamic simulation can both be considered as methods of real time prediction of tco both use data collected during an irrigation to control that irrigation both require some prior knowledge of the infiltration behaviour of the soil e g from a single evaluation of a previous irrigation at the site both also require at the very least measurement of the rate of advance during the irrigation that is being managed real time optimisation using the hydrodynamic simulation also requires measurement of the inflow rate and knowledge of the soil moisture deficit both of these methods adapt to changes in flow rate soil properties and soil moisture deficit and would be expected to give consistently good irrigation performance as seen from the results above the real time optimisation delivered excellent irrigation performance for both fields t17 and d supporting the conclusions of koech et al 2014a b the exception was irrigation 5 on field t17 where a substantial error in estimation of the deficit caused significant error in calculation of tco by the real time optimisation this indicates that the increased sophistication and greater data requirements of the real time optimisation makes it susceptible to significant errors in the data the positive for this method was that it worked well for both the cracking t17 and non cracking d infiltration characteristics the robustness and simplicity of a relationship between tco and t50 is a distinct advantage once the relationship is established for a field the grower or automation system only has to monitor the advance to the half way point of the field no knowledge of the flow rate and soil moisture deficit is required however a disadvantage of this approach is that a constant inflow rate is assumed whereas hydrodynamic simulation can readily accommodate inflows that all too often vary with time further testing is required to determine if the approach can accommodate variable inflow rates and if performance can be improved by moving the control point further down the field the simple relationship between tco and t50 will change and likely no longer be linear for different optimisation strategies for example inclusion of er in the optimisation will cause the relationship to be sensitive to the soil moisture deficit fortunately the optimisation strategy adopted here neglecting er should be suitable for most cracking clay soils as the deficit is typically mostly replenished in a short period after wetting the choice of 5 runoff in this study is based on previous experience by the authors it would be important to investigate whether this 5 limit is satisfactory to account for the range of variability of furrow behaviour expected in a typical irrigation anecdotal evidence suggests that this 5 is insufficient to address the systematic variability due to controlled traffic further work is also required to determine whether these simple relationships between tco and t50 are field specific or can be applied more generally for example the results for the individual furrows on the cracking clay soils suggest that the relationship developed for field t17 works reasonably across other cracking clay soils and might form the basis for a general relationship the greater variety of infiltration characteristics found in the non cracking soils poses a more difficult task to develop any generalised approach for these soils 8 conclusions optimisations were performed on historical data from a number of individual furrows with the objective of maximising application efficiency whilst ensuring water reaches the end of the field they showed that the application efficiency increases with flow rate until it reaches a plateau beyond which increases in flow rate result in no further increase in efficiency further increases in flow rate only serve to reduce the requirement or storage efficiency to undesirable levels the point where maximum application efficiency first occurs defines the preferred flow rate for a field the optimisations performed using the adopted strategy also showed that for any field there appears to be a linear relationship between time to cut off and the time of advance to the mid way point down the field thus providing a simple guideline for selection of time to cut off evaluation of one irrigation event on the particular field is all that is required to establish this relationship once established its application requires measurement only of the t50 advance time knowledge of the flow rate or soil moisture deficit is not required differences in the relationship for cracking and non cracking soils suggest that the shape of the infiltration characteristic is the main factor in determining the relationship crucially this prediction of time to cut off can be performed well in advance of when the control decision must be implemented simulations that replicated the control of groups of furrows showed that use of the simple relationship between tco and t50 would deliver performance well in excess of that from current grower practice performance achieved was equivalent to that delivered by the more data and computationally intensive hydrodynamic based real time optimisation acknowledgements this work was carried out as part of a project on the development of a smart automation system for the furrow
