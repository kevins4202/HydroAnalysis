6030,soil moisture sm is highly involved in a number of fundamental agricultural activities and hydrological processes currently most of the available microwave sm products are too coarse to be used in these relevant applications at regional or watershed scales whereas optical thermal infrared measurements are valid over clear sky conditions only the present study aims to provide a novel framework for the retrieval of all sky surface sm at fine spatial resolution synergistically using optical thermal infrared and microwave measurements in this framework sm for each clear sky pixel is determined from a novel pixel to pixel scheme of land surface temperature vegetation index t s vi trapezoid whereas cloudy pixel sm is derived from coarse microwave based product disaggregation where gridded meteorological measurements are provided as inputs mainland china is selected as the study area to obtain all sky sm at the spatial resolution of 0 05 over the period from august to october in 2017 a preliminary comparison of the estimated all sky sm with the china meteorological administration land data assimilation system cldas derived sm product at the same spatial resolution is conducted to assess the proposed approach results indicate that the two datasets show similar spatial patterns throughout mainland china moreover the estimated sm over 300 random pixels correlates well with the cldas product with rmse ranging from 0 070 to 0 083 m3 m3 and a slight bias varying from 0 001 to 0 011 m3 m3 on six selected days the present study therefore successfully provides a framework for the retrieval of all sky sm content from currently available satellite products keywords soil moisture all sky optical thermal infrared microwave 1 introduction soil moisture sm is highly involved in a number of fundamental agricultural activities and hydrological processes such as precipitation irrigation scheduling yield forecast evapotranspiration and runoff norman et al 1995 hossain and anagnostou 2005 wang et al 2017 berg and sheffield 2018 crow et al 2018 during the past decades a variety of algorithms have been proposed for monitoring the high spatiotemporal variability of land surface sm with remotely sensed observations moran et al 1994 lee and anagnostou 2004 carlson 2007 leng et al 2016 ma et al 2017 amazirh et al 2018 specifically enormous progress has been achieved for estimating sm via microwave emission and backscatter due to the fact that significant dielectric contrast occurs between that of liquid water 80 and dry soil 4 schmugge et al 1974 for an example to obtain globally continuous sm datasets two dedicated missions namely the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos and soil moisture active passive smap have been lunched in 2009 and 2015 by the european space agency esa and national aeronautics and space administration nasa respectively currently a series of sm products have been developed on the basis of the smos and smap observations moreover because no remote sensing technique utilizing a single electromagnetic region or approach can by itself satisfy the accuracy spatial and temporal resolution requirements for agricultural and hydrological applications aghakouchak and nakhjiri 2012 aghakouchak et al 2015 several blended sm products by merging the smos or smap and other available microwave observations are also produced at present two typical blended sm products are the climate change initiative cci and soil moisture operational products system smops which exhibit either longer data period or better spatial coverage than other sm products derived from single mission nevertheless most of these microwave sm product characters a relatively coarse spatial resolution 25 km whereas sm data at moderate spatial resolutions 1 10 km are commonly required for regional watershed and local applications crow et al 2010 to this end various disaggregation methods have been proposed for meeting the spatial requirements these methods can be roughly categorized into three types based on different spatial data as follows a optical thermal infrared data chauhan et al 2003 merlin et al 2008 piles et al 2011 zhao and li 2013 peng et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 b radar data narayan and lakshmi 2008 rüdiger et al 2016 and c surface attributes wilson et al 2005 montzka et al 2018 among these approaches disaggregation of coarse microwave sm products with fine spatial resolution optical thermal infrared images has received considerable attention in recent years specifically the most commonly used algorithm is the one using remotely sensed vegetation index vi and land surface temperature lst denoted as t s vi hereafter feature space however it is notable that most of the currently available optical thermal infrared based disaggregation methods can be used only for cloud free conditions hence although the microwave missions have the ability to penetrate clouds and obtain all sky sm in theory deriving all sky sm maps at fine spatial resolution using the traditional optical thermal infrared based disaggregation methods is still an enormous challenge in contrast although a number of algorithms have been developed to estimate sm content directly by optical thermal infrared images at fine spatial resolution over clear sky at present moran et al 1994 carlson 2007 leng et al 2016 the remaining concern is that sm content at the same fine spatial resolution over cloudy conditions is difficult to determine directly with most of the currently available algorithms making it a huge challenge to obtain all sky sm maps in regional scale using the single optical thermal infrared observations only currently although several sm related key land surface parameters i e net surface shortwave radiation net surface longwave radiation under both clear and cloudy conditions can be derived directly from satellite observations at fine spatial resolution tang et al 2006 zhou et al 2013 to our best knowledge as so far no practical approaches have been proposed to estimate sm directly from fine spatial resolution satellite observations under cloudy sky conditions in consideration of the penetrability of microwave though clouds it is promising that sm under cloudy conditions can be derived from microwave measurements providing an unique opportunity to generate all sky sm data at high spatial resolution in conjunction with sm retrievals from optical thermal infrared observations over clear sky conditions in an early study a preliminary attempt has been proposed to estimate sm from meteorological data derived surface and aerodynamic resistance over cloudy pixels following the work by carlson 2007 and subsequently to obtain all sky sm from the combination of optical thermal infrared retrievals over clear sky pixels and those from meteorological data derived sm over cloudy pixels leng et al 2017 although appears feasible to determine sm using meteorological data derived resistance parameters over cloudy pixels it is more expected that sm at fine spatial resolution under cloudy conditions can be derived from satellite microwave observations rather than meteorological data since microwave has the ability to penetrate clouds and obtain sm in such conditions in theory to this end the objective of the present study is to further explore the method for generating all sky sm data from currently available optical thermal infrared and microwave observations specifically the algorithm for the disaggregation of coarse microwave sm product over cloudy conditions where optical thermal infrared measurements are not available is to be primarily investigated furthermore because the traditional t s vi method is available only at a limited spatial domain that has relatively homogenous meteorological conditions the present study aims to investigate the feasibility of a novel pixel to pixel scheme of the t s vi trapezoid over a national scale with the proposed framework the disaggregated microwave sm over cloudy conditions and optical thermal infrared sm retrievals over clear sky pixels will be used to produce all sky sm maps over large regions the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the study area and data used in the investigation are described shortly section 3 details the methodologies for the determination of soil moisture content over clear sky and cloudy pixels section 4 and section 5 are results and discussion respectively the conclusions are given in section 6 2 study area and data 2 1 study area mainland china is selected as the study area to generate the all sky sm maps the territory of the study area lies between 18 54 n and 73 135 e resulting in significantly varying landscapes across its vast width and length fig 1 as seen from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis derived land use types data in fig 1 grasslands croplands cropland natural vegetation mosaic and barren or sparsely vegetated are the major land use types over the study area due to the multi landscapes and the highly complex topography the climate in mainland china differs from region to region for an example the northeastern china features the continental monsoon climate whereas the southwestern china exhibits the plateau climate all these heterogeneities make it imperative to generate spatially complete sm data with respect to better understand the water and mass exchange between the land and the atmosphere 2 2 remote sensing data 2 2 1 optical thermal images the modis is a key instrument aboard both the terra and aqua satellites it has the ability viewing the entire earth s surface every 1 to 2 days and acquiring data in 36 spectral bands from nearly 0 6 to 14 4 μm based on the modis observations a number of land atmosphere ocean and cryosphere products have been developed for various applications including environment monitoring and global change studies to determinate all sky sm content over the study area several modis land products including lst mod11b1 vegetation properties mod13c2 and mod15a2 and land surface reflectance mod09a1 are selected as primary inputs data in present study concretely the pre processing of these products including determination of broadband emissivity from two single thermal infrared channels band 31 and 32 generation of land surface albedo from seven optical bands band 1 to 7 and obtaining of fractional vegetation cover fvc from vegetation properties leng et al 2017 finally all these modis data are resampled to a same spatial resolution of 0 05 following the output size of the all sky sm data 2 2 2 microwave data the smops has been operationally running at national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa since 2012 aiming at increasing spatial and temporal coverage of the satellite sm observations and providing blended analysis from all the individual satellite microwave sm products for operational use smops imports sm retrievals from other satellite sensors and merger them with the output from the single channel retrieval scr algorithm using global land data assimilation system gldas modeled output a major advantage is that the latest smops v3 0 product has almost full land coverage making it possible to fill nearly all the gaps remaining by optical thermal infrared observations specifically the smops v3 0 sm product has significantly better spatial coverage than other currently available sm products at present in this study the smops v3 0 sm data is used to obtain sm at fine spatial resolution with the disaggregation procedure currently the daily smops product is stored as the netcdf file format and the archive period of record begins in march 2017 the 0 25 smops sm product is obtained from the comprehensive large array data stewardship system class website https www avl class noaa gov saa products search sub id 0 datatype family smops 2 3 meteorological forcing and sm data to estimate the all sky sm and assess the feasibility of the proposed approach the china meteorological administration land data assimilation system cldas derived meteorological forcing data and sm product are used in present study the latest cldas version 2 0 cldas v2 0 datasets are selected in the present study to derive all sky sm specifically the territory of these products lies between 0 60 n and 70 150 e with a spatial resolution of 0 0625 and a temporal interval of one hour it notes that only the data after january 2017 can be obtained at present from the official website at china meteorological data service center website http data cma cn site index html currently cldas v2 0 provides two kinds of data namely the real time and near real time products in the present study near real time meteorological forcing elements including air temperature specific humidity wind speed and solar radiation at 11 00 beijing time are obtained and provided as input data for the determination of all sky sm besides near real time sm product at a depth of 5 cm is selected to assess the estimated sm all the cldas data are resampled to 0 05 in present study to accord with the spatial resolution of the modis data 2 4 soil texture data to determine volumetric sm content from remotely sensed proxy soil hydraulic parameters are commonly required following the previous studies saxton and rawls 2006 leng et al 2017 clay and sand percentages in the soil column are implemented to predict the field capacity and wilting point for each grid cell for this purpose the soil texture map in china with a spatial resolution of 1 km is obtained from the official website of the land atmosphere interaction research group http globalchange bnu edu cn research soil2 specifically the clay and sand maps are firstly resampled to the spatial resolution of 0 05 in accord with the spatial resolution of the modis data and then to estimate field capacity and wilting point 3 method it should be noted that the present study aims to obtain all sky sm at fine spatial resolution 0 05 from the synergistic use of modis and smops data to obtain all sky sm maps over the study area the following definitions of the satellite pixels are primarily determined according to the situations of the modis and smops data specifically because one smops sm pixel 0 25 contains 5 5 resampled modis pixels 0 05 in the present study all the pixels for estimating sm are divided into three categories i e clear sky pixels cloudy pixels and remaining pixels the clear sky pixels are the ones with valid modis lst values while cloudy pixels are those without valid modis lst but have valid smops values besides the remaining pixels are the ones without neither modis lst nor smops values it notes that because the smops product reveals almost full land coverage the remaining pixels take only a little percentage of the total pixels specifically the following three sub sections are to expound respective methods for the determination of sm content over the aforementioned three pixel categories 3 1 microwave sm disaggregation using meteorological forcing data derived proxy over cloudy pixels for the cloudy pixels sm is determined from the disaggregation of the coarse microwave data in a previous study merlin et al 2012 proposed a practical method to obtain sm at fine spatial resolution from the disaggregation of coarse microwave sm product this method introduced a sm proxy namely the modis derived soil evaporative efficiency see as a link to disaggregate the 40 km smos sm product to a fine spatial resolution of 1 km in a recent study a derivation of the original disaggregation scheme was made using the temperature vegetation dryness index tvdi as input to simplify the calculation of disaggregated sm tagesson et al 2018 the new equation can be written as 1 θ θ smops 2 sm smops arccos 1 2 1 tvdi h smops 1 1 2 1 tvdi h 2 1 tvdi h 1 tvdi h smops where θ is disaggregated sm at higher spatial resolution θ smops is the smops sm product at coarse spatial resolution tvdi h is the tvdi at high spatial resolution 1 tvdi h smops is the average 1 tvdi h within a pixel of the smops sm data in present study the smops product is used as the coarse microwave sm data namely the θ smops with a spatial resolution of 0 25 to obtain sm at higher spatial resolution 0 05 with the disaggregation procedure it is evident that thermal infrared based lst is an essential input in eq 1 to obtain the disaggregated sm at fine spatial resolution in theory hence this method is impracticable over cloudy pixels because no valid lst is available in such conditions to this end another sm proxy namely the sm availability m 0 is used as an alternative in the disaggregation procedure in eq 1 for cloudy pixels according to previous studies by carlson 1986 2007 m 0 can be written as the ratio of aerodynamic resistance r a to the aerodynamic resistance plus surface resistance r s as follows 2 m 0 r a r a r s where m 0 refers to sm availability m 0 derived from resistance parameters according to the definitions of m 0 and tvdi carlson 1986 2007 sandholt et al 2002 the dry edge reveals minimum soil water storage indicating a m 0 value of 0 and subsequently a severest drought conditions with a tvdi value of 1 in contrast m 0 at wet edge shows plenty of water storage in soil column hence a m 0 value of 1 and subsequently a tvdi value of 0 should occur in this situation in general a relationship between m 0 and tvdi can be derived over clear sky conditions where lst data is available to constitute the t s vi configuration 3 m 0 tvdi 1 in theory the resistance parameters based m 0 in eq 2 should be equal to that m 0 1 tvdi derived from t s vi trapezoid in eq 3 the only difference is that they are calculated from different perspectives the former one is obtained from the calculation of resistance parameters using meteorological forcing measurements whereas the latter one is determined from the location of the given clear sky pixel within the t s vi configuration using satellite data as a consequence it is feasible to obtain a hypothetical tvdi value over cloudy pixels with the resistance parameters based m 0 even if the lst value is not available for cloudy pixels combining eqs 1 3 can yield 4 θ θ smops 2 θ smops arccos 1 2 m 0 smops 1 1 2 m 0 2 m 0 m 0 smops where m 0 smops is the average m 0 value within a pixel of the coarse smops sm data in present study surface resistance r s is recognized as a function to climatological resistance r c following the method proposed by todorovic 1999 as follows 5 a r s r c 2 b r s r c c 0 where a b and c are coefficients it notes that the climatological resistance r c and the coefficients can be derived from aerodynamic resistance r a and meteorological forcing data as for the aerodynamic resistance wind speed u is commonly used to calculate r a as follows 6 r a ln z u d z om ψ m ln z t d z oh ψ h k 2 u where k is the von karman constant can be taken as 0 41 z u and z t are the heights for wind speed and air temperature observations m respectively ψ m and ψ h are the stability corrections for heat and momentum respectively z om and z oh are the surface momentum roughness height and the roughness height for surface heat transfer m respectively d is the zero plane displacement height m it notes that the method to determine resistance parameters r a and r s generally requires several necessary meteorological forcing data i e wind speed solar radiation and vapor pressure deficit of the air and no lst value is necessary indicating that m 0 for cloudy pixels can be derived if only these meteorological forcing data can be obtained a detailed description on the determination of these resistance parameters can be referred to several previous studies brutsaert 1982 norman et al 1995 todorovic 1999 3 2 pixel to pixel determination of sm over clear sky pixels the t s vi trapezoid scheme was firstly proposed by moran et al 1994 to estimate sm over partially vegetated areas following a previously developed theory namely the crop water stress index cwsi that was originally designed for detecting plant water stress in fully vegetated conditions idso et al 1981 jackson et al 1981 the t s vi trapezoid scheme provides a feasible approach for deriving sm at fine spatial resolution from optical thermal infrared satellite images and less meteorological forcing data however it is known that the traditional t s vi method is only feasible within a limited spatial domain where meteorological conditions should be relatively homogenous hence it is difficult to apply the traditional t s vi method for deriving sm over large regions to this end the present study aims to further investigate the feasibility of a novel pixel to pixel scheme of the t s vi trapezoid proposed in an earlier study leng et al 2017 a major advantage of the pixel to pixel scheme of the t s vi trapezoid is that the traditional required uniform weather conditions are not necessary and the method can be applied freely regardless of the size of the study area specifically a hypothetical t s vi trapezoid exists for each of the clear sky pixels given that the unique weather conditions for this given clear sky pixel are known fig 2 depicts a hypothetical t s vi trapezoid space for a given clear sky pixel e g pixel p with a known lst of t s and fvc of f in this trapezoid the four lst values under extreme conditions e g t s max at point a t c max at point b t c min at point c and t s min at point d can be derived from energy balance principle following the work by moran et al 1994 specifically for each modis clear sky pixel it belongs to a known t s vi trapezoid in theory due to the fact that a unique meteorological condition for this clear sky pixel can be obtained from the gridded cldas products with the same spatial resolution in present study with the t s vi trapezoid m 0 of the given satellite clear sky pixel e g pixel p shown in fig 2 can be determined as 7 m 0 mp mn t c max t s max f t s max t s t c max t s max f t s max t c min t s min f t s min where mp and mn are the distances between the points m and p and the points m and n respectively because sm at the point m and point n are determined as wilting point and field capacity respectively volumetric sm content at point p is derived as 8 θ m 0 θ fc θ wt θ wt where θ is volumetric smcontent m3 m3 θ fc and θ wt are soil field capacity m3 m3 and wilting point m3 m3 respectively it notes that the method to determine m 0 with eq 7 can be used for clear sky pixels only due to the necessary input of the pixel lst value moreover except for the remote sensing data this method only requires four meteorological elements including air temperature specific humidity wind speed and solar radiation a detailed description on the determination of the four extreme lst values within the pixel to pixel scheme of the t s vi trapezoid over clear sky pixels can be referred to the previous works by moran et al 1994 and leng et al 2017 3 3 determination of sm over remaining pixels because no valid modis lst or smops values are available for the remaining pixels direct optical thermal sm retrieval or disaggregation of coarse sm product is infeasible in a previous study m 0 was defined as the ratio of aerodynamic resistance to the sum of aerodynamic plus surface resistance shown in eq 2 and was also expressed as the function to soil hydraulic parameters carlson 2007 sandholt et al 2002 as follows 9 m 0 θ θ wt θ fc θ wt hence combining eqs 2 and 9 volumetric sm content over the remaining pixels can be obtained from the meteorological data derived m 0 and soil hydraulic parameters as follows 10 θ r a r a r s θ fc θ wt θ wt it notes that the method to determine sm content over the remaining pixels only requires soil hydraulic parameters θ fc and θ wt and meteorological forcing data derived resistance parameters r a and r s 4 results 4 1 spatial patterns of all sky sm content over the study area although the optical thermal infrared measurements commonly reveal fine spatial resolution in comparison to passive microwave missions one of the limitations with the optical thermal infrared observations is that they are inherently to be contaminated by clouds resulting in significant gaps for obtaining sm maps over large areas with optical thermal infrared data only fig 3 depicts the resampled 0 05 mod11b1 lst and 0 25 smops sm product over mainland china on every first and fifteenth day from august to october 2017 it is evident from the lst maps that gaps can take considerable rate of the entire pixels over the study area in theory the traditional optical thermal infrared based sm retrieval algorithms are only available for those pixels with valid lst values thus making it nearly impossible to obtain all sky sm maps just using the traditional optical thermal infrared based sm retrieval methods in contrast although with a coarse spatial resolution than thermal infrared images smops sm product reveals better spatial coverage as shown in fig 3 it therefore provides an opportunity to obtain all sky sm maps at a fine spatial resolution e g 0 05 by merging the optical thermal infrared sm retrieval and smpos product with the method described in previous section sm over clear sky cloudy and remaining pixels are determined separately and all sky sm content is finally obtained with the modis observations and smops product fig 4 depicts the estimated all sky sm left side and cldas sm product right side with a spatial resolution of 0 05 on the first and fifteenth days from august to october 2017 it is clear that the estimated all sky sm content exhibits reasonable and similar spatial distribution in accord with the cldas sm product moreover significant dry and wet spatial patterns over north west and south east regions respectively can also be clearly found from the all sky sm maps specifically for each day southern china shows significant higher sm content than that in western china with the driest region occurs around the taklamakan desert areas moreover sm content in the north and northeast parts of china generally exhibit a medium value from both the estimated all sky sm maps and the cldas sm product from this comparison of spatial patterns between the two sm data it can be preliminarily concluded that the estimated all sky sm content reveals reasonable spatial distribution over mainland china a further quantitative assessment of the estimated all sky sm content is to be given in next section 4 2 preliminary comparison of all sky sm with cldas product because no ground in situ sm measurements over the study period are available at present the resampled cldas sm product at a same spatial resolution of 0 05 with a depth of 5 cm is used to preliminarily assess the estimated all sky sm content to evaluate the estimated all sky sm data 300 random pixels are selected across mainland china specially the selected pixels fulfill the following two conditions a slope of the pixel should be less than 10 to ensure a relatively flat surface and b land use types of the pixel should be grasslands croplands cropland natural vegetation mosaic or barren or sparsely vegetated according to the mcd12c1 derived land cover types shown in fig 1 these conditions are generally to guarantee minimum uncertainties in both the estimated all sky sm content and cldas sm product meanwhile these four land use types are known to take a majority of the entire pixels over mainland china thus the condition is generally representative based on the dem derived slope map and land use types of mainland china an equidistant random sampling method is used to determine the 300 random pixels throughout mainland china shown in fig 5 fig 6 depicts the comparison of all sky sm content and cldas sm product for the six days in 2017 it is clear from the results that the scatter plots of the estimated all sky sm content and cldas product are equally distributed around the line 1 1 for the study period with significant coefficient of determination r 2 varying from 0 390 to 0 549 moreover a slight bias from 0 001 to 0 011 m3 m3 with an rmse from 0 070 to 0 083 m3 m3 can be obtained between the two sm datasets for the six days indicating that the two datasets are well correlated although the two sm datasets show some differences in some pixels the overall trend of the sm variation for each day is similar and close all these results reveal that the estimated all sky sm content is generally reliable to further assess the estimated all sky sm pixel to pixel spatial distributions of the rmse and bias between estimated all sky sm and cldas data are produced over the study area fig 7 depicts the two metrics of estimated sm versus cldas sm product for the study area the rmse varies from approximately 0 001 to 0 015 m3 m3 with an average rmse of 0 079 m3 m3 whereas the bias ranges from approximately 0 108 to 0 119 m3 m3 with an average bias of 0 008 m3 m3 as can be seen from the results larger errors normally occur over the forest regions in southwest and northeast china or along the coastline for the north china plain most of the pixels reveal significant better accuracy than other regions with regarding to both rmse and bias 5 discussion 5 1 error analysis due to the lack of in situ sm measurements over the study area and period the assimilative sm product of cldas is used in present study to compare the all sky sm retrieval in the strictest sense this comparison can be treated as an appropriate reference but not the best description on the performance of the all sky sm retrieval nevertheless there are at least two advantages using the cldas sm product to assess the estimated all sky sm content the one is that the spatially continuous cldas product can help to better compare the spatial pattern of the all sky sm over the entire study area the other is that the inconsistency of spatial scale can be avoid due to the same spatial resolution of cldas product and estimated all sky sm maps although the estimated all sky sm maps show generally well correlation and coincident spatial pattern to the cldas sm product several major error sources probably leading to the uncertainties of the all sky sm retrieval should be seriously investigated in ongoing works the primary one is the errors in the direct inputs of the procedure for deriving all sky sm content these main inputs include modis observations smops product and meteorological elements as we known errors probably exist in each of these inputs for an instance error in modis lst is normally reported to be 1 k under ideal conditions according to a previous sensitivity analysis this error can lead to an rmse of 0 010 to 0 021 m3 m3 for clear sky sm retrieval using the proposed method leng et al 2017 hence it is necessary to produce more reliable inputs for the generation of all sky sm maps with the proposed method a second error source can be the mismatch of modis transit time the cldas time and also the smops product time it notes that modis transit time is unfixed within a time window probably 2 h in mainland china for each individual day whereas the cldas data are produced hourly except for these the smops sm product has blended several measurements at different overpass times from microwave sensors to guarantee maximum spatial coverage however these data are the best choices at present to derive all sky sm over mainland china using both optical thermal infrared retrieval and microwave product in general this time mismatch can lead to the inconformity of land surface status and meteorological conditions although the effects of the time mismatch on the all sky sm retrieval have not been further investigated it cannot be neglected in the ongoing work except for these soil hydraulic parameters are also essential for the determination of quantitative sm content however most of the currently available soil texture data are derived from limited soil samples most likely unable to reflect the actual spatial variation of soil especially over large areas meanwhile the most popular methods for converting soil texture to hydraulic parameters e g wilting point and field capacity are still the regression ones which will also cause various uncertainties for the determination of quantitative sm content 5 2 on the determination of sm over cloudy pixels it is known that sm estimation at fine spatial resolution from satellite data over cloudy pixels is a huge challenge at present to our best knowledge as so far disaggregation of coarse microwave based sm products into fine spatial resolution is a practical approach however most of the commonly used disaggregation methods rely on optical thermal infrared observations unavailable in cloudy conditions this contradiction makes it difficult to obtain sm for cloudy pixels at fine spatial resolution from satellite measurements at present in a previous research we have investigated sm estimation from meteorological forcing data derived resistance parameters leng et al 2017 in comparison to the preceding method using meteorological forcing data only a main advantage of the present study is that microwave sm product has been introduced to determine sm at fine spatial resolution over cloudy pixels moreover it should be noted that the meteorological forcing data derived resistance parameters are essential inputs for both of these two methods to obtain sm content over cloudy pixels for the previous approach sm content is expressed as a simple linear function to sm availability where the soil texture derived field capacity and wilting point are used to ensure the variation of sm content within these maximum and minimum values in the present study the meteorological forcing data derived resistance parameters are used as a proxy to disaggregate the coarse microwave sm product into fine spatial resolution it notes that the effect of soil texture on the final sm disaggregation with the proposed method is implicitly contained in the smops data since soil texture map is one of the essential parameters to produce the microwave sm product fig 8 depicts the scatters of the two methods for the determination of sm content versus the cldas sm product over cloudy pixels on the six selected days in 2017 it notes that the disaggregation procedure and the resistance based method are marked as method i and method ii in fig 8 it is evident from the results that method i reveal significant better consistency with the cldas sm product than method ii for all the six days the range of rmse for method i and method ii are 0 068 to 0 088 m3 m3 and 0 080 to 0 103 m3 m3 respectively in addition variations of bias of the method i and method ii are 0 008 to 0 020 m3 m3 and 0 049 to 0 002 m3 m3 respectively indicating that method i is relatively stable than method ii moreover a significant underestimation of sm content can be found in method ii for all the six days these preliminary comparisons reveal that the disaggregation of coarse microwave sm product can obtain better sm at fine spatial resolution than the resistance based method based on these comparisons it is most likely to indicate that the proposed method exhibits certain superiority than the previous procedure to obtain sm data at higher spatial resolution over cloudy pixels however comprehensive validation of the proposed method should be implemented with more reliable ground in situ sm measurements in the ongoing work to further underline the advantages of the proposed method 5 3 on the determination of sm over clear sky pixels previous section generally reveals that the disaggregation procedure can obtain better sm than the resistance based method at higher spatial resolution over cloudy pixels because the disaggregation procedure is able to determine sm over clear sky pixels in theory it is also necessary to assess the disaggregation procedure and t s vi trapezoid method for the estimation of sm fig 9 depicts the scatters of the t s vi trapezoid retrieval denoted as method i and the disaggregation procedure derived sm versus the cldas sm product over clear sky pixels on the six selected days in 2017 it is evident from the results that the t s vi trapezoid retrieval method reveals significant better consistency with the cldas sm product than the disaggregation procedure derived sm for all the six days rmses of the t s vi trapezoid method range from 0 067 to 0 077 m3 m3 whereas a larger rmse variation from 0 078 to 0 086 m3 m3 is obtained for the disaggregation procedure in addition variations of bias for the two methods are 0 011 to 0 010 m3 m3 and 0 035 to 0 047 m3 m3 respectively indicating that the t s vi trapezoid retrieval method is relatively stable than the disaggregation method these preliminary comparisons show that better sm estimates at higher spatial resolution can be obtained from direct retrieval using optical thermal infrared observations than using the disaggregation method hence although the disaggregation procedure is able to obtain sm at higher spatial resolution over all sky conditions the direct retrieval of sm from optical thermal infrared observations is implemented for the clear sky pixels in present study 5 4 on the coarse sm product selected in present study with the rapid developments of remote sensing technology and spatial modeling a number of satellite derived modeled assimilated and reanalysis sm products at global scale are available at present currently the smops and cci are the two main globally blended sm products produced by several available active and passive microwave observations except for these two blended products there are also many other products derived from individual microwave sensor such as the smos the smap the advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr2 and the advanced scatterometer ascat however a number of studies have highlighted that the blended products reveal better accuracy than those derived from single satellite sensor dorigo et al 2015 cheng et al 2019 moreover until the time we finished this study by october 2018 the cci products were released for a period from 1978 to 2016 only hence no cci data were available that can match the meteorological data cldas v2 0 available from january 2017 to present and the study period of the present study august to october 2017 at the meanwhile the latest version of the smops data v3 0 was released available from march 2017 to present specifically it is also noted that the blended smops data can not only exhibit remarkable accuracy but also better improve the performances of land surface model simulations than individual sm retrievals nair and indu 2016 yin et al 2018 hence the smops product was selected as the coarse sm data in present study nevertheless future study can also take into consideration of more satellite sm products over different study periods and regions except for the remote sensing sm products several other global sm products such as the gldas the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam the modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications merra and the fifth generation of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts atmospheric reanalysis era5 are also widely used datasets and can be regarded as the potential alternatives for present study to obtain sm under cloudy condition however these sm products are generally the reanalysis or assimilated sm data rather than remote sensing products while the main idea of the present study is to obtain sm at high spatial resolution from satellite observations both optical thermal infrared and microwave moreover it should be noted that remote sensing based sm products commonly exhibit higher accuracy than the reanalysis data and land data assimilation system simulations following previous studies wen et al 2014 stillman et al 2016 nevertheless except for the satellite sm products both the reanalysis and assimilated sm datasets are also feasible data sources for obtaining sm over cloudy pixels in future developments 5 5 advantages and disadvantages of the proposed method the present study has provided a practical framework for the obtaining of all sky sm maps at fine spatial resolution from the synergetic use of optical thermal infrared and microwave measurements in general all the main inputs of the proposed approach are quality controlled satellite and assimilative products that can be freely acquired at present which can ensure the accuracy of the estimated all sky sm to a certain extent a major advantage of the proposed method is that microwave sm product has been used to determine sm content for cloudy pixels at finer spatial resolution through disaggregation method compared to previous study that sm over cloudy pixels primarily obtained from meteorological forcing data derived resistance parameters only utilization of microwave sm product for the determination of sm content over cloud pixels reveal significant superiority moreover the disaggregation method introduces meteorological forcing data derived sm availability as the proxy making it possible to disaggregate coarse microwave sm data under cloudy conditions because the traditional t s vi feature space based disaggregation approaches are only available over clear sky pixels the present study seems to have extended the traditional applications from both the spatial patterns and comparison between the estimated all sky sm content and the cldas sm product nevertheless the feasibility of the proposed method should be further investigated with in situ measurements in the ongoing work furthermore it notes that the traditional spatial information based feature space normally requires uniform weather conditions making it difficult to apply over large areas by using the gridded meteorological forcing data at the same high spatial resolution to the modis images the novel pixel to pixel scheme of the t s vi feature space can be implemented free regardless of the both the size and the underlying surfaces of the study area providing an opportunity to map sm over large regions despite these because thermal infrared and microwave missions have different sensing depths it is most likely that the estimated all sky sm maps representative sm conditions at different soil layers in general thermal infrared signals can reflect sm conditions under several centimeters whereas microwave sm product usually with a much shallower surfaces this is also the reason that we insist on retaining optical thermal infrared sm retrieval over clear sky pixels for the all sky sm maps rather than the disaggregation of coarse microwave sm for all pixels although sm content in different layers probably has strong internal connections the present study cannot provide all sky sm content at a same soil depth it is crucial in the ongoing work if the microwave based sm content at shallow surface can be transformed to the deeper depth with respected to the thermal infrared based sm data 6 conclusions the present study provides a practical framework for the determination of all sky sm maps from the synergistic use of currently available optical thermal infrared sm retrieval and microwave sm product in present study sm over clear sky and cloudy pixels are estimated separately for clear sky pixels a novel pixel to pixel scheme of the t s vi feature space method is used to determine sm content while sm over cloudy pixels are derived from disaggregation of the coarse microwave sm product it notes that the gridded meteorological elements are used in both the clear sky and cloudy pixels to obtain sm content at fine spatial resolution a preliminary comparison with the assimilated cldas sm product shows that the estimated all sky sm maps have reasonable spatial patterns for the study period for the 300 random pixels the estimated all sky sm correlates well with the cldas product with rmse ranging from 0 070 to 0 083 m3 m3 and a slight bias varying from 0 001 to 0 011 m3 m3 over the study period these results suggest that the proposed framework is generally feasible for the obtaining of reliable all sky sm content at fine spatial resolution specifically the method to obtain sm over cloudy pixels combining microwave measurements and meteorological forcing data in present study shows certain superiority to a previous approach using meteorological forcing data only in summary the present study successfully achieved all sky sm content retrieval from currently available satellite products to assess the proposed approach comprehensively further work can be focused on implementing the proposed method over long period and further exploring potential applications such as the investigation of sm dynamic and drought events monitoring declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared

6030,soil moisture sm is highly involved in a number of fundamental agricultural activities and hydrological processes currently most of the available microwave sm products are too coarse to be used in these relevant applications at regional or watershed scales whereas optical thermal infrared measurements are valid over clear sky conditions only the present study aims to provide a novel framework for the retrieval of all sky surface sm at fine spatial resolution synergistically using optical thermal infrared and microwave measurements in this framework sm for each clear sky pixel is determined from a novel pixel to pixel scheme of land surface temperature vegetation index t s vi trapezoid whereas cloudy pixel sm is derived from coarse microwave based product disaggregation where gridded meteorological measurements are provided as inputs mainland china is selected as the study area to obtain all sky sm at the spatial resolution of 0 05 over the period from august to october in 2017 a preliminary comparison of the estimated all sky sm with the china meteorological administration land data assimilation system cldas derived sm product at the same spatial resolution is conducted to assess the proposed approach results indicate that the two datasets show similar spatial patterns throughout mainland china moreover the estimated sm over 300 random pixels correlates well with the cldas product with rmse ranging from 0 070 to 0 083 m3 m3 and a slight bias varying from 0 001 to 0 011 m3 m3 on six selected days the present study therefore successfully provides a framework for the retrieval of all sky sm content from currently available satellite products keywords soil moisture all sky optical thermal infrared microwave 1 introduction soil moisture sm is highly involved in a number of fundamental agricultural activities and hydrological processes such as precipitation irrigation scheduling yield forecast evapotranspiration and runoff norman et al 1995 hossain and anagnostou 2005 wang et al 2017 berg and sheffield 2018 crow et al 2018 during the past decades a variety of algorithms have been proposed for monitoring the high spatiotemporal variability of land surface sm with remotely sensed observations moran et al 1994 lee and anagnostou 2004 carlson 2007 leng et al 2016 ma et al 2017 amazirh et al 2018 specifically enormous progress has been achieved for estimating sm via microwave emission and backscatter due to the fact that significant dielectric contrast occurs between that of liquid water 80 and dry soil 4 schmugge et al 1974 for an example to obtain globally continuous sm datasets two dedicated missions namely the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos and soil moisture active passive smap have been lunched in 2009 and 2015 by the european space agency esa and national aeronautics and space administration nasa respectively currently a series of sm products have been developed on the basis of the smos and smap observations moreover because no remote sensing technique utilizing a single electromagnetic region or approach can by itself satisfy the accuracy spatial and temporal resolution requirements for agricultural and hydrological applications aghakouchak and nakhjiri 2012 aghakouchak et al 2015 several blended sm products by merging the smos or smap and other available microwave observations are also produced at present two typical blended sm products are the climate change initiative cci and soil moisture operational products system smops which exhibit either longer data period or better spatial coverage than other sm products derived from single mission nevertheless most of these microwave sm product characters a relatively coarse spatial resolution 25 km whereas sm data at moderate spatial resolutions 1 10 km are commonly required for regional watershed and local applications crow et al 2010 to this end various disaggregation methods have been proposed for meeting the spatial requirements these methods can be roughly categorized into three types based on different spatial data as follows a optical thermal infrared data chauhan et al 2003 merlin et al 2008 piles et al 2011 zhao and li 2013 peng et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 b radar data narayan and lakshmi 2008 rüdiger et al 2016 and c surface attributes wilson et al 2005 montzka et al 2018 among these approaches disaggregation of coarse microwave sm products with fine spatial resolution optical thermal infrared images has received considerable attention in recent years specifically the most commonly used algorithm is the one using remotely sensed vegetation index vi and land surface temperature lst denoted as t s vi hereafter feature space however it is notable that most of the currently available optical thermal infrared based disaggregation methods can be used only for cloud free conditions hence although the microwave missions have the ability to penetrate clouds and obtain all sky sm in theory deriving all sky sm maps at fine spatial resolution using the traditional optical thermal infrared based disaggregation methods is still an enormous challenge in contrast although a number of algorithms have been developed to estimate sm content directly by optical thermal infrared images at fine spatial resolution over clear sky at present moran et al 1994 carlson 2007 leng et al 2016 the remaining concern is that sm content at the same fine spatial resolution over cloudy conditions is difficult to determine directly with most of the currently available algorithms making it a huge challenge to obtain all sky sm maps in regional scale using the single optical thermal infrared observations only currently although several sm related key land surface parameters i e net surface shortwave radiation net surface longwave radiation under both clear and cloudy conditions can be derived directly from satellite observations at fine spatial resolution tang et al 2006 zhou et al 2013 to our best knowledge as so far no practical approaches have been proposed to estimate sm directly from fine spatial resolution satellite observations under cloudy sky conditions in consideration of the penetrability of microwave though clouds it is promising that sm under cloudy conditions can be derived from microwave measurements providing an unique opportunity to generate all sky sm data at high spatial resolution in conjunction with sm retrievals from optical thermal infrared observations over clear sky conditions in an early study a preliminary attempt has been proposed to estimate sm from meteorological data derived surface and aerodynamic resistance over cloudy pixels following the work by carlson 2007 and subsequently to obtain all sky sm from the combination of optical thermal infrared retrievals over clear sky pixels and those from meteorological data derived sm over cloudy pixels leng et al 2017 although appears feasible to determine sm using meteorological data derived resistance parameters over cloudy pixels it is more expected that sm at fine spatial resolution under cloudy conditions can be derived from satellite microwave observations rather than meteorological data since microwave has the ability to penetrate clouds and obtain sm in such conditions in theory to this end the objective of the present study is to further explore the method for generating all sky sm data from currently available optical thermal infrared and microwave observations specifically the algorithm for the disaggregation of coarse microwave sm product over cloudy conditions where optical thermal infrared measurements are not available is to be primarily investigated furthermore because the traditional t s vi method is available only at a limited spatial domain that has relatively homogenous meteorological conditions the present study aims to investigate the feasibility of a novel pixel to pixel scheme of the t s vi trapezoid over a national scale with the proposed framework the disaggregated microwave sm over cloudy conditions and optical thermal infrared sm retrievals over clear sky pixels will be used to produce all sky sm maps over large regions the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the study area and data used in the investigation are described shortly section 3 details the methodologies for the determination of soil moisture content over clear sky and cloudy pixels section 4 and section 5 are results and discussion respectively the conclusions are given in section 6 2 study area and data 2 1 study area mainland china is selected as the study area to generate the all sky sm maps the territory of the study area lies between 18 54 n and 73 135 e resulting in significantly varying landscapes across its vast width and length fig 1 as seen from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis derived land use types data in fig 1 grasslands croplands cropland natural vegetation mosaic and barren or sparsely vegetated are the major land use types over the study area due to the multi landscapes and the highly complex topography the climate in mainland china differs from region to region for an example the northeastern china features the continental monsoon climate whereas the southwestern china exhibits the plateau climate all these heterogeneities make it imperative to generate spatially complete sm data with respect to better understand the water and mass exchange between the land and the atmosphere 2 2 remote sensing data 2 2 1 optical thermal images the modis is a key instrument aboard both the terra and aqua satellites it has the ability viewing the entire earth s surface every 1 to 2 days and acquiring data in 36 spectral bands from nearly 0 6 to 14 4 μm based on the modis observations a number of land atmosphere ocean and cryosphere products have been developed for various applications including environment monitoring and global change studies to determinate all sky sm content over the study area several modis land products including lst mod11b1 vegetation properties mod13c2 and mod15a2 and land surface reflectance mod09a1 are selected as primary inputs data in present study concretely the pre processing of these products including determination of broadband emissivity from two single thermal infrared channels band 31 and 32 generation of land surface albedo from seven optical bands band 1 to 7 and obtaining of fractional vegetation cover fvc from vegetation properties leng et al 2017 finally all these modis data are resampled to a same spatial resolution of 0 05 following the output size of the all sky sm data 2 2 2 microwave data the smops has been operationally running at national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa since 2012 aiming at increasing spatial and temporal coverage of the satellite sm observations and providing blended analysis from all the individual satellite microwave sm products for operational use smops imports sm retrievals from other satellite sensors and merger them with the output from the single channel retrieval scr algorithm using global land data assimilation system gldas modeled output a major advantage is that the latest smops v3 0 product has almost full land coverage making it possible to fill nearly all the gaps remaining by optical thermal infrared observations specifically the smops v3 0 sm product has significantly better spatial coverage than other currently available sm products at present in this study the smops v3 0 sm data is used to obtain sm at fine spatial resolution with the disaggregation procedure currently the daily smops product is stored as the netcdf file format and the archive period of record begins in march 2017 the 0 25 smops sm product is obtained from the comprehensive large array data stewardship system class website https www avl class noaa gov saa products search sub id 0 datatype family smops 2 3 meteorological forcing and sm data to estimate the all sky sm and assess the feasibility of the proposed approach the china meteorological administration land data assimilation system cldas derived meteorological forcing data and sm product are used in present study the latest cldas version 2 0 cldas v2 0 datasets are selected in the present study to derive all sky sm specifically the territory of these products lies between 0 60 n and 70 150 e with a spatial resolution of 0 0625 and a temporal interval of one hour it notes that only the data after january 2017 can be obtained at present from the official website at china meteorological data service center website http data cma cn site index html currently cldas v2 0 provides two kinds of data namely the real time and near real time products in the present study near real time meteorological forcing elements including air temperature specific humidity wind speed and solar radiation at 11 00 beijing time are obtained and provided as input data for the determination of all sky sm besides near real time sm product at a depth of 5 cm is selected to assess the estimated sm all the cldas data are resampled to 0 05 in present study to accord with the spatial resolution of the modis data 2 4 soil texture data to determine volumetric sm content from remotely sensed proxy soil hydraulic parameters are commonly required following the previous studies saxton and rawls 2006 leng et al 2017 clay and sand percentages in the soil column are implemented to predict the field capacity and wilting point for each grid cell for this purpose the soil texture map in china with a spatial resolution of 1 km is obtained from the official website of the land atmosphere interaction research group http globalchange bnu edu cn research soil2 specifically the clay and sand maps are firstly resampled to the spatial resolution of 0 05 in accord with the spatial resolution of the modis data and then to estimate field capacity and wilting point 3 method it should be noted that the present study aims to obtain all sky sm at fine spatial resolution 0 05 from the synergistic use of modis and smops data to obtain all sky sm maps over the study area the following definitions of the satellite pixels are primarily determined according to the situations of the modis and smops data specifically because one smops sm pixel 0 25 contains 5 5 resampled modis pixels 0 05 in the present study all the pixels for estimating sm are divided into three categories i e clear sky pixels cloudy pixels and remaining pixels the clear sky pixels are the ones with valid modis lst values while cloudy pixels are those without valid modis lst but have valid smops values besides the remaining pixels are the ones without neither modis lst nor smops values it notes that because the smops product reveals almost full land coverage the remaining pixels take only a little percentage of the total pixels specifically the following three sub sections are to expound respective methods for the determination of sm content over the aforementioned three pixel categories 3 1 microwave sm disaggregation using meteorological forcing data derived proxy over cloudy pixels for the cloudy pixels sm is determined from the disaggregation of the coarse microwave data in a previous study merlin et al 2012 proposed a practical method to obtain sm at fine spatial resolution from the disaggregation of coarse microwave sm product this method introduced a sm proxy namely the modis derived soil evaporative efficiency see as a link to disaggregate the 40 km smos sm product to a fine spatial resolution of 1 km in a recent study a derivation of the original disaggregation scheme was made using the temperature vegetation dryness index tvdi as input to simplify the calculation of disaggregated sm tagesson et al 2018 the new equation can be written as 1 θ θ smops 2 sm smops arccos 1 2 1 tvdi h smops 1 1 2 1 tvdi h 2 1 tvdi h 1 tvdi h smops where θ is disaggregated sm at higher spatial resolution θ smops is the smops sm product at coarse spatial resolution tvdi h is the tvdi at high spatial resolution 1 tvdi h smops is the average 1 tvdi h within a pixel of the smops sm data in present study the smops product is used as the coarse microwave sm data namely the θ smops with a spatial resolution of 0 25 to obtain sm at higher spatial resolution 0 05 with the disaggregation procedure it is evident that thermal infrared based lst is an essential input in eq 1 to obtain the disaggregated sm at fine spatial resolution in theory hence this method is impracticable over cloudy pixels because no valid lst is available in such conditions to this end another sm proxy namely the sm availability m 0 is used as an alternative in the disaggregation procedure in eq 1 for cloudy pixels according to previous studies by carlson 1986 2007 m 0 can be written as the ratio of aerodynamic resistance r a to the aerodynamic resistance plus surface resistance r s as follows 2 m 0 r a r a r s where m 0 refers to sm availability m 0 derived from resistance parameters according to the definitions of m 0 and tvdi carlson 1986 2007 sandholt et al 2002 the dry edge reveals minimum soil water storage indicating a m 0 value of 0 and subsequently a severest drought conditions with a tvdi value of 1 in contrast m 0 at wet edge shows plenty of water storage in soil column hence a m 0 value of 1 and subsequently a tvdi value of 0 should occur in this situation in general a relationship between m 0 and tvdi can be derived over clear sky conditions where lst data is available to constitute the t s vi configuration 3 m 0 tvdi 1 in theory the resistance parameters based m 0 in eq 2 should be equal to that m 0 1 tvdi derived from t s vi trapezoid in eq 3 the only difference is that they are calculated from different perspectives the former one is obtained from the calculation of resistance parameters using meteorological forcing measurements whereas the latter one is determined from the location of the given clear sky pixel within the t s vi configuration using satellite data as a consequence it is feasible to obtain a hypothetical tvdi value over cloudy pixels with the resistance parameters based m 0 even if the lst value is not available for cloudy pixels combining eqs 1 3 can yield 4 θ θ smops 2 θ smops arccos 1 2 m 0 smops 1 1 2 m 0 2 m 0 m 0 smops where m 0 smops is the average m 0 value within a pixel of the coarse smops sm data in present study surface resistance r s is recognized as a function to climatological resistance r c following the method proposed by todorovic 1999 as follows 5 a r s r c 2 b r s r c c 0 where a b and c are coefficients it notes that the climatological resistance r c and the coefficients can be derived from aerodynamic resistance r a and meteorological forcing data as for the aerodynamic resistance wind speed u is commonly used to calculate r a as follows 6 r a ln z u d z om ψ m ln z t d z oh ψ h k 2 u where k is the von karman constant can be taken as 0 41 z u and z t are the heights for wind speed and air temperature observations m respectively ψ m and ψ h are the stability corrections for heat and momentum respectively z om and z oh are the surface momentum roughness height and the roughness height for surface heat transfer m respectively d is the zero plane displacement height m it notes that the method to determine resistance parameters r a and r s generally requires several necessary meteorological forcing data i e wind speed solar radiation and vapor pressure deficit of the air and no lst value is necessary indicating that m 0 for cloudy pixels can be derived if only these meteorological forcing data can be obtained a detailed description on the determination of these resistance parameters can be referred to several previous studies brutsaert 1982 norman et al 1995 todorovic 1999 3 2 pixel to pixel determination of sm over clear sky pixels the t s vi trapezoid scheme was firstly proposed by moran et al 1994 to estimate sm over partially vegetated areas following a previously developed theory namely the crop water stress index cwsi that was originally designed for detecting plant water stress in fully vegetated conditions idso et al 1981 jackson et al 1981 the t s vi trapezoid scheme provides a feasible approach for deriving sm at fine spatial resolution from optical thermal infrared satellite images and less meteorological forcing data however it is known that the traditional t s vi method is only feasible within a limited spatial domain where meteorological conditions should be relatively homogenous hence it is difficult to apply the traditional t s vi method for deriving sm over large regions to this end the present study aims to further investigate the feasibility of a novel pixel to pixel scheme of the t s vi trapezoid proposed in an earlier study leng et al 2017 a major advantage of the pixel to pixel scheme of the t s vi trapezoid is that the traditional required uniform weather conditions are not necessary and the method can be applied freely regardless of the size of the study area specifically a hypothetical t s vi trapezoid exists for each of the clear sky pixels given that the unique weather conditions for this given clear sky pixel are known fig 2 depicts a hypothetical t s vi trapezoid space for a given clear sky pixel e g pixel p with a known lst of t s and fvc of f in this trapezoid the four lst values under extreme conditions e g t s max at point a t c max at point b t c min at point c and t s min at point d can be derived from energy balance principle following the work by moran et al 1994 specifically for each modis clear sky pixel it belongs to a known t s vi trapezoid in theory due to the fact that a unique meteorological condition for this clear sky pixel can be obtained from the gridded cldas products with the same spatial resolution in present study with the t s vi trapezoid m 0 of the given satellite clear sky pixel e g pixel p shown in fig 2 can be determined as 7 m 0 mp mn t c max t s max f t s max t s t c max t s max f t s max t c min t s min f t s min where mp and mn are the distances between the points m and p and the points m and n respectively because sm at the point m and point n are determined as wilting point and field capacity respectively volumetric sm content at point p is derived as 8 θ m 0 θ fc θ wt θ wt where θ is volumetric smcontent m3 m3 θ fc and θ wt are soil field capacity m3 m3 and wilting point m3 m3 respectively it notes that the method to determine m 0 with eq 7 can be used for clear sky pixels only due to the necessary input of the pixel lst value moreover except for the remote sensing data this method only requires four meteorological elements including air temperature specific humidity wind speed and solar radiation a detailed description on the determination of the four extreme lst values within the pixel to pixel scheme of the t s vi trapezoid over clear sky pixels can be referred to the previous works by moran et al 1994 and leng et al 2017 3 3 determination of sm over remaining pixels because no valid modis lst or smops values are available for the remaining pixels direct optical thermal sm retrieval or disaggregation of coarse sm product is infeasible in a previous study m 0 was defined as the ratio of aerodynamic resistance to the sum of aerodynamic plus surface resistance shown in eq 2 and was also expressed as the function to soil hydraulic parameters carlson 2007 sandholt et al 2002 as follows 9 m 0 θ θ wt θ fc θ wt hence combining eqs 2 and 9 volumetric sm content over the remaining pixels can be obtained from the meteorological data derived m 0 and soil hydraulic parameters as follows 10 θ r a r a r s θ fc θ wt θ wt it notes that the method to determine sm content over the remaining pixels only requires soil hydraulic parameters θ fc and θ wt and meteorological forcing data derived resistance parameters r a and r s 4 results 4 1 spatial patterns of all sky sm content over the study area although the optical thermal infrared measurements commonly reveal fine spatial resolution in comparison to passive microwave missions one of the limitations with the optical thermal infrared observations is that they are inherently to be contaminated by clouds resulting in significant gaps for obtaining sm maps over large areas with optical thermal infrared data only fig 3 depicts the resampled 0 05 mod11b1 lst and 0 25 smops sm product over mainland china on every first and fifteenth day from august to october 2017 it is evident from the lst maps that gaps can take considerable rate of the entire pixels over the study area in theory the traditional optical thermal infrared based sm retrieval algorithms are only available for those pixels with valid lst values thus making it nearly impossible to obtain all sky sm maps just using the traditional optical thermal infrared based sm retrieval methods in contrast although with a coarse spatial resolution than thermal infrared images smops sm product reveals better spatial coverage as shown in fig 3 it therefore provides an opportunity to obtain all sky sm maps at a fine spatial resolution e g 0 05 by merging the optical thermal infrared sm retrieval and smpos product with the method described in previous section sm over clear sky cloudy and remaining pixels are determined separately and all sky sm content is finally obtained with the modis observations and smops product fig 4 depicts the estimated all sky sm left side and cldas sm product right side with a spatial resolution of 0 05 on the first and fifteenth days from august to october 2017 it is clear that the estimated all sky sm content exhibits reasonable and similar spatial distribution in accord with the cldas sm product moreover significant dry and wet spatial patterns over north west and south east regions respectively can also be clearly found from the all sky sm maps specifically for each day southern china shows significant higher sm content than that in western china with the driest region occurs around the taklamakan desert areas moreover sm content in the north and northeast parts of china generally exhibit a medium value from both the estimated all sky sm maps and the cldas sm product from this comparison of spatial patterns between the two sm data it can be preliminarily concluded that the estimated all sky sm content reveals reasonable spatial distribution over mainland china a further quantitative assessment of the estimated all sky sm content is to be given in next section 4 2 preliminary comparison of all sky sm with cldas product because no ground in situ sm measurements over the study period are available at present the resampled cldas sm product at a same spatial resolution of 0 05 with a depth of 5 cm is used to preliminarily assess the estimated all sky sm content to evaluate the estimated all sky sm data 300 random pixels are selected across mainland china specially the selected pixels fulfill the following two conditions a slope of the pixel should be less than 10 to ensure a relatively flat surface and b land use types of the pixel should be grasslands croplands cropland natural vegetation mosaic or barren or sparsely vegetated according to the mcd12c1 derived land cover types shown in fig 1 these conditions are generally to guarantee minimum uncertainties in both the estimated all sky sm content and cldas sm product meanwhile these four land use types are known to take a majority of the entire pixels over mainland china thus the condition is generally representative based on the dem derived slope map and land use types of mainland china an equidistant random sampling method is used to determine the 300 random pixels throughout mainland china shown in fig 5 fig 6 depicts the comparison of all sky sm content and cldas sm product for the six days in 2017 it is clear from the results that the scatter plots of the estimated all sky sm content and cldas product are equally distributed around the line 1 1 for the study period with significant coefficient of determination r 2 varying from 0 390 to 0 549 moreover a slight bias from 0 001 to 0 011 m3 m3 with an rmse from 0 070 to 0 083 m3 m3 can be obtained between the two sm datasets for the six days indicating that the two datasets are well correlated although the two sm datasets show some differences in some pixels the overall trend of the sm variation for each day is similar and close all these results reveal that the estimated all sky sm content is generally reliable to further assess the estimated all sky sm pixel to pixel spatial distributions of the rmse and bias between estimated all sky sm and cldas data are produced over the study area fig 7 depicts the two metrics of estimated sm versus cldas sm product for the study area the rmse varies from approximately 0 001 to 0 015 m3 m3 with an average rmse of 0 079 m3 m3 whereas the bias ranges from approximately 0 108 to 0 119 m3 m3 with an average bias of 0 008 m3 m3 as can be seen from the results larger errors normally occur over the forest regions in southwest and northeast china or along the coastline for the north china plain most of the pixels reveal significant better accuracy than other regions with regarding to both rmse and bias 5 discussion 5 1 error analysis due to the lack of in situ sm measurements over the study area and period the assimilative sm product of cldas is used in present study to compare the all sky sm retrieval in the strictest sense this comparison can be treated as an appropriate reference but not the best description on the performance of the all sky sm retrieval nevertheless there are at least two advantages using the cldas sm product to assess the estimated all sky sm content the one is that the spatially continuous cldas product can help to better compare the spatial pattern of the all sky sm over the entire study area the other is that the inconsistency of spatial scale can be avoid due to the same spatial resolution of cldas product and estimated all sky sm maps although the estimated all sky sm maps show generally well correlation and coincident spatial pattern to the cldas sm product several major error sources probably leading to the uncertainties of the all sky sm retrieval should be seriously investigated in ongoing works the primary one is the errors in the direct inputs of the procedure for deriving all sky sm content these main inputs include modis observations smops product and meteorological elements as we known errors probably exist in each of these inputs for an instance error in modis lst is normally reported to be 1 k under ideal conditions according to a previous sensitivity analysis this error can lead to an rmse of 0 010 to 0 021 m3 m3 for clear sky sm retrieval using the proposed method leng et al 2017 hence it is necessary to produce more reliable inputs for the generation of all sky sm maps with the proposed method a second error source can be the mismatch of modis transit time the cldas time and also the smops product time it notes that modis transit time is unfixed within a time window probably 2 h in mainland china for each individual day whereas the cldas data are produced hourly except for these the smops sm product has blended several measurements at different overpass times from microwave sensors to guarantee maximum spatial coverage however these data are the best choices at present to derive all sky sm over mainland china using both optical thermal infrared retrieval and microwave product in general this time mismatch can lead to the inconformity of land surface status and meteorological conditions although the effects of the time mismatch on the all sky sm retrieval have not been further investigated it cannot be neglected in the ongoing work except for these soil hydraulic parameters are also essential for the determination of quantitative sm content however most of the currently available soil texture data are derived from limited soil samples most likely unable to reflect the actual spatial variation of soil especially over large areas meanwhile the most popular methods for converting soil texture to hydraulic parameters e g wilting point and field capacity are still the regression ones which will also cause various uncertainties for the determination of quantitative sm content 5 2 on the determination of sm over cloudy pixels it is known that sm estimation at fine spatial resolution from satellite data over cloudy pixels is a huge challenge at present to our best knowledge as so far disaggregation of coarse microwave based sm products into fine spatial resolution is a practical approach however most of the commonly used disaggregation methods rely on optical thermal infrared observations unavailable in cloudy conditions this contradiction makes it difficult to obtain sm for cloudy pixels at fine spatial resolution from satellite measurements at present in a previous research we have investigated sm estimation from meteorological forcing data derived resistance parameters leng et al 2017 in comparison to the preceding method using meteorological forcing data only a main advantage of the present study is that microwave sm product has been introduced to determine sm at fine spatial resolution over cloudy pixels moreover it should be noted that the meteorological forcing data derived resistance parameters are essential inputs for both of these two methods to obtain sm content over cloudy pixels for the previous approach sm content is expressed as a simple linear function to sm availability where the soil texture derived field capacity and wilting point are used to ensure the variation of sm content within these maximum and minimum values in the present study the meteorological forcing data derived resistance parameters are used as a proxy to disaggregate the coarse microwave sm product into fine spatial resolution it notes that the effect of soil texture on the final sm disaggregation with the proposed method is implicitly contained in the smops data since soil texture map is one of the essential parameters to produce the microwave sm product fig 8 depicts the scatters of the two methods for the determination of sm content versus the cldas sm product over cloudy pixels on the six selected days in 2017 it notes that the disaggregation procedure and the resistance based method are marked as method i and method ii in fig 8 it is evident from the results that method i reveal significant better consistency with the cldas sm product than method ii for all the six days the range of rmse for method i and method ii are 0 068 to 0 088 m3 m3 and 0 080 to 0 103 m3 m3 respectively in addition variations of bias of the method i and method ii are 0 008 to 0 020 m3 m3 and 0 049 to 0 002 m3 m3 respectively indicating that method i is relatively stable than method ii moreover a significant underestimation of sm content can be found in method ii for all the six days these preliminary comparisons reveal that the disaggregation of coarse microwave sm product can obtain better sm at fine spatial resolution than the resistance based method based on these comparisons it is most likely to indicate that the proposed method exhibits certain superiority than the previous procedure to obtain sm data at higher spatial resolution over cloudy pixels however comprehensive validation of the proposed method should be implemented with more reliable ground in situ sm measurements in the ongoing work to further underline the advantages of the proposed method 5 3 on the determination of sm over clear sky pixels previous section generally reveals that the disaggregation procedure can obtain better sm than the resistance based method at higher spatial resolution over cloudy pixels because the disaggregation procedure is able to determine sm over clear sky pixels in theory it is also necessary to assess the disaggregation procedure and t s vi trapezoid method for the estimation of sm fig 9 depicts the scatters of the t s vi trapezoid retrieval denoted as method i and the disaggregation procedure derived sm versus the cldas sm product over clear sky pixels on the six selected days in 2017 it is evident from the results that the t s vi trapezoid retrieval method reveals significant better consistency with the cldas sm product than the disaggregation procedure derived sm for all the six days rmses of the t s vi trapezoid method range from 0 067 to 0 077 m3 m3 whereas a larger rmse variation from 0 078 to 0 086 m3 m3 is obtained for the disaggregation procedure in addition variations of bias for the two methods are 0 011 to 0 010 m3 m3 and 0 035 to 0 047 m3 m3 respectively indicating that the t s vi trapezoid retrieval method is relatively stable than the disaggregation method these preliminary comparisons show that better sm estimates at higher spatial resolution can be obtained from direct retrieval using optical thermal infrared observations than using the disaggregation method hence although the disaggregation procedure is able to obtain sm at higher spatial resolution over all sky conditions the direct retrieval of sm from optical thermal infrared observations is implemented for the clear sky pixels in present study 5 4 on the coarse sm product selected in present study with the rapid developments of remote sensing technology and spatial modeling a number of satellite derived modeled assimilated and reanalysis sm products at global scale are available at present currently the smops and cci are the two main globally blended sm products produced by several available active and passive microwave observations except for these two blended products there are also many other products derived from individual microwave sensor such as the smos the smap the advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr2 and the advanced scatterometer ascat however a number of studies have highlighted that the blended products reveal better accuracy than those derived from single satellite sensor dorigo et al 2015 cheng et al 2019 moreover until the time we finished this study by october 2018 the cci products were released for a period from 1978 to 2016 only hence no cci data were available that can match the meteorological data cldas v2 0 available from january 2017 to present and the study period of the present study august to october 2017 at the meanwhile the latest version of the smops data v3 0 was released available from march 2017 to present specifically it is also noted that the blended smops data can not only exhibit remarkable accuracy but also better improve the performances of land surface model simulations than individual sm retrievals nair and indu 2016 yin et al 2018 hence the smops product was selected as the coarse sm data in present study nevertheless future study can also take into consideration of more satellite sm products over different study periods and regions except for the remote sensing sm products several other global sm products such as the gldas the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam the modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications merra and the fifth generation of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts atmospheric reanalysis era5 are also widely used datasets and can be regarded as the potential alternatives for present study to obtain sm under cloudy condition however these sm products are generally the reanalysis or assimilated sm data rather than remote sensing products while the main idea of the present study is to obtain sm at high spatial resolution from satellite observations both optical thermal infrared and microwave moreover it should be noted that remote sensing based sm products commonly exhibit higher accuracy than the reanalysis data and land data assimilation system simulations following previous studies wen et al 2014 stillman et al 2016 nevertheless except for the satellite sm products both the reanalysis and assimilated sm datasets are also feasible data sources for obtaining sm over cloudy pixels in future developments 5 5 advantages and disadvantages of the proposed method the present study has provided a practical framework for the obtaining of all sky sm maps at fine spatial resolution from the synergetic use of optical thermal infrared and microwave measurements in general all the main inputs of the proposed approach are quality controlled satellite and assimilative products that can be freely acquired at present which can ensure the accuracy of the estimated all sky sm to a certain extent a major advantage of the proposed method is that microwave sm product has been used to determine sm content for cloudy pixels at finer spatial resolution through disaggregation method compared to previous study that sm over cloudy pixels primarily obtained from meteorological forcing data derived resistance parameters only utilization of microwave sm product for the determination of sm content over cloud pixels reveal significant superiority moreover the disaggregation method introduces meteorological forcing data derived sm availability as the proxy making it possible to disaggregate coarse microwave sm data under cloudy conditions because the traditional t s vi feature space based disaggregation approaches are only available over clear sky pixels the present study seems to have extended the traditional applications from both the spatial patterns and comparison between the estimated all sky sm content and the cldas sm product nevertheless the feasibility of the proposed method should be further investigated with in situ measurements in the ongoing work furthermore it notes that the traditional spatial information based feature space normally requires uniform weather conditions making it difficult to apply over large areas by using the gridded meteorological forcing data at the same high spatial resolution to the modis images the novel pixel to pixel scheme of the t s vi feature space can be implemented free regardless of the both the size and the underlying surfaces of the study area providing an opportunity to map sm over large regions despite these because thermal infrared and microwave missions have different sensing depths it is most likely that the estimated all sky sm maps representative sm conditions at different soil layers in general thermal infrared signals can reflect sm conditions under several centimeters whereas microwave sm product usually with a much shallower surfaces this is also the reason that we insist on retaining optical thermal infrared sm retrieval over clear sky pixels for the all sky sm maps rather than the disaggregation of coarse microwave sm for all pixels although sm content in different layers probably has strong internal connections the present study cannot provide all sky sm content at a same soil depth it is crucial in the ongoing work if the microwave based sm content at shallow surface can be transformed to the deeper depth with respected to the thermal infrared based sm data 6 conclusions the present study provides a practical framework for the determination of all sky sm maps from the synergistic use of currently available optical thermal infrared sm retrieval and microwave sm product in present study sm over clear sky and cloudy pixels are estimated separately for clear sky pixels a novel pixel to pixel scheme of the t s vi feature space method is used to determine sm content while sm over cloudy pixels are derived from disaggregation of the coarse microwave sm product it notes that the gridded meteorological elements are used in both the clear sky and cloudy pixels to obtain sm content at fine spatial resolution a preliminary comparison with the assimilated cldas sm product shows that the estimated all sky sm maps have reasonable spatial patterns for the study period for the 300 random pixels the estimated all sky sm correlates well with the cldas product with rmse ranging from 0 070 to 0 083 m3 m3 and a slight bias varying from 0 001 to 0 011 m3 m3 over the study period these results suggest that the proposed framework is generally feasible for the obtaining of reliable all sky sm content at fine spatial resolution specifically the method to obtain sm over cloudy pixels combining microwave measurements and meteorological forcing data in present study shows certain superiority to a previous approach using meteorological forcing data only in summary the present study successfully achieved all sky sm content retrieval from currently available satellite products to assess the proposed approach comprehensively further work can be focused on implementing the proposed method over long period and further exploring potential applications such as the investigation of

6031,meteorological drought is a precursor of hydrological drought understanding the propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought is important for the early warning of hydrological drought this study investigated this drought propagation by analyzing the correlation between the standardized precipitation index spi a metric of meteorological drought and standardized runoff index sri a metric of hydrological drought over the upstream midstream and downstream areas of the luanhe river basin lrb results revealed little difference in meteorological drought characteristics between pre and post human disturbance period while hydrological drought became more frequent in the pre human disturbance period the drought propagation was mainly affected by catchment characteristics the time of propagation of meteorological drought to hydrological drought was shorter in grassland dominated subbasin 1 5 months than in forest dominated subbasin 4 7 months in rainy season the drought propagation in these two subbasins showed a similar lag time of 7 12 months when it comes to dry season under the influence of changing environments and agricultural activities in upstream area drought propagation prolonged from 4 9 months to 5 12 months during december through june in the downstream area the drought propagation time during october through april becomes 1 2 month shorter which is likely caused by the increase in the domestic water supply and the expansion of the urban area results of this study will be helpful for the development of improved drought warning and forecasting system in arid and semi arid areas keywords standardized drought indices agricultural activities urban area expansion propagation time human activity luanhe river basin 1 introduction drought is a creeping phenomenon and unlike floods and tornadoes it generally develops slowly and often leaves persistent effects even after cessation mishra and singh 2010 drought has caused tremendous losses to many systems and socio economic sectors worldwide deb et al 2019a b for instance the 2014 california drought is a record breaking event griffin and anchukaitis 2014 and costs 2 2 billion in the u s richard et al 2014 understanding the drought evolution and variation at different temporal and spatial scales is of critical importance for drought management drought can be classified into meteorological agricultural hydrological and socioeconomic wilhite 2005 meteorological drought is related to the precipitation deficit over an extended period the soil moisture deficit may lead to crop reduction which is commonly referred to as agricultural drought hydrological drought is related to the water shortage in rivers lakes or reservoirs since hydrological drought is directly related to water supply to the society the evolution of hydrological drought has attracted much attention a variety of drought indicators have therefore been developed to characterize different types of drought such as the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 standardized soil moisture index ssi hao and aghakouchak 2014 and standardized runoff index sri shukla and wood 2008 hao et al 2018 for example the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 has been recommended by the world meteorological organization wmo as the indicator to track the meteorological drought hayes et al 2011 li et al 2016 due to the complicated nature of drought a multitude of multivariate or integrated indicators have also been developed for drought monitoring and prediction at regions and global scales vicente serrano et al 2010 hao and singh 2015 aghakouchak et al 2015 the transition of meteorological drought to hydrological drought is called the drought propagation eltahir and yeh 1999 since drought originates from meteorological drought that affects the hydrological process understanding how meteorological drought propagates to hydrological drought is important for hydrological drought management literatures show that the propagation of drought mostly relates to climatic conditions and catchment characteristics huang et al 2015a van loon and laaha 2015 analyzing the relationships of climatic factors and hydrological droughts in the jialing river basin zeng et al 2015 showed that there was generally one or two months lag between meteorological drought and hydrological drought though the propagation of drought has a close relationship with the hydrological cycle how the meteorological drought affects the hydrological cycle is still poorly understood gevaert et al 2018 likewise how human activities impact drought is not well understood for drought management especially in this human influenced era van loon et al 2016 human activities including dam irrigation urbanization and land use cover change can significantly alter the process of drought propagation lópez moreno et al 2009 wen et al 2011 reservoir construction is one of the most important controlling factors that can lead to changes in drought transmission through the regulation of runoff wu et al 2017 found a nonlinear relationship between meteorological drought and hydrological drought in the jinjiang river basin comparison of different time periods showed that reservoir construction shortened the propagation process from meteorological drought to hydrological drought a study by konapala and mishra 2017 in contiguous united states indicated that drought events propagated differently at different thresholds associated with the initiation of drought events the propagation of drought also varies in different type of land use huang et al 2017 2015b identified surface features including soil and topography types as potential factors for drought propagation time wu et al 2018 showed a significant positive correlation between forest coverage and drought propagation time while the percentage of land allocated to pasture was significantly negatively correlated with drought propagation time in the loess plateau china recent studies on drought propagation emphasize the need to comprehensively analyze drought propagation characteristics under different factors and distinguish the influence of each factor on the drought propagation time the objective of this study therefore is 1 to evaluate the relationship between meteorological drought and hydrological drought in luan river basin lrb 2 to investigate the spatial propagation pattern from meteorological drought to hydrological drought 3 to identify the potential human activities including land use land cover change and water supply demand by comparative analysis from different aspects the characteristics of drought propagation in the basin and the influencing factors of its changes were determined from the analysis of drought propagation characteristics and the differences in drought propagation time under each scenario the effect of changing environment on the propagation of drought from meteorological to hydrological was evaluated this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the study area methods for characterizing droughts and propagation behavior and data used in this study results and discussion are presented in section 3 followed by the conclusions in section 4 2 material and methods 2 1 study area lrb is the largest tributary basin of the haihe river basin which is located in the northern part of china our study focuses on the lrb above luanxian station fig 1 which extends from 115 47 e to 119 73 e and from 39 66 n to 42 73 n with a total drainage area of 44 202 km2 the elevation within the basin ranges from 3 m to 2241 m above mean sea level with the topography significantly descending from the northwest to the southeast based on surface characteristics elevation latitude and soil property the study area is further divided into upstream midstream and downstream of the lrb the upstream part mainly flows through the grassland of inner mongolia and the elevation of its riverbed ranges from 1800 m to 1145 m the midstream runs through the mountainous area in the south margin of bashang plateau and the mountainous area of northern hebei province where riverbed slopes range from 1145 m to 423 m the downstream part of lrb belongs to yanshan mountains in which riverbed slopes range from 423 m to 25 m lrb is considered as the most important ecological barrier for northern china not only for the world famous afforestation project called saihanba forest plain but also for the important water retention area for the megacities like beijing and tianjin to alleviate the mismatch between water supply and demand in the beijing tianjin tangshan region one of the most economically developed and densely populated areas a diversion project from luanhe to tianjin and from luanhe to tangshan was constructed from 1983 through 1985 the panjiakou reservoir in the downstream part of the lrb was built as the main source of water for this project wang et al 2019 the lrb is in the temperate semiarid continental monsoon climate zone where climate varies greatly fig 2 a b the annual average air temperature increases from 1 c to 11 c from northwest to southeast and the temperatures has risen significantly since 1960 jiang et al 2015 the annual average precipitation ranges from 400 mm to 800 mm many studies have concluded that the annual precipitation in the lrb does not have remarkable variation trends in the last 6 decades wang et al 2015 li et al 2018a b precipitation is mostly concentrated in june to august which accounts for 70 80 of the annual precipitation runoff has been commonly used for the evaluation of hydrological drought in three different subbasins of lrb the runoff manifested a sharp decrease fig 2 c from the highest in the 1960s 57 70 mm year 39 73 mm year and 93 03 mm year to the lowest in the 2000s 31 40 mm year 15 23 mm year and 22 68 mm year in the last 57 years the mann kendall mk mann 1945 kendall 1948 test was employed to identify the significant decreasing trend in the subbasins which indicated that the abrupt point of runoff series occurred around 1980 1990 the average annual runoff had decreased by about 30 since 1980 which would lead to the long lasting water shortage and aggravate water crisis in tianjin city yang et al 2019 severe drought events occurred in 1972 1980 1984 and 1997 2005 2 2 drought definition and assessment precipitation is the main source of the regional water supply which has a direct impact on meteorological drought the spi was employed as the meteorological drought indicator in this study the sri is calculated in a similar way as the spi and can be used as a hydrological drought indicator the spi and sri were calculated in the accumulation periods of 1 12 months during 1960 2016 and these periods were indicated as spi n and sri n for example spi 3 and sri 12 denote a 3 month precipitation accumulation period and a 12 month runoff accumulation period respectively the linkage between spi and sri was used to investigate the propagation of drought from meteorological to hydrological form in various hydrological processes the sri 1 1 month sri was used considering its description of short term hydrological drought the time n which spi n n month spi had the strongest correlation with sri 1 can represent the most suitable propagation time temporal correlations between spi n and sri 1 were calculated and the spearman correlation coefficient was chosen as a measure of correlation barker et al 2016 wu et al 2017 huang et al 2017 2 3 data source the digital elevation model dem with a 30 m resolution and the land use and land cover change lucc maps with a 1000 m resolution from 1980 to 2015 were obtained from the resources and environment science data center resdc of chinese academy of sciences cas http www resdc cn these were used to identify the underlying watershed characteristics monthly precipitation data from 9 weather stations fig 1 was obtained from national climate center of the china meteorological stations http data cma cn monthly runoff data from 4 hydrological stations including baichengzi sandaohezi hanjiaying and luanxian was collected from the heibei hydrographic bureau baichengzi station sandaohezi station and luanxian station are the controlling hydrological stations of the mainstream and they are located in the upstream midstream and downstream parts respectively the yixun river which is controlled by hanjiaying station and flows into the midstream behind the sandaohezi station is the largest tributary of the luanhe river 2 4 potential factors identification there are many potential factors affecting the propagation of drought huang et al 2017 in order to identify the influence of different factors two approaches can be taken one is to compare the landuse and landcover characteristics of different subbasins upstream midstream and downstream the other is to identify the influencing factors by using different time periods with a disturbance period to represent the conditions under disturbance due to potential factors van loon et al 2019 landuse is divided into six categories in lrb including arable land forest grassland water construction land and unused land fig 3 shows the landuse change of different subbasins from 1980 to 2010 in general each sub basin can be characterized by their main types of landuse in the upstream part nearly 55 of the total area is grassland the arable land accounts for 30 of the total area which has been increasing continuously since the 1980s the midstream and downstream parts are mainly covered by forests with coverage of 44 and followed by grassland and arable land the biggest difference between landuse types in the midstream and downstream parts is that besides the three types mentioned above the area of urban land and water area in the downstream part are remarkably larger given that the dominated landuse has not changed greatly during last 3 decades the potential influencing factors of drought propagation might mostly be human activities based on landuse such as agricultural activities in the upstream part and the domestic water demand in downstream part time periods were divided into pre disturbance period and post disturbance period to clarify these anthropogenic influences as mentioned earlier a significant abrupt point existed near 1980 1990 in the runoff series in the lrb which may also affect drought propagation what s more the time series length would also affect the accuracy of correlation analysis therefore the midpoint of the study period in 1988 was chosen as the dividing point of two stages stage i from 1960 to 1988 represented the drought propagation under the natural condition while stage ii 1989 2016 represented the drought propagation under the effect of changing environments 3 results and discussion 3 1 tempo spatial pattern of meteorological and hydrological drought fig 4 shows the variation of spi and sri for different time scales from the upstream to the downstream there were two major drought events around 1980 and 2000 identified by spi this is consistent with the record in yearbook that the lrb area had suffered severe drought in 1980 and 2000 wang et al 2019 with the expansion of the time scale there were more prolonged and significant wet and dry periods the spi n in the three sub basins demonstrated a relatively slight variation and suggested the meteorological drought showed little spatial heterogeneity at lrb in the last 6 decades fig 4 a c e however the meteorological drought in downstream part demonstrated regional differences in the 1980s and the 2010s the drought event that occurred in the 1980s seemed to have a longer duration and less severity than that in the upstream and midstream parts in the 2010s the upstream and midstream parts experienced a moderate drought while the downstream had a relatively severer drought on the contrary the variation of sri n reflected obvious changes in hydrological drought fig 4 b d f from 1960 to 1975 the whole basin was relatively wet hydrological dry episodes gradually increased after the 1980s after the drought mitigated slightly between 1992 and 2000 hydrological drought events became intensified again since 2000 in all three catchments due to the influence of multiple factors including topography climatic characteristics human activities etc hydrological conditions showed remarkable differences in the three subbasins a severer drought fig 4 b occurred in 1978 in the upstream part and two years earlier in the midstream and downstream parts drought events in the midstream part were more severer than that in the downstream part during 1980 1990 and the drought severity was relatively weak in the upstream part after the 2000s comparison of the characteristics of spi n with sri n found that the meteorological drought and the hydrological drought did not synchronize with each other although closely related their relationship can be divided into three situations 1 meteorological drought occurred with hydrological drought 2 hydrological drought occurred shortly after meteorological drought 3 hydrological drought occurred quite a time after the meteorological drought van loon and van lanen 2012 mostly meteorological drought has a higher frequency and shorter duration compared with hydrological drought in subbasins the temporal trend of hydrological drought and meteorological drought showed a relatively higher consistency in the midstream part than in the upstream and downstream parts human activities were more intensive in the upstream and downstream parts than in midstream and caused anthropogenic induced land cover change to alter the hydrological processes like evapotranspiration infiltration which would influence the development of drought therefore the response of hydrological drought to meteorological drought became more complex li et al 2018a b rangecroft et al 2019 3 2 propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought fig 5 shows the spearman correlation between spi n and sri 1 similarly to the study of van loon et al 2014 the seasonality of drought propagation was noteworthy in this catchment generally the correlation of spi n and sri 1 was higher in the rainy season july december than in the dry season january june because most of the annual precipitation is concentrated in summer it has a critical impact on the replenishment of river flow therefore severe meteorological drought during summer may affect the hydrological drought throughout the year on the contrary when it comes to the dry season lower temperature results in weak evapotranspiration and slows down the hydrological cycles which may prolong the propagation time of drought the correlation especially weakened in spring march may because temperature rises in spring after the winter freeze period and leads to snow melt although precipitation was low in this period the snow melt formed surface runoff and mitigated the hydrological drought frauenfeld 2004 as mentioned above the monthly maximum spearman coefficients between spi n and sri 1 in fig 5 reflect the most possible propagation time from the meteorological drought to the hydrological drought the propagation time increased from 1 to 12 months from july to the next june the shortest propagation was shown in july september 1 3 months followed by october december and january march 4 9 months the longest propagation was identified in may june 10 12 months during the flood season in july and august the propagation to hydrological drought was more obvious the simultaneous increase in temperature and precipitation accelerates the hydrological cycle and will further influence the drought propagation process yang et al 2012 besides climatic factors the catchment characteristics also played an important role in drought propagations yang et al 2017 the midstream and downstream parts demonstrate relatively strong correlations than upstream part the reason might be that the forest land has higher evapotranspiration than grassland and arable land sterling et al 2013 and is identified as the major land cover in the midstream and downstream parts another reason might be the grassland and arable land are more permeable or largely influenced by groundwater recharge barker et al 2016 additionally the subbasin slope might also influence drought propagation as reported by yang et al 2017 3 3 propagation variation under human activities impact fig 6 shows the propagation time from meteorological drought to hydrological drought in two stages stage i was characterized as the period when the drought propagation was less affected by human activities where natural underlying surface features might dominantly affect the propagation of drought the drought propagation in stage ii represented the combined effect of natural conditions and human activities the gap between the two stages can reflect how changing environment affects the propagation of drought in stage i the relationship between hydrological drought and meteorological drought become closer from upstream to downstream parts in the upstream part which was mainly covered by grassland the drought propagation time during rainy season july december was 1 5 months it was much shorter than that in the midstream and downstream parts where forest was the main land cover with the propagation time of 4 7 months the reason for this phenomenon might be the interception of precipitation by forest vegetation which prolonged the conversion time of precipitation to runoff li et al 2009 in stage ii correlations between sri 1 and spi n were lower than those in stage i the weaker relationship between meteorological and hydrological droughts indicated that changing environment affected the hydrological processes the variation of drought propagation time in the two time periods in the three subbasins demonstrated different pattern under increasing water depletion land use land cover change reservoir operation and so on in the upstream part fig 6 a b the correlation between hydrological drought and meteorological drought in august november was significantly strengthened additionally the drought propagation time had been extended by 1 to 3 months from december to july while the propagation time was shortened by 4 months in august previous studies confirmed that irrigation was the main cause of the decline in annual observed runoff in haihe river basin ren et al 2002 wang et al 2011 regulatory activities such as increasing irrigation by extracting groundwater could cause more hydrological drought at long time scale gómez gómez and pérez blanco 2012 but the irrigation will also increase the soil water contents and form runoff in a short time scale which might prolong the propagation of drought as well wen et al 2011 studies have demonstrated that the groundwater consumption consisted of over 50 of the water supply and most of it was used for agricultural irrigation especially for the north china plain which had experienced groundwater over exploitation for agricultural irrigation and urbanization since the 1960s zheng et al 2010 cao et al 2014 groundwater depth in chengde showed an obvious decrease from 2003 to 2010 with 6 83 m to 6 92 m caused by the depletion of groundwater yuan et al 2013 moreover the upstream area of lrb is a typical agricultural area where arable area was increased from 1655 km2 to 1726 km2 while the yield output per centare has increased nearly 2 times during 1980 2015 fig 7 the increase in agricultural area and corresponding food production growth might also contribute to the increase of propagation time in the midstream and downstream parts fig 6 c d e f the correlation between spi n and sri 1 became weaker especially in the dry season from january to june the propagation time from meteorological drought to hydrological drought was shortened by 1 2 months in most of the months october to april in flood season the propagation time of drought decreased from 11 months to 1 month in july in downstream and from 11 months to 2 months in august in midstream as shown in fig 8 the gross domestic product gdp increased by 24 48 billion yuan decade which was mostly concentrated in stage ⅱ from 3 47 to 140 39 billion yuan while the urban population of the study area increased by 0 62 million decade in chengde from 1960 to 2016 the increase of gdp and population in chengde enhanced the industrial and domestic water consumption in the downstream part of lrb after the launch of the reform and opening up policy in 1978 in china li et al 2016 the increasing consumption of water resources by human activities had caused weakening of the link between meteorological drought and hydrological drought in midstream and downstream parts especially in january june with less precipitation during meteorological drought the recharge of water from precipitation became too low to meet domestic industrial and agricultural demand therefore one would use engineering measures such as reservoir regulation and water transfer to ensure the security of public water supplies which would weaken the correlation between meteorological drought and hydrological drought moreover the increase in water depletion from the river will also increase the risk of hydrological drought this phenomenon was more obvious in hot summers when the water consumption reached the highest at the same time the expansion of the urban city area has increased the impervious area which changed the hydrological process of runoff in the study area and shortened the propagation time of the drought it is also noted that reservoirs might play a role in the variation of hydrological process in the downstream area fig 1 in 1979 panjiakou reservoir and daheiting reservoir in the mainstream part of luanhe river were put into operation successively with a total reservoir capacity of 2 93 109 m3 and 3 37 108 m3 respectively wang et al 2019 therefore the alteration of the propagation process from meteorological to hydrological droughts between two stages can also be attributed to the operation of large reservoirs the period of long propagation time and weak correlation coefficients from february to may in stage i were extended to june in stage ii since the effects of reservoirs on drought transmission are mainly concentrated in the dry season wang et al 2019 their regulation of runoff might alter the relationship between precipitation and runoff in the dry season and shorten the drought process wu et al 2018 4 conclusion in the human influence era understanding how changing environments affects the propagation of drought is important to mitigate the damage caused by extreme events this study compared drought propagation processes in different periods in sub basins to characterize the tempo spatial propagation of drought in lrb the drought propagation time was obtained by the spearman correlation coefficient of sri 1 and spi n the following conclusions can be drawn from the study 1 during 1960 2016 meteorological drought events are generally evenly distributed in the lrb with more hydrological drought episodes after the 1980s seasonality of drought

july to the next june 2 in the pre human disturbance period stage i the drought propagation process was mainly affected by catchment characteristics the propagation time of meteorological drought to

january june was 7 12 months 3 under the influence of changing environment stage ii human activities interfered with the natural circulation process and weakened the link between meteorological

6031,meteorological drought is a precursor of hydrological drought understanding the propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought is important for the early warning of hydrological drought this study investigated this drought propagation by analyzing the correlation between the standardized precipitation index spi a metric of meteorological drought and standardized runoff index sri a metric of hydrological drought over the upstream midstream and downstream areas of the luanhe river basin lrb results revealed little difference in meteorological drought characteristics between pre and post human disturbance period while hydrological drought became more frequent in the pre human disturbance period the drought propagation was mainly affected by catchment characteristics the time of propagation of meteorological drought to hydrological drought was shorter in grassland dominated subbasin 1 5 months than in forest dominated subbasin 4 7 months in rainy season the drought propagation in these two subbasins showed a similar lag time of 7 12 months when it comes to dry season under the influence of changing environments and agricultural activities in upstream area drought propagation prolonged from 4 9 months to 5 12 months during december through june in the downstream area the drought propagation time during october through april becomes 1 2 month shorter which is likely caused by the increase in the domestic water supply and the expansion of the urban area results of this study will be helpful for the development of improved drought warning and forecasting system in arid and semi arid areas keywords standardized drought indices agricultural activities urban area expansion propagation time human activity luanhe river basin 1 introduction drought is a creeping phenomenon and unlike floods and tornadoes it generally develops slowly and often leaves persistent effects even after cessation mishra and singh 2010 drought has caused tremendous losses to many systems and socio economic sectors worldwide deb et al 2019a b for instance the 2014 california drought is a record breaking event griffin and anchukaitis 2014 and costs 2 2 billion in the u s richard et al 2014 understanding the drought evolution and variation at different temporal and spatial scales is of critical importance for drought management drought can be classified into meteorological agricultural hydrological and socioeconomic wilhite 2005 meteorological drought is related to the precipitation deficit over an extended period the soil moisture deficit may lead to crop reduction which is commonly referred to as agricultural drought hydrological drought is related to the water shortage in rivers lakes or reservoirs since hydrological drought is directly related to water supply to the society the evolution of hydrological drought has attracted much attention a variety of drought indicators have therefore been developed to characterize different types of drought such as the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 standardized soil moisture index ssi hao and aghakouchak 2014 and standardized runoff index sri shukla and wood 2008 hao et al 2018 for example the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 has been recommended by the world meteorological organization wmo as the indicator to track the meteorological drought hayes et al 2011 li et al 2016 due to the complicated nature of drought a multitude of multivariate or integrated indicators have also been developed for drought monitoring and prediction at regions and global scales vicente serrano et al 2010 hao and singh 2015 aghakouchak et al 2015 the transition of meteorological drought to hydrological drought is called the drought propagation eltahir and yeh 1999 since drought originates from meteorological drought that affects the hydrological process understanding how meteorological drought propagates to hydrological drought is important for hydrological drought management literatures show that the propagation of drought mostly relates to climatic conditions and catchment characteristics huang et al 2015a van loon and laaha 2015 analyzing the relationships of climatic factors and hydrological droughts in the jialing river basin zeng et al 2015 showed that there was generally one or two months lag between meteorological drought and hydrological drought though the propagation of drought has a close relationship with the hydrological cycle how the meteorological drought affects the hydrological cycle is still poorly understood gevaert et al 2018 likewise how human activities impact drought is not well understood for drought management especially in this human influenced era van loon et al 2016 human activities including dam irrigation urbanization and land use cover change can significantly alter the process of drought propagation lópez moreno et al 2009 wen et al 2011 reservoir construction is one of the most important controlling factors that can lead to changes in drought transmission through the regulation of runoff wu et al 2017 found a nonlinear relationship between meteorological drought and hydrological drought in the jinjiang river basin comparison of different time periods showed that reservoir construction shortened the propagation process from meteorological drought to hydrological drought a study by konapala and mishra 2017 in contiguous united states indicated that drought events propagated differently at different thresholds associated with the initiation of drought events the propagation of drought also varies in different type of land use huang et al 2017 2015b identified surface features including soil and topography types as potential factors for drought propagation time wu et al 2018 showed a significant positive correlation between forest coverage and drought propagation time while the percentage of land allocated to pasture was significantly negatively correlated with drought propagation time in the loess plateau china recent studies on drought propagation emphasize the need to comprehensively analyze drought propagation characteristics under different factors and distinguish the influence of each factor on the drought propagation time the objective of this study therefore is 1 to evaluate the relationship between meteorological drought and hydrological drought in luan river basin lrb 2 to investigate the spatial propagation pattern from meteorological drought to hydrological drought 3 to identify the potential human activities including land use land cover change and water supply demand by comparative analysis from different aspects the characteristics of drought propagation in the basin and the influencing factors of its changes were determined from the analysis of drought propagation characteristics and the differences in drought propagation time under each scenario the effect of changing environment on the propagation of drought from meteorological to hydrological was evaluated this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the study area methods for characterizing droughts and propagation behavior and data used in this study results and discussion are presented in section 3 followed by the conclusions in section 4 2 material and methods 2 1 study area lrb is the largest tributary basin of the haihe river basin which is located in the northern part of china our study focuses on the lrb above luanxian station fig 1 which extends from 115 47 e to 119 73 e and from 39 66 n to 42 73 n with a total drainage area of 44 202 km2 the elevation within the basin ranges from 3 m to 2241 m above mean sea level with the topography significantly descending from the northwest to the southeast based on surface characteristics elevation latitude and soil property the study area is further divided into upstream midstream and downstream of the lrb the upstream part mainly flows through the grassland of inner mongolia and the elevation of its riverbed ranges from 1800 m to 1145 m the midstream runs through the mountainous area in the south margin of bashang plateau and the mountainous area of northern hebei province where riverbed slopes range from 1145 m to 423 m the downstream part of lrb belongs to yanshan mountains in which riverbed slopes range from 423 m to 25 m lrb is considered as the most important ecological barrier for northern china not only for the world famous afforestation project called saihanba forest plain but also for the important water retention area for the megacities like beijing and tianjin to alleviate the mismatch between water supply and demand in the beijing tianjin tangshan region one of the most economically developed and densely populated areas a diversion project from luanhe to tianjin and from luanhe to tangshan was constructed from 1983 through 1985 the panjiakou reservoir in the downstream part of the lrb was built as the main source of water for this project wang et al 2019 the lrb is in the temperate semiarid continental monsoon climate zone where climate varies greatly fig 2 a b the annual average air temperature increases from 1 c to 11 c from northwest to southeast and the temperatures has risen significantly since 1960 jiang et al 2015 the annual average precipitation ranges from 400 mm to 800 mm many studies have concluded that the annual precipitation in the lrb does not have remarkable variation trends in the last 6 decades wang et al 2015 li et al 2018a b precipitation is mostly concentrated in june to august which accounts for 70 80 of the annual precipitation runoff has been commonly used for the evaluation of hydrological drought in three different subbasins of lrb the runoff manifested a sharp decrease fig 2 c from the highest in the 1960s 57 70 mm year 39 73 mm year and 93 03 mm year to the lowest in the 2000s 31 40 mm year 15 23 mm year and 22 68 mm year in the last 57 years the mann kendall mk mann 1945 kendall 1948 test was employed to identify the significant decreasing trend in the subbasins which indicated that the abrupt point of runoff series occurred around 1980 1990 the average annual runoff had decreased by about 30 since 1980 which would lead to the long lasting water shortage and aggravate water crisis in tianjin city yang et al 2019 severe drought events occurred in 1972 1980 1984 and 1997 2005 2 2 drought definition and assessment precipitation is the main source of the regional water supply which has a direct impact on meteorological drought the spi was employed as the meteorological drought indicator in this study the sri is calculated in a similar way as the spi and can be used as a hydrological drought indicator the spi and sri were calculated in the accumulation periods of 1 12 months during 1960 2016 and these periods were indicated as spi n and sri n for example spi 3 and sri 12 denote a 3 month precipitation accumulation period and a 12 month runoff accumulation period respectively the linkage between spi and sri was used to investigate the propagation of drought from meteorological to hydrological form in various hydrological processes the sri 1 1 month sri was used considering its description of short term hydrological drought the time n which spi n n month spi had the strongest correlation with sri 1 can represent the most suitable propagation time temporal correlations between spi n and sri 1 were calculated and the spearman correlation coefficient was chosen as a measure of correlation barker et al 2016 wu et al 2017 huang et al 2017 2 3 data source the digital elevation model dem with a 30 m resolution and the land use and land cover change lucc maps with a 1000 m resolution from 1980 to 2015 were obtained from the resources and environment science data center resdc of chinese academy of sciences cas http www resdc cn these were used to identify the underlying watershed characteristics monthly precipitation data from 9 weather stations fig 1 was obtained from national climate center of the china meteorological stations http data cma cn monthly runoff data from 4 hydrological stations including baichengzi sandaohezi hanjiaying and luanxian was collected from the heibei hydrographic bureau baichengzi station sandaohezi station and luanxian station are the controlling hydrological stations of the mainstream and they are located in the upstream midstream and downstream parts respectively the yixun river which is controlled by hanjiaying station and flows into the midstream behind the sandaohezi station is the largest tributary of the luanhe river 2 4 potential factors identification there are many potential factors affecting the propagation of drought huang et al 2017 in order to identify the influence of different factors two approaches can be taken one is to compare the landuse and landcover characteristics of different subbasins upstream midstream and downstream the other is to identify the influencing factors by using different time periods with a disturbance period to represent the conditions under disturbance due to potential factors van loon et al 2019 landuse is divided into six categories in lrb including arable land forest grassland water construction land and unused land fig 3 shows the landuse change of different subbasins from 1980 to 2010 in general each sub basin can be characterized by their main types of landuse in the upstream part nearly 55 of the total area is grassland the arable land accounts for 30 of the total area which has been increasing continuously since the 1980s the midstream and downstream parts are mainly covered by forests with coverage of 44 and followed by grassland and arable land the biggest difference between landuse types in the midstream and downstream parts is that besides the three types mentioned above the area of urban land and water area in the downstream part are remarkably larger given that the dominated landuse has not changed greatly during last 3 decades the potential influencing factors of drought propagation might mostly be human activities based on landuse such as agricultural activities in the upstream part and the domestic water demand in downstream part time periods were divided into pre disturbance period and post disturbance period to clarify these anthropogenic influences as mentioned earlier a significant abrupt point existed near 1980 1990 in the runoff series in the lrb which may also affect drought propagation what s more the time series length would also affect the accuracy of correlation analysis therefore the midpoint of the study period in 1988 was chosen as the dividing point of two stages stage i from 1960 to 1988 represented the drought propagation under the natural condition while stage ii 1989 2016 represented the drought propagation under the effect of changing environments 3 results and discussion 3 1 tempo spatial pattern of meteorological and hydrological drought fig 4 shows the variation of spi and sri for different time scales from the upstream to the downstream there were two major drought events around 1980 and 2000 identified by spi this is consistent with the record in yearbook that the lrb area had suffered severe drought in 1980 and 2000 wang et al 2019 with the expansion of the time scale there were more prolonged and significant wet and dry periods the spi n in the three sub basins demonstrated a relatively slight variation and suggested the meteorological drought showed little spatial heterogeneity at lrb in the last 6 decades fig 4 a c e however the meteorological drought in downstream part demonstrated regional differences in the 1980s and the 2010s the drought event that occurred in the 1980s seemed to have a longer duration and less severity than that in the upstream and midstream parts in the 2010s the upstream and midstream parts experienced a moderate drought while the downstream had a relatively severer drought on the contrary the variation of sri n reflected obvious changes in hydrological drought fig 4 b d f from 1960 to 1975 the whole basin was relatively wet hydrological dry episodes gradually increased after the 1980s after the drought mitigated slightly between 1992 and 2000 hydrological drought events became intensified again since 2000 in all three catchments due to the influence of multiple factors including topography climatic characteristics human activities etc hydrological conditions showed remarkable differences in the three subbasins a severer drought fig 4 b occurred in 1978 in the upstream part and two years earlier in the midstream and downstream parts drought events in the midstream part were more severer than that in the downstream part during 1980 1990 and the drought severity was relatively weak in the upstream part after the 2000s comparison of the characteristics of spi n with sri n found that the meteorological drought and the hydrological drought did not synchronize with each other although closely related their relationship can be divided into three situations 1 meteorological drought occurred with hydrological drought 2 hydrological drought occurred shortly after meteorological drought 3 hydrological drought occurred quite a time after the meteorological drought van loon and van lanen 2012 mostly meteorological drought has a higher frequency and shorter duration compared with hydrological drought in subbasins the temporal trend of hydrological drought and meteorological drought showed a relatively higher consistency in the midstream part than in the upstream and downstream parts human activities were more intensive in the upstream and downstream parts than in midstream and caused anthropogenic induced land cover change to alter the hydrological processes like evapotranspiration infiltration which would influence the development of drought therefore the response of hydrological drought to meteorological drought became more complex li et al 2018a b rangecroft et al 2019 3 2 propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought fig 5 shows the spearman correlation between spi n and sri 1 similarly to the study of van loon et al 2014 the seasonality of drought propagation was noteworthy in this catchment generally the correlation of spi n and sri 1 was higher in the rainy season july december than in the dry season january june because most of the annual precipitation is concentrated in summer it has a critical impact on the replenishment of river flow therefore severe meteorological drought during summer may affect the hydrological drought throughout the year on the contrary when it comes to the dry season lower temperature results in weak evapotranspiration and slows down the hydrological cycles which may prolong the propagation time of drought the correlation especially weakened in spring march may because temperature rises in spring after the winter freeze period and leads to snow melt although precipitation was low in this period the snow melt formed surface runoff and mitigated the hydrological drought frauenfeld 2004 as mentioned above the monthly maximum spearman coefficients between spi n and sri 1 in fig 5 reflect the most possible propagation time from the meteorological drought to the hydrological drought the propagation time increased from 1 to 12 months from july to the next june the shortest propagation was shown in july september 1 3 months followed by october december and january march 4 9 months the longest propagation was identified in may june 10 12 months during the flood season in july and august the propagation to hydrological drought was more obvious the simultaneous increase in temperature and precipitation accelerates the hydrological cycle and will further influence the drought propagation process yang et al 2012 besides climatic factors the catchment characteristics also played an important role in drought propagations yang et al 2017 the midstream and downstream parts demonstrate relatively strong correlations than upstream part the reason might be that the forest land has higher evapotranspiration than grassland and arable land sterling et al 2013 and is identified as the major land cover in the midstream and downstream parts another reason might be the grassland and arable land are more permeable or largely influenced by groundwater recharge barker et al 2016 additionally the subbasin slope might also influence drought propagation as reported by yang et al 2017 3 3 propagation variation under human activities impact fig 6 shows the propagation time from meteorological drought to hydrological drought in two stages stage i was characterized as the period when the drought propagation was less affected by human activities where natural underlying surface features might dominantly affect the propagation of drought the drought propagation in stage ii represented the combined effect of natural conditions and human activities the gap between the two stages can reflect how changing environment affects the propagation of drought in stage i the relationship between hydrological drought and meteorological drought become closer from upstream to downstream parts in the upstream part which was mainly covered by grassland the drought propagation time during rainy season july december was 1 5 months it was much shorter than that in the midstream and downstream parts where forest was the main land cover with the propagation time of 4 7 months the reason for this phenomenon might be the interception of precipitation by forest vegetation which prolonged the conversion time of precipitation to runoff li et al 2009 in stage ii correlations between sri 1 and spi n were lower than those in stage i the weaker relationship between meteorological and hydrological droughts indicated that changing environment affected the hydrological processes the variation of drought propagation time in the two time periods in the three subbasins demonstrated different pattern under increasing water depletion land use land cover change reservoir operation and so on in the upstream part fig 6 a b the correlation between hydrological drought and meteorological drought in august november was significantly strengthened additionally the drought propagation time had been extended by 1 to 3 months from december to july while the propagation time was shortened by 4 months in august previous studies confirmed that irrigation was the main cause of the decline in annual observed runoff in haihe river basin ren et al 2002 wang et al 2011 regulatory activities such as increasing irrigation by extracting groundwater could cause more hydrological drought at long time scale gómez gómez and pérez blanco 2012 but the irrigation will also increase the soil water contents and form runoff in a short time scale which might prolong the propagation of drought as well wen et al 2011 studies have demonstrated that the groundwater consumption consisted of over 50 of the water supply and most of it was used for agricultural irrigation especially for the north china plain which had experienced groundwater over exploitation for agricultural irrigation and urbanization since the 1960s zheng et al 2010 cao et al 2014 groundwater depth in chengde showed an obvious decrease from 2003 to 2010 with 6 83 m to 6 92 m caused by the depletion of groundwater yuan et al 2013 moreover the upstream area of lrb is a typical agricultural area where arable area was increased from 1655 km2 to 1726 km2 while the yield output per centare has increased nearly 2 times during 1980 2015 fig 7 the increase in agricultural area and corresponding food production growth might also contribute to the increase of propagation time in the midstream and downstream parts fig 6 c d e f the correlation between spi n and sri 1 became weaker especially in the dry season from january to june the propagation time from meteorological drought to hydrological drought was shortened by 1 2 months in most of the months october to april in flood season the propagation time of drought decreased from 11 months to 1 month in july in downstream and from 11 months to 2 months in august in midstream as shown in fig 8 the gross domestic product gdp increased by 24 48 billion yuan decade which was mostly concentrated in stage ⅱ from 3 47 to 140 39 billion yuan while the urban population of the study area increased by 0 62 million decade in chengde from 1960 to 2016 the increase of gdp and population in chengde enhanced the industrial and domestic water consumption in the downstream part of lrb after the launch of the reform and opening up policy in 1978 in china li et al 2016 the increasing consumption of water resources by human activities had caused weakening of the link between meteorological drought and hydrological drought in midstream and downstream parts especially in january june with less precipitation during meteorological drought the recharge of water from precipitation became too low to meet domestic industrial and agricultural demand therefore one would use engineering measures such as reservoir regulation and water transfer to ensure the security of public water supplies which would weaken the correlation between meteorological drought and hydrological drought moreover the increase in water depletion from the river will also increase the risk of hydrological drought this phenomenon was more obvious in hot summers when the water consumption reached the highest at the same time the expansion of the urban city area has increased the impervious area which changed the hydrological process of runoff in the study area and shortened the propagation time of the drought it is also noted that reservoirs might play a role in the variation of hydrological process in the downstream area fig 1 in 1979 panjiakou reservoir and daheiting reservoir in the mainstream part of luanhe river were put into operation successively with a total reservoir capacity of 2 93 109 m3 and 3 37 108 m3 respectively wang et al 2019 therefore the alteration of the propagation process from meteorological to hydrological droughts between two stages can also be attributed to the operation of large reservoirs the period of long propagation time and weak correlation coefficients from february to may in stage i were extended to june in stage ii since the effects of reservoirs on drought transmission are mainly concentrated in the dry season wang et al 2019 their regulation of runoff might alter the relationship between precipitation and runoff in the dry season and shorten the drought process wu et al 2018 4 conclusion in the human influence era understanding how changing environments affects the propagation of drought is important to mitigate the damage caused by extreme events this study compared drought propagation processes in different periods in sub basins to characterize the tempo spatial propagation of drought in lrb the drought propagation time was obtained by the spearman correlation coefficient of sri 1 and spi n the following conclusions can be drawn from the study 1 during 1960 2016 meteorological drought events are generally evenly distributed in the lrb with more hydrological drought episodes after the 1980s seasonality of drought showed that the correlation of spi n and sri 1 was higher in the rainy season july december than in the dry season january june the corresponding propagation time increased from 1 to 12 months from july to the next june 2 in the pre human disturbance period stage i the drought propagation process was mainly affected by catchment characteristics the propagation time of meteorological drought to hydrological drought was shorter in grassland dominated subbasin 1 5 months than in forest dominated subbasin 4 7 months in july december the drought propagation time in three subbasins during the january june was 7 12 months 3 under the influence of changing environment stage ii human activities interfered with the natural circulation process and weakened the link between meteorological drought and hydrological drought the change of drought propagation time in three subbasins indicated the impact of human activities on drought propagation agricultural activities have increased the drought propagation time in december july the increase in the domestic water supply and the expansion of urban area would shorten the drought propagation time in october to april by 1 2 months moreover the construction and regulation of reservoirs could also shorten it results of drought characteristics and propagation processes in this study are expected to be helpful for the future development of drought warning systems for better drought preparedness there are still some uncertainties in the study of factors affecting drought propagation time because of the underlying complexities of influencing factors it is difficult to accurately identify or disentangle the influence of each factor at the same time due to the lack of statistical data in subbasins the impact of

6032,the objective of this study was to evaluate the hydrologic performance of gridded precipitation datasets for streamflow simulation in ethiopia four products are prominent in the literature namely climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr climate hazards group infra red precipitation with station chirps precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks climate data record persiann cdr and tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm 3b42 version 7 3b42v7 the datasets from these products were compared statistically with the gauge observation dataset furthermore the hydrologic performance of the products was evaluated using the soil and water assessment tool swat hydrologic model in two watersheds of the lake ziway basin four statistical and three contingency indices were used to compare the precipitation products statistically and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias pbias and the ratio of mean square error rsr were used to compare streamflow simulations all the satellite based precipitation products chirps persiann cdr and trmm performed well for monthly streamflow simulations for both watersheds the reanalysis product cfsr performed the worst with high mean error me and relative bias ratio bias the high me and bias values of cfsr adversely affected the hydrologic performance and resulted in unsatisfactory streamflow simulation performance of the chirps precipitation product in capturing daily and monthly streamflows showed that it can provide valuable precipitation estimates for use as input in hydrologic models in data sparse regions of developing countries such as ethiopia keywords swat lake ziway cfsr persiann cdr chirps trmm 3b42v7 1 introduction changes in land use and climate variability and the lack of formal policies on water use are the main factors affecting the assessment of water resources in the central rift valley basin of ethiopia distributed hydrologic models play an important role in the assessment of water resources in large basins meng et al 2014 the semi distributed hydrologic model soil and water assessment tool swat is one of such models designed to study the impact of land use and land management changes on water resources arnold et al 1998 srinivasan et al 1998 precipitation is one of the most important inputs in hydrologic models such as swat sorooshian et al 2011 because precipitation is highly variable spatially and temporally high temporal and spatial resolution data are required for accurate hydrologic modeling duan and bastiaanssen 2013 direct and accurate measurement of precipitation can generally be obtained from conventional weather stations however sparsely distributed rain gauge stations can result in spatially poor representation of precipitation javanmard et al 2010 lack of high resolution spatially and temporally precipitation data can lead to poor quality hydrologic simulations beven and westerberg 2011 and inappropriate solutions to water resources problems in developing countries of tropical regions such as ethiopia lack of financial and technical resources result in rain gauge networks that are sparsely distributed this results in lack of accurate precipitation data for hydrologic modeling and other purposes hughes 2006 fortunately precipitation temperature and evapotranspiration data needed for hydrologic modeling are being provided by various organizations using satellite based remote sensing products wood et al 2011 global or quasi global scale gridded precipitation products with various temporal and spatial resolutions have been generated in the last few decades tapiador et al 2012 however regional variability in the performance of gridded precipitation products is very high because of the a errors inherent in satellite based datasets villarini et al 2009 and b uncertainties resulting from the sampling techniques used nijssen and lettenmaier 2004 therefore there is a need to assess the performance suitability and accuracy of these products in various regions before they can be used in hydrologic modeling and water resources decision making the use of gridded precipitation products as input in the swat model has been studied recently for instance roth and lemann 2016 compared the applicability of the conventional rain gauge stations and climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr data in simulating discharge and soil loss in ethiopian watersheds of the blue nile basin they showed that the conventional rain gauge data resulted in better performance as compared to the cfsr data whereas fuka et al 2014 concluded that streamflow simulated using cfsr products in four watersheds of the united states and one watershed of ethiopia provided as good as or better results than modeling using data from conventional rain gauge stations li et al 2018 evaluated the adequacy of the tropical rainfall measuring mission version 7 real time trmm 3b42rt and post real time trmm 3b42 precipitation products in driving hydrologic models of the tiaoxi catchment in china analysis of the results for the temporal spatial and rainfall intensity for these two products demonstrated that the trmm 3b42 data had a better correlation with the rain gauge data than the trmm 3b42rt data furthermore the trmm 3b42rt data produced unsatisfactory hydrologic simulation results both at monthly and daily scales whereas the trmm 3b42 data produced a good fit at the monthly scale statistical and hydrologic performance of the trmm 3b42v6 and trmm 3b42v7 satellite precipitation products were studied by xue et al 2013 for the wangchu basin of bhutan statistical comparison of the two products showed that the trmm 3b42v7 product is an improvement upon the trmm 3b42v6 product both at the 0 25 0 25 degree grid cell and whole basin scales from the hydrologic evaluation it was observed that the unsatisfactory goodness of fit for the trmm 3b42v6 product resulted when the hydrologic model was calibrated using the in situ rain gauge data the results from the hydrologic model improved significantly when it was calibrated using the satellite precipitation estimates however the trmm 3b42v7 product performed fairly well in both scenarios zhu et al 2016 compared the performance of the cfsr precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks climate data record persiann cdr and trmm 3b42v7 precipitation products in the xiang and qu river basins of china they found that at the daily time scale persiann cdr and at the monthly time scale trmm 3b42v7 product resulted in better discharge predictions the performance of the cfsr precipitation product varied between different basins for a better understanding of the performance of the gridded precipitation products at different elevations the products need to be evaluated in areas with high altitude yong et al 2010 moreover assessing the application of these products for streamflow simulations in data scarce countries such as ethiopia is important for proper management of the limited water resources available in these countries among the many available widely used precipitation datasets with high spatial and temporal resolution data four leading products were selected for this study the products included climate hazards group infra red precipitation with station chirps cfsr persiann cdr and trmm 3b42v7 the chirps precipitation estimate is a recently released dataset designed to take into account precipitation pattern and complex topographic characteristics of countries such as ethiopia in addition a long period of record high resolution 0 25 and 0 05 and relatively low latency of the chirps product make it the preferred dataset for hydrologic modeling persiann real time trmm 3b42rt and post real time trmm 3b42 precipitation products are widely used satellite based precipitation products persiann cdr and trmm 3b42v7 precipitation products are the latest versions of these satellite products and their hydrologic performance have not yet been well evaluated the three satellite based precipitation products chirps persiann cdr and trmm 3b42v7 selected use gauge based estimates and provide high spatial resolution 0 25 products cfsr was selected because of its long period of record high spatial resolution free availability and ease of use with the swat model it is worthwhile to note that as far as we are presently aware very few studies have been conducted to evaluate the accuracy and applicability of the chirps and persiann cdr precipitation estimates because these datasets became available only recently hence the assessment of the applicability of these precipitation products with the swat hydrologic model for streamflow simulation is a new area of study especially in ethiopia therefore the objectives of this study were to i compare the four gridded precipitation products against the rain gauge observations at the daily dekadal and monthly timescales ii evaluate their precipitation detection capabilities for different threshold values and iii determine the applicability of the datasets in simulating streamflow in two watersheds of the lake ziway basin ethiopia using the swat model 2 study area lake ziway fig 1 is located in the central rift valley basin of ethiopia which is part of the great east african rift valley it is a natural lake located at an elevation of 1638 m above sea level having an average depth of 4 m and an area of about 435 km2 among the lakes found in the rift valley of ethiopia lake ziway is the only fresh water lake suitable for fish farming the meki and ketar rivers are the two main upstream sources of fresh water to the lake and the bulbula river drains the overflow to the downstream terminal lake abayata lake ziway basin is located between 38 12 36 e to 39 24 36 e longitude and 7 22 12 n to 8 28 12 n latitude covering a total area of 7311 km2 including the lake the meki watershed is located on the west side of the lake covering an area of 2224 km2 including the western highlands a large portion of this watershed is found in the rift floor while the ketar watershed covers an area of 3282 km2 mainly characterized as the eastern highlands of the basin only a small part of the watershed around the outlet is found in the rift floor fig 1 the climatic conditions in lake ziway basin vary significantly across time and space average daily temperature varies from about 16 0c in the western and eastern highland parts of the basin to 21 c in the lowland parts found around the lake getnet et al 2014 the mean annual rainfall over the entire basin is about 900 mm year which varies from 700 mm year at the rift floor to 1200 mm year in some regions with higher altitude according to pascual ferrer et al 2014 about 59 of the precipitation falls during the main monsoon season between june to september 28 occurs in the minor rainfall months starting from march to may and the remaining 13 of the precipitation occurs during the dry season of the region actual evapotranspiration data varying from 650 mm year in the rift floor to 900 mm year in the eastern and western highlands were recorded in the years 1994 and 1995 ayenew 2003 an estimated 1800 mm year of water is also being lost from lake ziway due to evaporation vallet coulomb et al 2001 3 methods and materials this study presents the comparison and application of gridded precipitation datasets using a physically based swat model to estimate streamflow in lake ziway basin the study involved calibration sensitivity and uncertainty analysis and validation of the hydrologic model using the observed weather data for this purpose the swat calibration and uncertainty programs swat cup sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 calibration and uncertainty analysis algorithm were applied the four gridded precipitation products were used to simulate streamflow in the two main upstream rivers of lake ziway it is understood that the gridded precipitation products are estimates and might be subjected to different sources of error which need to be evaluated direct quantification based on statistical indices and indirect inference based on modeling can generally be used to carry out the evaluation li et al 2015 according to bitew and gebremichael 2011a model based evaluation has two advantages first it is not subject to scale discrepancy since the gridded precipitation products are evaluated at the scale of the whole watershed the second advantage is that the output from the products is used as the forcing input to a specific application of the hydrologic model in this study the above mentioned four gridded precipitation products were first directly compared against rain gauge observations using performance indices and then used in a swat hydrologic model to simulate streamflow in the two main rivers meki and ketar of the basin to compare the hydrologic applicability of the four products the model performance using the gridded precipitation products was also evaluated using the streamflow performance assessment objectives rain gauge data for the nine stations located in the basin fig 1 were obtained from the national meteorological agency of ethiopia for the period from 1985 to 2004 the thiessen polygon method was used to calculate the average areal rainfall over the whole basin watersheds using arcgis to evaluate the gridded precipitation products a gridded precipitation datasets the four gridded precipitation products cfsr persiann cdr chirps and trmm 3b42v7 were evaluated in this study swat file formatted daily cfsr data can be freely downloaded from http globalweather tamu edu and it is easy to use as input to the swat model the persian cdr precipitation which is a multi satellite based high resolution product is a newly released dataset suitable specifically for long period hydrological modeling ashouri et al 2015 the chirps datasets available from 1981 to present with different formats time steps and spatial resolutions are developed for drought sensitive areas and tested in countries like ethiopia the trmm 3b42v7 has been providing valuable precipitation data ever since it was started in 1997 trmm uses precipitation radar pr to detect the structure of tropical storms and their intensity nastos et al 2016 previous studies have shown that the trmm 3b42v7 product results in good performance of hydrologic simulations the gridded precipitation products with their spatial and temporal distributions are described briefly in table 1 1 ncep cfsr cfsr dataset the national center for environmental prediction product cfsr is a 0 31 0 31 resolution reanalysis dataset that covers almost the whole globe it is available for the period 1979 to 2014 cfsr uses a 3d var data assimilation scheme and also the accuracy of the dataset has been improved by including the coupling of the atmosphere ocean land surface sea ice system essou et al 2017 since the atmospheric model generated precipitation is considered to be biased the land surface component does not use precipitation from this model saha et al 2010 cfsr uses precipitation from the noaa climate prediction center cpc and the cpc unified daily gauge analysis wang et al 2011 2 persiann cdr pcdr dataset the perciann cdr dataset consists of a 0 25 0 25 resolution daily precipitation estimates with global coverage of 60 n 60 s starting in 1983 the infrared information is converted into rainfall rates by training the artificial neural network ann model in the persiann algorithm passive microwave based precipitation estimates sourced by multiple satellites are used to train the ann model hsu et al 1997 the pcdr product belongs to the category of satellite gauge precipitation estimates category since the global precipitation climatology project gpcp monthly precipitation developed from the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc precipitation gauge dataset is used to reduce the biases in the persiann precipitation estimates adler et al 2003 3 chirps dataset the chirps dataset is a high resolution precipitation dataset available from 1981 to the present with quasi global coverage at the daily pentadal and monthly time scales funk et al 2015 version 2 of the atmospheric model rainfall field from the noaa climate forecast system cfs trmm 3b42v7 data monthly precipitation climatology data chpclim and rain gauge station s data are the datasets used to construct the chirps product duan et al 2016 chirps products which are in the satellite gauge category are available at 0 05 and 0 25 spatial resolutions the 0 25 resolution precipitation dataset was used and evaluated in this study 4 trmm 3b42v7 dataset the national aeronautics and space administration and the japan aerospace exploration agency produced the tmpa trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis precipitation products including trmm 3b42 for tropical and subtropical precipitation monitoring huffman et al 2007 the tmpa algorithm that combines precipitation estimates from microwave and infrared sensors and the gpcc monthly gauge analysis is applied in 3b42v7 duan et al 2016 the dataset used and evaluated in this study was the daily precipitation product data provided for the quasi global coverage of 50 n 50 s at a spatial resolution of 0 25 beginning in 1998 b approach and performance of gridded precipitation products the validation of gridded precipitation products can be done either by directly comparing the gridded products with the rain gauge networks or using a hydrologic model and evaluating the ability of the products to prediction streamflows the approach used in this study was to compare the precipitation products directly with observed precipitation data and then to use the products to predict streamflow the accuracy of the gridded precipitation products was quantified using correlation coefficient cc root mean square error rmse mean error me and relative bias bias given in eqs 1 to 4 in addition contingency scores using the number of hits a false alarm b and miss c given in eqs 5 to 7 were also computed and used as verification wilks 2006 cc measures the degree of linear correlation between the gridded datasets and gauge observed precipitations the me and rmse measure the average difference and average error respectively bias reflects the relative degree of systematic error in precipitation estimates for perfect correlation cc is one and the errors of the other parameters are zero the probability of detection pod also known as the hit rate describes the fraction of the observed events that were correctly estimated by the precipitation product evaluated based on the given threshold values false alarm ratio far measures the fraction of false alarms detected by the product that was actually not observed the hit rate and false alarm ratios are combined into one score using the critical success index csi that shows the evaluation of the overall rain detecting skill of the precipitation product as compared to the observed precipitation nastos et al 2016 the scores range from 0 to 1 for pod and csi representing the poor and good ends respectively and from 1 to 0 at the poor and good ends for far 1 cc i 1 n g i g s i s i 1 n g i g 2 i 1 n s i s 2 2 rmse 1 n i 1 n s i g i 2 3 me 1 n i n n s i g i 4 bias i 1 n s i g i i 1 n g i

of agriculture it is a physically based semi distributed hydrologic model arnold et al 1998 which can be applied to simulate continuous flows in a watershed or to derive a spatially distributed model at the river basin scale in fact the swat was developed with the capability to study large and complex watersheds having varying land use soil and slope classes under different management conditions the swat can evaluate the long term impacts of different land management practices on water quantity quality and sediment yield neitsch et al 2011 in such a model a watershed is divided into a number of sub basins which are further sub divided into hydrologic response units hrus the model uses a water balance equation to simulate the hydrological cycle and to predict the hydrology in each hru different model components and the hydrological equations used are described in detail in the swat documentation neitsch et al 2011 the national aeronautics and space administration shuttle radar topographic mission 30m resolution digital elevation model of the study area was downloaded from https earthexplorer usgs gov and used by the authors to extract the required watershed characteristics the land use classification was prepared from the land cover data obtained from the ethiopian ministry of water resources the soil properties database was obtained from the harmonized world soil database http www fao org data en discharge data from the two rivers in the basin were obtained from the ethiopian ministry of water resources hydrology department the discharge data from meki and ketar stations were used for calibration 1980 1994 including the warming up period and validation 1995 2004 of the swat model these calibration and validation periods were selected based on the availability of data observed temperature and precipitation data used for driving the hydrologic model were provided by the ethiopian national meteorological agency in order to have basin specific and optimal parameters for each watershed swat cup was used to calibrate the model abbaspour et al 2007 sufi 2 was selected from the different analysis techniques built into swat cup statistical indices used to assess the hydrologic model performance were nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the coefficient of determination r2 percent bias pbias and the ratio of mean square error to the standard deviation of the measured data rsr eqs 8 11 were used to determine these statistical objective functions respectively details of these measures are explained by moriasi et al 2007 8 nse 1

discharge o is average measured discharge s is average simulated discharge and n is the number of observations in order to evaluate the performance of the streamflow simulation generated by the gridded precipitation products the hydrologic model needs to be calibrated using either the gridded precipitation datasets or the rain gauge data then the calibrated model is used to simulate streamflow using precipitation data from rain gauge stations and gridded product datasets separately and the results are compared with the observed streamflow according to previous studies calibrating the swat model using the precipitation products resulted in a slightly higher accuracy of the streamflow simulations but the simulations obtained using the two calibration strategies were virtually the same with negligible difference between the accuracy parameters zhu et al 2016 however the presence of large errors in the rainfall data of the gridded precipitation datasets could result in unrealistic model parameter values during the calibration process as the model tries to compensate for the errors habib et al 2014 hence in our study the model was first calibrated using the rain gauge data and then simulated with the gridded products 4 results a evaluation of gridded precipitation products in this study the capability of four gridded precipitation products as input to a popular hydrologic model swat for simulating streamflow was evaluated and compared to identify the best gridded precipitation product the precipitation products were first compared directly against the rain gauge precipitation in the basin according to yong et al 2014 comparing gridded precipitation products directly against the rain gauge data which are at the point scale may lead to evaluation errors because of the differences in scales between them on the other hand interpolation of rain gauge data to a gridded dataset or the opposite can result in additional errors miao et al 2015 yang et al 2016 therefore in this study comparison of the selected precipitation products against the rain gauge data was done using areally averaged precipitation data since this approach is more meaningful for hydrologic applications meng et al 2014 the evaluation was done using the data for the period from 1998 to 2004 for the trmm 3b42v7 dataset and from 1985 to 2004 for all others 1 a general comparison of the precipitation datasets box plots of the gridded precipitation products and the rain gauge datasets showed significant differences in monthly rainfall amounts and patterns fig 2 for a better understanding we broke the monthly data into three seasons and then assessed the rainfall datasets in each season the high rainfall season is from june to september the low rainfall season is from march to may and the dry season is from october to february for the ketar watershed the persiann cdr and chirps products correctly represented the timing of the rainy season the precipitation amounts for the chirps product were similar to the rain gauge measured values throughout the rainy season however the persian cdr product overestimated the precipitation amount especially in the months of july and august by about 230 mm on average and underestimated in the low rain season march to may despite the fact that the comparison period for the trmm 3b42v7 product was shorter as compared to the other products the timing of the rainy season was well represented by the trmm 3b42v7 product also the precipitation amounts estimated by this product were similar to the measured values and those estimated by the chirps product the cfsr products satisfactorily represented the timing of the rainy season however precipitation amounts were overestimated in the months of july and august by about 260 mm on average and underestimated in the low rain season about 50 mm on average for the meki watershed representation of the timing of the rainy season by the cfsr product was satisfactory but the precipitation amounts were underestimated throughout the rainy seasons persiann cdr product s representation of the timing of the rainy season and estimation of the precipitation amounts were better than for the other datasets chirps product slightly overestimated precipitation values for the rainy season months of july and august and underestimated in the low rain season from march to may however its representation of the timing of the rainy season was good the trmm 3b42v7 product slightly overestimated precipitation amounts in almost all of the months including the dry season the representation of the timing of the rainy season by this product was better than cfsr but not as good as persiann cdr and chirps 2 statistical comparison of the precipitation products i daily comparison daily precipitation estimates from the gridded precipitation products were compared against the rain gauge data the statistical indices cc rmse me and bias and contingency scores csi far and pod are summarized in table 2 all the gridded products scored small linear correlations with the rain gauged data persiann cdr and trmm 3b42v7 have better correlations as compared to the other products the values of me and bias indicated that chirps has the closest agreement with the rain gauge data 2 90 mm day and 3 48 mm day of me and 3 47 and 4 43 of bias for the ketar and meki watersheds respectively persiann cdr showed better skill at detecting rain events with higher pod and csi values and relatively average values of far chirps exhibits the least skill in detecting rain events with small pod and csi values however it scored better on far with smaller values cfsr showed good skill at detecting rain events and it also scored the best on far trmm 3b42v7 exhibits highest pod and far values and small csi values ii dekadal comparison the statistical measures obtained by comparing the dekadal ten days gridded precipitation products with rain gauge data are plotted in fig 3 the results show a better agreement between the gridded products and rain gauge data for the meki watershed as compared to the similar data for ketar watershed for both the watersheds higher cc 0 74 and 0 81 respectively for the ketar and meki watersheds values were obtained when the chirps product dataset was compared with the observed data the lowest cc 0 63 and 0 61 respectively for the ketar and meki watersheds values were scored by cfsr the chirps product also had the best linear correlation and low rmse values of 33 97 mm dekad and 31 12 mm dekad respectively for the ketar and meki watersheds the cfsr product had the highest rmse values of 50 55 mm dekad and 46 70 mm dekad respectively for these watersheds fig 4 shows the scatter plots of the dekadal precipitation of the gridded precipitation products versus the rain gauge data the chirps product scored the highest r2 values 0 55 and 0 65 respectively for the kater and meki watersheds persiann cdr performed better than trmm 3b42v7 with values of r2 0 51 and r2 0 64 respectively the cfsr product scored the least r2 0 4 and r2 0 37 iii monthly comparison in general as shown in fig 5 very good agreements between the four gridded precipitation products datasets and the gauge data were found using cc for both watersheds the values ranged from 0 77 to 0 91 and from 0 73 to 0 95 respectively for the meki and ketar watersheds the cfsr had the minimum cc 0 73 and 0 77 respectively values the chirps and trmm 3b42v7 scored the highest cc 0 91 and 0 95 respectively values for the ketar watershed chirps product had the best agreement with the gauged observations with an rmse value of 26 14 mm month the values of me and bias indicated that the cfsr dataset had the closest agreement with the gauge measurements the persiann cdr product overestimated precipitation for the meki watershed the trmm 3b42v7 dataset had the smallest average error with the rmse value of 22 33 mm month the chirps and cfsr products underestimated precipitation for both the watersheds the cfsr dataset had the highest rmse values 63 3 mm month and 66 01 mm month respectively for the ketar and meki watersheds the lowest me and bias values of chirps indicated that the product had the closest agreement with the gauge data from the scatter plots shown in fig 6 it can be observed that the chirps and trmm 3b42v7 products scored the highest correlation r2 0 83 and r2 0 91 and cfsr scored the lowest r2 0 59 and r2 0 52 correlation for the ketar and meki watersheds respectively iv precipitation thresholds detection comparison to further evaluate the gridded precipitation products the three contingency indices pod far and csi were assessed using different precipitation thresholds to evaluate the light and heavy daily precipitation events detection ability of the gridded products mean daily precipitation thresholds of 0 5 mm 1 mm 2 mm 5 mm and 10 mm were used to calculate the contingency indices the values of pod far and csi showing the performance of the four gridded products at different thresholds are plotted in fig 7 for the ketar watershed when the daily precipitation threshold value was 0 5 mm day the persiann cdr and trmm 3b42v7 products had higher pod greater than 80 and csi greater than 60 values whereas the chirps product had lower pod greater than 64 and csi greater than 52 values when the daily precipitation threshold value was greater than 10 mm day the smallest pod of 22 and csi of 12 were obtained for the chirps product the trmm 3b42v7 product also had the lowest far greater than 68 value whereas the other products scored far values greater than 78 for the meki watershed when the daily precipitation threshold was 0 5 mm day the persiann cdr product had higher pod 82 and csi greater than 61 values whereas the cfsr product had the lowest pod greater than 58 and csi greater than 52 values when the daily precipitation threshold was greater than 10 mm day the highest pod of 34 and csi of 18 were obtained for the chirps product followed by the trmm 3b42v7 product while the smallest was obtained for cfsr b swat model calibration and validation twenty seven hydrological parameters were selected for calibration and validation of the swat model for streamflow simulation discharge data for the period 1980 1994 were used for the calibration of the model in both watersheds and 1995 2004 and 1995 2001 for validation in the ketar and meki watersheds respectively the calibration and validation periods were selected based on the availability of continuous discharge data in both watersheds swat cup was used for the calibration and uncertainty analysis of the model the most sensitive parameters and their fitted values were identified separately and found to be different for the two watersheds the sensitive parameters obtained by the sufi 2 algorithm in swat cup for the ketar watershed are shown in table 3 calibration and validation of the model were carried out by comparing observed discharges at the ketar and meki gauging stations with the simulated streamflows model performance results for the daily calibration and validation of the watersheds are shown in table 4 the plots of the observed and simulated monthly flows for the ketar and meki watersheds are shown in figs 8 and 9 respectively it can be observed from the table and figures that although the peak streamflows were not simulated well because of the factors such as an uneven representation of the spatial distribution of precipitation the model simulations of the observed discharges were good the observed and simulated monthly streamflows for the ketar watershed showed good agreement with the nse pbias rsr and r2 values of 0 68 4 56 0 57 and 0 68 respectively for the calibration period and 0 67 23 37 0 58 and 0 69 respectively for the validation period for the meki watershed the model simulated streamflows were very good with nse pbias rsr and r2 values of 0 75 4 51 0 50 and 0 79 respectively for the calibration period and 0 60 23 33 0 64 and 0 80 respectively for the validation period c evaluation and comparison of streamflow simulations i daily streamflow validation precipitation data from the four gridded precipitation products and the rain gauge measurements were used in the calibrated swat model to validate the streamflow simulations at the daily and monthly scales figs 10 and 11 show the daily streamflow validations of the four gridded precipitation products for the ketar and meki watersheds respectively the three precipitation products cfsr chirps and persiann cdr were evaluated for the validation period from 1985 to 2004 since the trmm 3b42v7 precipitation dataset dates in 1998 we found it ideal to evaluate the performance of the four products additionally for the period from 1998 to 2004 the chirps product resulted in satisfactory nse 0 51 and 0 55 respectively rsr 0 70 and 0 67 respectively and pbias 21 4 and 13 4 respectively values for the ketar and meki watersheds when the whole validation period was considered the trmm 3b42v7 product also resulted in satisfactory nse 0 57 rsr 0 65 and pbias 3 9 values for the ketar watershed and unsatisfactory nse 0 47 rsr 0 73 and pbias 38 1 values for the meki watershed during the 1998 2004 validation period persiann cdr precipitation generated daily simulation resulted in an unsatisfactory nse 0 44 and 0 42 respectively rsr 0 75 and 0 76 respectively and pbias 43 2 and 41 6 respectively values for the ketar and meki watersheds cfsr resulted in the least representative daily simulation with nse 0 69 rsr 1 30 and pbias 124 4 for the ketar watershed and nse 0 07 rsr 0 96 and pbias 66 1 for the meki watershed ii monthly streamflow validation the monthly streamflows simulated using the four gridded precipitation products were compared and validated with the gauge discharge observations as shown in figs 12 and 13 for both watersheds the swat model driven by the dataset simulated by cfsr generated the least representative streamflows with the smallest and negative nse values and high rsr values of 0 94 and 1 06 for the ketar and meki watersheds respectively the cfsr dataset also overestimated monthly streamflows with pbias of 62 83 for the ketar watershed and underestimated with pbias values of 76 64 for the meki watershed for both of the watersheds the trmm 3b42v7 product performed the second best for the validation period from 1998 to 2004 following the chirps product it resulted in high nse 0 70 and 0 63 respectively values and a low rsr 0 55 and 0 61 respectively values for the ketar and meki watersheds it also resulted in remarkably small pbias 7 9 and 11 13 respectively values for these watersheds the chirps product outperformed the remaining two products for both watersheds the monthly streamflow simulated by the chirps dataset showed good efficiency with nse value of 0 71 and rsr value of 0 54 for the ketar watershed and with a slightly high negative value of pbias 16 42 it also showed satisfactory efficiency with nse value of 0 60 and rsr value of 0 63 for the meki watershed with a relatively better value of pbias 12 30 the monthly streamflows simulated with the persiann cdr dataset resulted in an acceptable model efficiency with nse value of 0 65 and rsr value of 0 59 for the ketar watershed but with a relatively larger pbias of 21 70 and its performance for the meki watershed was fair with nse and rsr values of 0 50 and 0 70 respectively and a high positive pbias 18 80 5 discussion this study compares four high resolution gridded precipitation datasets against the rain gauge data the hydrologic performances of the datasets in simulating streamflows are evaluated in two watersheds of the lake ziway basin in ethiopia the two opposite facing watersheds ketar and meki with highly varying topography on the western and eastern sides of lake ziway can be taken as good representatives of ethiopian watersheds from fig 1 it can be observed that the meki watershed on the western side of the lake has a higher density of rain gauging stations and flat topography while the mountainous part of the basin with higher elevations are mainly found in the ketar watershed where the density of ground observations is low since gauged precipitation datasets are employed in the production of the selected gridded precipitation datasets station density and topography play an important role in the quality of products statistical evaluations of gridded precipitation datasets have been conducted on small to large scale areas in a number of studies beck et al 2017 duan et al 2016 moazami et al 2016 in addition hydrologic evaluations of gridded precipitation estimates have also been studied in different watersheds behrangi et al 2011 tuo et al 2016 zhu et al 2018 however a limited number of studies have been conducted to simultaneously evaluate the statistical and hydrologic performance of gridded precipitation datasets zhu et al 2016 in a country with a complex topography and a deeply convective and mostly bimodal precipitation system such as ethiopia direct comparison of precipitation products against the rain gauge data can be significantly supported by the hydrologic evaluation bayissa et al 2017 evaluated the performance of five satellite based rainfall datasets to monitor meteorological drought in the ethiopian blue nile basin and concluded that the chirps product performed the best at the dekadal monthly and seasonal time scales similarly the daily dekadal and monthly cc me and bias values in our study also show that the chirps product outperformed the other three precipitation products the good statistical performance of the product can be attributed to its design objective which is to monitor droughts in countries like ethiopia the statistical indices cc rmse me and bias of the four precipitation products demonstrated that the three satellite based products performed better than the reanalysis cfsr product for both the watersheds the cfsr product underestimated precipitation amounts in the meki watershed and overestimated in the ketar watershed this resulted in high values of me and bias indicating that although the product was able to capture precipitation patterns the precipitation amounts were highly biased comparing cfsr precipitation with the conventional rain gauge data on selected ethiopian watersheds roth and lemann 2016 also showed that the cfsr product was unable to represent precipitation variability fuka et al 2014 also recommended further studies before blindly accepting cfsr rainfall data as an input to hydrologic models the poor statistical performance of the cfsr product in this study also affected the hydrologic simulation of streamflow the high negative me and bias values for the meki watershed resulted in very low streamflows and unsatisfactory high pbias the increased precipitation amounts also resulted in streamflow having higher peak flows than the observed flows for the ketar watershed these results indicate that although cfsr dataset is valuable in data sparse countries such as ethiopia because of its global availability and free access it needs to be used with caution the main reason for the cfsr product to perform poorly in our study could be related to the prediction accuracy of the regional weather which is strongly dependent on the geographical factors that control the atmospheric circulation by the atmospheric models used to derive the reanalysis precipitation products monteiro et al 2016 statistical evaluation of the three satellite based precipitation products chirps persiann cdr and trmm 3b42v7 revealed that the performances of the products were similar with high values of cc and low values of me and bias for both watersheds however in general satellite precipitation products are more reliable in flat terrain regions than in mountainous regions derin and yilmaz 2014 tian and peters lidard 2010 zhu et al 2016 accordingly all the satellite precipitation products had high cc and low rmse in the relatively flat meki watershed than the ketar watershed trmm 3b42v7 s monthly correlation performance was better than the daily correlation performance as compared to the persiann cdr product which performed better at the daily scale this also indicates that a better correlation at the daily scale may not confirm the same at the monthly scale and it also showed that using monthly rain gauge data to adjust the bias cannot guarantee improved estimates of daily precipitation li et al 2015 li et al 2013 yong et al 2014 comparing the daily timescale contingency statistical indices pod far and csi for the whole basin scale demonstrated that unlike other results with the lowest far cfsr performed well in detecting rain events the persiann cdr and trmm 3b42v7 products scored high contingency indices but with higher far values dinku et al 2010 obtained the same result for the relatively wet regions of africa and stated that the satellite products detect rains that do not reach the ground the pod and csi values of all the gridded precipitation products for the daily threshold values indicate that the overall precipitation detection skill of the products decreases as precipitation threshold increases this shows that both the satellite and reanalysis precipitation products are not good at accurately capturing the magnitude of intense precipitation events all the gridded precipitation products also resulted in almost uniform precipitation detection capability for the mountainous ketar watershed than the relatively flat terrain meki fig 7 although the statistical correlations of the satellite products show similar results the products performed differently in streamflow simulations the chirps and trmm 3b42v7 products performed better than the poorly distributed gauging station data both for the daily and monthly streamflow simulations of the ketar watershed however despite its good spatial distribution the persiann cdr product was not able to perform better than the station data for the monthly streamflow simulations this can be attributed to the relatively high monthly statistical me 7 88 and bias 9 94 values of the product our results also confirm the conclusion made by zhu et al 2016 which is that bias and me of precipitation estimates determine the accuracy of streamflow simulation by a model the reason given for the conclusion according to su et al 2008 was related to the nonlinearity of the hydrologic process where precipitation bias can be transformed into larger pbias in streamflow simulation although the daily scale statistical performance of the persiann cdr product was better the daily streamflow simulated by the product resulted in unsatisfactory nse rsr and pbias values in addition despite the good statistical performance of the satellite based products for the flat terrain in the meki watershed the relatively well distributed station data results in better streamflow simulations than all the gridded precipitation products the persiann cdr product performed poor and unsatisfactory streamflow simulations at the monthly and daily validations respectively the higher statistical me and bias values of trmm 3b42v7 as compared to chirps also resulted in lower daily and monthly streamflow validation performances for the meki watershed this also indicates that the hydrologic performance evaluation results of the satellite products depend more on gauging station distribution than the terrain of the study area from the statistical and hydrologic evaluations and the preceding discussions it can be observed that the performances of the four gridded precipitation estimates have considerable differences among the satellite precipitation products the chirps dataset performed the best both in the statistical comparisons and in the daily and monthly streamflow simulations for both watersheds better performance of the microwave based retrieval algorithm derived trmm 3b42v7 compared to the infrared based algorithm derived persiann cdr in mountainous regions like the watersheds in our study has also been shown by previous studies bitew and gebremichael 2010 bitew and gebremichael 2011b hirpa et al 2010 hong et al 2007 the good performance of the chirps product for the ketar watershed indicates that the product can be used for daily and monthly hydrologic modeling not only in the data scarce areas of ethiopia but also in areas where the density and distribution of ground observations are unsatisfactory however overall our results indicated that all the satellite based precipitation estimates can be used to generate inputs for hydrologic models for monthly streamflow simulation in areas with spares rain gauge data and also the better performance of these estimates might be achieved if the hydrologic models are calibrated using the estimated datasets from the gridded precipitation products 6 conclusions this study assessed the statistical performance of the cfsr gridded precipitation dataset and three satellite based precipitation estimates chirps persiann cdr and trmm 3b42v7 and compared their performances in predicting time series rainfall recorded at rain gauges over two adjacent and opposite facing watersheds of the lake ziway basin ethiopia the ultimate goal of our analysis was to evaluate and compare the hydrologic performance of the precipitation products as input to the swat model for streamflow simulation in the lake ziway basin our findings are summarized as follows 1 all the satellite based precipitation products considered in our study showed better statistical performance with higher correlation and lower error values than the reanalysis cfsr product the satellite derived products also performed better in flat terrain than in the mountainous watershed meanwhile the reverse was true for the cfsr product 2 the persiann cdr and trmm 3b42v7 products were reliable in simulating streamflow at the monthly scale and the daily performance of trmm 3b42v7 was nearly satisfactory both products can be used as input to hydrologic models for monthly streamflow simulations in data sparse areas the trmm 3b42v7 product can also give useful results for daily streamflow simulation if the other parameters and inputs of the model are good and representative 3 the chirps product performed the best both in statistical and hydrologic evaluations over the two watersheds it also performed well as input in the hydrologic model to simulate streamflow both at the daily and monthly scales the chirps product can be used as the best substitute not only in data scarce regions of ethiopia but also in areas where the spatial distribution of gauging stations is poor 4 finally we note that the statistical comparison and hydrologic evaluation results of the gridded precipitation products over the two watersheds in our study might be applicable to areas where data is scarce and where the watersheds have relatively similar climate and topographical characteristics we recommend further studies and analysis of the chirps product using more watersheds from different parts of ethiopia since this product can be a promising alternative to fill the precipitation data gap in the country since we are in the new era of global precipitation measurement gpm based precipitation data hydrologic evaluation of gpm based satellite estimates like imerg and gsmap can also be suggested for future research prakash et al

6032,the objective of this study was to evaluate the hydrologic performance of gridded precipitation datasets for streamflow simulation in ethiopia four products are prominent in the literature namely climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr climate hazards group infra red precipitation with station chirps precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks climate data record persiann cdr and tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm 3b42 version 7 3b42v7 the datasets from these products were compared statistically with the gauge observation dataset furthermore the hydrologic performance of the products was evaluated using the soil and water assessment tool swat hydrologic model in two watersheds of the lake ziway basin four statistical and three contingency indices were used to compare the precipitation products statistically and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias pbias and the ratio of mean square error rsr were used to compare streamflow simulations all the satellite based precipitation products chirps persiann cdr and trmm performed well for monthly streamflow simulations for both watersheds the reanalysis product cfsr performed the worst with high mean error me and relative bias ratio bias the high me and bias values of cfsr adversely affected the hydrologic performance and resulted in unsatisfactory streamflow simulation performance of the chirps precipitation product in capturing daily and monthly streamflows showed that it can provide valuable precipitation estimates for use as input in hydrologic models in data sparse regions of developing countries such as ethiopia keywords swat lake ziway cfsr persiann cdr chirps trmm 3b42v7 1 introduction changes in land use and climate variability and the lack of formal policies on water use are the main factors affecting the assessment of water resources in the central rift valley basin of ethiopia distributed hydrologic models play an important role in the assessment of water resources in large basins meng et al 2014 the semi distributed hydrologic model soil and water assessment tool swat is one of such models designed to study the impact of land use and land management changes on water resources arnold et al 1998 srinivasan et al 1998 precipitation is one of the most important inputs in hydrologic models such as swat sorooshian et al 2011 because precipitation is highly variable spatially and temporally high temporal and spatial resolution data are required for accurate hydrologic modeling duan and bastiaanssen 2013 direct and accurate measurement of precipitation can generally be obtained from conventional weather stations however sparsely distributed rain gauge stations can result in spatially poor representation of precipitation javanmard et al 2010 lack of high resolution spatially and temporally precipitation data can lead to poor quality hydrologic simulations beven and westerberg 2011 and inappropriate solutions to water resources problems in developing countries of tropical regions such as ethiopia lack of financial and technical resources result in rain gauge networks that are sparsely distributed this results in lack of accurate precipitation data for hydrologic modeling and other purposes hughes 2006 fortunately precipitation temperature and evapotranspiration data needed for hydrologic modeling are being provided by various organizations using satellite based remote sensing products wood et al 2011 global or quasi global scale gridded precipitation products with various temporal and spatial resolutions have been generated in the last few decades tapiador et al 2012 however regional variability in the performance of gridded precipitation products is very high because of the a errors inherent in satellite based datasets villarini et al 2009 and b uncertainties resulting from the sampling techniques used nijssen and lettenmaier 2004 therefore there is a need to assess the performance suitability and accuracy of these products in various regions before they can be used in hydrologic modeling and water resources decision making the use of gridded precipitation products as input in the swat model has been studied recently for instance roth and lemann 2016 compared the applicability of the conventional rain gauge stations and climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr data in simulating discharge and soil loss in ethiopian watersheds of the blue nile basin they showed that the conventional rain gauge data resulted in better performance as compared to the cfsr data whereas fuka et al 2014 concluded that streamflow simulated using cfsr products in four watersheds of the united states and one watershed of ethiopia provided as good as or better results than modeling using data from conventional rain gauge stations li et al 2018 evaluated the adequacy of the tropical rainfall measuring mission version 7 real time trmm 3b42rt and post real time trmm 3b42 precipitation products in driving hydrologic models of the tiaoxi catchment in china analysis of the results for the temporal spatial and rainfall intensity for these two products demonstrated that the trmm 3b42 data had a better correlation with the rain gauge data than the trmm 3b42rt data furthermore the trmm 3b42rt data produced unsatisfactory hydrologic simulation results both at monthly and daily scales whereas the trmm 3b42 data produced a good fit at the monthly scale statistical and hydrologic performance of the trmm 3b42v6 and trmm 3b42v7 satellite precipitation products were studied by xue et al 2013 for the wangchu basin of bhutan statistical comparison of the two products showed that the trmm 3b42v7 product is an improvement upon the trmm 3b42v6 product both at the 0 25 0 25 degree grid cell and whole basin scales from the hydrologic evaluation it was observed that the unsatisfactory goodness of fit for the trmm 3b42v6 product resulted when the hydrologic model was calibrated using the in situ rain gauge data the results from the hydrologic model improved significantly when it was calibrated using the satellite precipitation estimates however the trmm 3b42v7 product performed fairly well in both scenarios zhu et al 2016 compared the performance of the cfsr precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks climate data record persiann cdr and trmm 3b42v7 precipitation products in the xiang and qu river basins of china they found that at the daily time scale persiann cdr and at the monthly time scale trmm 3b42v7 product resulted in better discharge predictions the performance of the cfsr precipitation product varied between different basins for a better understanding of the performance of the gridded precipitation products at different elevations the products need to be evaluated in areas with high altitude yong et al 2010 moreover assessing the application of these products for streamflow simulations in data scarce countries such as ethiopia is important for proper management of the limited water resources available in these countries among the many available widely used precipitation datasets with high spatial and temporal resolution data four leading products were selected for this study the products included climate hazards group infra red precipitation with station chirps cfsr persiann cdr and trmm 3b42v7 the chirps precipitation estimate is a recently released dataset designed to take into account precipitation pattern and complex topographic characteristics of countries such as ethiopia in addition a long period of record high resolution 0 25 and 0 05 and relatively low latency of the chirps product make it the preferred dataset for hydrologic modeling persiann real time trmm 3b42rt and post real time trmm 3b42 precipitation products are widely used satellite based precipitation products persiann cdr and trmm 3b42v7 precipitation products are the latest versions of these satellite products and their hydrologic performance have not yet been well evaluated the three satellite based precipitation products chirps persiann cdr and trmm 3b42v7 selected use gauge based estimates and provide high spatial resolution 0 25 products cfsr was selected because of its long period of record high spatial resolution free availability and ease of use with the swat model it is worthwhile to note that as far as we are presently aware very few studies have been conducted to evaluate the accuracy and applicability of the chirps and persiann cdr precipitation estimates because these datasets became available only recently hence the assessment of the applicability of these precipitation products with the swat hydrologic model for streamflow simulation is a new area of study especially in ethiopia therefore the objectives of this study were to i compare the four gridded precipitation products against the rain gauge observations at the daily dekadal and monthly timescales ii evaluate their precipitation detection capabilities for different threshold values and iii determine the applicability of the datasets in simulating streamflow in two watersheds of the lake ziway basin ethiopia using the swat model 2 study area lake ziway fig 1 is located in the central rift valley basin of ethiopia which is part of the great east african rift valley it is a natural lake located at an elevation of 1638 m above sea level having an average depth of 4 m and an area of about 435 km2 among the lakes found in the rift valley of ethiopia lake ziway is the only fresh water lake suitable for fish farming the meki and ketar rivers are the two main upstream sources of fresh water to the lake and the bulbula river drains the overflow to the downstream terminal lake abayata lake ziway basin is located between 38 12 36 e to 39 24 36 e longitude and 7 22 12 n to 8 28 12 n latitude covering a total area of 7311 km2 including the lake the meki watershed is located on the west side of the lake covering an area of 2224 km2 including the western highlands a large portion of this watershed is found in the rift floor while the ketar watershed covers an area of 3282 km2 mainly characterized as the eastern highlands of the basin only a small part of the watershed around the outlet is found in the rift floor fig 1 the climatic conditions in lake ziway basin vary significantly across time and space average daily temperature varies from about 16 0c in the western and eastern highland parts of the basin to 21 c in the lowland parts found around the lake getnet et al 2014 the mean annual rainfall over the entire basin is about 900 mm year which varies from 700 mm year at the rift floor to 1200 mm year in some regions with higher altitude according to pascual ferrer et al 2014 about 59 of the precipitation falls during the main monsoon season between june to september 28 occurs in the minor rainfall months starting from march to may and the remaining 13 of the precipitation occurs during the dry season of the region actual evapotranspiration data varying from 650 mm year in the rift floor to 900 mm year in the eastern and western highlands were recorded in the years 1994 and 1995 ayenew 2003 an estimated 1800 mm year of water is also being lost from lake ziway due to evaporation vallet coulomb et al 2001 3 methods and materials this study presents the comparison and application of gridded precipitation datasets using a physically based swat model to estimate streamflow in lake ziway basin the study involved calibration sensitivity and uncertainty analysis and validation of the hydrologic model using the observed weather data for this purpose the swat calibration and uncertainty programs swat cup sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 calibration and uncertainty analysis algorithm were applied the four gridded precipitation products were used to simulate streamflow in the two main upstream rivers of lake ziway it is understood that the gridded precipitation products are estimates and might be subjected to different sources of error which need to be evaluated direct quantification based on statistical indices and indirect inference based on modeling can generally be used to carry out the evaluation li et al 2015 according to bitew and gebremichael 2011a model based evaluation has two advantages first it is not subject to scale discrepancy since the gridded precipitation products are evaluated at the scale of the whole watershed the second advantage is that the output from the products is used as the forcing input to a specific application of the hydrologic model in this study the above mentioned four gridded precipitation products were first directly compared against rain gauge observations using performance indices and then used in a swat hydrologic model to simulate streamflow in the two main rivers meki and ketar of the basin to compare the hydrologic applicability of the four products the model performance using the gridded precipitation products was also evaluated using the streamflow performance assessment objectives rain gauge data for the nine stations located in the basin fig 1 were obtained from the national meteorological agency of ethiopia for the period from 1985 to 2004 the thiessen polygon method was used to calculate the average areal rainfall over the whole basin watersheds using arcgis to evaluate the gridded precipitation products a gridded precipitation datasets the four gridded precipitation products cfsr persiann cdr chirps and trmm 3b42v7 were evaluated in this study swat file formatted daily cfsr data can be freely downloaded from http globalweather tamu edu and it is easy to use as input to the swat model the persian cdr precipitation which is a multi satellite based high resolution product is a newly released dataset suitable specifically for long period hydrological modeling ashouri et al 2015 the chirps datasets available from 1981 to present with different formats time steps and spatial resolutions are developed for drought sensitive areas and tested in countries like ethiopia the trmm 3b42v7 has been providing valuable precipitation data ever since it was started in 1997 trmm uses precipitation radar pr to detect the structure of tropical storms and their intensity nastos et al 2016 previous studies have shown that the trmm 3b42v7 product results in good performance of hydrologic simulations the gridded precipitation products with their spatial and temporal distributions are described briefly in table 1 1 ncep cfsr cfsr dataset the national center for environmental prediction product cfsr is a 0 31 0 31 resolution reanalysis dataset that covers almost the whole globe it is available for the period 1979 to 2014 cfsr uses a 3d var data assimilation scheme and also the accuracy of the dataset has been improved by including the coupling of the atmosphere ocean land surface sea ice system essou et al 2017 since the atmospheric model generated precipitation is considered to be biased the land surface component does not use precipitation from this model saha et al 2010 cfsr uses precipitation from the noaa climate prediction center cpc and the cpc unified daily gauge analysis wang et al 2011 2 persiann cdr pcdr dataset the perciann cdr dataset consists of a 0 25 0 25 resolution daily precipitation estimates with global coverage of 60 n 60 s starting in 1983 the infrared information is converted into rainfall rates by training the artificial neural network ann model in the persiann algorithm passive microwave based precipitation estimates sourced by multiple satellites are used to train the ann model hsu et al 1997 the pcdr product belongs to the category of satellite gauge precipitation estimates category since the global precipitation climatology project gpcp monthly precipitation developed from the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc precipitation gauge dataset is used to reduce the biases in the persiann precipitation estimates adler et al 2003 3 chirps dataset the chirps dataset is a high resolution precipitation dataset available from 1981 to the present with quasi global coverage at the daily pentadal and monthly time scales funk et al 2015 version 2 of the atmospheric model rainfall field from the noaa climate forecast system cfs trmm 3b42v7 data monthly precipitation climatology data chpclim and rain gauge station s data are the datasets used to construct the chirps product duan et al 2016 chirps products which are in the satellite gauge category are available at 0 05 and 0 25 spatial resolutions the 0 25 resolution precipitation dataset was used and evaluated in this study 4 trmm 3b42v7 dataset the national aeronautics and space administration and the japan aerospace exploration agency produced the tmpa trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis precipitation products including trmm 3b42 for tropical and subtropical precipitation monitoring huffman et al 2007 the tmpa algorithm that combines precipitation estimates from microwave and infrared sensors and the gpcc monthly gauge analysis is applied in 3b42v7 duan et al 2016 the dataset used and evaluated in this study was the daily precipitation product data provided for the quasi global coverage of 50 n 50 s at a spatial resolution of 0 25 beginning in 1998 b approach and performance of gridded precipitation products the validation of gridded precipitation products can be done either by directly comparing the gridded products with the rain gauge networks or using a hydrologic model and evaluating the ability of the products to prediction streamflows the approach used in this study was to compare the precipitation products directly with observed precipitation data and then to use the products to predict streamflow the accuracy of the gridded precipitation products was quantified using correlation coefficient cc root mean square error rmse mean error me and relative bias bias given in eqs 1 to 4 in addition contingency scores using the number of hits a false alarm b and miss c given in eqs 5 to 7 were also computed and used as verification wilks 2006 cc measures the degree of linear correlation between the gridded datasets and gauge observed precipitations the me and rmse measure the average difference and average error respectively bias reflects the relative degree of systematic error in precipitation estimates for perfect correlation cc is one and the errors of the other parameters are zero the probability of detection pod also known as the hit rate describes the fraction of the observed events that were correctly estimated by the precipitation product evaluated based on the given threshold values false alarm ratio far measures the fraction of false alarms detected by the product that was actually not observed the hit rate and false alarm ratios are combined into one score using the critical success index csi that shows the evaluation of the overall rain detecting skill of the precipitation product as compared to the observed precipitation nastos et al 2016 the scores range from 0 to 1 for pod and csi representing the poor and good ends respectively and from 1 to 0 at the poor and good ends for far 1 cc i 1 n g i g s i s i 1 n g i g 2 i 1 n s i s 2 2 rmse 1 n i 1 n s i g i 2 3 me 1 n i n n s i g i 4 bias i 1 n s i g i i 1 n g i

of agriculture it is a physically based semi distributed hydrologic model arnold et al 1998 which can be applied to simulate continuous flows in a watershed or to derive a spatially distributed model at the river basin scale in fact the swat was developed with the capability to study large and complex watersheds having varying land use soil and slope classes under different management conditions the swat can evaluate the long term impacts of different land management practices on water quantity quality and sediment yield neitsch et al 2011 in such a model a watershed is divided into a number of sub basins which are further sub divided into hydrologic response units hrus the model uses a water balance equation to simulate the hydrological cycle and to predict the hydrology in each hru different model components and the hydrological equations used are described in detail in the swat documentation neitsch et al 2011 the national aeronautics and space administration shuttle radar topographic mission 30m resolution digital elevation model of the study area was downloaded from https earthexplorer usgs gov and used by the authors to extract the required watershed characteristics the land use classification was prepared from the land cover data obtained from the ethiopian ministry of water resources the soil properties database was obtained from the harmonized world soil database http www fao org data en discharge data from the two rivers in the basin were obtained from the ethiopian ministry of water resources hydrology department the discharge data from meki and ketar stations were used for calibration 1980 1994 including the warming up period and validation 1995 2004 of the swat model these calibration and validation periods were selected based on the availability of data observed temperature and precipitation data used for driving the hydrologic model were provided by the ethiopian national meteorological agency in order to have basin specific and optimal parameters for each watershed swat cup was used to calibrate the model abbaspour et al 2007 sufi 2 was selected from the different analysis techniques built into swat cup statistical indices used to assess the hydrologic model performance were nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the coefficient of determination r2 percent bias pbias and the ratio of mean square error to the standard deviation of the measured data rsr eqs 8 11 were used to determine these statistical objective functions respectively details of these measures are explained by moriasi et al 2007 8 nse 1

discharge o is average measured discharge s is average simulated discharge and n is the number of observations in order to evaluate the performance of the streamflow simulation generated by the gridded precipitation products the hydrologic model needs to be calibrated using either the gridded precipitation datasets or the rain gauge data then the calibrated model is used to simulate streamflow using precipitation data from rain gauge stations and gridded product datasets separately and the results are compared with the observed streamflow according to previous studies calibrating the swat model using the precipitation products resulted in a slightly higher accuracy of the streamflow simulations but the simulations obtained using the two calibration strategies were virtually the same with negligible difference between the accuracy parameters zhu et al 2016 however the presence of large errors in the rainfall data of the gridded precipitation datasets could result in unrealistic model parameter values during the calibration process as the model tries to compensate for the errors habib et al 2014 hence in our study the model was first calibrated using the rain gauge data and then simulated with the gridded products 4 results a evaluation of gridded precipitation products in this study the capability of four gridded precipitation products as input to a popular hydrologic model swat for simulating streamflow was evaluated and compared to identify the best gridded precipitation product the precipitation products were first compared directly against the rain gauge precipitation in the basin according to yong et al 2014 comparing gridded precipitation products directly against the rain gauge data which are at the point scale may lead to evaluation errors because of the differences in scales between them on the other hand interpolation of rain gauge data to a gridded dataset or the opposite can result in additional errors miao et al 2015 yang et al 2016 therefore in this study comparison of the selected precipitation products against the rain gauge data was done using areally averaged precipitation data since this approach is more meaningful for hydrologic applications meng et al 2014 the evaluation was done using the data for the period from 1998 to 2004 for the trmm 3b42v7 dataset and from 1985 to 2004 for all others 1 a general comparison of the precipitation datasets box plots of the gridded precipitation products and the rain gauge datasets showed significant differences in monthly rainfall amounts and patterns fig 2 for a better understanding we broke the monthly data into three seasons and then assessed the rainfall datasets in each season the high rainfall season is from june to september the low rainfall season is from march to may and the dry season is from october to february for the ketar watershed the persiann cdr and chirps products correctly represented the timing of the rainy season the precipitation amounts for the chirps product were similar to the rain gauge measured values throughout the rainy season however the persian cdr product overestimated the precipitation amount especially in the months of july and august by about 230 mm on average and underestimated in the low rain season march to may despite the fact that the comparison period for the trmm 3b42v7 product was shorter as compared to the other products the timing of the rainy season was well represented by the trmm 3b42v7 product also the precipitation amounts estimated by this product were similar to the measured values and those estimated by the chirps product the cfsr products satisfactorily represented the timing of the rainy season however precipitation amounts were overestimated in the months of july and august by about 260 mm on average and underestimated in the low rain season about 50 mm on average for the meki watershed representation of the timing of the rainy season by the cfsr product was satisfactory but the precipitation amounts were underestimated throughout the rainy seasons persiann cdr product s representation of the timing of the rainy season and estimation of the precipitation amounts were better than for the other datasets chirps product slightly overestimated precipitation values for the rainy season months of july and august and underestimated in the low rain season from march to may however its representation of the timing of the rainy season was good the trmm 3b42v7 product slightly overestimated precipitation amounts in almost all of the months including the dry season the representation of the timing of the rainy season by this product was better than cfsr but not as good as persiann cdr and chirps 2 statistical comparison of the precipitation products i daily comparison daily precipitation estimates from the gridded precipitation products were compared against the rain gauge data the statistical indices cc rmse me and bias and contingency scores csi far and pod are summarized in table 2 all the gridded products scored small linear correlations with the rain gauged data persiann cdr and trmm 3b42v7 have better correlations as compared to the other products the values of me and bias indicated that chirps has the closest agreement with the rain gauge data 2 90 mm day and 3 48 mm day of me and 3 47 and 4 43 of bias for the ketar and meki watersheds respectively persiann cdr showed better skill at detecting rain events with higher pod and csi values and relatively average values of far chirps exhibits the least skill in detecting rain events with small pod and csi values however it scored better on far with smaller values cfsr showed good skill at detecting rain events and it also scored the best on far trmm 3b42v7 exhibits highest pod and far values and small csi values ii dekadal comparison the statistical measures obtained by comparing the dekadal ten days gridded precipitation products with rain gauge data are plotted in fig 3 the results show a better agreement between the gridded products and rain gauge data for the meki watershed as compared to the similar data for ketar watershed for both the watersheds higher cc 0 74 and 0 81 respectively for the ketar and meki watersheds values were obtained when the chirps product dataset was compared with the observed data the lowest cc 0 63 and 0 61 respectively for the ketar and meki watersheds values were scored by cfsr the chirps product also had the best linear correlation and low rmse values of 33 97 mm dekad and 31 12 mm dekad respectively for the ketar and meki watersheds the cfsr product had the highest rmse values of 50 55 mm dekad and 46 70 mm dekad respectively for these watersheds fig 4 shows the scatter plots of the dekadal precipitation of the gridded precipitation products versus the rain gauge data the chirps product scored the highest r2 values 0 55 and 0 65 respectively for the kater and meki watersheds persiann cdr performed better than trmm 3b42v7 with values of r2 0 51 and r2 0 64 respectively the cfsr product scored the least r2 0 4 and r2 0 37 iii monthly comparison in general as shown in fig 5 very good agreements between the four gridded precipitation products datasets and the gauge data were found using cc for both watersheds the values ranged from 0 77 to 0 91 and from 0 73 to 0 95 respectively for the meki and ketar watersheds the cfsr had the minimum cc 0 73 and 0 77 respectively values the chirps and trmm 3b42v7 scored the highest cc 0 91 and 0 95 respectively values for the ketar watershed chirps product had the best agreement with the gauged observations with an rmse value of 26 14 mm month the values of me and bias indicated that the cfsr dataset had the closest agreement with the gauge measurements the persiann cdr product overestimated precipitation for the meki watershed the trmm 3b42v7 dataset had the smallest average error with the rmse value of 22 33 mm month the chirps and cfsr products underestimated precipitation for both the watersheds the cfsr dataset had the highest rmse values 63 3 mm month and 66 01 mm month respectively for the ketar and meki watersheds the lowest me and bias values of chirps indicated that the product had the closest agreement with the gauge data from the scatter plots shown in fig 6 it can be observed that the chirps and trmm 3b42v7 products scored the highest correlation r2 0 83 and r2 0 91 and cfsr scored the lowest r2 0 59 and r2 0 52 correlation for the ketar and meki watersheds respectively iv precipitation thresholds detection comparison to further evaluate the gridded precipitation products the three contingency indices pod far and csi were assessed using different precipitation thresholds to evaluate the light and heavy daily precipitation events detection ability of the gridded products mean daily precipitation thresholds of 0 5 mm 1 mm 2 mm 5 mm and 10 mm were used to calculate the contingency indices the values of pod far and csi showing the performance of the four gridded products at different thresholds are plotted in fig 7 for the ketar watershed when the daily precipitation threshold value was 0 5 mm day the persiann cdr and trmm 3b42v7 products had higher pod greater than 80 and csi greater than 60 values whereas the chirps product had lower pod greater than 64 and csi greater than 52 values when the daily precipitation threshold value was greater than 10 mm day the smallest pod of 22 and csi of 12 were obtained for the chirps product the trmm 3b42v7 product also had the lowest far greater than 68 value whereas the other products scored far values greater than 78 for the meki watershed when the daily precipitation threshold was 0 5 mm day the persiann cdr product had higher pod 82 and csi greater than 61 values whereas the cfsr product had the lowest pod greater than 58 and csi greater than 52 values when the daily precipitation threshold was greater than 10 mm day the highest pod of 34 and csi of 18 were obtained for the chirps product followed by the trmm 3b42v7 product while the smallest was obtained for cfsr b swat model calibration and validation twenty seven hydrological parameters were selected for calibration and validation of the swat model for streamflow simulation discharge data for the period 1980 1994 were used for the calibration of the model in both watersheds and 1995 2004 and 1995 2001 for validation in the ketar and meki watersheds respectively the calibration and validation periods were selected based on the availability of continuous discharge data in both watersheds swat cup was used for the calibration and uncertainty analysis of the model the most sensitive parameters and their fitted values were identified separately and found to be different for the two watersheds the sensitive parameters obtained by the sufi 2 algorithm in swat cup for the ketar watershed are shown in table 3 calibration and validation of the model were carried out by comparing observed discharges at the ketar and meki gauging stations with the simulated streamflows model performance results for the daily calibration and validation of the watersheds are shown in table 4 the plots of the observed and simulated monthly flows for the ketar and meki watersheds are shown in figs 8 and 9 respectively it can be observed from the table and figures that although the peak streamflows were not simulated well because of the factors such as an uneven representation of the spatial distribution of precipitation the model simulations of the observed discharges were good the observed and simulated monthly streamflows for the ketar watershed showed good agreement with the nse pbias rsr and r2 values of 0 68 4 56 0 57 and 0 68 respectively for the calibration period and 0 67 23 37 0 58 and 0 69 respectively for the validation period for the meki watershed the model simulated streamflows were very good with nse pbias rsr and r2 values of 0 75 4 51 0 50 and 0 79 respectively for the calibration period and 0 60 23 33 0 64 and 0 80 respectively for the validation period c evaluation and comparison of streamflow simulations i daily streamflow validation precipitation data from the four gridded precipitation products and the rain gauge measurements were used in the calibrated swat model to validate the streamflow simulations at the daily and monthly scales figs 10 and 11 show the daily streamflow validations of the four gridded precipitation products for the ketar and meki watersheds respectively the three precipitation products cfsr chirps and persiann cdr were evaluated for the validation period from 1985 to 2004 since the trmm 3b42v7 precipitation dataset dates in 1998 we found it ideal to evaluate the performance of the four products additionally for the period from 1998 to 2004 the chirps product resulted in satisfactory nse 0 51 and 0 55 respectively rsr 0 70 and 0 67 respectively and pbias 21 4 and 13 4 respectively values for the ketar and meki watersheds when the whole validation period was considered the trmm 3b42v7 product also resulted in satisfactory nse 0 57 rsr 0 65 and pbias 3 9 values for the ketar watershed and unsatisfactory nse 0 47 rsr 0 73 and pbias 38 1 values for the meki watershed during the 1998 2004 validation period persiann cdr precipitation generated daily simulation resulted in an unsatisfactory nse 0 44 and 0 42 respectively rsr 0 75 and 0 76 respectively and pbias 43 2 and 41 6 respectively values for the ketar and meki watersheds cfsr resulted in the least representative daily simulation with nse 0 69 rsr 1 30 and pbias 124 4 for the ketar watershed and nse 0 07 rsr 0 96 and pbias 66 1 for the meki watershed ii monthly streamflow validation the monthly streamflows simulated using the four gridded precipitation products were compared and validated with the gauge discharge observations as shown in figs 12 and 13 for both watersheds the swat model driven by the dataset simulated by cfsr generated the least representative streamflows with the smallest and negative nse values and high rsr values of 0 94 and 1 06 for the ketar and meki watersheds respectively the cfsr dataset also overestimated monthly streamflows with pbias of 62 83 for the ketar watershed and underestimated with pbias values of 76 64 for the meki watershed for both of the watersheds the trmm 3b42v7 product performed the second best for the validation period from 1998 to 2004 following the chirps product it resulted in high nse 0 70 and 0 63 respectively values and a low rsr 0 55 and 0 61 respectively values for the ketar and meki watersheds it also resulted in remarkably small pbias 7 9 and 11 13 respectively values for these watersheds the chirps product outperformed the remaining two products for both watersheds the monthly streamflow simulated by the chirps dataset showed good efficiency with nse value of 0 71 and rsr value of 0 54 for the ketar watershed and with a slightly high negative value of pbias 16 42 it also showed satisfactory efficiency with nse value of 0 60 and rsr value of 0 63 for the meki watershed with a relatively better value of pbias 12 30 the monthly streamflows simulated with the persiann cdr dataset resulted in an acceptable model efficiency with nse value of 0 65 and rsr value of 0 59 for the ketar watershed but with a relatively larger pbias of 21 70 and its performance for the meki watershed was fair with nse and rsr values of 0 50 and 0 70 respectively and a high positive pbias 18 80 5 discussion this study compares four high resolution gridded precipitation datasets against the rain gauge data the hydrologic performances of the datasets in simulating streamflows are evaluated in two watersheds of the lake ziway basin in ethiopia the two opposite facing watersheds ketar and meki with highly varying topography on the western and eastern sides of lake ziway can be taken as good representatives of ethiopian watersheds from fig 1 it can be observed that the meki watershed on the western side of the lake has a higher density of rain gauging stations and flat topography while the mountainous part of the basin with higher elevations are mainly found in the ketar watershed where the density of ground observations is low since gauged precipitation datasets are employed in the production of the selected gridded precipitation datasets station density and topography play an important role in the quality of products statistical evaluations of gridded precipitation datasets have been conducted on small to large scale areas in a number of studies beck et al 2017 duan et al 2016 moazami et al 2016 in addition hydrologic evaluations of gridded precipitation estimates have also been studied in different watersheds behrangi et al 2011 tuo et al 2016 zhu et al 2018 however a limited number of studies have been conducted to simultaneously evaluate the statistical and hydrologic performance of gridded precipitation datasets zhu et al 2016 in a country with a complex topography and a deeply convective and mostly bimodal precipitation system such as ethiopia direct comparison of precipitation products against the rain gauge data can be significantly supported by the hydrologic evaluation bayissa et al 2017 evaluated the performance of five satellite based rainfall datasets to monitor meteorological drought in the ethiopian blue nile basin and concluded that the chirps product performed the best at the dekadal monthly and seasonal time scales similarly the daily dekadal and monthly cc me and bias values in our study also show that the chirps product outperformed the other three precipitation products the good statistical performance of the product can be attributed to its design objective which is to monitor droughts in countries like ethiopia the statistical indices cc rmse me and bias of the four precipitation products demonstrated that the three satellite based products performed better than the reanalysis cfsr product for both the watersheds the cfsr product underestimated precipitation amounts in the meki watershed and overestimated in the ketar watershed this resulted in high values of me and bias indicating that although the product was able to capture precipitation patterns the precipitation amounts were highly biased comparing cfsr precipitation with the conventional rain gauge data on selected ethiopian watersheds roth and lemann 2016 also showed that the cfsr product was unable to represent precipitation variability fuka et al 2014 also recommended further studies before blindly accepting cfsr rainfall data as an input to hydrologic models the poor statistical performance of the cfsr product in this study also affected the hydrologic simulation of streamflow the high negative me and bias values for the meki watershed resulted in very low streamflows and unsatisfactory high pbias the increased precipitation amounts also resulted in streamflow having higher peak flows than the observed flows for the ketar watershed these results indicate that although cfsr dataset is valuable in data sparse countries such as ethiopia because of its global availability and free access it needs to be used with caution the main reason for the cfsr product to perform poorly in our study could be related to the prediction accuracy of the regional weather which is strongly dependent on the geographical factors that control the atmospheric circulation by the atmospheric models used to derive the reanalysis precipitation products monteiro et al 2016 statistical evaluation of the three satellite based precipitation products chirps persiann cdr and trmm 3b42v7 revealed that the performances of the products were similar with high values of cc and low values of me and bias for both watersheds however in general satellite precipitation products are more reliable in flat terrain regions than in mountainous regions derin and yilmaz 2014 tian and peters lidard 2010 zhu et al 2016 accordingly all the satellite precipitation products had high cc and low rmse in the relatively flat meki watershed than the ketar watershed trmm 3b42v7 s monthly correlation performance was better than the daily correlation performance as compared to the persiann cdr product which performed better at the daily scale this also indicates that a better correlation at the daily scale may not confirm the same at the monthly scale and it also showed that using monthly rain gauge data to adjust the bias cannot guarantee improved estimates of daily precipitation li et al 2015 li et al 2013 yong et al 2014 comparing the daily timescale contingency statistical indices pod far and csi for the whole basin scale demonstrated that unlike other results with the lowest far cfsr performed well in detecting rain events the persiann cdr and trmm 3b42v7 products scored high contingency indices but with higher far values dinku et al 2010 obtained the same result for the relatively wet regions of africa and stated that the satellite products detect rains that do not reach the ground the pod and csi values of all the gridded precipitation products for the daily threshold values indicate that the overall precipitation detection skill of the products decreases as precipitation threshold increases this shows that both the satellite and reanalysis precipitation products are not good at accurately capturing the magnitude of intense precipitation events all the gridded precipitation products also resulted in almost uniform precipitation detection capability for the mountainous ketar watershed than the relatively flat terrain meki fig 7 although the statistical correlations of the satellite products show similar results the products performed differently in streamflow simulations the chirps and trmm 3b42v7 products performed better than the poorly distributed gauging station data both for the daily and monthly streamflow simulations of the ketar watershed however despite its good spatial distribution the persiann cdr product was not able to perform better than the station data for the monthly streamflow simulations this can be attributed to the relatively high monthly statistical me 7 88 and bias 9 94 values of the product our results also confirm the conclusion made by zhu et al 2016 which is that bias and me of precipitation estimates determine the accuracy of streamflow simulation by a model the reason given for the conclusion according to su et al 2008 was related to the nonlinearity of the hydrologic process where precipitation bias can be transformed into larger pbias in streamflow simulation although the daily scale statistical performance of the persiann cdr product was better the daily streamflow simulated by the product resulted in unsatisfactory nse rsr and pbias values in addition despite the good statistical performance of the satellite based products for the flat terrain in the meki watershed the relatively well distributed station data results in better streamflow simulations than all the gridded precipitation products the persiann cdr product performed poor and unsatisfactory streamflow simulations at the monthly and daily validations respectively the higher statistical me and bias values of trmm 3b42v7 as compared to chirps also resulted in lower daily and monthly streamflow validation performances for the meki watershed this also indicates that the hydrologic performance evaluation results of the satellite products depend more on gauging station distribution than the terrain of the study area from the statistical and hydrologic evaluations and the preceding discussions it can be observed that the performances of the four gridded precipitation estimates have considerable differences among the satellite precipitation products the chirps dataset performed the best both in the statistical comparisons and in the daily and monthly streamflow simulations for both watersheds better performance of the microwave based retrieval algorithm derived trmm 3b42v7 compared to the infrared based algorithm derived persiann cdr in mountainous regions like the watersheds in our study has also been shown by previous studies bitew and gebremichael 2010 bitew and gebremichael 2011b hirpa et al 2010 hong et al 2007 the good performance of the chirps product for the ketar watershed indicates that the product can be used for daily and monthly hydrologic modeling not only in the data scarce areas of ethiopia but also in areas where the density and distribution of ground observations are unsatisfactory however overall our results indicated that all the satellite based precipitation estimates can be used to generate inputs for hydrologic models for monthly streamflow simulation in areas with spares rain gauge data and also the better performance of these estimates might be achieved if the hydrologic models are calibrated using the estimated datasets from the gridded precipitation products 6 conclusions this study assessed the statistical performance of the cfsr gridded precipitation dataset and three satellite based precipitation estimates chirps persiann cdr and trmm 3b42v7 and compared their performances in predicting time series rainfall recorded at rain gauges over two adjacent and opposite facing watersheds of the lake ziway basin ethiopia the ultimate goal of our analysis was to evaluate and compare the hydrologic performance of the precipitation products as input to the swat model for streamflow simulation in the lake ziway basin our findings are summarized as follows 1 all the satellite based precipitation products considered in our study showed better statistical performance with higher correlation and lower error values than the reanalysis cfsr product the satellite derived products also performed better in flat terrain than in the mountainous watershed meanwhile the reverse was true for the cfsr product 2 the persiann cdr and trmm 3b42v7 products were reliable in simulating streamflow at the monthly scale and the daily performance of trmm 3b42v7 was nearly satisfactory both products can be used as input to hydrologic models for monthly streamflow simulations in data sparse areas the trmm 3b42v7 product can also give useful results for daily streamflow simulation if the other parameters and inputs of the model are good and representative 3 the chirps product performed the best both in statistical and hydrologic evaluations over the two watersheds it also performed well as input in the hydrologic model to simulate streamflow both at the daily and monthly scales the chirps product can be used as the best substitute not only in data scarce regions of ethiopia but also in areas where the spatial distribution of gauging stations is poor 4 finally we note that the statistical comparison and hydrologic evaluation results of the gridded precipitation products over the two watersheds in our study might be applicable to areas where data is scarce and where the watersheds have relatively similar climate and topographical characteristics we recommend further studies and analysis of the chirps product using more watersheds from different parts of ethiopia since this product can be a promising alternative to fill the precipitation data gap in the country since we are in the new era of global precipitation measurement gpm based precipitation data hydrologic evaluation of gpm based satellite estimates like imerg and gsmap can also be suggested for future research prakash et al

6033,the uncertainties in atmospheric water demand used in evaluating drought indices are the primary cause of discrepancies between them especially in water limited regions this study evaluated standardized moisture anomaly index szi using a combined water energy balance approach and compared the performance with the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and self calibrated palmer drought severity index scpdsi over seven climatic regions in china from 1948 to 2017 the atmospheric water demand in szi is evaluated using climatically appropriate precipitation for existing conditions cafec which takes into account most parts of the surface water energy balance i e precipitation evapotranspiration runoff and soil moisture recharge and loss the relative performances of szi spei and scpdsi for multicategory and multi scalar drought identification are reported in terms of pearson correlation coefficient through a series of cross comparisons our result explains that the szi spei and scpdsi drought indices presented dissimilar abilities in different regions which of course raises the issue of regional applicability the performance of szi is better than spei and scpdsi in both humid and non humid regions although the consistency of spei is similar to szi across different temporal scale it is more appropriate for multi scalar drought analysis in humid regions the scpdsi are inconsistent in identifying multicategory drought the enhanced drought appraisal with the szi is the consequence of a more objective evaluation of atmospheric water demand by incorporating precipitation runoff and change in water storage all that control meteorological hydrological and agricultural droughts respectively the szi can offer a better multi category and multi scalar droughts information which could aid in providing valuable early warning of rapidly evolving drought most notably in the water limited region keywords drought indices drought monitoring

studies have stated necessities for an enhanced drought monitoring scheme through the combination of existing drought indices and integration of drought related climatic parameters to promote drought preparation and management practices which will ultimately reduce drought vulnerability vicente serrano et al 2010 zargar et al 2011 hao and aghakouchak 2013 hao et al 2016 in order to optimize these

the relative advantages and shortcomings of the individual drought index anderson et al 2013 for instance spi mckee et al 1993 and sri shukla and wood 2008 are computed for a variety of time scales which allows them to monitor short term drought such as meteorological drought and long term drought such as hydrological drought mishra and singh 2010 huang et al 2017 their major fault is that they are based solely on p and runoff ro observations respectively which might be insufficient in describing surface water imbalances caused by drought ma et al 2014 mcevoy et al 2016 ford and labosier 2017 therefore considering the multi category nature of droughts a single variable index might not independently identify diverse categories of drought farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 the spei measures drought severity in terms of accumulated climatic water balance anomalies by including the difference between available water supply i e p and atmospheric water demand i e potential evapotranspiration pet vicente serrano et al 2010 beguería et al 2014 ayantobo et al 2019 research has explicated that variation exists in the relations between p and pet across different climate regions yang et al 2006 xu et al 2013 yang et al 2015 and large et rates associated to high t are equally relevant and may reinforce drought severity therefore it is necessary to acknowledge impacts of p deficiency and also consider droughts as water stress conditions caused by both p shortages and high atmospheric evaporative demand vicente serrano et al 2010 ma et al 2014 gouveia et al 2017 in most water limited i e arid and semi arid regions pet is often substantially higher than et and p unep 1992 yang et al 2006 although pet plays an essential role in delineating the climatic boundary of a region from arid to humid relying on it for detailing droughts can lead to biases in water limited regions pereira et al 2009 paulo et al 2012 yang et al 2018 studies have also revealed that in water limited regions change in et is frequently dominated by a change in p rather than in pet while in a humid region change in et is generally controlled by a change in pet rather than p budyko 1974 yang et al 2006 yang et al 2018 although there have been numerous global and regional applications of spei for multi category drought studies some critical drawbacks have been reported based on the discrepancies in the relationships between p et and pet across different climatic regions these includes i spei mostly measures meteorological drought and may result to biases in representing other drought categories dai

2010 sheffield et al 2012a b zhang et al 2015 wells et al 2004 modified pdsi by adopting an automatically calculating procedure to develop scpdsi which improved the spatial comparability of pdsi but even so the overall weakness of pdsi remain unsolved and the unchanged approximation of climatic characteristic using an empirically semilogarithmic regression method still depends heavily on other reference locations and data wells et al 2004 palmer 1965 most of the above cited indices have been promoted to quantify drought in china wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 hao et al 2017 ayantobo et al 2019 however recognizing their major weakness and also the complex topography and climatic fluctuation from region to region zhai et al 2010 wu et al 2011 a more physically based approach is needed to enhance the performances of these indices for multi category drought monitoring in china therefore the main novelty of this study is to adopt a combined water energy balance procedure to address both supply and atmospheric demand aspects of droughts through standardized moisture anomaly index szi zhang et al 2015 the szi employs a modern land surface model to estimate the aggregate moisture departure and also incorporates a multi scalar feature to analyze drought events at various temporal scales unlike spei the atmospheric water demand is determined using climatically appropriate precipitation for existing conditions cafec denoted as p i e the minimum amount of p needed to maintain a normal soil moisture level for a certain region which initially came from pdsi palmer 1965 wells et al 2004 although szi has been recommended for monitoring multi category drought most especially in water stressed regions wells et al 2004 dai 2011 zhang et al 2015 zhang and he 2016 it has not been widely explored in literature for regional drought analysis consequently the primary intent of this research is to regionally appraise the szi for multi category and multi scalar drought identification over seven climatic regions in china to realize this we studied the connections between p et and pet and also explored the performances of szi spei and scpdsi using standard drought

eventually chose the three parameter log logistic distribution for estimating the spei complete calculation procedures for the spei can be read in vicente serrano et al 2010 the szi and scpdsi utilizes the differences between actual p and computed p in a specific month to measure the wet or dry conditions based on water budget analysis four water balance components were computed monthly together with their potential values to calculate p these include evapotranspiration et surface runoff ro soil moisture recharge r and loss l potential evapotranspiration pet potential runoff pro potential recharge pr and potential moisture loss pl these eight components are closely associated with available water capacity of the soil and represent a more complex but comprehensive soil water balance in the surface level ma et al 2014 the p et pet and ro are obtained from gldasv2 noah output while the other components are calculated as follows 3 r δ s t δ s u δ s t δ s u 0 0 δ s t δ s u 0

potential moisture loss from surface layer pls is potential moisture loss from underlying layer pl is total potential moisture loss st and su are surface layer 0 10 cm and underlying layer 10 200 cm available soil moisture respectively derived from gldasv2 noah outputs δst and δsu are their monthly variable quantity estimated from st and su awc is available soil water holding capacity of the two

where j ranges across the months of a year i e j 1 12 the weighting factors α β γ and δ are called evapotranspiration coefficient recharge coefficient runoff coefficient and loss coefficient respectively the derived water balance coefficients are later used to determine the monthly value of p as follows 9 p α j p e t β j p r γ j p r o δ j p l since p takes most components of the surface water energy balance i e p et ro l and r into account during estimation it is physically more reliable than pet as an indicator of atmospheric water demand palmer 1965 dai et al 2004 dai 2011 ma et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 the difference between p and p is called the moisture anomaly index which indicates the water deficit or surplus is formulated as follows 10 z p p since both d and z series can be negative i e similar range the three parameter log logistic distribution recommended for d series by vicente serrano et al 2010 was selected to standardize the z series to derive the szi at various timescales scpdsi is calculated based on the methods described in wells et al 2004 3 3 evaluation of standardized drought indices meteorological hydrological agricultural and comprehensive droughts are analyzed in four levels by examining p ro δs and wer via the spi mckee et al 1993 standardized runoff index ssi shukla and wood 2008 standardized soil water index sswi wang et al 2011 hao and aghakouchak 2013 and standardized water energy index swi zhang et al 2019 respectively in the seven climatic regions to ensure that spi ssi sswi and wer are independent of szi spei and scpdsi the p pet ro and et are obtained from the cru ts 4 01 and gleam et products the δs is evaluated as 11 δ s p r o e t where ro is runoff and et is based on remote sensing dataset that has been validated using eddy covariance tower flux data sets and it is estimated as miralles et al 2011 martens et al 2017 12 et e t e b e i et eb and ei are transpiration bare soil evaporation and interception loss respectively research has shown that energy and water correlate negatively during drought scenarios this shows that the total energy supplied i e ratio of sensible heat to net radiation during drought is comparatively higher than normal condition while the total water supplied i e residual available water to precipitation is usually lower than the normal condition yin et al 2014 liu et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 as a result the ratio of residual available water p et to residual energy pet et is relatively lower higher during dry wet scenarios than normal condition liu et al 2017 this ratio is defined as wer and is referred to as swi in this research 13 wer p e t p e t e t the spi ssi sswi and swi indices are indexed with a similar standardized procedure which can be illustrated by the ensuing four steps i fit a probability density function to the frequency distribution of the target variable summed over the timescale of interest and test the goodness of fit by the kolmogorov smirnov nonparametric test massey 1951 ii use the fitted distribution to estimate the cumulative probabilities by numerical solution methods iii transform the cumulative probabilities to the z values of a normal distribution with zero mean and unit variance iv identify the drought condition according to certain threshold values of the standardized indices here we computed spi ssi sswi and swi from 1 to 50 months to monitor different time scales of drought these indices are completely independent of the szi spei and scpdsi which is based on gldasv2 noah 3 4 evaluating the performance of szi spei and scpdsi to investigate the performance of szi spei and scpdsi the results were correlated with the observed drought based on the spi representing meteorological drought ssi representing hydrological drought sswi representing agricultural drought and swi representing comprehensive drought using water energy balance characteristics over the seven climatic regions the relative performance in multicategory and multi scalar drought monitoring are in terms of pearson correlation coefficient r chambers et al 1983 draper and smith 1998 anderson et al 2013 which is the measure of linear dependence between pairs of spi szi spei scpdsi ssi szi spei scpdsi sswi szi spei scpdsi and swi szi spei scpdsi obtained at 1 50 month scales 4 results 4 1 water supply and demand relationship using p et and pet indices the fundamental interactions and corresponding roles of p et and pet vary with fluctuations in the climatic condition and topography over each region as shown in table 2 a high positive correlation between p et and pet was observed in most climatic regions for instance the average correlation r between p and p ranged from 0 72 region iv to 0 84 region v r between p and et ranged from 0 68 region iv to 0 86 region v r between p and pet ranged from 0 18 region iv to 0 79 region vi while r between et and pet ranged from 0 19 region iv to 0 82 region vi the averaged r between p and pet are much lower as compared to other variables with r values lower in humid regions and higher in the arid region fig 2 showed that the long term mean annual wi p pet ranged from 0 05 region vi to 0 92 region iv thus revealing that a region s climate varies from arid to humid the evaporation ratio et p ranged from 0 82 region iii to 2 93 region v while dryness index pet p ranged from 2 10 region iii to 19 21 region v during 1948 2017 for the seven climatic regions also the regional distribution of mean differences among p et pet and p can be found in fig 3 the average difference between p and et ranged between 0 54 region v to 54 87 region iv p and pet ranged between 150 85 region vi to 13 51 region iv while et and pet ranged from 148 39 region vi to 59 02 region iii as revealed in the figure the annual mean pet is much higher than p especially in arid regions while the magnitudes of annual mean p and p was quite similar i e their mean difference and p p ratio are generally around 0 and 1 0 respectively in all the regions from a natural perspective the relationship between p and p reflects that the atmospheric water demand and supply balances typically over a long time scale in all climatic region the results highlight that change of et is dominated by a change in p rather than pet in arid regions while a change in et is controlled by a change in pet rather than p in humid regions atmospheric water demand is limited by available p in arid regions and by pet in humid regions which also agrees with earlier studies yang et al 2006 4 2 performances of szi spei and scpdsi for meteorological drought monitoring using spi meteorological drought occurs as a result of a deficiency in p showing that the primary driver of meteorological drought is p mckee et al 1993 therefore it is worth monitoring the performance of szi spei and scpdsi in terms of meteorological drought using p based drought index such as spi the statistical metrics in fig 4 give general information regarding the relationship between spi and regionally averaged szi spei and scpdsi indices for the seven climatic regions at 1 to 50 month time scales during 1948 2017 the figure shows that r values of szi spi had stronger correlations in all the seven climatic regions indicating a closer relationship between szi and p component of the hydrologic budget the mean r values of szi spi range between 0 36 region vii and 0 77 region v which are generally higher than those for the spei spi range between 0 16 region vi to 0 69 region v and for the scpdsi spi range between 0 11 region vii to 0 52 region v the discrepancy between r values for szi spi and spei spi are highest in northwestern desert region i e region vi average r is 67 and lowest in the northeast humid semi humid warm region i e region i average r is 9 showing that the spei underperforms in identifying meteorological droughts in the arid region fig 5 also illustrates the trends of spi szi spei scpdsi at different time scale for all the seven climatic regions there is an upward trend in szi and spei for 1 48 month while in the case of scpdsi a slight increase from 1 to 6 month followed by a decreasing trend from 12 to 48 month was observed the discrepancy between r values for szi spi and spei spi decreased from 11 at 1 month to 8 at 3 month and gradually increased from 18 12 month to 40 48 month the performance of spei decreases with increasing temporal scales after 3 month scale in contrast the discrepancy between r values for szi spi and scpdsi spi are highest at 1 month scale i e averaged r is 69 and lowest at the 48 month scale i e averaged r is 38 fig 4 and fig 5 indicating that the scpdsi are incapable of identifying meteorological drought at varied time scales this demonstrates that the szi can better represent the meteorological droughts than the spei i e mainly in water limited regions and the scpdsi at multiple temporal scales 4 3 performances of szi spei and scpdsi for hydrological drought monitoring using ssi the connection between the streamflow and moisture availability described by szi spei and scpdsi are examined to obtain a better perception of the show of szi spei and scpdsi in hydrological droughts monitoring fig 6 illustrates the correlation between ssi and regionally averaged szi spei and scpdsi for the seven climatic regions at 1 to 50 month time scales among all indices included in the inter comparison szi ssi relationship is the most highly correlated with time in all the regions as shown in this figure the mean r values szi ssi range between 0 52 region vii and 0 80 region vi which are generally higher than those for the scpdsi ssi range between 0 29 region iii to 0 74 region vi and for the spei ssi range between 0 06 region vi to 0 62 region i the discrepancy between r values for szi ssi and spei ssi are highest in northwestern desert region i e region vi average r is 90 and lowest in the central and southern china humid subtropical region i e region i average r is 14 showing that the spei underperforms in identifying hydrological droughts in the arid region fig 7 further illustrates the trends of ssi szi spei scpdsi at different time scale for all the seven climatic regions there was an increase decrease trend for spei scpdsi respectively from 1 to 48 month while in the case of szi there was an increased trend from 1 to 12 month followed by a decreasing trend from 18 to 48 month the discrepancy between r values for szi ssi and spei ssi increased gradually from 34 at 1 month to 54 at 48 month the performance of spei decreases with increasing time scale from 1 to 48 month on the other hand the r values for szi ssi and scpdsi ssi were 23 at 1 month and increased slightly to 28 at 48 month these values were generally lower compared to the discrepancy between szi ssi and spei ssi also in fig 6 the average values of r for scpdsi were higher than spei in regions v vi and vii indicating that the scpdsi tries to recognize hydrological drought at various time scales better than spei in the arid regions the r values of szi ssi are higher in all the seven climatic regions indicating a closer relationship of szi with runoff component of the hydrologic budget 4 4 performances of szi spei and scpdsi for agricultural drought monitoring using sswi agricultural drought mostly occurs from low levels of soil water storage which consequently impacts agricultural activities so the correlations between the δs and szi spei scpdsi were studied to appraise their performances for agricultural droughts monitoring fig 8 shows the relationship between sswi and regionally averaged szi spei and scpdsi for the seven climatic regions at 1 to 50 month time scales during 1948 2017 the figure shows that the r values of szi sswi are higher in all the seven climatic regions indicating a closer relationship of szi with δs components of the hydrologic budget the mean r values of szi sswi range between 0 40 region vii and 0 84 region v which are generally higher than those for the spei sswi range between 0 03 region v to 0 62 region i and for the scpdsi sswi range between 0 14 region vi to 0 40 region i the discrepancy between r values for szi sswi and spei sswi are highest in northwestern desert region i e region vi average r is 104 and lowest in the northeast humid semi humid warm region i e region i average r is 14 showing that the spei underperforms in identifying agricultural droughts in the arid region also fig 9 illustrates the trends of sswi szi spei scpdsi at different time scale for all the seven climatic regions there was an upward trend in szi and spei from 1 to 48 month while in the case of scpdsi the trend increases between 1 and 18 months and after that decreased slightly between 18 and 48 months the discrepancy between the average r values for szi sswi and spei sswi for all climatic regions are 7 14 18 25 32 44 54 73 83 while that of szi sswi and scpdsi sswi are 71 70 69 68 71 72 77 86 95 for 1 3 6 9 12 18 24 36 and 48 months respectively the performances of spei and scpdsi decreases with increasing temporal scales fig 8 and fig 9 indicating again that compared to szi scpdsi and spei are incapable of identifying agricultural drought at different time scales with increasing aridity over the seven climatic regions this shows that the scpdsi are restricted in recognizing the agricultural drought at different temporal scales and the performance of scpdsi decreases with increasing temporal scales after 12 month scale such conclusions point to szi as a better description of agricultural droughts than the spei regionally especially in water stressed regions and the scpdsi at multiple time scales 4 5 performances of szi spei and scpdsi for comprehensive drought monitoring using swi the relationship between swi and regionally averaged szi spei and scpdsi for the seven climatic regions from 1 to 50 month time scales during 1948 2017 are shown in fig 10 evidently in all the seven climatic regions the intercomparison between szi swi have a higher value of r compared to other relationship at every time scale the mean r values of szi swi range between 0 43 region ii and 0 68 region vi which are generally higher than those for the spei swi range between 0 19 region v to 0 57 region vi and for the scpdsi swi range between 0 20 region ii to 0 48 region iv similarly the discrepancy between r values for szi swi and spei swi are highest in the inner mongolia steppe region i e region v average r is 60 and lowest in northeast humid semi humid warm region and south china humid tropical region respectively i e average r for both regions i and iv are 9 8 this indicates that the performance of spei in determining the swi also weakens with increasing aridity while szi generally performs better than the spei across all climatic regions fig 11 further illustrates the trends of swi szi spei scpdsi at different time scale for all the seven climatic regions there was a decrease in the trend of szi and scpdsi between 1 and 9 months followed by a slight increase in scpdsi trend between 12 and 48 months in contrast spei increased between 1 and 9 months stable between 12 and 24 months and later increased gradually between 36 and 48 months the discrepancy between r values for szi swi and spei swi increased gradually from 7 at 1 month to 30 at 48 month on the other hand the r values for szi swi and scpdsi swi was 49 at 1 month and decreased slightly to 19 at 48 month fig 10 and fig 11 this shows that at higher time scale i e 12 48 month the discrepancy between szi swi and scpdsi swi was smaller than that of szi swi and spei swi showing that the performance of spei decreases with increasing time scale from 1 to 48 month the r for szi swi are also generally higher than those for spei swi at the regional scale especially in arid regions and scpdsi swi at multiple temporal scales the higher r values for szi swi in all the seven climatic regions indicated a closer relationship of szi with wer overall the findings revealed that szi could surely describe comprehensive droughts using the components of water energy balance at the regional scale 5 discussion generally different drought indices center on different aspects of drought and they require different variables for their estimation therefore for a specific drought event various indices could yield different results vicente serrano et al 2012 wang et al 2015 in an attempt to use a comprehensive composite index that captures droughts from different perspectives i e meteorological agricultural and hydrological drought we used a combined water energy balance approach to address both the supply and atmospheric demand aspects of droughts in this study we regionally evaluate and compare the performance of drought indices that employ p i e szi and scpdsi with existing indices that use pet i e spei as a measure of atmospheric water demand metric also included in the intercomparison are standard drought monitoring indicators such as the spi ssi sswi and swi an index based on p ro δs and wer observations respectively these indices were computed at multiple time scales utilizing independent data sources allowing comparability particularly in the arid and humid regions the relative performance in multicategory and multi scalar drought identification are reported in terms of pearson correlation coefficient chambers et al 1983 draper and smith 1998 by this statistical relationship we obtained the measure of linear dependence between pairs of spi szi spei scpdsi ssi szi spei scpdsi sswi szi spei scpdsi and swi szi spei scpdsi drought indices the spearman nonparametric coefficient of rank correlation which does not assume linear dependence was also tested and yielded similar results in terms of ranking correlation strength between drought indices on the whole the szi spei and scpdsi drought indices presented different abilities when compared with spi ssi sswi and swi drought indices in various regions which of course raises the question of regional applicability for instance investigating the droughts indices over the seven climatic regions in china our result showed that the correlation of spi ssi sswi and swi with szi are generally much higher than with spei and scpdsi in both arid and humid regions the scpdsi are limited in identifying multicategory drought as the performance decreases with increasing temporal scale although the consistency of spei is similar to szi across different temporal scale it is more appropriate for multi scalar drought analysis in humid regions simply because the rate of evapotranspiration anomaly as a result of t fluctuation in the surface water balance is comparatively large in the arid than in humid regions besides the higher values of r between pairs of szi spi szi ssi sswi and szi swi in the seven climatic regions indicated a closer relationship of szi with p ro δs and wer component of the hydrologic budget hence suggesting szi as a useful index for monitoring multicategory drought similar results of the excellent performance of szi have also been reported in some studies most especially in water stressed regions zhang et al 2015 zhang and he 2016 zhang et al 2019 many authors have noticed that the main discrepancies between existing drought indices are caused by uncertainty in atmospheric water demand used in evaluating drought indices sheffield et al 2012a b zhang et al 2015 especially in water limited regions where the actual atmospheric water uptake is primarily dominated by change in p rather than in pet yang et al 2006 for example the spei s energy budget appears to control the water budget component in water limited regions while in the case of szi it adopts a revised atmospheric water demand estimates that maintains the balance between both water and energy budgets enabling more physically based and reliable drought information concisely the strength of szi is that unlike spei the atmospheric water demand was evaluated using p i e originally from pdsi palmer 1965 which takes into account most components of the surface water energy balance i e p et ro r and l in this way the physical mechanisms of spei and scpdsi are improved therefore through series of cross comparisons we have attested that employing pet as a measure of atmospheric water demand for drought evaluation and monitoring leads to some biases especially over water limited regions where p rather than pet primarily controls the actual evapotranspiration knowing that szi is physically more consistent in reflecting surface water energy balance over both humid and non humid regions it can better describe the multi category droughts than the spei regionally especially in water limited regions and the scpdsi at various time scales therefore the improved drought appraisal with the szi is the outcome of a more rational evaluation of atmospheric water demand by including p ro and δs all that control meteorological hydrological and agricultural droughts respectively this could assist in providing estimable early warning of rapidly evolving drought most especially in water limited regions 6 conclusions this study evaluates and appraises the applicability of szi spei and scpdsi drought indices as well as their ability to represent both multi category e g meteorological hydrological and agricultural and multi scaler drought identification over seven climatic regions in china using gldas cru ts and gleam satellite observed data from 1948 to 2017 some key conclusions drawn are as follows i the climatic water balance p pet is overly depended on t data which could change depending on the regional variation of t and p hence affecting the spatial consistency and comparability of spei ii the physically based water and energy balance approach and corresponding moisture departure are able to regularize the effect of p and t by considering soil moisture related hydrometeorological processes previously defined by pdsi iii the szi a standardized multi scalar drought index is derived by modifying the standardization procedure of pdsi on the basis of the mathematical framework of spei hence combining the simplicity of calculation with sufficient accounting of the physical nature of water supply and demand relating to droughts iv the spi spei is derived solely from the analyses of climate variables such as p and t and mainly for consideration of meteorological droughts in contrast the improved drought assessment with the szi is the result of including p ro and δs all that influence meteorological hydrological and agricultural droughts respectively v applications in this study showed that the computed szi series correlated well and even performed better than spei and scpdsi at multiple temporal scales which suggests that the multicategory and multi scalar szi is more reasonable in advancing comprehensive and composite drought monitoring and management with different purposes overall our results demonstrate that adopting p as water demand metric is more flexible in determining surface water energy balance over both arid and humid regions facilitating better characterization of multi category and multi scalar droughts in different climate regions although szi supports comprehensive drought identification and analysis it is important to explore its spatial consistency under climate change in the future declaration of competing interest the

6033,the uncertainties in atmospheric water demand used in evaluating drought indices are the primary cause of discrepancies between them especially in water limited regions this study evaluated standardized moisture anomaly index szi using a combined water energy balance approach and compared the performance with the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and self calibrated palmer drought severity index scpdsi over seven climatic regions in china from 1948 to 2017 the atmospheric water demand in szi is evaluated using climatically appropriate precipitation for existing conditions cafec which takes into account most parts of the surface water energy balance i e precipitation evapotranspiration runoff and soil moisture recharge and loss the relative performances of szi spei and scpdsi for multicategory and multi scalar drought identification are reported in terms of pearson correlation coefficient through a series of cross comparisons our result explains that the szi spei and scpdsi drought indices presented dissimilar abilities in different regions which of course raises the issue of regional applicability the performance of szi is better than spei and scpdsi in both humid and non humid regions although the consistency of spei is similar to szi across different temporal scale it is more appropriate for multi scalar drought analysis in humid regions the scpdsi are inconsistent in identifying multicategory drought the enhanced drought appraisal with the szi is the consequence of a more objective evaluation of atmospheric water demand by incorporating precipitation runoff and change in water storage all that control meteorological hydrological and agricultural droughts respectively the szi can offer a better multi category and multi scalar droughts information which could aid in providing valuable early warning of rapidly evolving drought most notably in the water limited region keywords drought indices drought monitoring

the relative advantages and shortcomings of the individual drought index anderson et al 2013 for instance spi mckee et al 1993 and sri shukla and wood 2008 are computed for a variety of time scales which allows them to monitor short term drought such as meteorological drought and long term drought such as hydrological drought mishra and singh 2010 huang et al 2017 their major fault is that they are based solely on p and runoff ro observations respectively which might be insufficient in describing surface water imbalances caused by drought ma et al 2014 mcevoy et al 2016 ford and labosier 2017 therefore considering the multi category nature of droughts a single variable index might not independently identify diverse categories of drought farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 the spei measures drought severity in terms of accumulated climatic water balance anomalies by including the difference between available water supply i e p and atmospheric water demand i e potential evapotranspiration pet vicente serrano et al 2010 beguería et al 2014 ayantobo et al 2019 research has explicated that variation exists in the relations between p and pet across different climate regions yang et al 2006 xu et al 2013 yang et al 2015 and large et rates associated to high t are equally relevant and may reinforce drought severity therefore it is necessary to acknowledge impacts of p deficiency and also consider droughts as water stress conditions caused by both p shortages and high atmospheric evaporative demand vicente serrano et al 2010 ma et al 2014 gouveia et al 2017 in most water limited i e arid and semi arid regions pet is often substantially higher than et and p unep 1992 yang et al 2006 although pet plays an essential role in delineating the climatic boundary of a region from arid to humid relying on it for detailing droughts can lead to biases in water limited regions pereira et al 2009 paulo et al 2012 yang et al 2018 studies have also revealed that in water limited regions change in et is frequently dominated by a change in p rather than in pet while in a humid region change in et is generally controlled by a change in pet rather than p budyko 1974 yang et al 2006 yang et al 2018 although there have been numerous global and regional applications of spei for multi category drought studies some critical drawbacks have been reported based on the discrepancies in the relationships between p et and pet across different climatic regions these includes i spei mostly measures meteorological drought and may result to biases in representing other drought categories dai

droughts because it incorporates range of variables necessary to evaluate long term drought scenario of a particular area and time palmer 1965 dai et al 2004 wells et al 2004 ma et al 2014 in estimating the surface water energy balance pdsi adopts a two layer bucket model to quantify monthly cumulative moisture departure palmer 1965 wells et al 2004 ma et al 2014 the previous and present moisture supply and demand are included into the hydrological budget system in which water supply is recognized as p while water demand as ro et and changes in soil water storage δs despite common critiques of pdsi includes i lack of a physically based surface water energy balance ii inconsistency in the performance at various location and iii insensitivity to temperature vicente serrano et al 2010 sheffield et al 2012a b zhang et al 2015 wells et al 2004 modified pdsi by adopting an automatically calculating procedure to develop scpdsi which improved the spatial comparability of pdsi but even so the overall weakness of pdsi remain unsolved and the unchanged approximation of climatic characteristic using an empirically semilogarithmic regression method still depends heavily on other reference locations and data wells et al 2004 palmer 1965 most of the above cited indices have been promoted to quantify drought in china wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 hao et al 2017 ayantobo et al 2019 however recognizing their major weakness and also the complex topography and climatic fluctuation from region to region zhai et al 2010 wu et al 2011 a more physically based approach is needed to enhance the performances of these indices for multi category drought monitoring in china therefore the main novelty of this study is to adopt a combined water energy balance procedure to address both supply and atmospheric demand aspects of droughts through standardized moisture anomaly index szi zhang et al 2015 the szi employs a modern land surface model to estimate the aggregate moisture departure and also incorporates a multi scalar feature to analyze drought events at various temporal scales unlike spei the atmospheric water demand is determined using climatically appropriate precipitation for existing conditions cafec denoted as p i e the minimum amount of p needed to maintain a normal soil moisture level for a certain region which initially came from pdsi palmer 1965 wells et al 2004 although szi has been recommended for monitoring multi category drought most especially in water stressed regions wells et al 2004 dai 2011 zhang et al 2015 zhang and he 2016 it has not been widely explored in literature for regional drought analysis consequently the primary intent of this research is to regionally appraise the szi for multi category and multi scalar drought identification over seven climatic regions in china to realize this we studied the connections between p et and pet and also explored the performances of szi spei and scpdsi using standard drought indices i e spi ssi standardized soil water index sswi and standardized water energy index swi for multi category drought monitoring the remainder of the article is prepared as follows section 2

topography and climate mainland china is subdivided into seven regions zhao 1983 ayantobo et al 2017 including northeast humid semi humid warm region region i north china humid semi humid temperate

gleam eu the gleam is a collection of algorithms that distinctly evaluate the various components of et through 1980 2017 transpiration et bare soil evaporation eb and interception loss ei based on satellite observations the cru ts 4 01 and gleam v3 1a datasets were utilized to estimate spi ssi sswi and swi i e residual water energy ratio and to examine the performance of szi spei and scpdsi in multi category drought identification through characteristics of water energy balance 3 methods 3 1 degree of dryness of the climatic regions the degree of dryness in the study regions are quantified using the long term average of the wetness index wi estimated as follows unep 1992 1 wi p p e t the wi is computed for the seven climatic regions for the period 1948 2017 and the regions were then classified as arid wi 0 2 semi arid 0 2 wi 0 5 sub humid 0 5 wi 0 75 and humid wi 0 75 unep 1992 in the present study wi ranged from 0 05 at northwest desert areas region vi to 0 92 at south china humid tropical zone region iv thus revealing that a region s climate varies from arid to humid for more specific information of the climatic regions please see table 1 3 2 evaluation of c a f e c and pet based drought indices in this study we regionally appraise the performances of drought indices that use p i e szi and scpdsi with existing indices that use pet i e spei as a means of atmospheric water demand metric based on the output of gldasv2 noah for the seven climatic regions in china during 1948 2017 the spei is based on the probability distribution of the monthly difference d between p and pet cumulated across various time scales and is normalized following the spi drought classification vicente serrano et al 2010 the difference p pet is attributed to as a climatic water balance where monthly p and pet based on the penman monteith method allen et al 1998 are collected from gldasv2 noah 2 d p p e t vicente serrano et al 2010 examined different probability distributions and eventually chose the three parameter log logistic distribution for estimating the spei complete calculation procedures for the spei can be read in vicente serrano et al 2010 the szi and scpdsi utilizes the differences between actual p and computed p in a specific month to measure the wet or dry conditions based on water budget analysis four water balance components were computed monthly together with their potential values to calculate p these include evapotranspiration et surface runoff ro soil moisture recharge r and loss l potential evapotranspiration pet potential runoff pro potential recharge pr and potential moisture loss pl these eight components are closely associated with available water capacity of the soil and represent a more complex but comprehensive soil water balance in the surface level ma et al 2014 the p et pet and ro are obtained from gldasv2 noah output while the other components are calculated as follows 3 r δ s t δ s u δ s t δ s u 0 0 δ s t δ s u 0

potential moisture loss from surface layer pls is potential moisture loss from underlying layer pl is total potential moisture loss st and su are surface layer 0 10 cm and underlying layer 10 200 cm available soil moisture respectively derived from gldasv2 noah outputs δst and δsu are their monthly variable quantity estimated from st and su awc is available soil water holding capacity of the two layers the water balance coefficients were estimated as the ratios of the monthly climatic means of actual to potential values as follows palmer 1965 8 α et j pet j β r j pr j γ ro j pro j δ l j pl j where j ranges across the months of a year i e j 1 12 the weighting factors α β γ and δ are called evapotranspiration coefficient recharge coefficient runoff coefficient and loss coefficient respectively the derived water balance coefficients are later used to determine the monthly value of p as follows 9 p α j p e t β j p r γ j p r o δ j p l since p takes most components of the surface water energy balance i e p et ro l and r into account during estimation it is physically more reliable than pet as an indicator of atmospheric water demand palmer 1965 dai et al 2004 dai 2011 ma et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 the difference between p and p is called the moisture anomaly index which indicates the water deficit or surplus is formulated as follows 10 z p p since both d and z series can be negative i e similar range the three parameter log logistic distribution recommended for d series by vicente serrano et al 2010 was selected to standardize the z series to derive the szi at various timescales scpdsi is calculated based on the methods described in wells et al 2004 3 3 evaluation of standardized drought indices meteorological hydrological agricultural and comprehensive droughts are analyzed in four levels by examining p ro δs and wer via the spi mckee et al 1993 standardized runoff index ssi shukla and wood 2008 standardized soil water index sswi wang et al 2011 hao and aghakouchak 2013 and standardized water energy index swi zhang et al 2019 respectively in the seven climatic regions to ensure that spi ssi sswi and wer are independent of szi spei and scpdsi the p pet ro and et are obtained from the cru ts 4 01 and gleam et products the δs is evaluated as 11 δ s p r o e t where ro is runoff and et is based on remote sensing dataset that has been validated using eddy covariance tower flux data sets and it is estimated as miralles et al 2011 martens et al 2017 12 et e t e b e i et eb and ei are transpiration bare soil evaporation and interception loss respectively research has shown that energy and water correlate negatively during drought scenarios this shows that the total energy supplied i e ratio of sensible heat to net radiation during drought is comparatively higher than normal condition while the total water supplied i e residual available water to precipitation is usually lower than the normal condition yin et al 2014 liu et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 as a result the ratio of residual available water p et to residual energy pet et is relatively lower higher during dry wet scenarios than normal condition liu et al 2017 this ratio is defined as wer and is referred to as swi in this research 13 wer p e t p e t e t the spi ssi sswi and swi indices are indexed with a similar standardized procedure which can be illustrated by the ensuing four steps i fit a probability density function to the frequency distribution of the target variable summed over the timescale of interest and test the goodness of fit by the kolmogorov smirnov nonparametric test massey 1951 ii use the fitted distribution to estimate the cumulative probabilities by numerical solution methods iii transform the cumulative probabilities to the z values of a normal distribution with zero mean and unit variance iv identify the drought condition according to certain threshold values of the standardized indices here we computed spi ssi sswi and swi from 1 to 50 months to monitor different time scales of drought these indices are completely independent of the szi spei and scpdsi which is based on gldasv2 noah 3 4 evaluating the performance of szi spei and scpdsi to investigate the performance of szi spei and scpdsi the results were correlated with the observed drought based on the spi representing meteorological drought ssi representing hydrological drought sswi representing agricultural drought and swi representing comprehensive drought using water energy balance characteristics over the seven climatic regions the relative performance in multicategory and multi scalar drought monitoring are in terms of pearson correlation coefficient r chambers et al 1983 draper and smith 1998 anderson et al 2013 which is the measure of linear dependence between pairs of spi szi spei scpdsi ssi szi spei scpdsi sswi szi spei scpdsi and swi szi spei scpdsi obtained at 1 50 month scales 4 results 4 1 water supply and demand relationship using p et and pet indices the fundamental interactions and corresponding roles of p et and pet vary with fluctuations in the climatic condition and topography over each region as shown in table 2 a high positive correlation between p et and pet was observed in most climatic regions for instance the average correlation r between p and p ranged from 0 72 region iv to 0 84 region v r between p and et ranged from 0 68 region iv to 0 86 region v r between p and pet ranged from 0 18 region iv to 0 79 region vi while r between et and pet ranged from 0 19 region iv to 0 82 region vi the averaged r between p and pet are much lower as compared to other variables with r values lower in humid regions and higher in the arid region fig 2 showed that the long term mean annual wi p pet ranged from 0 05 region vi to 0 92 region iv thus revealing that a region s climate varies from arid to humid the evaporation ratio et p ranged from 0 82 region iii to 2 93 region v while dryness index pet p ranged from 2 10 region iii to 19 21 region v during 1948 2017 for the seven climatic regions also the regional distribution of mean differences among p et pet and p can be found in fig 3 the average difference between p and et ranged between 0 54 region v to 54 87 region iv p and pet ranged between 150 85 region vi to 13 51 region iv while et and pet ranged from 148 39 region vi to 59 02 region iii as revealed in the figure the annual mean pet is much higher than p especially in arid regions while the magnitudes of annual mean p and p was quite similar i e their mean difference and p p ratio are generally around 0 and 1 0 respectively in all the regions from a natural perspective the relationship between p and p reflects that the atmospheric water demand and supply balances typically over a long time scale in all climatic region the results highlight that change of et is dominated by a change in p rather than pet in arid regions while a change in et is controlled by a change in pet rather than p in humid regions atmospheric water demand is limited by available p in arid regions and by pet in humid regions which also agrees with earlier studies yang et al 2006 4 2 performances of szi spei and scpdsi for meteorological drought monitoring using spi meteorological drought occurs as a result of a deficiency in p showing that the primary driver of meteorological drought is p mckee et al 1993 therefore it is worth monitoring the performance of szi spei and scpdsi in terms of meteorological drought using p based drought index such as spi the statistical metrics in fig 4 give general information regarding the relationship between spi and regionally averaged szi spei and scpdsi indices for the seven climatic regions at 1 to 50 month time scales during 1948 2017 the figure shows that r values of szi spi had stronger correlations in all the seven climatic regions indicating a closer relationship between szi and p component of the hydrologic budget the mean r values of szi spi range between 0 36 region vii and 0 77 region v which are generally higher than those for the spei spi range between 0 16 region vi to 0 69 region v and for the scpdsi spi range between 0 11 region vii to 0 52 region v the discrepancy between r values for szi spi and spei spi are highest in northwestern desert region i e region vi average r is 67 and lowest in the northeast humid semi humid warm region i e region i average r is 9 showing that the spei underperforms in identifying meteorological droughts in the arid region fig 5 also illustrates the trends of spi szi spei scpdsi at different time scale for all the seven climatic regions there is an upward trend in szi and spei for 1 48 month while in the case of scpdsi a slight increase from 1 to 6 month followed by a decreasing trend from 12 to 48 month was observed the discrepancy between r values for szi spi and spei spi decreased from 11 at 1 month to 8 at 3 month and gradually increased from 18 12 month to 40 48 month the performance of spei decreases with increasing temporal scales after 3 month scale in contrast the discrepancy between r values for szi spi and scpdsi spi are highest at 1 month scale i e averaged r is 69 and lowest at the 48 month scale i e averaged r is 38 fig 4 and fig 5 indicating that the scpdsi are incapable of identifying meteorological drought at varied time scales this demonstrates that the szi can better represent the meteorological droughts than the spei i e mainly in water limited regions and the scpdsi at multiple temporal scales 4 3 performances of szi spei and scpdsi for hydrological drought monitoring using ssi the connection between the streamflow and moisture availability described by szi spei and scpdsi are examined to obtain a better perception of the show of szi spei and scpdsi in hydrological droughts monitoring fig 6 illustrates the correlation between ssi and regionally averaged szi spei and scpdsi for the seven climatic regions at 1 to 50 month time scales among all indices included in the inter comparison szi ssi relationship is the most highly correlated with time in all the regions as shown in this figure the mean r values szi ssi range between 0 52 region vii and 0 80 region vi which are generally higher than those for the scpdsi ssi range between 0 29 region iii to 0 74 region vi and for the spei ssi range between 0 06 region vi to 0 62 region i the discrepancy between r values for szi ssi and spei ssi are highest in northwestern desert region i e region vi average r is 90 and lowest in the central and southern china humid subtropical region i e region i average r is 14 showing that the spei underperforms in identifying hydrological droughts in the arid region fig 7 further illustrates the trends of ssi szi spei scpdsi at different time scale for all the seven climatic regions there was an increase decrease trend for spei scpdsi respectively from 1 to 48 month while in the case of szi there was an increased trend from 1 to 12 month followed by a decreasing trend from 18 to 48 month the discrepancy between r values for szi ssi and spei ssi increased gradually from 34 at 1 month to 54 at 48 month the performance of spei decreases with increasing time scale from 1 to 48 month on the other hand the r values for szi ssi and scpdsi ssi were 23 at 1 month and increased slightly to 28 at 48 month these values were generally lower compared to the discrepancy between szi ssi and spei ssi also in fig 6 the average values of r for scpdsi were higher than spei in regions v vi and vii indicating that the scpdsi tries to recognize hydrological drought at various time scales better than spei in the arid regions the r values of szi ssi are higher in all the seven climatic regions indicating a closer relationship of szi with runoff component of the hydrologic budget 4 4 performances of szi spei and scpdsi for agricultural drought monitoring using sswi agricultural drought mostly occurs from low levels of soil water storage which consequently impacts agricultural activities so the correlations between the δs and szi spei scpdsi were studied to appraise their performances for agricultural droughts monitoring fig 8 shows the relationship between sswi and regionally averaged szi spei and scpdsi for the seven climatic regions at 1 to 50 month time scales during 1948 2017 the figure shows that the r values of szi sswi are higher in all the seven climatic regions indicating a closer relationship of szi with δs components of the hydrologic budget the mean r values of szi sswi range between 0 40 region vii and 0 84 region v which are generally higher than those for the spei sswi range between 0 03 region v to 0 62 region i and for the scpdsi sswi range between 0 14 region vi to 0 40 region i the discrepancy between r values for szi sswi and spei sswi are highest in northwestern desert region i e region vi average r is 104 and lowest in the northeast humid semi humid warm region i e region i average r is 14 showing that the spei underperforms in identifying agricultural droughts in the arid region also fig 9 illustrates the trends of sswi szi spei scpdsi at different time scale for all the seven climatic regions there was an upward trend in szi and spei from 1 to 48 month while in the case of scpdsi the trend increases between 1 and 18 months and after that decreased slightly between 18 and 48 months the discrepancy between the average r values for szi sswi and spei sswi for all climatic regions are 7 14 18 25 32 44 54 73 83 while that of szi sswi and scpdsi sswi are 71 70 69 68 71 72 77 86 95 for 1 3 6 9 12 18 24 36 and 48 months respectively the performances of spei and scpdsi decreases with increasing temporal scales fig 8 and fig 9 indicating again that compared to szi scpdsi and spei are incapable of identifying agricultural drought at different time scales with increasing aridity over the seven climatic regions this shows that the scpdsi are restricted in recognizing the agricultural drought at different temporal scales and the performance of scpdsi decreases with increasing temporal scales after 12 month scale such conclusions point to szi as a better description of agricultural droughts than the spei regionally especially in water stressed regions and the scpdsi at multiple time scales 4 5 performances of szi spei and scpdsi for comprehensive drought monitoring using swi the relationship between swi and regionally averaged szi spei and scpdsi for the seven climatic regions from 1 to 50 month time scales during 1948 2017 are shown in fig 10 evidently in all the seven climatic regions the intercomparison between szi swi have a higher value of r compared to other relationship at every time scale the mean r values of szi swi range between 0 43 region ii and 0 68 region vi which are generally higher than those for the spei swi range between 0 19 region v to 0 57 region vi and for the scpdsi swi range between 0 20 region ii to 0 48 region iv similarly the discrepancy between r values for szi swi and spei swi are highest in the inner mongolia steppe region i e region v average r is 60 and lowest in northeast humid semi humid warm region and south china humid tropical region respectively i e average r for both regions i and iv are 9 8 this indicates that the performance of spei in determining the swi also weakens with increasing aridity while szi generally performs better than the spei across all climatic regions fig 11 further illustrates the trends of swi szi spei scpdsi at different time scale for all the seven climatic regions there was a decrease in the trend of szi and scpdsi between 1 and 9 months followed by a slight increase in scpdsi trend between 12 and 48 months in contrast spei increased between 1 and 9 months stable between 12 and 24 months and later increased gradually between 36 and 48 months the discrepancy between r values for szi swi and spei swi increased gradually from 7 at 1 month to 30 at 48 month on the other hand the r values for szi swi and scpdsi swi was 49 at 1 month and decreased slightly to 19 at 48 month fig 10 and fig 11 this shows that at higher time scale i e 12 48 month the discrepancy between szi swi and scpdsi swi was smaller than that of szi swi and spei swi showing that the performance of spei decreases with increasing time scale from 1 to 48 month the r for szi swi are also generally higher than those for spei swi at the regional scale especially in arid regions and scpdsi swi at multiple temporal scales the higher r values for szi swi in all the seven climatic regions indicated a closer relationship of szi with wer overall the findings revealed that szi could surely describe comprehensive droughts using the components of water energy balance at the regional scale 5 discussion generally different drought indices center on different aspects of drought and they require different variables for their estimation therefore for a specific drought event various indices could yield different results vicente serrano et al 2012 wang et al 2015 in an attempt to use a comprehensive composite index that captures droughts from different perspectives i e meteorological agricultural and hydrological drought we used a combined water energy balance approach to address both the supply and atmospheric demand aspects of droughts in this study we regionally evaluate and compare the performance of drought indices that employ p i e szi and scpdsi with existing indices that use pet i e spei as a measure of atmospheric water demand metric also included in the intercomparison are standard drought monitoring indicators such as the spi ssi sswi and swi an index based on p ro δs and wer observations respectively these indices were computed at multiple time scales utilizing independent data sources allowing comparability particularly in the arid and humid regions the relative performance in multicategory and multi scalar drought identification are reported in terms of pearson correlation coefficient chambers et al 1983 draper and smith 1998 by this statistical relationship we obtained the measure of linear dependence between pairs of spi szi spei scpdsi ssi szi spei scpdsi sswi szi spei scpdsi and swi szi spei scpdsi drought indices the spearman nonparametric coefficient of rank correlation which does not assume linear dependence was also tested and yielded similar results in terms of ranking correlation strength between drought indices on the whole the szi spei and scpdsi drought indices presented different abilities when compared with spi ssi sswi and swi drought indices in various regions which of course raises the question of regional applicability for instance investigating the droughts indices over the seven climatic regions in china our result showed that the correlation of spi ssi sswi and swi with szi are generally much higher than with spei and scpdsi in both arid and humid regions the scpdsi are limited in identifying multicategory drought as the performance decreases with increasing temporal scale although the consistency of spei is similar to szi across different temporal scale it is more appropriate for multi scalar drought analysis in humid regions simply because the rate of evapotranspiration anomaly as a result of t fluctuation in the surface water balance is comparatively large in the arid than in humid regions besides the higher values of r between pairs of szi spi szi ssi sswi and szi swi in the seven climatic regions indicated a closer relationship of szi with p ro δs and wer component of the hydrologic budget hence suggesting szi as a useful index for monitoring multicategory drought similar results of the excellent performance of szi have also been reported in some studies most especially in water stressed regions zhang et al 2015 zhang and he 2016 zhang et al 2019 many authors have noticed that the main discrepancies between existing drought indices are caused by uncertainty in atmospheric water demand used in evaluating drought indices sheffield et al 2012a b zhang et al 2015 especially in water limited regions where the actual atmospheric water uptake is primarily dominated by change in p rather than in pet yang et al 2006 for example the spei s energy budget appears to control the water budget component in water limited regions while in the case of szi it adopts a revised atmospheric water demand estimates that maintains the balance between both water and energy budgets enabling more physically based and reliable drought information concisely the strength of szi is that unlike spei the atmospheric water demand was evaluated using p i e originally from pdsi palmer 1965 which takes into account most components of the surface water energy balance i e p et ro r and l in this way the physical mechanisms of spei and scpdsi are improved therefore through series of cross comparisons we have attested that employing pet as a measure of atmospheric water demand for drought evaluation and monitoring leads to some biases especially over water limited regions where p rather than pet primarily controls the actual evapotranspiration knowing that szi is physically more consistent in reflecting surface water energy balance over both humid and non humid regions it can better describe the multi category droughts than the spei regionally especially in water limited regions and the scpdsi at various time scales therefore the improved drought appraisal with the szi is the outcome of a more rational evaluation of atmospheric water demand by including p ro and δs all that control meteorological hydrological and agricultural droughts respectively this could assist in providing estimable early warning of rapidly evolving drought most especially in water limited regions 6 conclusions this study evaluates and appraises the applicability of szi spei and scpdsi drought indices as well as their ability to represent both multi category e g meteorological hydrological and agricultural and multi scaler drought identification over seven climatic regions in china using gldas cru ts and gleam satellite observed data from 1948 to 2017 some key conclusions drawn are as follows i the climatic water balance p pet is overly depended on t data which could change depending on the regional variation of t and p hence affecting the spatial consistency and comparability of spei ii the physically based water and energy balance approach and corresponding moisture departure are able to regularize the effect of p and t by considering soil moisture related hydrometeorological processes previously defined by pdsi iii the szi a standardized multi scalar drought index is derived by modifying the standardization procedure of pdsi on the basis of the mathematical framework of spei hence combining the simplicity of calculation with sufficient accounting of the physical nature of water supply and demand relating to droughts iv the spi spei is derived solely from the analyses of climate variables such as p and t and mainly for consideration of meteorological droughts in contrast the improved drought assessment with the szi is the result of including p ro and δs all that influence meteorological hydrological and agricultural droughts respectively v applications in this study showed that the computed szi series correlated well and even performed better than spei and scpdsi at multiple temporal scales which suggests that the multicategory and multi scalar szi is more reasonable in advancing comprehensive and composite drought monitoring and management with different purposes overall our results demonstrate that adopting p as water demand metric is more flexible in determining surface water energy balance over both arid and humid regions facilitating better characterization of multi category and multi scalar droughts in different climate regions although szi supports comprehensive drought identification and analysis it is important to explore its spatial consistency under climate change in the future declaration of competing interest the

validated by comparison with laboratory experiments the surface geometry and the dilation behavior were subsequently incorporated into a hydraulic module to estimate the hydraulic aperture and flow rate based on the cubic law finally these data were input into a solute transport module to investigate the influences of the mechanical boundary conditions on the solute transport in the fracture and the matrix at different shear displacements and time the model linked the complex mechanisms involved in the mechanical hydraulic and solute transport processes for fractures subjected to shear and revealed a controlling effect of normal stiffness on the transport behavior the results show that the normal displacement normal stress cumulative sheared off area and porosity of matrix change quickly in the initial stage of shear and gradually reach some constant values when the fracture surface is sufficiently smoothed in the residual stage in the entire shear process the major asperities are substantially damaged producing abundant gouge particles that contribute to the retardation of solute transport the shear induced dilation and the retardation induced by gouge particles from damaged asperities played competitive roles in solute transport that resulted in the nonlinear variations in the coefficient of retardation the model established a solid platform for estimating the mechanical hydraulic solute transport processes in fractures subjected to shear upon which more sophisticated modules such as pressure solution and clogging by particles may be developed to improve the understanding on the outstanding issues involved in the coupled processes keywords fracture shear fluid flow solute transport constant normal stiffness retardation 1 introduction understanding the coupled mechanical hydraulic solute transport properties of fractures is essential for the long term safety assessment of high level radio active waste repositories constructed in deep seated rock masses tsang et al 2015 zhao et al 2019 in the host rocks the fractures form major paths for solute transport due to their typically much greater permeability than that of the intact rocks zhao et al 2004 leung and zimmerman 2012 min et al 2004 baghbanan and jing 2008 zhao et al 2018a deep seated rock fractures are subjected to in situ stresses that increase with depth and thereby reducing the permeability of fractures meanwhile a shear process on rock fractures tends to increase the permeability and the magnitude increased by shear is appreciably greater than that resulting from a pure normal loading unloading process under the same stress level li et al 2008 xue et al 2013 such permeability enhancement is mainly attributed to the shear induced dilation on rough surfaces which can substantially influence the speed and path of solute transport in fractured rock masses for laboratory investigations on the shear behavior of rock fractures conventional direct shear tests apply a constant normal load cnl boundary which assumes that the normal load keeps constant during shear reitsma and kueper 1994 yeo et al 1998 muralha et al 2014 this boundary condition is only applicable to the rocks without constraints from the surrounding environment such as free rock blocks sliding upon slopes for deep seated rock fractures the shear induced dilation will be noticeably constrained by the surrounding rock masses a constant normal stiffness cns boundary condition is more representative for the deep seated rocks comparing with the cnl boundary condition saeb and amadei 1990 1992 indraratna et al 1999 jiang et al 2004 therefore the cns boundary conditions need to be incorporated into mechanical models designed for estimating the shear behavior of deep seated rough walled fractures most experimental and numerical tests on rock fractures subjected to shear are meant to estimate their shear strength which principally originates from three components i e the basic frictional strength the asperity sliding and the asperity shearing saeb and amadei 1992 haberfield and johnston 1994 the asperity sliding and shearing represent the undamaged and damaged states of contacting asperities respectively while the frictional strength and asperity sliding can be represented by a basic friction angle and a dilation angle respectively the asperity shearing needs to be modeled upon mechanics that interpret and represent the crushing and shear off phenomena on contacting asperities johnston and lam 1989 saeb and amadei 1992 haberfield and johnston 1994 indraratna et al 2015 earlier models used idealized fracture profiles such as triangular and sine shaped profiles to represent the surface roughness and to establish the mechanical models for contacting asperities dight and chiu 1981 saeb and amadei 1992 statistical and empirical parameters such as joint roughness coefficient jrc were later employed to quantify natural irregular roughness in shear models barton and choubey 1977 zhao et al 2015 indraratna et al 2015 zheng and qi 2016 since the normal stress changes along with the dilation under cns conditions the normal stress evolution as well as the resulting shear stress increment need to be estimated and updated in a step wise manner during the entire shear process li et al 2018 modeling shear behavior of natural rough walled fractures under cns conditions still faces strong challenges in terms of roughness characterization failure mechanism identification and realization and step wise updating of evolving parameters on the other hand the dilation behavior of fractures during shear has a significant impact on their hydraulic and solute transport properties the permeability of fractures is typically enhanced during shear due to dilation although some studies reported the permeability may be reduced by contraction and or asperity damage ishibashi et al 2016 wu et al 2017 ye and ghassemi 2018 im et al 2018 solute transport in fractures relies heavily on their hydraulic properties which is governed by different mechanisms such as advection hydrodynamic dispersion sorption reactions matrix diffusion limited spatial and temporal scales and flow structures i e eddy or recirculation zone neretnieks 1980 tang et al 1981 zhao et al 2014a fiori and becker 2015 ahmad et al 2016 guihéneuf et al 2017 while most of previous studies only considered normal stresses a few pioneer works have been put forward to address the influences of shear processes on the solute transport in fractures e g zhao et al 2011 babadagli et al 2015 in these models however the complex natural fracture geometry was simplified to idealized models without considering the influences of roughness fig 1 a c fig 1 d shows the conceptual model for fluid flow and or solute transport during shear under cns boundary conditions the upper block is sheared along x direction while the lower block is fixed the fluid solute is injected into the model through one end of the fracture and flows out of the model through the other end of the fracture after fluid solute diffusions within the fracture and matrix the direction of the normal stress is perpendicular to the fracture plane the simplified modeling of normal displacement shear displacement curve fig 2 a exhibits significant discrepancies with the conceptual model fig 2 b and the testing results on natural fractures fig 2 c olsson and barton 2001 xiong et al 2011 more realistic representation of the dilation behavior of rock fractures during shear is strongly required which needs to be incorporated into coupled shear flow models to address the influence of shear on the solute transport behavior in rock fractures besides the shear induced dilation the debris or gouge generated by shear is another important issue that influences the solute transport in fractures because sorption of solutes on the surfaces of gouge particles leads to the retardation of solute transport zhao et al 2012 the retardation coefficient is frequently used in analytical models to account for the retardation effect of gouge particles which changes proportionally with the increased absorptive surface area provided by the particles therefore estimating the particle sizes and their distribution becomes a key issue previous studies on sheared fractures found that the particles may exhibit a power law distribution amitrano and schmittbuhl 2002 and the percentage of coarse particle decreases and the percentages of fine and silt clay particle increase with the increasing shear displacement pereira and de freitas 1993 mechanical models that are capable of assessing the sheared off volumes of asperities at an arbitrary shear displacement need to be developed to establish the basis for particle distribution and therefore retardation coefficient estimations in light of the outstanding issues mentioned above in the present study we developed a 2 d analytical model that characterizes the shear behavior of initially well mated rough walled rock fractures under cns conditions at first this model provided the results of normal displacement and sheared off area during the entire shearing process which were then used to estimate the evolutions of hydraulic aperture and retardant coefficient respectively these values were finally incorporated into a general transport solution for single fractures leading to an analytical model for shear flow transport processes the influences of several controlling parameters involved in the model on the solute transport behavior such as normal stiffness transport time and shear displacement were investigated quantitatively comparing to previous models that only take into account the dilation or the influence of gouge particles the developed model estimated their effects on solute transport simultaneously under cns conditions which may provide a platform for quantitative estimations on the mechanical hydraulic solute transport properties of sheared or shearing rock fractures e g faults in deep seated rock masses 2 modeling solute transport in rough walled fractures during shear 2 1 modeling of mechanical behavior of fractures during shear under cns conditions the mechanical behavior of fractures inherently influences the flow patterns of fluid within fractured rock masses and in turn affects the solute transport processes to quantitatively study the shear behavior of rock fractures under cns conditions li et al 2018 developed a continuously yielding model that characterizes the surface roughness by two order asperities the surface roughness was quantitatively decomposed into waviness and unevenness fig 3 and the measurable physical properties such as asperity wavelength and asperity angle were used for shear behavior estimation this model comparing to previous models that are merely applicable to regular shaped joints saeb and amadei 1992 indraratna et al 1999 and those employing statistical parameters like jrc to characterize fracture surface roughness indraratna et al 2015 can better represent the role played by the asperities of different sizes in a shear process however this model treated the dilation angle as a lumped parameter based on a sinusoidal function which was highly empirical in estimating the dilation behavior of shearing fractures that is the key to solve the stress flow transport processes in this study we separately quantify the contributions of dilation and asperity shearing to the total joint shear resistance which is more physically meaningful gerrard 1986 correlation between the improved model and the experimental data in this study has demonstrated its capacity which will be shown in detail in the following section 3 for brittle hard rocks such as granite the partial failure of asperities and generation of micro cracks could happen before the peak shear stress arrives instead of the ordinarily employed pre and post peak classification the entire shear process is simply divided into two stages i e the elastic stage and the plastic stage the term plastic is used to distinguish from the elastic behavior taking place in the initial shear stage during the plastic stage the asperities are gradually yielded and substantially sheared off the dilation behavior is governed by different mechanisms in the elastic stage and the plastic stage the shear stress shear displacement curve in the elastic stage is directly related to the shear displacement in a linear manner while the curve in the plastic stage is governed by a shear stiffness reduction factor that represents the degradation of asperities in the elastic stage the incremental shear stress depends linearly on the incremental shear displacement 1 δ τ k s δ δ s e where τ is the shear stress increment k s is the shear stiffness and δ δ s e is the shear displacement increment in the elastic stage in this study the k s is a constant that is 1 10 of the normal stiffness k n the shear stiffness of rock fractures typically ranges from 1 100 to 1 10 of the normal stiffness alber and hauptfleisch 1999 here a fixed ratio of 1 10 was selected to represent the behavior of hard rocks granite when the dilation commences the increasing normal displacement will increase the normal stress under cns conditions therefore the normal stress and the normal displacement are step wisely updated in li et al 2018 2a δ δ n δ δ s p tan i d i 2b δ n i δ n i 1 δ δ n 2c δ σ n k n δ δ n 2d σ n i σ n i 1 δ σ n where δ δ n is the increment of normal displacement δ δ s p is the increment of shear displacement in the plastic stage i d i is the dilation angle at step i and δ σ n is the increment of normal stress δ n i and δ n i 1 are the normal displacement at iterative steps i and i 1 respectively and σ n i and σ n i 1 are the normal stress at iterative steps i and i 1 respectively with the platform established by li et al 2018 we then introduce the principle of wear to estimate the evolutions of normal stress shear stress and normal displacement in the plastic stage we start the model construction with a simplified case where the asperity is triangular as shown in fig 4 a this model only contains a single wave without unevenness the classic wear theory barwell 1958 queener et al 1965 assumed that for a metal surface under shear the volume of surface roughness is a function of the normal stress shear displacement and surface roughness degree it was proposed that the increment of the sheared surface roughness volume over the shear displacement increment was proportional to the remaining surface roughness volume in this study we additionally take into account the role of shear stress playing in asperity degradation by linking the evolution of asperity area to a function of the plastic work and the remaining asperity area the increment of the sheared asperity area at step i δ s s i over an increment of plastic work δ w s p i τ δ δ s p i is linearly proportional to the asperity area available for shear at step i equal to the un sheared asperity area at the last step s i 1 3 δ s s i δ w s p i c i s i 1 where c i is the degradation coefficient of the asperity at step i and s i 1 λ i 1 a i 1 2 λ is the asperity wavelength and a is the asperity amplitude see fig 4 the sheared asperity area at step i is 4 s s i s i 1 s b i where s b i is the un sheared asperity area before experiencing the increment in dilation δ δ n i over step i combining eqs 3 and 4 yields 5a s s i s i 1 1 e c i w s p i 5b s b i s i 1 e c i w s p i according to fig 4 the un sheared asperity area before experiencing the increment in dilation over step i s b i is given by 6 s b i λ 2 i 1 2 c o t i d i c o t i 0 the sheared asperity area at step i then becomes 7 s s i λ i 1 2 a i 1 λ i 1 c o t i d i c o t i 0 where i 0 is the initial dilation angle the amplitude of the un sheared asperity at step i before instant dilation a b i is 8 a b i λ i 1 c o t i d i c o t i 0 combining eqs 5b and 6 yields the dilation angle of the asperity at step i i d i as 9 t a n i d i e c i w s p i 2 e c i w s p i t a n i d i 1 the asperity area available for shear at step i 1 is updated as 10a a i a b i δ δ n i 10b λ i λ i 1 2 δ δ s p i 10c s i λ i a i 2 the sheared asperity area ratio at step i is 11 a s i s s i s 0 to produce a smooth curve bridging the elastic stage and the plastic stage the dilation angle should be identical at the transitional point between the two stages given that the dilation angle at the onset of plastic stage depends on the accumulated plastic tangential work we consider that the mobilisable dilation angle in the elastic stage decreases as the elastic energy w s e σ τ d δ s e accumulating in a form similar to eq 9 as 12 t a n i d m e c w s e 2 e c w s e t a n i 0 where c is the wear constant for the triangular asperity we then extend the triangular model to more general cases where both waviness and unevenness are present i e natural fracture surfaces a surface profile with roughness is characterized by the waviness and the unevenness which are quantified by the inclination angle iw wavelength λw and amplitude aw of the waviness and the inclination angle αu wavelength λu and amplitude au of the unevenness as shown in fig 3 li et al 2017 2018 here the waviness represents the large scale undulations which causes dilation during shear since they are too large to be completely sheared off the unevenness represents small scale roughness that tends to be damaged during shear isrm 1978 these values are defined based on the consideration that the waviness and unevenness that represent the effect of asperities together with the basic friction of a fracture surface constitute the total shear resistance therefore the mobilisable shear stress τ m can be written as 13 τ m σ n tan ϕ b i d m α d m 1 a s a s σ s where ϕ b is the basic friction angle of a fracture i d m is the mobilisable asperity angle for the waviness α d m is the mobilisable asperity angle for the unevenness and σ s is the shear stress required to shear off an asperity the sheared area ratio a s of waviness and unevenness is 14 a s a s w a s u s 0 w s 0 u where a s w and a s u denote the sheared area of waviness and unevenness respectively and s 0 w and s 0 u represent the initial area of waviness and unevenness respectively the dilation angle of unevenness at step i α d i has an identical form with that of the waviness eq 9 as 15 t a n α d i e c u i w s p i 2 e c u i w s p i t a n α d i 1 where cu is the wear constant for the critical unevenness the sheared area of unevenness at step i s s u i is 16 s s u i λ u i 1 2 a u i 1 λ u i 1 c o t α d i c o t α 0 where α 0 is initial inclination angle of the unevenness the degradation coefficient of asperity is closely related to the joint roughness and the strength of asperities hutson and dowding 1990 here we use the dilation angle and the asperity area available for shear to represent the joint roughness the degradation coefficients of waviness and unevenness at step i c w i and c u i are 17 c w i k i d i σ c s w i 1 18 c u i k α d i σ c s u i 1 respectively where k is a dimensionless coefficient that represents the effect of experimental environments such as temperature and humidity on the asperity degradation σ c is the unconfined compressive strength of the rock the dilation angle of unevenness at the beginning of plastic stage is 19 t a n α d e c u w s e 2 e c u w s e t a n α 0 to present the decay of shear stiffness in the plastic stage a reduction factor f is introduced as itasca consulting group inc 2011 20 f 1 τ τ m f k s represents the present shear stiffness at a given mobilisable shear stress and τ is the actual stress the shear stress in the plastic stage can then be updated by 21 τ i τ i 1 fk s δ δ s fig 5 shows the flowchart of model implementation in the mechanical module the mechanical behaviors of fractures are updated and stored at each step of shear displacement comparing to the previous shear models under the cns condition indraratna et al 2015 li et al 2018 the present model explicitly and independently took into account the roles of asperity sliding and asperity shearing and mimics the physical process of asperity degradation based on the principle of wear the evolutions of normal displacement and sheared off area of rough walled profiles during shear can be obtained which will be later used in the solute transport estimation 2 2 hydro mechanical behavior of fractures during shear both normal and shear stresses change the geometry of voids in fractures that serve as the spaces for fluid flow and solute transport the loading and unloading processes result in the closure and opening of a fracture respectively while the shear stress yields the relative movement of two walls of a fracture resulting in aperture heterogeneity and dilation contraction in a shear process the mechanical aperture of a fracture b m can be estimated by li et al 2008 22 b m b n 0 δ b n δ b s where b n 0 is the initial aperture at a given stress environment δ b n is the variation of aperture due to normal loading or unloading i e closure or opening and δ b s is the variation of aperture due to shear note that all of these variables represent the half space of a fracture as shown in fig 1 d for well mated fractures subjected to normal stress the voids that can effectively conduct fluid are considerably small according to previous experimental measurements an initial fracture aperture b n 0 5 μm was employed here to represent this state zhao et al 2011 δ b n is the aperture variation due to normal loading unloading process in which the positive value of δ b n indicates an unloading process and the negative value indicates a loading process the hyperbolic function proposed by bandis can be used to correlate the normal displacement b n with σ n as follows bandis et al 1983 23 σ n k 0 2 b n 1 b n b nmax where b nmax is half of the maximum normal closure and k 0 is the initial normal stiffness at a prescribed stress state this function is only applicable to a simple normal loading unloading process without shearing δ b s is associated with the normal displacement evolution in a shear process with the increment of shear displacement the normal displacement of a fracture experiences dramatic changes that can be classified into three stages in the first stage the normal displacement typically show negative values contraction that are mainly controlled by the rock type the matedness of the fracture and the normal stress level applied which happens before the appearance of the peak shear stress this stage is transitory and its influence on the hydraulic and transport behavior is limited which is therefore not considered in the developed model in the mechanical module described above the dilation takes place along with the appearance of the peak shear stress in the second stage along with the onset of dilation the normal displacement increases significantly at an approximately constant gradient in the third stage the normal displacement increases continuously at a decaying gradient that gradually approaches 0 which means that the dilation will efficiently halt at a sufficiently large shear displacement jiang et al 2004 2006 for a shear process under cnl conditions the normal stress is constant throughout the whole process therefore δ b n 0 under cns conditions the total aperture change partially results from the varying normal stress and the summation of δ b n and δ b s will correspond to the normal displacement increment by making use of δ δ n 2 δ b n δ b s the mechanical aperture at any given shear displacement can be obtained to calculate the flow rate however the hydraulic aperture b h should be used instead of b m when rough walled fractures are encountered bear 1972 in the previous studies models employing different parameters such as standard deviation of local mechanical aperture and contact area ratio zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 critical normal stress baghbanan and jing 2008 standard deviations of local mechanical aperture and local slope of fracture surface xiong et al 2011 jrc olsson and barton 2001 and minimum closure distance and average jrc values for upper and lower rock fracture profiles rasouli and hosseinian 2011 have been established to link the hydraulic aperture to the mechanical aperture as tabulated in table 1 for natural groundwater flow in deep seated fractures the flow is likely to stay in the linear regime i e r e 1 javadi et al 2014 which ruled out the models where the linear flow was not strictly maintained meanwhile models established based on the 3 d geometry of fractures or need to solve fluid flow in a specific geometry cannot be directly applied to the problem here mallikamas and rajaram 2010 wang et al 2015 given the fact that in the linear flow regime the difference between mechanical aperture and hydraulic aperture is directly attributed to the roughness of fracture surface their relation needs to be established based on parameters that can effectively characterize the roughness detwiler and rajaram 2007 li et al 2016 the root mean square of the first deviation of a profile z 2 is extensively used in roughness assessment for its simplicity and explicit mathematical definition written as 24 z 2 1 m z i 1 z i x i 1 x i 2 1 2 where x i and z i are the coordinates of the profile and m is the number of sampling points along the x direction a numerical study on fluid flow through rough profiles with a range of z 2 from 0 smooth parallel plate model to 0 50 j r c 20 by solving navier stokes equations was put forward the following expression for the relation between b h and b m was developed li and jiang 2013 zhao et al 2014b 25 b h b m 1 z 2 2 25 in simulation a constant hydraulic pressure was applied to the inlet of the fracture and the flow rate at the outlet was recorded no slip condition was applied to the fracture walls this boundary condition and the treatment of 2 d fractures are exact the same with the problem concerned here which therefore was employed in the hydraulic module to estimate the hydraulic aperture one may select other relations tabulated in table 1 when corresponding fracture geometry and hydraulic boundary conditions are encountered for example when the magnitude of roughness can be represented by a simple coefficient the equations of lomize 1951 louis 1969 patir and cheng 1978 walsh 1981 and or hakami 1995 may be selected when the surface roughness of fractures represented by jrc tortuosity fractal dimension and or root mean square of the first deviation of the profile is available the equations of barton et al 1985 waite et al 1999 yu and cheng 2002 liu et al 2015 and or li and jiang 2013 may be selected with respect to 3 d fracture geometries when the statistical parameters such as the standard deviation of mean mechanical aperture standard deviation of local slope of fracture surface and standard deviation of mechanical aperture during shearing are known the equations of zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 xiong et al 2011 and or xie et al 2015 may be selected several regression equations between j r c and z 2 have been derived a representative one of which is myers 1962 tse and cruden 1979 26 j r c 32 2 32 74 l o g z 2 for fluid flow having a sufficiently small reynolds number i e r e 1 in deep seated rock fractures the cubic law is valid as long as the influence of the surface roughness has been addressed eq 25 the flow rate q can then be obtained by 27 q w 2 b h 3 3 μ dp dx where w is the fracture width w 1 in 2 d μ is the dynamic viscosity and p is the hydraulic pressure the mean flow velocity v in a fracture can be calculated by 28 v q 2 w b h b h 2 3 μ dp dx 2 3 solute transport in fractured rocks solute transport in fractures and rock matrix is governed by a series of mechanisms which are affected by the geometric properties of both fractures and rock matrix and the boundary conditions neretnieks 1980 shih 2007 a general analytical solution developed by tang et al 1981 has addressed all of these transport mechanisms and is widely accepted in different models accounting for solute transport in fractured rocks sun and buscheck 2003 shih 2007 zhao et al 2011 zou et al 2016 if the decay of solute is negligible the governing equation for solute transport in single rock fractures can be written as 29 v c f x d f 2 c f x 2 r c f t q b h 0 where c f is the volumetric concentration of solute in the fracture d f is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient determined by d f α l v d α l is the mechanical dispersivity in the direction of fracture axis d is the molecular diffusion coefficient x is the distance along the fracture axis r is the retardation coefficient in the fractures t is the time and q is the diffusive flux perpendicular to the fracture axis considering the mass balance of solute in the fracture and in the pores of the matrix respectively the following governing equations of solute transport can be obtained tang et al 1981 neretnieks et al 1982 30 v c f x d f 2 c f x 2 r c f t d e b h c m z z b 0 31 c m t d a r 2 c m z 2 where c m is the volumetric concentration of solute in the matrix z is the coordinate perpendicular to the fracture axis fig 1 c and r is the retardation coefficient in the matrix d e and d a are the effective diffusion coefficient and the apparent diffusion coefficient respectively which are defined as 32 d e d θ m 33 d a d e θ ρ m k m where θ is the rock matrix porosity m is the exponent relating to the diffusion coefficient typically taken to be 1 6 for granite ruffet et al 1995 ρ m is the bulk density of the matrix and k m is the distribution coefficient that is defined as the mass of solute adsorbed per unit volume of matrix divided by the concentration of solute freeze and cherry 1979 the matrix porosity θ is stress dependent written as zimmerman 1991 34 θ 1 1 θ i e a 1 σ σ i a 2 a 3 e a 3 σ e a 3 σ i where θ i is the initial matrix porosity at zero stress and a 1 a 2 and a 3 are constants that equal to 0 82 10 4 5 35 10 4 and 0 12 respectively the source concentration is typically considered as a constant at the inlet i e c f 0 t c 0 which is only an approximation when the hydrodynamic dispersion is present rasmuson 1986 here c 0 represents the solute concentration at the source a more representative boundary which treats the flux at the inlet fig 1c as a constant should be considered as danckwerts 1953 35a v c 0 v c f 0 t d

retardation coefficient which varies with the changing extra absorptive area provided by gouge particles during shear a retardation coefficient is typically defined as zhao et al 2012 39 r 1 α k f b h where α is a coefficient that represents the extra adsorptive area induced by shear on rough surfaces and k f is the equilibrium distribution coefficient of solute on a fracture surface for commonly employed smooth parallel plates model of rock fractures without the generation of gouge particles α 1 given that a rough surface can have greater actual area than a planar surface with the same length and width the extra adsorptive surfaces provided directly by the roughness and provided by gouge particles need to be considered independently as zhao et al 2012 40 α α r α s s act 2 l w s she 2 l w where α r and α s are the surface increase factors due to the roughness of fracture surface and the shear process respectively s act is the actual surface area s she is the increased adsorptive area by shear and l is the fracture length α r can be directly estimated by comparing the real length of a profile to the apparent length on x axis see fig 1 b and c note that during a shear process α r needs to be updated according to the exposed surface area change induced by asperity damage as demonstrated in fig 4 in the present study it is assumed that the wear products during shearing would not clog the flow channels to determine α s two important issues need to be addressed 1 the volume of gouge particles generated by shear at an arbitrary shear displacement 2 the size distribution of the generated particles the first issue is solved by the developed mechanical model presented above eqs 7 and 16 which provides the sheared off area at a given shear displacement the second issue more or less needs to be experimentally constrained to establish a distribution model for gouge particles produced by shear direct shear tests were conducted on six fresh tensile fractures of granite under normal stresses of 1 5 and 10 mpa and the generated particles were carefully collected and measured via a laser diffraction particle size analyzer zhao et al 2018b the results show that the size distribution can be well described by a weibull function as zhao et al 2018a b 41 f x a w b w b w a w x a w b w 1 e x a w b w where a w 0 is the shape parameter and b w 0 is the scale parameter which are determined by fitting the experimental results with this distribution function the surface area of sheared off gouge particles could be calculated by 42 s she v s β j f d j a w b w d where v s is the sheared off volume of particles β is a shape factor and d is the arithmetic mean diameter of the particle size for a first order estimation we presume that all the particles have a uniform shape of spheres β 6 the sheared off area s s in 2 d models can be linked with the sheared off volume v s by assigning a unit thickness when fluid flow presents some very fine particles may be flushed away from the fracture lacking supports from matured theory or experimental measurements here we have to presume that all gouge particles stay in the fracture to highlight the effect of retardation it is also notable that with the transformation from mechanical aperture to hydraulic aperture by eq 25 the rough walled model will be simplified to the parallel plates model with a constant hydraulic aperture in such a condition the dispersion induced by aperture variation in the direction of fracture axis is neglected in the calculation the computational process of the developed mechanical hydraulic solute transport model is shown in fig 5 the material properties the geometric parameters and the parameters associated with the boundary conditions need to be input into the model to initiate the computation the mechanical module provides the variations of normal stress shear stress normal displacement and sheared off area in a shear process the normal displacement is then used to calculate the changes in aperture and flow rate during shear in the hydraulic module the sheared off area and its particle distribution are used to obtain the retardation coefficient finally these results together with the constants and coefficients associated with mass transport in rocks are input into the solute transport module to compute the concentrations of solute in fractures and matrix at different locations and time the calculation is put forward in a step wise manner i e the parameters in the hydraulic and transport modules are updated at each shear displacement increment these processes can be easily solved using some commercial computational softwares such as matlab 3 validation of the proposed mechanical model to the best of our knowledge no available experimental results on the coupled shear flow transport processes of rock fractures under cns conditions have been reported in the literature if any the only available experimental results are the mechanical behaviors i e shear stress normal displacement and normal stress of fractures sheared under cns conditions therefore in this section the validity of the mechanical model is verified against experimental observations here shear test results on a 2 d fracture established from a jrc profile and a rough walled fracture were used for this purpose in the following section 4 a parametric study is performed to test the sensitivity of the transport properties i e relative concentrations in both fractures and matrix to the mechanical parameters i e shear displacement normal stiffness and initial normal stress 3 1 comparison with a jrc profiled rock fracture barton and choubey 1977 proposed 10 profiles for characterizing the surface roughness of rock fractures the jrc values of these 2 d profiles range from 0 to 20 here we selected the profile with a jrc value of 8 10 to prepare the artificial rock samples fig 6 the sample was made of a mixture of plaster water and retardant with a weight ratio of 1 0 2 0 005 the shear behavior of fractures is governed by a number of parameters including the material properties the surface morphology and the boundary conditions to efficiently validate the model some of these parameters need to be well constrained to gain a better understanding on the sensitivity of shear behavior to the remaining parameters the artificial samples instead of natural rocks was used for its constant physicomechanical properties and good reproductivity in preparing samples with the same surface which could facilitate the investigation on the influence of boundary conditions on the shear behavior the samples had a size of 100 mm in width 200 mm in length and 100 mm in height as shown in fig 6 a the undulation only existed in the length direction while the width direction was merely an extension of the 2 d profile the density of the sample was 2 066 g cm3 and the compressive strength was 47 4 mpa direct shear tests were carried out on these samples under cns boundary condition using a servo controlled shear testing apparatus developed by jiang et al 2004 2006 the initial normal stress was 2 mpa and the normal stiffness was 3 and 7 gpa m here the values of normal stiffness 3 and 7 gpa m are generally in the same magnitude with those reported in literature jiang et al 2009 nemcik et al 2014 kulatilake et al 2016 the normal stiffness is controlled by the surrounding rocks rather than by the specimen itself which is realized via a servo controlled apparatus the tested maximum shear displacement was 20 mm 10 of the model length a constant shear rate of 0 5 mm min was applied to all the tests and calculations mentioned here as recommended by isrm isrm 2007 for the tested profile the wavelength and angle of the critical waviness were 72 4 mm and 6 82 respectively and those of the critical unevenness were 23 1 mm and 11 83 respectively the method to calculate these critical values is referred to li et al 2018 these parameters were input into the developed mechanical module for shear and the mechanical behavior such as shear stress normal displacement and normal stress during shear was calculated at each shear step δ δ s 0 005 m m fig 7 shows the comparisons of shear stress normal displacement and normal stress versus shear displacement between the experimental results and the predictions of the developed model the results show that with the increasing shear displacement the shear stress normal displacement and normal stress increase significantly in the stage before the appearance of the peak shear stress and then gently approaching some constant values the larger normal stiffness results in the larger shear and normal stresses and the smaller normal displacement dilation a greater normal stiffness would more tightly confine a fracture that enhances the interlocking of asperities thereby increasing the normal stress and reducing the dilation as a result a greater shear stress is required to slide the fracture in the residual stage the good agreement between the experimental results and the predicted results show that the developed model is capable of estimating the mechanical behavior of 2 d profiled fractures during shear under cns conditions 3 2 comparison with a rough walled rock fracture in a previous study we prepared replicas of a natural granite fracture exposed in the construction site of omaru power plant in miyazaki prefecture in japan and conducted direct shear tests li et al 2008 as shown in fig 8 a the fracture had a rough surface with the existence of several major asperities the mean jrc value of the fracture ranged 16 18 the same material and procedure with that described in the last section were taken to prepare the rough walled samples in the shear test the initial normal stress was 1 mpa and the normal stiffness was 0 5 gpa m since the mechanical model was developed based on 2 d profiles the representativeness of 2 d profiles to 3 d rough surfaces needs to be evaluated to verify the applicability of the model instead of randomly selecting 2 d profiles nine regularly spaced profiles with an interval of 10 cm along the width direction were selected and their angles of the critical waviness were calculated the results show that profile no 3 has the largest angle iw 16 37 followed by no 6 iw 13 86 as shown in fig 8 the asperity of the maximum size is included in profile no 3 as shown in fig 8 a given the fact that the shear behavior of fractures is governed by a few major asperities that have greater inclination angle and wavelength than others jiang et al 2006 oh et al 2015 these two profiles were selected to estimate the shear behavior of the studied fracture as a comparison we also computed the arithmetic mean of profiles along the width direction with an interval of 0 2 mm and generated a new profile that represents the average roughness of the surface as shown in fig 8 d the wavelength and angle of the critical waviness for profile no 3 were 32 mm and 16 37 for profile no 6 were 30 mm and 13 86 and for the average profile were 56 mm and 5 06 respectively the wavelength and angle of the critical unevenness for profile no 3 were 12 mm and 8 53 for profile no 6 were 8 mm and 12 68 and for the average profile were 18 mm and 5 89 respectively fig 9 a shows the variations in shear stress versus shear displacement between experimental results and predicted results of the three profiles before reaching the peak shear the contacting asperities are most in the elastic state therefore the shear stress increases in a linear manner and the results calculated from different profiles are almost identical the result of profile no 3 fits well with the experimental result at peak but overestimates the shear stress in the post peak stage in some contents the curve of profile no 6 is similar to that of no 3 with a slightly smaller shear stress at peak and in the residual stage in contrast the average profile significantly underestimates the peak shear stress yet fitting well with the experimental result in the residual stage for a rough surface the overriding and shear off of major asperities happen simultaneously with the occurrence of the peak shear stress i e the shear strength jiang et al 2006 in the post peak stage along with the failure of major asperities some other asperities with smaller sizes gradually take part in the wearing process and the shear behavior tends to be controlled by a more generalized surface character i e the average roughness this explains why the peak shear stress is well predicted by using profile no 3 and the residual shear stress is well predicted by using the average profile the predicted normal displacement of the profiles no 3 and no 6 is greater than the experimental result as shown in fig 9 b because in these profiles the geometry of the major asperities was taken to represent the roughness of the whole surface the normal displacement of the average profile is smaller than the experimental result due to the reduced height and slope of asperities by averaging the results of other seven profiles are bounded between the results of the maximum profile no 3 and the average profile the above comparisons suggest that the peak shear stress of a rough walled fracture could be accurately predicted using a profile that represents the geometry of the largest asperity and the residual shear stress could be well predicted using a profile that represents the average roughness character the normal displacement is somewhat around the middle of the results of the maximum profile and the average profile the shear behavior of 2 d profiled fractures could be precisely predicted by the developed model as shown in fig 7 because their maximum profile and average profile are identical in the present study since only 2 d models of fractures are concerned the proposed mechanical model is considered suitable to serve as a mechanical basis for solute transport assessment 4 parametric study a parametric study was put forward to investigate the typical response of solute transport behavior of rough walled rock fractures to the shear process we considered five normal stresses i e 1 mpa 5 mpa 10 mpa 30 mpa and 50 mpa in the analysis which represent the in situ stress levels of shallow rocks to deep seated rocks 2000 m in the abovementioned sections three specific values of normal stiffness 0 5 gpa m 3 gpa m and 7 gpa m were assigned to the tests according to their mechanical and geometric properties since these samples were taken from different locations to gain a general understanding on the effect of normal stiffness on the transport behavior a wide range of normal stiffness i e 1 gpa m 10 gpa m 100 gpa m and 1000 gpa m were selected which covered most conditions encountered in practices pyrak nolte and morris 2000 jiang et al 2009 together with the normal stress to mimic the in situ boundary condition of fractures the critical angle and the wavelength of the profile that represents the geometry of the largest asperity as shown in fig 8 b were used for the calculation because the validation process has demonstrated that this profile could well predict the shear strength of the tested samples which is one of the most important properties of fractures the unconfined compressive strength is 132 mpa and the residual friction angle is 35 9 for granite according to laboratory tests li 2009 zhao et al 2018b the values of parameters used for calculation are tabulated in table 2 4 1 mechanical behavior of fractures during shear the evolutions of the normal displacement dilation the normal stress and the matrix porosity during shear are shown in fig 10 subjected to four levels of normal stiffness and two initial normal stresses 1 mpa and 50 mpa for comparison as shown in fig 10 a and d the difference of the residual normal displacements obtained at the normal stiffness of 1 gpa m and 1000 gpa m is around 20 times showing that the normal stiffness has a strong confining effect on the dilation behavior of fractures during the entire shear process the increment of normal stress during shear is proportional to the dilation with a factor of kn as shown in fig 10 b and e the normal stress becomes constant after reaching some turning point which is in accordance with that on the dilation curve the normal stress increases up to 210 mpa in fig 10 b and 230 mpa in fig 10 e at a normal stiffness of 1000 gpa m which largely surpasses the initial normal stresses of 1 mpa and 50 mpa in reality shear processes may halt when such reacting normal stresses have reached some critical values which is why fractures sheared to different displacements exist in the nature the above results suggest that when a rough walled rock fracture is sheared under a great value of normal stiffness e g deep seated hard rocks the dilational behavior will be primarily governed by the reacting restriction of surrounding rock masses due to shear induced dilation i e the increment in normal stress rather than the initial normal stress that only represents the in situ stress environment prior to shear an active shear force is required to initiate the sliding which will later trigger the reaction of surrounding rock masses for deep seated fractures due to shear induced dilation such active shear force and the reactive normal force will further compress the host rocks of the fracture resulting in the decrease in porosity the calculated results of porosity are shown in fig 10 c and f along with the shear the porosity of the host rock exhibits a fast descending behavior in the initial stage due to the fast increments of both shear stress and normal stress and then reaches some constant values in the residual stage where both the normal and shear stresses no longer change for a normal stiffness of 1 gpa m that is typically used in laboratory experiment the calculated porosity decreases from 0 85 to 0 84 by a rate of 1 18 as shear displacement increases from 0 to 20 mm under an initial normal stress of 50 mpa see fig 10 k in contrast under a normal stiffness of 1000 gpa m the porosity varies by a rate of 33 02 which is approximately 28 times that under a normal stiffness of 1 gpa m simply because the increased compressive stresses acting on the host rock are greater in both normal and shear orientations such reduction of porosity will efficiently influence the diffusion of solute in the rock matrix as presented later the evolutions of the cumulative sheared off area and the resulting value of r are shown in fig 11 the cumulative sheared off area also exhibits a fast increasing stage followed by an almost constant stage during shear as shown in fig 11 a and c the transition between the two stages is instantaneous for the case with a great value of normal stiffness i e 1000 gpa m which becomes more gentle as the normal stiffness decreases for the case with a large value of normal stiffness i e 1000 gpa m the shear off of asperities happens simultaneously with the start of dilation which substantially smoothens the facture surface reducing the dilation in the residual stage fig 10 a and d in contrast the damage on asperities happens less fiercely in the initial stage of shear in the case with smaller normal stiffness therefore the cumulative sheared off area keeps increasing in a larger displacement of shear when the fracture surface is sufficiently smoothened the damage on asperities will gradually halt leaving the two flat walls sliding on each other the sheared off minerals will increase the absorptive area thereby enhancing the retardation of solute transport in a fracture meanwhile as indicated by eq 39 the augment of aperture due to dilation will efficiently reduce the retardation coefficient their competitive effects on the value of r are shown in fig 11 b and d in the initial stage of shear the hydraulic aperture starts to increase proportionally with the dilation while most asperities remain intact therefore the curves of all cases exhibit rapid decreasing tendencies by a magnitude as large as two orders for the cases with relatively large values of normal stiffness after a fast descending stage a rebound of r could be observed this rebound happens when the effect of the increased absorptive area prevails over the effect of increasing hydraulic aperture which occurs in the fast increasing stage of the cumulative sheared off area where the asperities are fiercely damaged as shown in fig 11 a and c the rebound is more obvious in the case with a greater initial normal stress i e 50 mpa since it could bring greater damages to the asperities in the initial stage of shear in the residual stage i e shear displacement is larger than 10 mm since both the hydraulic aperture and sheared off area change in small ranges the retardation coefficient falls in a stage with constant values 4 2 effect of shear on the transport behavior with the obtained flow rate from the hydraulic module and the value of r the spatial distribution of the concentration of solute in the fracture c f and the concentration in the matrix c m were calculated fig 12 shows the variations in the relative concentrations c f c 0 and c m c 0 with varying initial normal stress σ n0 and varying distance along the fracture trace x from 0 to 10 m here two levels of normal stiffness 1 gpa m and 1000 gpa m were selected for comparison and constant initial values were assigned to other parameters as tabulated in table 2 in the following analysis when the influence of a parameter is analyzed other parameters will be assigned the initial value the concentration in rock matrix was taken at the location perpendicular to the fracture wall with a distance of 0 5 m for the cases in the left column the values of c f c 0 and c m c 0 are almost constant along the distance from 0 to 10 m because the concentration is substantially balanced after a transport time of 50 years for the cases in the right column the strong normal stiffness has significantly restricted the dilation resulting in a considerably slow transport process both c f c 0 and c m c 0 decrease with the increasing σ n0 because a larger normal stress will more tightly confine a fracture resulting in the reduction of fracture aperture and porosity simultaneously such reduction is enhanced by applying a greater level of normal stiffness on the fracture as shown by the comparison between the figures in left column 1 gpa m to the right column 1000 gpa m the concentration decreases in an accelerated manner with the increases of the normal stress and the distance from the original point which is more obvious at higher levels of normal stress and normal stiffness as indicated by eq 29 the reduction in average flow rate at a given pressure gradient and the augment of retardation subjected to a strong stress and stiffness confinement will work together to yield a slow transport process the influence of k n on the variations in c f c 0 and c m c 0 are shown in fig 13 under two normal stresses 1 mpa and 50 mpa while both c f c 0 and c m c 0 decrease gently with the increasing normal stiffness and distance the case with a normal stiffness of 1000 gpa m distinguished itself from other cases exhibiting a large gradient of reduction the concentration difference between the original point inlet with the location 10 m away could be as high as 35 for the fracture and 60 for the matrix demonstrating a considerably slow transport process for deep seated rock fractures subjected to large stiffness for the normal stress ranging from 1 mpa to 50 mpa the variations in c f c 0 can be negligible however the variations in c m c 0 should be taken into account especially when k n 1000 gpa m fig 14 shows the variations in c f c 0 and c m c 0 with the varying shear displacement δ s the c f c 0 and c m c 0 decrease with the increasing distance from the source as δ s increases both c f c 0 and c m c 0 increase dramatically in the initial stage due to the dilation of the fracture and then approach constant values in the residual stage again a greater level of normal stiffness strongly surpasses the augment of relative concentrations in the initial stage resulting in a much more retarded transport process these curves are analogous to the dilation curves shown in fig 10 a and d indicating that the dilation plays a dominate role in the variations of the relative concentrations in a shear process with the increment of initial normal stress from 1 mpa to 50 mpa the variations in c f c 0 and c m c 0 do not change significantly in the place near the inlet i e x 0 m which however decrease to a large extent in the place far from the inlet i e x 10 m 4 3 effects of diffusion distance in z direction and time fig 15 shows the contour plots for c m c 0 distributions under different normal stresses with the increment of z from 0 01 m to 1 m c m c 0 decreases significantly with an increasing gradient showing that it is increasingly hard for the solute to penetrate into the deep positions comparison between the two figures reveals that the distribution of concentration with a greater gradient along the depth will present in the deep seated rocks fig 16 shows the penetration profiles of c f c 0 and c m c 0 at a time scale t up to 100 years under an initial normal stress of 50 mpa in the place near the inlet i e x 0 m the c f c 0 increases with a gradually decreasing rate as the elapsed time increases from 0 to 100 years however in the place far from the inlet i e x 10 m the c f c 0 increases with a first increasing and then decreasing rate for t 0 100 years while the value of c f c 0 close to the source reaches 1 0 in a period of around 30 years the concentration 10 m away from the inlet can hardly reach the equilibrium even after an elapsed time of 100 years due to the strong stress and stiffness constraints acting on deep seated rock fractures the concentration in the matrix exhibits a similar tendency but the values are always less than 1 0 after a long period which together with the results shown in fig 15 indicate that the matrix plays a much less important role in the solute transport in fractured rocks therefore at short time scales the matrix diffusion may be neglected when estimating the transport properties of deep seated fractured tight hard rocks 5 discussions 5 1 shear flow transport process of rock fractures the above analysis on calculation results clearly demonstrates the significant influences of shear processes on the hydraulic and solute transport behaviors of rock fractures for shallow rocks where the normal stress and normal stiffness acting on fracture planes are relatively low the shear induced dilation may increase the fracture aperture by up to three orders 5 μm comparing to 5 mm leading to a significant augment of flow rate according to the cubic law the solute transport process will be tremendously accelerated along with the shear process for deep seated rocks the shear process also results in the expansion of fracture aperture however due to the strong constriction of stress and stiffness boundaries the change of aperture is limited to a much depressed magnitude typically less than one order fig 10 this difference is in concert with our common knowledge on the transport phenomena in rock fractures at different depths it is notable that the cnl boundary condition as frequently used in previous studies cannot realistically reflect the constriction of surrounding rocks in terms of stress and stiffness on a shearing fracture the normal stress can be increased by up to 4 5 times when a normal stiffness of 1000 gpa m is applied to a rough walled fracture with an initial normal stress as large as 50 mpa the surface roughness plays a crucial role in the mechanical behavior of fractures during shear which varies with the rock type the environment a fracture is generated weathering and the deformation history the present study only considered fresh well mated tensile fractures which exhibit a pronounced dilation behavior another assumption is made that the normal stiffness is a constant during shearing which however deviates from the realistic cases during shearing the normal stress increases significantly i e more than two orders of magnitude as shown in fig 10 b in such a case the normal stiffness is not a constant and may change with the increasing stress jiang et al 2009 therefore the effect of variable normal stiffness during shearing should also be investigated in future works on the other hand the gouge particles generated during shear play a negative role in solute transport by providing extra absorptive areas a fracture could generate more particles when sheared under a larger normal stress and or normal stiffness the retardation effect of particles may be masked by the dilation in the initial stage of shear which may then prevail when sufficient particles are accumulated along with the shear the aperture normal stress and solute concentration change dramatically in the initial stage of shear along with the dilation and gradually approach some constant values in the residual stage therefore as long as a fracture has undergone a sufficiently large shear displacement its transport behavior may achieve a steady state 5 2 limitations of the model and future development the simplification of 3 d problems to 2 d is the most outstanding limitation of the presented model 2 d profiles selected from a 3 d surface may not realistically represent its topographical characteristics which is the main source of biased estimation of the mechanical behavior of fractures given that the material properties are generally well constrained we selected three profiles including the maximum profile and the average profile from a natural fracture surface and the calculated results showed that the shear strength is intimately associated with the geometry of a few major asperities that can be well represented by the maximum profile however the residual shear stress is likely to agree with the predictions made by the average profile this suggests that a spectrum analysis is required to identify these major asperities and to characterize the average roughness when 2 d profiles have to be selected from 3 d surfaces in the hydraulic aspect the fluid flow typically bypasses the contacts of varying sizes and shapes bridging the walls of a fracture with tortuosity which bring extra frictional losses and enhance the heterogeneity and localization of flow in contrast a 2 d model does not allow the existence of contacts because a single contact could block the entire flow therefore the model presented here only represents an open slice of a real fracture which holds its representative hydraulic properties some coarse particles may also block the throats of flow paths affecting the hydraulic and solute transport behavior this issue was not considered due to the lack of reliable mathematical models supported by experimental measurements a transformation of mechanical aperture to hydraulic aperture was adopted in the present model to account for the influence of roughness on the fluid flow the same manner of which may be used in 3 d model development in the future alternately solutions such as modified local cubic laws may help establish more precise permeability estimations mallikamas and rajaram 2010 presently 3 d numerical techniques have allowed the researchers to establish high resolution models of the real geometry of fractures based on which the fluid flow and solute transport can be precisely computed detwiler and rajaram 2007 xiong et al 2011 wang and cardenas 2016 zou et al 2017 huang et al 2019 however an identical surface geometry cannot be found on two single fractures in nature therefore a new numerical model has to be established when a new fracture is to be studied solving these high resolution models is highly time consuming and verification against well established experimental data is required when a new numerical model is established given that theoretical solutions to 3 d problems remain largely immature 2 d models with their simplicity and well established theories can still provide helpful insights into the mechanisms involved in the shear flow transport processes another limitation is the absence of extra absorptive areas provided by micro cracks generated during shear which together with gouge particles contribute to the variation of retardant coefficient zhao et al 2012 the micro cracks were neglected simply because the developed mechanical model could not precisely assess their cracking processes this issue remains largely unknown due mainly to the limitation of experimental techniques especially measurement methods that can effectively detect their spatial distribution and the geometry of single micro cracks in a shear process new techniques such as x ray ct combined with the theoretical and numerical analyses may help reveal the mechanisms that drive the generation of micro cracks however it still faces strong challenges when applying them to contacting asperities of various shapes and sizes under different stress environments tatone and grasselli 2015 other mechanisms such as sub critical cracking and healing due to pressure solution further complicate the estimations yasuhara and elsworth 2008 a possible solution is to link the works of shear force and normal force to the volume of generated micro cracks instead of predicting their exact locations and areas either way all models need to be validated experimentally based on reliable measurement techniques the weibull function was adopted to characterize the size distribution of sheared off gouge particles based on the measurements on particles collected after the fractures being sheared to the residual stage zhao et al 2018b actually the shear off of major asperities taking place immediately after reaching the peak stress is likely to generate coarse particles first which will gradually be crushed and smashed into finer particles along with the shear pereira and de freitas 1993 in the residual stage some new particles may also be generated from both the damaged asperities and some undamaged asperities of smaller sizes therefore the size distribution of particles at different shear displacement may have different characters if the weibull function is applicable to the size distribution at any shear displacement the parameters involved in the function shall have different values which require further experimental explorations in the present study the entire calculation was executed in an analytical manner the variations in the stress and displacement at each shear step were calculated based on the information of the last step the calculation only proceeds forwardly and the iteration is not necessary for each step without the need for numerical modeling the proposed method has a high computational efficiency that benefits the assessment for large scale problems 6 conclusions in the present study an analytical model for estimating the mechanical hydraulic solute transport processes in rough walled rock fractures under the constant normal stiffness boundary condition was developed the normal stiffness represents the reaction of surrounding rock masses to a shearing rock fracture due to the shear induced dilation that efficiently confines the fracture especially for deep seated rocks the model is composed of a mechanical module a hydraulic module and a solute transport module being calculated in a step wise manner in the mechanical module the surface of fractures was decomposed into waviness and unevenness and the roughness was characterized by their geometric properties the sliding process between the fracture walls and the failure of asperities were estimated based on the principle of wear which provided the sheared off area of asperities at each shear step the dilation induced expansion of mechanical aperture was incorporated into the hydraulic module to calculate the hydraulic aperture and the flow rate using a modified relation between the mechanical aperture and hydraulic aperture the governing equations of solute transport in rock fractures were solved to obtain the spatial distribution of solute concentration in the fracture and the matrix applying a constant flux boundary the retardation of transport due to the increased adsorptive areas provided by the generated gouge particles during shear was taken into account in the transport calculation the validity of the mechanical module was verified against shear test results on 2 d profiled rough walled fractures a combination of the maximum profile that represents the geometry of the largest asperity and the average profile seemingly captures the primary shear behavior of rough walled fractures using the mechanical module in 2 d due to the absence of shear flow solute transport test results instead of applying the model to a specific condition a parametric study was put forward to gain a general understanding on the transport behavior of shearing fractures the developed model systematically reveals the significant influences of a shear process on the hydraulic and solute transport behavior of rock fractures especially the competitive role played by the shear induced dilation and the retardation due to the increased absorptive area in the transport process the model also demonstrates the remarkable difference between the shear behavior of shallow rock fractures and deep seated rock fractures due to the differences in normal constrictions in terms of normal stress and normal stiffness which subsequently results in different transport behavior this model is especially helpful for the quantitative estimations on the solute transport through sheared fractures e g fault zones that extensively exist in nature lacking the supports of direct experimental measurements on stress flow transport processes in rock fractures under cns conditions a number of assumptions and simplifications have to be made to bridge these complex processes meanwhile several important issues such as the extra absorptive area produced by micro cracks the difference in size distribution patterns of particles at different shear displacements and the effect of solubility on solute transport still wait to be addressed in the future explorations

6034,the present study developed a two dimensional mechanical hydraulic solute transport model for rough walled rock fractures under constant normal stiffness boundary conditions first the mechanical responses of a fracture during shear including the shear stress the normal stress the dilation and the sheared off area of asperities at each shear step were calculated in a mechanical module the surface roughness was characterized by two order asperities i e waviness and unevenness and the degradation of asperities was estimated based on the principle of wear the mechanical module was validated by comparison with laboratory experiments the surface geometry and the dilation behavior were subsequently incorporated into a hydraulic module to estimate the hydraulic aperture and flow rate based on the cubic law finally these data were input into a solute transport module to investigate the influences of the mechanical boundary conditions on the solute transport in the fracture and the matrix at different shear displacements and time the model linked the complex mechanisms involved in the mechanical hydraulic and solute transport processes for fractures subjected to shear and revealed a controlling effect of normal stiffness on the transport behavior the results show that the normal displacement normal stress cumulative sheared off area and porosity of matrix change quickly in the initial stage of shear and gradually reach some constant values when the fracture surface is sufficiently smoothed in the residual stage in the entire shear process the major asperities are substantially damaged producing abundant gouge particles that contribute to the retardation of solute transport the shear induced dilation and the retardation induced by gouge particles from damaged asperities played competitive roles in solute transport that resulted in the nonlinear variations in the coefficient of retardation the model established a solid platform for estimating the mechanical hydraulic solute transport processes in fractures subjected to shear upon which more sophisticated modules such as pressure solution and clogging by particles may be developed to improve the understanding on the outstanding issues involved in the coupled processes keywords fracture shear fluid flow solute transport constant normal stiffness retardation 1 introduction understanding the coupled mechanical hydraulic solute transport properties of fractures is essential for the long term safety assessment of high level radio active waste repositories constructed in deep seated rock masses tsang et al 2015 zhao et al 2019 in the host rocks the fractures form major paths for solute transport due to their typically much greater permeability than that of the intact rocks zhao et al 2004 leung and zimmerman 2012 min et al 2004 baghbanan and jing 2008 zhao et al 2018a deep seated rock fractures are subjected to in situ stresses that increase with depth and thereby reducing the permeability of fractures meanwhile a shear process on rock fractures tends to increase the permeability and the magnitude increased by shear is appreciably greater than that resulting from a pure normal loading unloading process under the same stress level li et al 2008 xue et al 2013 such permeability enhancement is mainly attributed to the shear induced dilation on rough surfaces which can substantially influence the speed and path of solute transport in fractured rock masses for laboratory investigations on the shear behavior of rock fractures conventional direct shear tests apply a constant normal load cnl boundary which assumes that the normal load keeps constant during shear reitsma and kueper 1994 yeo et al 1998 muralha et al 2014 this boundary condition is only applicable to the rocks without constraints from the surrounding environment such as free rock blocks sliding upon slopes for deep seated rock fractures the shear induced dilation will be noticeably constrained by the surrounding rock masses a constant normal stiffness cns boundary condition is more representative for the deep seated rocks comparing with the cnl boundary condition saeb and amadei 1990 1992 indraratna et al 1999 jiang et al 2004 therefore the cns boundary conditions need to be incorporated into mechanical models designed for estimating the shear behavior of deep seated rough walled fractures most experimental and numerical tests on rock fractures subjected to shear are meant to estimate their shear strength which principally originates from three components i e the basic frictional strength the asperity sliding and the asperity shearing saeb and amadei 1992 haberfield and johnston 1994 the asperity sliding and shearing represent the undamaged and damaged states of contacting asperities respectively while the frictional strength and asperity sliding can be represented by a basic friction angle and a dilation angle respectively the asperity shearing needs to be modeled upon mechanics that interpret and represent the crushing and shear off phenomena on contacting asperities johnston and lam 1989 saeb and amadei 1992 haberfield and johnston 1994 indraratna et al 2015 earlier models used idealized fracture profiles such as triangular and sine shaped profiles to represent the surface roughness and to establish the mechanical models for contacting asperities dight and chiu 1981 saeb and amadei 1992 statistical and empirical parameters such as joint roughness coefficient jrc were later employed to quantify natural irregular roughness in shear models barton and choubey 1977 zhao et al 2015 indraratna et al 2015 zheng and qi 2016 since the normal stress changes along with the dilation under cns conditions the normal stress evolution as well as the resulting shear stress increment need to be estimated and updated in a step wise manner during the entire shear process li et al 2018 modeling shear behavior of natural rough walled fractures under cns conditions still faces strong challenges in terms of roughness characterization failure mechanism identification and realization and step wise updating of evolving parameters on the other hand the dilation behavior of fractures during shear has a significant impact on their hydraulic and solute transport properties the permeability of fractures is typically enhanced during shear due to dilation although some studies reported the permeability may be reduced by contraction and or asperity damage ishibashi et al 2016 wu et al 2017 ye and ghassemi 2018 im et al 2018 solute transport in fractures relies heavily on their hydraulic properties which is governed by different mechanisms such as advection hydrodynamic dispersion sorption reactions matrix diffusion limited spatial and temporal scales and flow structures i e eddy or recirculation zone neretnieks 1980 tang et al 1981 zhao et al 2014a fiori and becker 2015 ahmad et al 2016 guihéneuf et al 2017 while most of previous studies only considered normal stresses a few pioneer works have been put forward to address the influences of shear processes on the solute transport in fractures e g zhao et al 2011 babadagli et al 2015 in these models however the complex natural fracture geometry was simplified to idealized models without considering the influences of roughness fig 1 a c fig 1 d shows the conceptual model for fluid flow and or solute transport during shear under cns boundary conditions the upper block is sheared along x direction while the lower block is fixed the fluid solute is injected into the model through one end of the fracture and flows out of the model through the other end of the fracture after fluid solute diffusions within the fracture and matrix the direction of the normal stress is perpendicular to the fracture plane the simplified modeling of normal displacement shear displacement curve fig 2 a exhibits significant discrepancies with the conceptual model fig 2 b and the testing results on natural fractures fig 2 c olsson and barton 2001 xiong et al 2011 more realistic representation of the dilation behavior of rock fractures during shear is strongly required which needs to be incorporated into coupled shear flow models to address the influence of shear on the solute transport behavior in rock fractures besides the shear induced dilation the debris or gouge generated by shear is another important issue that influences the solute transport in fractures because sorption of solutes on the surfaces of gouge particles leads to the retardation of solute transport zhao et al 2012 the retardation coefficient is frequently used in analytical models to account for the retardation effect of gouge particles which changes proportionally with the increased absorptive surface area provided by the particles therefore estimating the particle sizes and their distribution becomes a key issue previous studies on sheared fractures found that the particles may exhibit a power law distribution amitrano and schmittbuhl 2002 and the percentage of coarse particle decreases and the percentages of fine and silt clay particle increase with the increasing shear displacement pereira and de freitas 1993 mechanical models that are capable of assessing the sheared off volumes of asperities at an arbitrary shear displacement need to be developed to establish the basis for particle distribution and therefore retardation coefficient estimations in light of the outstanding issues mentioned above in the present study we developed a 2 d analytical model that characterizes the shear behavior of initially well mated rough walled rock fractures under cns conditions at first this model provided the results of normal displacement and sheared off area during the entire shearing process which were then used to estimate the evolutions of hydraulic aperture and retardant coefficient respectively these values were finally incorporated into a general transport solution for single fractures leading to an analytical model for shear flow transport processes the influences of several controlling parameters involved in the model on the solute transport behavior such as normal stiffness transport time and shear displacement were investigated quantitatively comparing to previous models that only take into account the dilation or the influence of gouge particles the developed model estimated their effects on solute transport simultaneously under cns conditions which may provide a platform for quantitative estimations on the mechanical hydraulic solute transport properties of sheared or shearing rock fractures e g faults in deep seated rock masses 2 modeling solute transport in rough walled fractures during shear 2 1 modeling of mechanical behavior of fractures during shear under cns conditions the mechanical behavior of fractures inherently influences the flow patterns of fluid within fractured rock masses and in turn affects the solute transport processes to quantitatively study the shear behavior of rock fractures under cns conditions li et al 2018 developed a continuously yielding model that characterizes the surface roughness by two order asperities the surface roughness was quantitatively decomposed into waviness and unevenness fig 3 and the measurable physical properties such as asperity wavelength and asperity angle were used for shear behavior estimation this model comparing to previous models that are merely applicable to regular shaped joints saeb and amadei 1992 indraratna et al 1999 and those employing statistical parameters like jrc to characterize fracture surface roughness indraratna et al 2015 can better represent the role played by the asperities of different sizes in a shear process however this model treated the dilation angle as a lumped parameter based on a sinusoidal function which was highly empirical in estimating the dilation behavior of shearing fractures that is the key to solve the stress flow transport processes in this study we separately quantify the contributions of dilation and asperity shearing to the total joint shear resistance which is more physically meaningful gerrard 1986 correlation between the improved model and the experimental data in this study has demonstrated its capacity which will be shown in detail in the following section 3 for brittle hard rocks such as granite the partial failure of asperities and generation of micro cracks could happen before the peak shear stress arrives instead of the ordinarily employed pre and post peak classification the entire shear process is simply divided into two stages i e the elastic stage and the plastic stage the term plastic is used to distinguish from the elastic behavior taking place in the initial shear stage during the plastic stage the asperities are gradually yielded and substantially sheared off the dilation behavior is governed by different mechanisms in the elastic stage and the plastic stage the shear stress shear displacement curve in the elastic stage is directly related to the shear displacement in a linear manner while the curve in the plastic stage is governed by a shear stiffness reduction factor that represents the degradation of asperities in the elastic stage the incremental shear stress depends linearly on the incremental shear displacement 1 δ τ k s δ δ s e where τ is the shear stress increment k s is the shear stiffness and δ δ s e is the shear displacement increment in the elastic stage in this study the k s is a constant that is 1 10 of the normal stiffness k n the shear stiffness of rock fractures typically ranges from 1 100 to 1 10 of the normal stiffness alber and hauptfleisch 1999 here a fixed ratio of 1 10 was selected to represent the behavior of hard rocks granite when the dilation commences the increasing normal displacement will increase the normal stress under cns conditions therefore the normal stress and the normal displacement are step wisely updated in li et al 2018 2a δ δ n δ δ s p tan i d i 2b δ n i δ n i 1 δ δ n 2c δ σ n k n δ δ n 2d σ n i σ n i 1 δ σ n where δ δ n is the increment of normal displacement δ δ s p is the increment of shear displacement in the plastic stage i d i is the dilation angle at step i and δ σ n is the increment of normal stress δ n i and δ n i 1 are the normal displacement at iterative steps i and i 1 respectively and σ n i and σ n i 1 are the normal stress at iterative steps i and i 1 respectively with the platform established by li et al 2018 we then introduce the principle of wear to estimate the evolutions of normal stress shear stress and normal displacement in the plastic stage we start the model construction with a simplified case where the asperity is triangular as shown in fig 4 a this model only contains a single wave without unevenness the classic wear theory barwell 1958 queener et al 1965 assumed that for a metal surface under shear the volume of surface roughness is a function of the normal stress shear displacement and surface roughness degree it was proposed that the increment of the sheared surface roughness volume over the shear displacement increment was proportional to the remaining surface roughness volume in this study we additionally take into account the role of shear stress playing in asperity degradation by linking the evolution of asperity area to a function of the plastic work and the remaining asperity area the increment of the sheared asperity area at step i δ s s i over an increment of plastic work δ w s p i τ δ δ s p i is linearly proportional to the asperity area available for shear at step i equal to the un sheared asperity area at the last step s i 1 3 δ s s i δ w s p i c i s i 1 where c i is the degradation coefficient of the asperity at step i and s i 1 λ i 1 a i 1 2 λ is the asperity wavelength and a is the asperity amplitude see fig 4 the sheared asperity area at step i is 4 s s i s i 1 s b i where s b i is the un sheared asperity area before experiencing the increment in dilation δ δ n i over step i combining eqs 3 and 4 yields 5a s s i s i 1 1 e c i w s p i 5b s b i s i 1 e c i w s p i according to fig 4 the un sheared asperity area before experiencing the increment in dilation over step i s b i is given by 6 s b i λ 2 i 1 2 c o t i d i c o t i 0 the sheared asperity area at step i then becomes 7 s s i λ i 1 2 a i 1 λ i 1 c o t i d i c o t i 0 where i 0 is the initial dilation angle the amplitude of the un sheared asperity at step i before instant dilation a b i is 8 a b i λ i 1 c o t i d i c o t i 0 combining eqs 5b and 6 yields the dilation angle of the asperity at step i i d i as 9 t a n i d i e c i w s p i 2 e c i w s p i t a n i d i 1 the asperity area available for shear at step i 1 is updated as 10a a i a b i δ δ n i 10b λ i λ i 1 2 δ δ s p i 10c s i λ i a i 2 the sheared asperity area ratio at step i is 11 a s i s s i s 0 to produce a smooth curve bridging the elastic stage and the plastic stage the dilation angle should be identical at the transitional point between the two stages given that the dilation angle at the onset of plastic stage depends on the accumulated plastic tangential work we consider that the mobilisable dilation angle in the elastic stage decreases as the elastic energy w s e σ τ d δ s e accumulating in a form similar to eq 9 as 12 t a n i d m e c w s e 2 e c w s e t a n i 0 where c is the wear constant for the triangular asperity we then extend the triangular model to more general cases where both waviness and unevenness are present i e natural fracture surfaces a surface profile with roughness is characterized by the waviness and the unevenness which are quantified by the inclination angle iw wavelength λw and amplitude aw of the waviness and the inclination angle αu wavelength λu and amplitude au of the unevenness as shown in fig 3 li et al 2017 2018 here the waviness represents the large scale undulations which causes dilation during shear since they are too large to be completely sheared off the unevenness represents small scale roughness that tends to be damaged during shear isrm 1978 these values are defined based on the consideration that the waviness and unevenness that represent the effect of asperities together with the basic friction of a fracture surface constitute the total shear resistance therefore the mobilisable shear stress τ m can be written as 13 τ m σ n tan ϕ b i d m α d m 1 a s a s σ s where ϕ b is the basic friction angle of a fracture i d m is the mobilisable asperity angle for the waviness α d m is the mobilisable asperity angle for the unevenness and σ s is the shear stress required to shear off an asperity the sheared area ratio a s of waviness and unevenness is 14 a s a s w a s u s 0 w s 0 u where a s w and a s u denote the sheared area of waviness and unevenness respectively and s 0 w and s 0 u represent the initial area of waviness and unevenness respectively the dilation angle of unevenness at step i α d i has an identical form with that of the waviness eq 9 as 15 t a n α d i e c u i w s p i 2 e c u i w s p i t a n α d i 1 where cu is the wear constant for the critical unevenness the sheared area of unevenness at step i s s u i is 16 s s u i λ u i 1 2 a u i 1 λ u i 1 c o t α d i c o t α 0 where α 0 is initial inclination angle of the unevenness the degradation coefficient of asperity is closely related to the joint roughness and the strength of asperities hutson and dowding 1990 here we use the dilation angle and the asperity area available for shear to represent the joint roughness the degradation coefficients of waviness and unevenness at step i c w i and c u i are 17 c w i k i d i σ c s w i 1 18 c u i k α d i σ c s u i 1 respectively where k is a dimensionless coefficient that represents the effect of experimental environments such as temperature and humidity on the asperity degradation σ c is the unconfined compressive strength of the rock the dilation angle of unevenness at the beginning of plastic stage is 19 t a n α d e c u w s e 2 e c u w s e t a n α 0 to present the decay of shear stiffness in the plastic stage a reduction factor f is introduced as itasca consulting group inc 2011 20 f 1 τ τ m f k s represents the present shear stiffness at a given mobilisable shear stress and τ is the actual stress the shear stress in the plastic stage can then be updated by 21 τ i τ i 1 fk s δ δ s fig 5 shows the flowchart of model implementation in the mechanical module the mechanical behaviors of fractures are updated and stored at each step of shear displacement comparing to the previous shear models under the cns condition indraratna et al 2015 li et al 2018 the present model explicitly and independently took into account the roles of asperity sliding and asperity shearing and mimics the physical process of asperity degradation based on the principle of wear the evolutions of normal displacement and sheared off area of rough walled profiles during shear can be obtained which will be later used in the solute transport estimation 2 2 hydro mechanical behavior of fractures during shear both normal and shear stresses change the geometry of voids in fractures that serve as the spaces for fluid flow and solute transport the loading and unloading processes result in the closure and opening of a fracture respectively while the shear stress yields the relative movement of two walls of a fracture resulting in aperture heterogeneity and dilation contraction in a shear process the mechanical aperture of a fracture b m can be estimated by li et al 2008 22 b m b n 0 δ b n δ b s where b n 0 is the initial aperture at a given stress environment δ b n is the variation of aperture due to normal loading or unloading i e closure or opening and δ b s is the variation of aperture due to shear note that all of these variables represent the half space of a fracture as shown in fig 1 d for well mated fractures subjected to normal stress the voids that can effectively conduct fluid are considerably small according to previous experimental measurements an initial fracture aperture b n 0 5 μm was employed here to represent this state zhao et al 2011 δ b n is the aperture variation due to normal loading unloading process in which the positive value of δ b n indicates an unloading process and the negative value indicates a loading process the hyperbolic function proposed by bandis can be used to correlate the normal displacement b n with σ n as follows bandis et al 1983 23 σ n k 0 2 b n 1 b n b nmax where b nmax is half of the maximum normal closure and k 0 is the initial normal stiffness at a prescribed stress state this function is only applicable to a simple normal loading unloading process without shearing δ b s is associated with the normal displacement evolution in a shear process with the increment of shear displacement the normal displacement of a fracture experiences dramatic changes that can be classified into three stages in the first stage the normal displacement typically show negative values contraction that are mainly controlled by the rock type the matedness of the fracture and the normal stress level applied which happens before the appearance of the peak shear stress this stage is transitory and its influence on the hydraulic and transport behavior is limited which is therefore not considered in the developed model in the mechanical module described above the dilation takes place along with the appearance of the peak shear stress in the second stage along with the onset of dilation the normal displacement increases significantly at an approximately constant gradient in the third stage the normal displacement increases continuously at a decaying gradient that gradually approaches 0 which means that the dilation will efficiently halt at a sufficiently large shear displacement jiang et al 2004 2006 for a shear process under cnl conditions the normal stress is constant throughout the whole process therefore δ b n 0 under cns conditions the total aperture change partially results from the varying normal stress and the summation of δ b n and δ b s will correspond to the normal displacement increment by making use of δ δ n 2 δ b n δ b s the mechanical aperture at any given shear displacement can be obtained to calculate the flow rate however the hydraulic aperture b h should be used instead of b m when rough walled fractures are encountered bear 1972 in the previous studies models employing different parameters such as standard deviation of local mechanical aperture and contact area ratio zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 critical normal stress baghbanan and jing 2008 standard deviations of local mechanical aperture and local slope of fracture surface xiong et al 2011 jrc olsson and barton 2001 and minimum closure distance and average jrc values for upper and lower rock fracture profiles rasouli and hosseinian 2011 have been established to link the hydraulic aperture to the mechanical aperture as tabulated in table 1 for natural groundwater flow in deep seated fractures the flow is likely to stay in the linear regime i e r e 1 javadi et al 2014 which ruled out the models where the linear flow was not strictly maintained meanwhile models established based on the 3 d geometry of fractures or need to solve fluid flow in a specific geometry cannot be directly applied to the problem here mallikamas and rajaram 2010 wang et al 2015 given the fact that in the linear flow regime the difference between mechanical aperture and hydraulic aperture is directly attributed to the roughness of fracture surface their relation needs to be established based on parameters that can effectively characterize the roughness detwiler and rajaram 2007 li et al 2016 the root mean square of the first deviation of a profile z 2 is extensively used in roughness assessment for its simplicity and explicit mathematical definition written as 24 z 2 1 m z i 1 z i x i 1 x i 2 1 2 where x i and z i are the coordinates of the profile and m is the number of sampling points along the x direction a numerical study on fluid flow through rough profiles with a range of z 2 from 0 smooth parallel plate model to 0 50 j r c 20 by solving navier stokes equations was put forward the following expression for the relation between b h and b m was developed li and jiang 2013 zhao et al 2014b 25 b h b m 1 z 2 2 25 in simulation a constant hydraulic pressure was applied to the inlet of the fracture and the flow rate at the outlet was recorded no slip condition was applied to the fracture walls this boundary condition and the treatment of 2 d fractures are exact the same with the problem concerned here which therefore was employed in the hydraulic module to estimate the hydraulic aperture one may select other relations tabulated in table 1 when corresponding fracture geometry and hydraulic boundary conditions are encountered for example when the magnitude of roughness can be represented by a simple coefficient the equations of lomize 1951 louis 1969 patir and cheng 1978 walsh 1981 and or hakami 1995 may be selected when the surface roughness of fractures represented by jrc tortuosity fractal dimension and or root mean square of the first deviation of the profile is available the equations of barton et al 1985 waite et al 1999 yu and cheng 2002 liu et al 2015 and or li and jiang 2013 may be selected with respect to 3 d fracture geometries when the statistical parameters such as the standard deviation of mean mechanical aperture standard deviation of local slope of fracture surface and standard deviation of mechanical aperture during shearing are known the equations of zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 xiong et al 2011 and or xie et al 2015 may be selected several regression equations between j r c and z 2 have been derived a representative one of which is myers 1962 tse and cruden 1979 26 j r c 32 2 32 74 l o g z 2 for fluid flow having a sufficiently small reynolds number i e r e 1 in deep seated rock fractures the cubic law is valid as long as the influence of the surface roughness has been addressed eq 25 the flow rate q can then be obtained by 27 q w 2 b h 3 3 μ dp dx where w is the fracture width w 1 in 2 d μ is the dynamic viscosity and p is the hydraulic pressure the mean flow velocity v in a fracture can be calculated by 28 v q 2 w b h b h 2 3 μ dp dx 2 3 solute transport in fractured rocks solute transport in fractures and rock matrix is governed by a series of mechanisms which are affected by the geometric properties of both fractures and rock matrix and the boundary conditions neretnieks 1980 shih 2007 a general analytical solution developed by tang et al 1981 has addressed all of these transport mechanisms and is widely accepted in different models accounting for solute transport in fractured rocks sun and buscheck 2003 shih 2007 zhao et al 2011 zou et al 2016 if the decay of solute is negligible the governing equation for solute transport in single rock fractures can be written as 29 v c f x d f 2 c f x 2 r c f t q b h 0 where c f is the volumetric concentration of solute in the fracture d f is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient determined by d f α l v d α l is the mechanical dispersivity in the direction of fracture axis d is the molecular diffusion coefficient x is the distance along the fracture axis r is the retardation coefficient in the fractures t is the time and q is the diffusive flux perpendicular to the fracture axis considering the mass balance of solute in the fracture and in the pores of the matrix respectively the following governing equations of solute transport can be obtained tang et al 1981 neretnieks et al 1982 30 v c f x d f 2 c f x 2 r c f t d e b h c m z z b 0 31 c m t d a r 2 c m z 2 where c m is the volumetric concentration of solute in the matrix z is the coordinate perpendicular to the fracture axis fig 1 c and r is the retardation coefficient in the matrix d e and d a are the effective diffusion coefficient and the apparent diffusion coefficient respectively which are defined as 32 d e d θ m 33 d a d e θ ρ m k m where θ is the rock matrix porosity m is the exponent relating to the diffusion coefficient typically taken to be 1 6 for granite ruffet et al 1995 ρ m is the bulk density of the matrix and k m is the distribution coefficient that is defined as the mass of solute adsorbed per unit volume of matrix divided by the concentration of solute freeze and cherry 1979 the matrix porosity θ is stress dependent written as zimmerman 1991 34 θ 1 1 θ i e a 1 σ σ i a 2 a 3 e a 3 σ e a 3 σ i where θ i is the initial matrix porosity at zero stress and a 1 a 2 and a 3 are constants that equal to 0 82 10 4 5 35 10 4 and 0 12 respectively the source concentration is typically considered as a constant at the inlet i e c f 0 t c 0 which is only an approximation when the hydrodynamic dispersion is present rasmuson 1986 here c 0 represents the solute concentration at the source a more representative boundary which treats the flux at the inlet fig 1c as a constant should be considered as danckwerts 1953 35a v c 0 v c f 0 t d

retardation coefficient which varies with the changing extra absorptive area provided by gouge particles during shear a retardation coefficient is typically defined as zhao et al 2012 39 r 1 α k f b h where α is a coefficient that represents the extra adsorptive area induced by shear on rough surfaces and k f is the equilibrium distribution coefficient of solute on a fracture surface for commonly employed smooth parallel plates model of rock fractures without the generation of gouge particles α 1 given that a rough surface can have greater actual area than a planar surface with the same length and width the extra adsorptive surfaces provided directly by the roughness and provided by gouge particles need to be considered independently as zhao et al 2012 40 α α r α s s act 2 l w s she 2 l w where α r and α s are the surface increase factors due to the roughness of fracture surface and the shear process respectively s act is the actual surface area s she is the increased adsorptive area by shear and l is the fracture length α r can be directly estimated by comparing the real length of a profile to the apparent length on x axis see fig 1 b and c note that during a shear process α r needs to be updated according to the exposed surface area change induced by asperity damage as demonstrated in fig 4 in the present study it is assumed that the wear products during shearing would not clog the flow channels to determine α s two important issues need to be addressed 1 the volume of gouge particles generated by shear at an arbitrary shear displacement 2 the size distribution of the generated particles the first issue is solved by the developed mechanical model presented above eqs 7 and 16 which provides the sheared off area at a given shear displacement the second issue more or less needs to be experimentally constrained to establish a distribution model for gouge particles produced by shear direct shear tests were conducted on six fresh tensile fractures of granite under normal stresses of 1 5 and 10 mpa and the generated particles were carefully collected and measured via a laser diffraction particle size analyzer zhao et al 2018b the results show that the size distribution can be well described by a weibull function as zhao et al 2018a b 41 f x a w b w b w a w x a w b w 1 e x a w b w where a w 0 is the shape parameter and b w 0 is the scale parameter which are determined by fitting the experimental results with this distribution function the surface area of sheared off gouge particles could be calculated by 42 s she v s β j f d j a w b w d where v s is the sheared off volume of particles β is a shape factor and d is the arithmetic mean diameter of the particle size for a first order estimation we presume that all the particles have a uniform shape of spheres β 6 the sheared off area s s in 2 d models can be linked with the sheared off volume v s by assigning a unit thickness when fluid flow presents some very fine particles may be flushed away from the fracture lacking supports from matured theory or experimental measurements here we have to presume that all gouge particles stay in the fracture to highlight the effect of retardation it is also notable that with the transformation from mechanical aperture to hydraulic aperture by eq 25 the rough walled model will be simplified to the parallel plates model with a constant hydraulic aperture in such a condition the dispersion induced by aperture variation in the direction of fracture axis is neglected in the calculation the computational process of the developed mechanical hydraulic solute transport model is shown in fig 5 the material properties the geometric parameters and the parameters associated with the boundary conditions need to be input into the model to initiate the computation the mechanical module provides the variations of normal stress shear stress normal displacement and sheared off area in a shear process the normal displacement is then used to calculate the changes in aperture and flow rate during shear in the hydraulic module the sheared off area and its particle distribution are used to obtain the retardation coefficient finally these results together with the constants and coefficients associated with mass transport in rocks are input into the solute transport module to compute the concentrations of solute in fractures and matrix at different locations and time the calculation is put forward in a step wise manner i e the parameters in the hydraulic and transport modules are updated at each shear displacement increment these processes can be easily solved using some commercial computational softwares such as matlab 3 validation of the proposed mechanical model to the best of our knowledge no available experimental results on the coupled shear flow transport processes of rock fractures under cns conditions have been reported in the literature if any the only available experimental results are the mechanical behaviors i e shear stress normal displacement and normal stress of fractures sheared under cns conditions therefore in this section the validity of the mechanical model is verified against experimental observations here shear test results on a 2 d fracture established from a jrc profile and a rough walled fracture were used for this purpose in the following section 4 a parametric study is performed to test the sensitivity of the transport properties i e relative concentrations in both fractures and matrix to the mechanical parameters i e shear displacement normal stiffness and initial normal stress 3 1 comparison with a jrc profiled rock fracture barton and choubey 1977 proposed 10 profiles for characterizing the surface roughness of rock fractures the jrc values of these 2 d profiles range from 0 to 20 here we selected the profile with a jrc value of 8 10 to prepare the artificial rock samples fig 6 the sample was made of a mixture of plaster water and retardant with a weight ratio of 1 0 2 0 005 the shear behavior of fractures is governed by a number of parameters including the material properties the surface morphology and the boundary conditions to efficiently validate the model some of these parameters need to be well constrained to gain a better understanding on the sensitivity of shear behavior to the remaining parameters the artificial samples instead of natural rocks was used for its constant physicomechanical properties and good reproductivity in preparing samples with the same surface which could facilitate the investigation on the influence of boundary conditions on the shear behavior the samples had a size of 100 mm in width 200 mm in length and 100 mm in height as shown in fig 6 a the undulation only existed in the length direction while the width direction was merely an extension of the 2 d profile the density of the sample was 2 066 g cm3 and the compressive strength was 47 4 mpa direct shear tests were carried out on these samples under cns boundary condition using a servo controlled shear testing apparatus developed by jiang et al 2004 2006 the initial normal stress was 2 mpa and the normal stiffness was 3 and 7 gpa m here the values of normal stiffness 3 and 7 gpa m are generally in the same magnitude with those reported in literature jiang et al 2009 nemcik et al 2014 kulatilake et al 2016 the normal stiffness is controlled by the surrounding rocks rather than by the specimen itself which is realized via a servo controlled apparatus the tested maximum shear displacement was 20 mm 10 of the model length a constant shear rate of 0 5 mm min was applied to all the tests and calculations mentioned here as recommended by isrm isrm 2007 for the tested profile the wavelength and angle of the critical waviness were 72 4 mm and 6 82 respectively and those of the critical unevenness were 23 1 mm and 11 83 respectively the method to calculate these critical values is referred to li et al 2018 these parameters were input into the developed mechanical module for shear and the mechanical behavior such as shear stress normal displacement and normal stress during shear was calculated at each shear step δ δ s 0 005 m m fig 7 shows the comparisons of shear stress normal displacement and normal stress versus shear displacement between the experimental results and the predictions of the developed model the results show that with the increasing shear displacement the shear stress normal displacement and normal stress increase significantly in the stage before the appearance of the peak shear stress and then gently approaching some constant values the larger normal stiffness results in the larger shear and normal stresses and the smaller normal displacement dilation a greater normal stiffness would more tightly confine a fracture that enhances the interlocking of asperities thereby increasing the normal stress and reducing the dilation as a result a greater shear stress is required to slide the fracture in the residual stage the good agreement between the experimental results and the predicted results show that the developed model is capable of estimating the mechanical behavior of 2 d profiled fractures during shear under cns conditions 3 2 comparison with a rough walled rock fracture in a previous study we prepared replicas of a natural granite fracture exposed in the construction site of omaru power plant in miyazaki prefecture in japan and conducted direct shear tests li et al 2008 as shown in fig 8 a the fracture had a rough surface with the existence of several major asperities the mean jrc value of the fracture ranged 16 18 the same material and procedure with that described in the last section were taken to prepare the rough walled samples in the shear test the initial normal stress was 1 mpa and the normal stiffness was 0 5 gpa m since the mechanical model was developed based on 2 d profiles the representativeness of 2 d profiles to 3 d rough surfaces needs to be evaluated to verify the applicability of the model instead of randomly selecting 2 d profiles nine regularly spaced profiles with an interval of 10 cm along the width direction were selected and their angles of the critical waviness were calculated the results show that profile no 3 has the largest angle iw 16 37 followed by no 6 iw 13 86 as shown in fig 8 the asperity of the maximum size is included in profile no 3 as shown in fig 8 a given the fact that the shear behavior of fractures is governed by a few major asperities that have greater inclination angle and wavelength than others jiang et al 2006 oh et al 2015 these two profiles were selected to estimate the shear behavior of the studied fracture as a comparison we also computed the arithmetic mean of profiles along the width direction with an interval of 0 2 mm and generated a new profile that represents the average roughness of the surface as shown in fig 8 d the wavelength and angle of the critical waviness for profile no 3 were 32 mm and 16 37 for profile no 6 were 30 mm and 13 86 and for the average profile were 56 mm and 5 06 respectively the wavelength and angle of the critical unevenness for profile no 3 were 12 mm and 8 53 for profile no 6 were 8 mm and 12 68 and for the average profile were 18 mm and 5 89 respectively fig 9 a shows the variations in shear stress versus shear displacement between experimental results and predicted results of the three profiles before reaching the peak shear the contacting asperities are most in the elastic state therefore the shear stress increases in a linear manner and the results calculated from different profiles are almost identical the result of profile no 3 fits well with the experimental result at peak but overestimates the shear stress in the post peak stage in some contents the curve of profile no 6 is similar to that of no 3 with a slightly smaller shear stress at peak and in the residual stage in contrast the average profile significantly underestimates the peak shear stress yet fitting well with the experimental result in the residual stage for a rough surface the overriding and shear off of major asperities happen simultaneously with the occurrence of the peak shear stress i e the shear strength jiang et al 2006 in the post peak stage along with the failure of major asperities some other asperities with smaller sizes gradually take part in the wearing process and the shear behavior tends to be controlled by a more generalized surface character i e the average roughness this explains why the peak shear stress is well predicted by using profile no 3 and the residual shear stress is well predicted by using the average profile the predicted normal displacement of the profiles no 3 and no 6 is greater than the experimental result as shown in fig 9 b because in these profiles the geometry of the major asperities was taken to represent the roughness of the whole surface the normal displacement of the average profile is smaller than the experimental result due to the reduced height and slope of asperities by averaging the results of other seven profiles are bounded between the results of the maximum profile no 3 and the average profile the above comparisons suggest that the peak shear stress of a rough walled fracture could be accurately predicted using a profile that represents the geometry of the largest asperity and the residual shear stress could be well predicted using a profile that represents the average roughness character the normal displacement is somewhat around the middle of the results of the maximum profile and the average profile the shear behavior of 2 d profiled fractures could be precisely predicted by the developed model as shown in fig 7 because their maximum profile and average profile are identical in the present study since only 2 d models of fractures are concerned the proposed mechanical model is considered suitable to serve as a mechanical basis for solute transport assessment 4 parametric study a parametric study was put forward to investigate the typical response of solute transport behavior of rough walled rock fractures to the shear process we considered five normal stresses i e 1 mpa 5 mpa 10 mpa 30 mpa and 50 mpa in the analysis which represent the in situ stress levels of shallow rocks to deep seated rocks 2000 m in the abovementioned sections three specific values of normal stiffness 0 5 gpa m 3 gpa m and 7 gpa m were assigned to the tests according to their mechanical and geometric properties since these samples were taken from different locations to gain a general understanding on the effect of normal stiffness on the transport behavior a wide range of normal stiffness i e 1 gpa m 10 gpa m 100 gpa m and 1000 gpa m were selected which covered most conditions encountered in practices pyrak nolte and morris 2000 jiang et al 2009 together with the normal stress to mimic the in situ boundary condition of fractures the critical angle and the wavelength of the profile that represents the geometry of the largest asperity as shown in fig 8 b were used for the calculation because the validation process has demonstrated that this profile could well predict the shear strength of the tested samples which is one of the most important properties of fractures the unconfined compressive strength is 132 mpa and the residual friction angle is 35 9 for granite according to laboratory tests li 2009 zhao et al 2018b the values of parameters used for calculation are tabulated in table 2 4 1 mechanical behavior of fractures during shear the evolutions of the normal displacement dilation the normal stress and the matrix porosity during shear are shown in fig 10 subjected to four levels of normal stiffness and two initial normal stresses 1 mpa and 50 mpa for comparison as shown in fig 10 a and d the difference of the residual normal displacements obtained at the normal stiffness of 1 gpa m and 1000 gpa m is around 20 times showing that the normal stiffness has a strong confining effect on the dilation behavior of fractures during the entire shear process the increment of normal stress during shear is proportional to the dilation with a factor of kn as shown in fig 10 b and e the normal stress becomes constant after reaching some turning point which is in accordance with that on the dilation curve the normal stress increases up to 210 mpa in fig 10 b and 230 mpa in fig 10 e at a normal stiffness of 1000 gpa m which largely surpasses the initial normal stresses of 1 mpa and 50 mpa in reality shear processes may halt when such reacting normal stresses have reached some critical values which is why fractures sheared to different displacements exist in the nature the above results suggest that when a rough walled rock fracture is sheared under a great value of normal stiffness e g deep seated hard rocks the dilational behavior will be primarily governed by the reacting restriction of surrounding rock masses due to shear induced dilation i e the increment in normal stress rather than the initial normal stress that only represents the in situ stress environment prior to shear an active shear force is required to initiate the sliding which will later trigger the reaction of surrounding rock masses for deep seated fractures due to shear induced dilation such active shear force and the reactive normal force will further compress the host rocks of the fracture resulting in the decrease in porosity the calculated results of porosity are shown in fig 10 c and f along with the shear the porosity of the host rock exhibits a fast descending behavior in the initial stage due to the fast increments of both shear stress and normal stress and then reaches some constant values in the residual stage where both the normal and shear stresses no longer change for a normal stiffness of 1 gpa m that is typically used in laboratory experiment the calculated porosity decreases from 0 85 to 0 84 by a rate of 1 18 as shear displacement increases from 0 to 20 mm under an initial normal stress of 50 mpa see fig 10 k in contrast under a normal stiffness of 1000 gpa m the porosity varies by a rate of 33 02 which is approximately 28 times that under a normal stiffness of 1 gpa m simply because the increased compressive stresses acting on the host rock are greater in both normal and shear orientations such reduction of porosity will efficiently influence the diffusion of solute in the rock matrix as presented later the evolutions of the cumulative sheared off area and the resulting value of r are shown in fig 11 the cumulative sheared off area also exhibits a fast increasing stage followed by an almost constant stage during shear as shown in fig 11 a and c the transition between the two stages is instantaneous for the case with a great value of normal stiffness i e 1000 gpa m which becomes more gentle as the normal stiffness decreases for the case with a large value of normal stiffness i e 1000 gpa m the shear off of asperities happens simultaneously with the start of dilation which substantially smoothens the facture surface reducing the dilation in the residual stage fig 10 a and d in contrast the damage on asperities happens less fiercely in the initial stage of shear in the case with smaller normal stiffness therefore the cumulative sheared off area keeps increasing in a larger displacement of shear when the fracture surface is sufficiently smoothened the damage on asperities will gradually halt leaving the two flat walls sliding on each other the sheared off minerals will increase the absorptive area thereby enhancing the retardation of solute transport in a fracture meanwhile as indicated by eq 39 the augment of aperture due to dilation will efficiently reduce the retardation coefficient their competitive effects on the value of r are shown in fig 11 b and d in the initial stage of shear the hydraulic aperture starts to increase proportionally with the dilation while most asperities remain intact therefore the curves of all cases exhibit rapid decreasing tendencies by a magnitude as large as two orders for the cases with relatively large values of normal stiffness after a fast descending stage a rebound of r could be observed this rebound happens when the effect of the increased absorptive area prevails over the effect of increasing hydraulic aperture which occurs in the fast increasing stage of the cumulative sheared off area where the asperities are fiercely damaged as shown in fig 11 a and c the rebound is more obvious in the case with a greater initial normal stress i e 50 mpa since it could bring greater damages to the asperities in the initial stage of shear in the residual stage i e shear displacement is larger than 10 mm since both the hydraulic aperture and sheared off area change in small ranges the retardation coefficient falls in a stage with constant values 4 2 effect of shear on the transport behavior with the obtained flow rate from the hydraulic module and the value of r the spatial distribution of the concentration of solute in the fracture c f and the concentration in the matrix c m were calculated fig 12 shows the variations in the relative concentrations c f c 0 and c m c 0 with varying initial normal stress σ n0 and varying distance along the fracture trace x from 0 to 10 m here two levels of normal stiffness 1 gpa m and 1000 gpa m were selected for comparison and constant initial values were assigned to other parameters as tabulated in table 2 in the following analysis when the influence of a parameter is analyzed other parameters will be assigned the initial value the concentration in rock matrix was taken at the location perpendicular to the fracture wall with a distance of 0 5 m for the cases in the left column the values of c f c 0 and c m c 0 are almost constant along the distance from 0 to 10 m because the concentration is substantially balanced after a transport time of 50 years for the cases in the right column the strong normal stiffness has significantly restricted the dilation resulting in a considerably slow transport process both c f c 0 and c m c 0 decrease with the increasing σ n0 because a larger normal stress will more tightly confine a fracture resulting in the reduction of fracture aperture and porosity simultaneously such reduction is enhanced by applying a greater level of normal stiffness on the fracture as shown by the comparison between the figures in left column 1 gpa m to the right column 1000 gpa m the concentration decreases in an accelerated manner with the increases of the normal stress and the distance from the original point which is more obvious at higher levels of normal stress and normal stiffness as indicated by eq 29 the reduction in average flow rate at a given pressure gradient and the augment of retardation subjected to a strong stress and stiffness confinement will work together to yield a slow transport process the influence of k n on the variations in c f c 0 and c m c 0 are shown in fig 13 under two normal stresses 1 mpa and 50 mpa while both c f c 0 and c m c 0 decrease gently with the increasing normal stiffness and distance the case with a normal stiffness of 1000 gpa m distinguished itself from other cases exhibiting a large gradient of reduction the concentration difference between the original point inlet with the location 10 m away could be as high as 35 for the fracture and 60 for the matrix demonstrating a considerably slow transport process for deep seated rock fractures subjected to large stiffness for the normal stress ranging from 1 mpa to 50 mpa the variations in c f c 0 can be negligible however the variations in c m c 0 should be taken into account especially when k n 1000 gpa m fig 14 shows the variations in c f c 0 and c m c 0 with the varying shear displacement δ s the c f c 0 and c m c 0 decrease with the increasing distance from the source as δ s increases both c f c 0 and c m c 0 increase dramatically in the initial stage due to the dilation of the fracture and then approach constant values in the residual stage again a greater level of normal stiffness strongly surpasses the augment of relative concentrations in the initial stage resulting in a much more retarded transport process these curves are analogous to the dilation curves shown in fig 10 a and d indicating that the dilation plays a dominate role in the variations of the relative concentrations in a shear process with the increment of initial normal stress from 1 mpa to 50 mpa the variations in c f c 0 and c m c 0 do not change significantly in the place near the inlet i e x 0 m which however decrease to a large extent in the place far from the inlet i e x 10 m 4 3 effects of diffusion distance in z direction and time fig 15 shows the contour plots for c m c 0 distributions under different normal stresses with the increment of z from 0 01 m to 1 m c m c 0 decreases significantly with an increasing gradient showing that it is increasingly hard for the solute to penetrate into the deep positions comparison between the two figures reveals that the distribution of concentration with a greater gradient along the depth will present in the deep seated rocks fig 16 shows the penetration profiles of c f c 0 and c m c 0 at a time scale t up to 100 years under an initial normal stress of 50 mpa in the place near the inlet i e x 0 m the c f c 0 increases with a gradually decreasing rate as the elapsed time increases from 0 to 100 years however in the place far from the inlet i e x 10 m the c f c 0 increases with a first increasing and then decreasing rate for t 0 100 years while the value of c f c 0 close to the source reaches 1 0 in a period of around 30 years the concentration 10 m away from the inlet can hardly reach the equilibrium even after an elapsed time of 100 years due to the strong stress and stiffness constraints acting on deep seated rock fractures the concentration in the matrix exhibits a similar tendency but the values are always less than 1 0 after a long period which together with the results shown in fig 15 indicate that the matrix plays a much less important role in the solute transport in fractured rocks therefore at short time scales the matrix diffusion may be neglected when estimating the transport properties of deep seated fractured tight hard rocks 5 discussions 5 1 shear flow transport process of rock fractures the above analysis on calculation results clearly demonstrates the significant influences of shear processes on the hydraulic and solute transport behaviors of rock fractures for shallow rocks where the normal stress and normal stiffness acting on fracture planes are relatively low the shear induced dilation may increase the fracture aperture by up to three orders 5 μm comparing to 5 mm leading to a significant augment of flow rate according to the cubic law the solute transport process will be tremendously accelerated along with the shear process for deep seated rocks the shear process also results in the expansion of fracture aperture however due to the strong constriction of stress and stiffness boundaries the change of aperture is limited to a much depressed magnitude typically less than one order fig 10 this difference is in concert with our common knowledge on the transport phenomena in rock fractures at different depths it is notable that the cnl boundary condition as frequently used in previous studies cannot realistically reflect the constriction of surrounding rocks in terms of stress and stiffness on a shearing fracture the normal stress can be increased by up to 4 5 times when a normal stiffness of 1000 gpa m is applied to a rough walled fracture with an initial normal stress as large as 50 mpa the surface roughness plays a crucial role in the mechanical behavior of fractures during shear which varies with the rock type the environment a fracture is generated weathering and the deformation history the present study only considered fresh well mated tensile fractures which exhibit a pronounced dilation behavior another assumption is made that the normal stiffness is a constant during shearing which however deviates from the realistic cases during shearing the normal stress increases significantly i e more than two orders of magnitude as shown in fig 10 b in such a case the normal stiffness is not a constant and may change with the increasing stress jiang et al 2009 therefore the effect of variable normal stiffness during shearing should also be investigated in future works on the other hand the gouge particles generated during shear play a negative role in solute transport by providing extra absorptive areas a fracture could generate more particles when sheared under a larger normal stress and or normal stiffness the retardation effect of particles may be masked by the dilation in the initial stage of shear which may then prevail when sufficient particles are accumulated along with the shear the aperture normal stress and solute concentration change dramatically in the initial stage of shear along with the dilation and gradually approach some constant values in the residual stage therefore as long as a fracture has undergone a sufficiently large shear displacement its transport behavior may achieve a steady state 5 2 limitations of the model and future development the simplification of 3 d problems to 2 d is the most outstanding limitation of the presented model 2 d profiles selected from a 3 d surface may not realistically represent its topographical characteristics which is the main source of biased estimation of the mechanical behavior of fractures given that the material properties are generally well constrained we selected three profiles including the maximum profile and the average profile from a natural fracture surface and the calculated results showed that the shear strength is intimately associated with the geometry of a few major asperities that can be well represented by the maximum profile however the residual shear stress is likely to agree with the predictions made by the average profile this suggests that a spectrum analysis is required to identify these major asperities and to characterize the average roughness when 2 d profiles have to be selected from 3 d surfaces in the hydraulic aspect the fluid flow typically bypasses the contacts of varying sizes and shapes bridging the walls of a fracture with tortuosity which bring extra frictional losses and enhance the heterogeneity and localization of flow in contrast a 2 d model does not allow the existence of contacts because a single contact could block the entire flow therefore the model presented here only represents an open slice of a real fracture which holds its representative hydraulic properties some coarse particles may also block the throats of flow paths affecting the hydraulic and solute transport behavior this issue was not considered due to the lack of reliable mathematical models supported by experimental measurements a transformation of mechanical aperture to hydraulic aperture was adopted in the present model to account for the influence of roughness on the fluid flow the same manner of which may be used in 3 d model development in the future alternately solutions such as modified local cubic laws may help establish more precise permeability estimations mallikamas and rajaram 2010 presently 3 d numerical techniques have allowed the researchers to establish high resolution models of the real geometry of fractures based on which the fluid flow and solute transport can be precisely computed detwiler and rajaram 2007 xiong et al 2011 wang and cardenas 2016 zou et al 2017 huang et al 2019 however an identical surface geometry cannot be found on two single fractures in nature therefore a new numerical model has to be established when a new fracture is to be studied solving these high resolution models is highly time consuming and verification against well established experimental data is required when a new numerical model is established given that theoretical solutions to 3 d problems remain largely immature 2 d models with their simplicity and well established theories can still provide helpful insights into the mechanisms involved in the shear flow transport processes another limitation is the absence of extra absorptive areas provided by micro cracks generated during shear which together with gouge particles contribute to the variation of retardant coefficient zhao et al 2012 the micro cracks were neglected simply because the developed mechanical model could not precisely assess their cracking processes this issue remains largely unknown due mainly to the limitation of experimental techniques especially measurement methods that can effectively detect their spatial distribution and the geometry of single micro cracks in a shear process new techniques such as x ray ct combined with the theoretical and numerical analyses may help reveal the mechanisms that drive the generation of micro cracks however it still faces strong challenges when applying them to contacting asperities of various shapes and sizes under different stress environments tatone and grasselli 2015 other mechanisms such as sub critical cracking and healing due to pressure solution further complicate the estimations yasuhara and elsworth 2008 a possible solution is to link the works of shear force and normal force to the volume of generated micro cracks instead of predicting their exact locations and areas either way all models need to be validated experimentally based on reliable measurement techniques the weibull function was adopted to characterize the size distribution of sheared off gouge particles based on the measurements on particles collected after the fractures being sheared to the residual stage zhao et al 2018b actually the shear off of major asperities taking place immediately after reaching the peak stress is likely to generate coarse particles first which will gradually be crushed and smashed into finer particles along with the shear pereira and de freitas 1993 in the residual stage some new particles may also be generated from both the damaged asperities and some undamaged asperities of smaller sizes therefore the size distribution of particles at different shear displacement may have different characters if the weibull function is applicable to the size distribution at any shear displacement the parameters involved in the function shall have different values which require further experimental explorations in the present study the entire calculation was executed in an analytical manner the variations in the stress and displacement at each shear step were calculated based on the information of the last step the calculation only proceeds forwardly and the iteration is not necessary for each step without the need for numerical modeling the proposed method has a high computational efficiency that benefits the assessment for large scale problems 6 conclusions in the present study an analytical model for estimating the mechanical hydraulic solute transport processes in rough walled rock fractures under the constant normal stiffness boundary condition was developed the normal stiffness represents the reaction of surrounding rock masses to a shearing rock fracture due to the shear induced dilation that efficiently confines the fracture especially for deep seated rocks the model is composed of a mechanical module a hydraulic module and a solute transport module being calculated in a step wise manner in the mechanical module the surface of fractures was decomposed into waviness and unevenness and the roughness was characterized by their geometric properties the sliding process between the fracture walls and the failure of asperities were estimated based on the principle of wear which provided the sheared off area of asperities at each shear step the dilation induced expansion of mechanical aperture was incorporated into the hydraulic module to calculate the hydraulic aperture and the flow rate using a modified relation between the mechanical aperture and hydraulic aperture the governing equations of solute transport in rock fractures were solved to obtain the spatial distribution of solute concentration in the fracture and the matrix applying a constant flux boundary the retardation of transport due to the increased adsorptive areas provided by the generated gouge particles during shear was taken into account in the transport calculation the validity of the mechanical module was verified against shear test results on 2 d profiled rough walled fractures a combination of the maximum profile that represents the geometry of the largest asperity and the average profile seemingly captures the primary shear behavior of rough walled fractures using the mechanical module in 2 d due to the absence of shear flow solute transport test results instead of applying the model to a specific condition a parametric study was put forward to gain a general understanding on the transport behavior of shearing fractures the developed model systematically reveals the significant influences of a shear process on the hydraulic and solute transport behavior of rock fractures especially the competitive role played by the shear induced dilation and the retardation due to the increased absorptive area in the transport process the model also demonstrates the remarkable difference between the shear behavior of shallow rock fractures and deep seated rock fractures due to the differences in normal constrictions in terms of normal stress and normal stiffness which subsequently results in different transport behavior this model is especially helpful for the quantitative estimations on the solute transport through sheared fractures e g fault zones that extensively exist in nature lacking the supports of direct experimental measurements on stress flow transport processes in rock fractures under cns conditions a number of assumptions and simplifications have to be made to bridge these complex processes meanwhile several important issues such as the extra absorptive area produced by micro cracks the difference in size distribution patterns of particles at different shear displacements and the effect of solubility on solute transport still wait to be addressed in the future explorations nevertheless the present model provides a solid platform upon which the thermal hydraulic mechanical chemical models of rock fractures subjected to shear may be further developed declaration of
