17985,in order to understand and minimize the formation of halogenated disinfection by products dbps it is important to investigate how dissolved organic matter dom contributes to their generation in the present study we analysed the dom profile of water samples from the barcelona catchment area by high resolution mass spectrometry hrms and we studied the changes after chlorination chlorination produced significant changes in the dom decreased the average m z and kendrick mass defect kmd of their spectra and decreased the number and abundance of lignin like features the van krevelen vk fingerprint exhibited several noticeable changes including the appearance of highly oxidized peaks in the tannin like region average o c 0 78 0 08 the appearance of features with low h c and the disappearance of more than half of the lipids like features up to 657 halogenated peaks were generated during sample chlorination most of which in the condensed hydrocarbons like and the lignin like region of the vk diagram around 200 features were found to be strongly correlated ρ 0 795 to the formation potential of trihalomethanes thms and 5 were correlated with the formation potential of haloacetonitrile hans they all were plotted in the lignin fraction of the vk diagram but both groups of features exhibited different nitrogen content those features related to hans fp had at least one nitrogen atoms in their structures whilst those related to thms did not graphical abstract image 1 keywords high resolution mass spectrometry water chlorination dissolved organic matter disinfection by products van krevelen diagram dbp formation potential 1 introduction water chlorination is an efficient and cost effective method for removing pathogens related to waterborne diseases such as typhoid fevers cholera botulism and dysentery its introduction in the early 20th century epa us 2000 leal et al 1909 traube 1894 is regarded as a major turning point in the history of water management notwithstanding the sanitary benefits of water chlorination the addition of disinfectants to water triggers the generation of a myriad of disinfection by products dbps some of which are carcinogenic and may cause several toxicological effects after chronic consumption even at trace levels font ribera et al 2018 villanueva et al 2015 subsequently the occurrence of halogenated dbps derived from water chlorination is an emerging concern and several regulations have been enacted at domestic and supranational level to minimize the exposure of population to them chinese department of health 2006 commission 1998 european parliament 2000 nhmrc and nrmmc 2011 us epa 2006 1998 brominated and chlorinated trihalomethanes tribromo trichloro bromodichloro and dibromochloromethane also known as thms have attracted the most attention of both academia and regulatory agencies but the list of identified halogenated dbps contains hundreds of molecules from families as diverse as haloacetic acids haloacetonitriles haloketones haloaldehydes halonitromethanes and haloacetamides among others richardson et al 2008 recently the use of non target analyses has revealed the existence of a high number of previously unknown halogenated dbps in drinking water richardson and ternes 2018 high resolution mass spectrometry hrms and ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry uhrms analyses have contributed to determine their elemental composition through highly accurate m z measurements zhang et al 2014 2012 zhang and yang 2018 adsorbable organic halides aox analyses often report the presence of a significant number of halogenated substances the structures of which are yet to be elucidated hua and reckhow observed that only 45 of the total aox could be explained by the presence of thms trihaloacetic acids and dihaloacetic acids hua and reckhow 2007 while yeh et al observed that the percentage of aox that could be justified by the occurrence of targeted dbps was rather variable 35 118 in swimming pool water yeh et al 2014 finally an unsettled amount of dbps halogenated or not may be generated during water chlorination without being detectable by aox or by conventional extraction and detection methods direct measurements of target dbp are undoubtedly useful however the prediction of the dbp formation potential fp is equally important particularly in those cases when adjusting the disinfection parameters is viable in this regard the characterization of dissolved organic matter dom has proved to be a promising tool several dom properties are closely related to the occurrence of dbp precursors such as thms and or can be used as descriptors for predicting their fps this includes dom s spectroscopic properties i e ultraviolet absorbance at λ 254 nm or suva254 hua et al 2015 and fluorescent signal roccaro et al 2009 its composition e g the presence of protein like organic matter chu et al 2010 aromatic moieties hua et al 2015 and suspended particulate matter hou et al 2018 and the bulk concentration of dom which can be accounted as total organic carbon toc lee et al 2009 or as dissolved organic carbon doc peng et al 2016 commonly predictive models are multi parametrical and contemplate a wide range of physicochemical conditions i e the concentrations of halide ions or the ph as well as chlorination parameters the reaction time the temperature the reagent dose etc sohn et al 2004 however these models mostly rely on a reduced number of selected dbp target methods can hardly cover the quantitative analysis of the whole set of dbps generated during water chlorination because of i the large number of identified dbps ii the elevated costs of obtaining high purity standards for all of them and iii the presence of unknown dbps therefore the risk of dbps formation should be addressed using more holistic approaches such as non target analyses based on hrms the advances in mass spectrometry ms have allowed the identification of individual components of dom which is one of the most heterogeneous mixtures in the environment woods et al 2009 high field strength fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance ms fticr ms is capable of unravelling complex dom mixtures across aquatic systems kellerman et al 2014 riedel et al 2016 and orbitrap ms has proven to be a valid alternative as it also is capable of detecting subtle changes in dom profiles despite of being able to assign fewer features due to its lower m z resolution power farré et al 2019 hawkes et al 2018 2016 patriarca et al 2018 yuthawong et al 2019 the hrms study of dom is often complemented with graphical representations fingerprinting such as van krevelen vk diagrams and kendrick mass defect kmd plots which assist in the visualization interpretation and comparison of dom profiles andersson et al 2019 kim et al 2003 lavonen et al 2013 the objective of the present study was to investigate the changes of the dom after water chlorination from a multivariate analysis perspective and exploring the changes in their fingerprint obtained with orbitrap ms in order to i understand which regions of the fingerprints were more susceptible to changes during disinfection reactions and ii to identify surrogate features to help predicting dbp formation to this aim we extracted and analysed the dom of ten surface water samples from barcelona catchment area dom was isolated by solid phase extraction spe and analysed by hrms instrumental analyses were conducted before and after lab scale chlorination tests in order to track the changes in the dom the method was finally validated by investigating the correlation between m z features and the concentrations of two families of halogenated dbps thms and haloacetonitriles hans chosen because of their

were taken from the ter river itself and from the three reservoirs sau susqueda and pasteral 169 hm3 233 hm3 and 2 hm3 respectively these reservoirs are relevant for the barcelona metropolitan area as they supply around 170 hm3 drinking water agència catalana de l aigua 2015 through interbasin water transfer and present certain differences in term of morphology trophic state and residence time with sau being the most eutrophic water body of the reservoirs chain all of which may have a potential impact in the nature and concentration of dbp precursors samples were taken at the specified depth see table 1 in amber glass bottles letting no head space the bottles were immediately refrigerated and transported to the laboratory where they were processed within 24 h following the general procedure schematized in fig 2 and described in the following sections 2 3 batch chlorination experiments the dbp fp was assessed following a modified version of the standard method apha 2005 to obtain between 1 and 3 mg l of residual free chlorine after 24 h of contact time as described in previous studies de vera et al 2015 doederer et al 2014 liu et al 2016 once determined the specific chlorine dose was added to a 250 ml head space free glass bottle the bottle was capped and stored in an incubator in the dark at 25 c for 24 h the residual chlorine was measured with a photometric cuvette test kit lck 310 hach lange gmbh düsseldorf germany after measuring their chlorine content and quenching them with ascorbic acid samples were extracted for dbp analysis see text s1 in the supporting information and for dom characterization see section 2 4 2 4 extraction of ppl dom raw and quenched chlorinated samples were processed following the same protocol aliquots of each sample were filtered through 0 7 μm mesh size glass fibre filters and extracted by spe according to the method described elsewhere dittmar and koch 2006 with minor modifications as previously implemented in farré et al 2019 briefly 250 ml of filtered sample were acidified to ph 2 0 by adding formic acid drop by drop and were extracted with a ppl cartridge 500 mg 3 ml these cartridges contain a styrene divinylbenzene polymeric phase modified with a non polar surface recent studies have shown that ppl cartridges are found among the most efficient sorbents for dom components enabling a broad coverage of dom constituents in one single collection while avoiding substantial leaching li et al 2017 and they have been extensively applied to extract and characterize dom from several water matrices arakawa et al 2017 farré et al 2019 li et al 2016 prior to the extraction cartridges were washed thrice with 1 0 ml of methanol and were soaked overnight with 1 0 ml of methanol after being conditioned the cartridges were washed with one volume of formic acid 0 1 v v then samples were loaded under vacuum at approx 2 ml min salts were rinsed off with 3 0 ml of formic acid 0 1 v v and cartridges were dried under vacuum for 15 min finally the elution was carried out with 2 00 ml of methanol the extracts were collected in previously tared liquid chromatography lc vials 500 μl of the methanolic extracts were diluted 1 1 with ultrapure water and stored at 20 c until their instrumental analysis procedural blanks consisting of 250 1 ml of ultrapure water were filtered and extracted following the same protocol and in parallel with real samples analyses quenched chlorination blanks were also processed 2 5 instrumental analysis of organic matter analyses were carried out by hrms using a ltq velos from thermo scientific san josé ca usa using a hybrid linear ion trap orbitrap analyser extracts of blanks raw samples and chlorinated samples were infused into the mass spectrometer at a flow of 8 μl min the ionisation was performed with an electrospray ionisation esi source operating in negative polarity the instrumental parameters were set as follows the capillary voltage was set at 3 1 kv the capillary and the source heater temperatures were maintained at 275 c and 45 c respectively the sheath gas and the auxiliary gas flows were set at 28 and 5 a u while the sweep gas flow was turned off 300 scans were acquired for every sample spectra were acquired in full scan mode with a resolution of 100 000 da fwhm and a m z range of 100 1000 the following signals were used as lock masses for internal calibration during spectra acquisition m z 369 08272 c16h17o10 m z 397 11402 c18h21o10 and m z 423 12967 c20h23o10 2 6 data treatment determination of elemental compositions and fingerprinting an averaged spectrum of each sample was obtained using the software xcalibur 2 2 thermo scientific spectra were exported as excel workbook format files and processed with a custom script in r v 3 5 using the rstudio environment v 1 1 463 r tools technology the elemental compositions of the spectral signals were tentatively determined with functions from the r package mfassignr schum et al 2019 the workflow is fully described in the supporting information text s2 briefly m z signals were assigned to elemental formulae chon0 5s0 2cl0 2br0 2 using the function mfassignr mfassign with the following restrictions maximum tolerable m z error 1 0 ppm m z range 100 1000 charge only monocharged formulae were considered range of o c 0 1 0 range of h c 0 3 2 5 range of dbeo 1 10 the presence of features with 32s 35cl or 79br atoms was double checked by searching isotopologues containing 34s 37cl and 81br respectively the experimental 37cl 35cl 34s 32s and 81br 79br ratios were compared to natural isotopic ratios as detailed in text s2 the final list of formulae was represented in vk diagrams based on their o c h c and n c ratios they were classified in predefined categories according to their location in the vk diagram these classification criteria detailed in table s1 have been accepted in a multitude of recent dom studies although it should be noted that they may not fully describe the structural diversity of the peaks that are contained in each compositional space and it should be stressed that further structural elucidation should be performed to identify each substance and to unambiguously classify it schymanski et al 2014 the aromaticity index ai of each formula was calculated according to equation 1 koch and dittmar 2006 1 a i 1 c o s 0 5 h c o s n p the double bound equivalent dbe normalized by the number of carbons was calculated according to equation 2 melendez perez et al 2016 2 d b e c 1 0 5 2 c h n c masses were transformed to kendrick mass km values by normalizing their iupac 12c based mass by 1 0011178 kmch2 1 0000000 kendrick 1963 then kmd were calculated as in equation 3 hughey et al 2001 and kmd plots were presented 3 k m d k m k m where km and km stand for the kendrick mass km and the truncated kendrick mass values respectively 2 7 data treatment descriptive statistics and multivariate analyses statistics and multivariate analyses were performed using the r packages vegan oksanen et al 2019 stats r core team 2019 and factominer lê et al 2008 among others the data normality was checked using shapiro wilk tests and the null hypothesis h0 was rejected when p 0 05 differences among raw samples and chlorinated samples were investigated using paired difference tests non normally distributed data was assessed with wilcoxon signed ranks tests while paired student s t tests were applied to normal datasets in both cases differences were considered significant at p values 0 05 in multiple comparisons p values were corrected using the bonferroni holm method p bh a matrix was built containing the total set of formulae assigned in raw and chlorinated samples and their spectral abundances multivariate analyses principal component analysis pca were carried out in order to elucidate trends among samples and to identify those features that better distinguished chlorinated from raw samples correlation among variables and principal components pc was quantified as the square cosine of their angle in the loading graph which may range from 0 α 90 orthogonal totally uncorrelated to 1 α 0 parallel perfectly correlated the dissimilarity among samples was explored using the function vegan vegdist and represented with hierarchical clustering dendrograms stats heatmap the statistical dependence between thms hans and the hrms formulae were assessed in terms of spearman s rank correlation only those formulae that had been detected in 70 of the samples were considered those pairs of variables that were correlated with spearman s rank coefficients ρ 0 625 and ρ 0 795 were considered to be statistically correlated and strongly correlated respectively these thresholds imply correlations with statistical significances of approximately p 5 00 10 2 and p 5 00 10 3 respectively according to equation 4 4 t ρ n 2 1 ρ 2 where n is the number of observations and t is the student s t statistic which is justified by the permutation argument kendall and stuart 1969 2 8 additional precautions and safety considerations in order to avoid sample contamination all the lab glassware employed in these experiments had been thoroughly cleaned as follows i washed with detergent ii immersed in nitric acid bath hno3 10 v v overnight iii rinsed with ultrapure water iv rinsed with acetone and v thoroughly dried with nitrogen experiments were carried out under extraction fume 3 results and discussion 3 1 data treatment and study of samples by hierarchical clustering analysis table 2 summarises the main characteristics of the infused spectra distinguishing raw samples from chlorinated ones as can be seen the infusion of the raw extracts offered spectra with 85 000 3000 peaks most of which approx 90 were found to be noise and low intensity artefacts once cleaned up spectra presented an average number of monoisotopic signals of 6800 200 this value was relatively constant through the different samples and no significant trends were observed linking the number of signals and the sampling point or the depth of the water column peaks were tentatively assigned to empirical formulae using a custom r script text s2 a matrix was built containing the detected features and their respective abundance in each sample samples were classified according to their dissimilarity by measuring their cao dissimilarity index cyd cao et al 1997 the resulting dendrogram fig s1 satisfactorily grouped samples according to their two main characteristics matrix river or reservoir water and water body ter river sau susqueda and pasteral once the chlorinated samples were introduced into the model fig s2 the type of treatment raw or chlorinated sample became the primary factor that drove the clustering this highlights that water chlorination had a decisive impact in the elemental composition of dom 3 2 effects of chlorination to organic matter spectra and its kmd as can be seen in table 2 the number of signals detected by esi significantly increased after chlorination p 0 0003 from 8475 297 to 9559 721 accordingly the number of peaks corresponding to monocharged molecules fragments with exclusively 12c atoms increased from 6832 235 to 8418 247 p 10 4 in parallel the average intensity of these peaks decreased significantly ratio 0 71 p 0 0003 more precisely their average m z weighted by intensity decreased from m z 361 9 to 345 15 p 0 0051 these changes imply the breakage of larger molecules to create smaller less intense transformation products which can be attributed to miscellaneous oxidative degradation reactions of dom kmd plots corroborated a decrease in the average molecular mass of the spectra after chlorination the number of peaks with m z 600 was lower after chlorination as it is exemplified in fig 3 which shows the kmd plots of the pasteral extracts and the dataset was compressed in a narrower m z window this behaviour was observed in the whole set of kmd plots which are collected in fig s3 in the supporting information in parallel the average kmd and the intensity averaged kmd decreased significantly p 0 0051 and p 0 0093 after chlorination as a general rule low kmd values can be related to hydrogen poorer molecules e g aromatic compounds to the detriment of aliphatic molecules nikolic 2011 and more oxidized molecules see table s2 from a mechanistic point of view this can be justified by the oxidation of hydroxyls to carbonyls which produces aldehydes and ketones from primary and secondary alcohols respectively deborde and von gunten 2008 hu et al 2003 kmd can also decrease as a result of the hydrolysis of ketones which produces highly oxidized molecules such as monohydroxyl acetone dihydroxyl acetone and ultimately lactate finally a decrease in the kmd can be justified because of the introduction of halogens to the molecular structure 3 3 determination of elemental composition and effects of chlorination on the vk regions the dom profiles of every sample were fingerprinted building vk diagrams based on the o c and h c ratios of each identified formulae fig s4 in the supplementary information collects the whole set of vk diagrams detailing the intensity and m z of each feature with the size and colour of the scattered points vk diagrams were used to automatically classify the detected features in vk compositional spaces defined by their o c and h c ratios fig 3 shows a vk diagram of pasteral s surface water raw and chlorinated extracts on the left and right respectively with their compositional spaces clearly delimited table 3 summarises the relative abundances and behaviour of the features according to their location in the vk diagram the group of features placed in the lignin like features region was the most abundant in the analysed samples 3532 peaks belonged to this compositional space equivalent to 73 of the total number of signals which can be expected in common natural surface waters with no significant anthropogenic pressure in freshwater dom s vk diagram this compositional space is shared by lignin related molecules and esi fragments and signals related to carboxyl rich alicyclic molecules cram lam et al 2007 among other organic substances with the same compositional characteristics the number of features assigned to this region decreased both in absolute and in relative terms after chlorination 1005 signals corresponding to lignin like signals decreased their intensity according to wilcoxon signed rank tests or paired student s t tests p 0 05 and 1225 signals disappeared completely the abundances of 606 lignin like features were unaltered only 91 features increased their concentrations and finally 665 new lignin like peaks appeared after chlorination among the latter 460 were assigned to halogenated formulae while the lignin like region decreased in terms of intensity and number of peaks it is no less true that it accumulated the highest number of new signals highlighting the complex behaviour of the lignin fraction during water chlorination lignin is composed of complex mixtures of polymers based on phenol moieties guaiacyl syringyl and p hydroxyphenylpropane aromatic moieties national research council us safe drinking water committee 1979 the chlorination of which is an importance source of halogenated dbps chuang et al 2015 lyon et al 2014 also observed that fluorescent organic matter corresponding to the parallel factor analysis parafac component c3 showed the highest reactivity to chlorination this component is associated with terrestrial humic like features which include lignin breakdown products degraded lignin and other aromatic intricate molecules in the present work the number of peaks tentatively related to soil derived humics defined in šantl temkiv et al 2013 as h c 1 5 and a i 0 5 also decreased from 2088 133 to 1768 157 p 0 0001 and their average intensity decreased by 65 on another note the number of peaks assigned as lipids like features and condensed hydrocarbon like features also decreased most lipids like signals that had been detected in the original samples 56 6 disappeared after chlorination and 11 0 significantly decreased their abundance p 0 05 similarly 203 condensed hydrocarbon like features disappeared during the treatment a total number of 143 new features appeared in the condensed hydrocarbon like compositional compartment 103 of which halogenated and 22 new signals 17 of which halogenated appeared in the lipid like compartment after chlorination chlorination caused the appearance of several new highly oxidized molecules with o c ratios 0 75 see for example the vk diagram in fig 3 a significant part of which belonged to the tannin like region the average o c ratio of those new formulae was 0 767 0 080 significantly higher p 10 4 than the o c ratio of the other registered tannin like m z 0 717 0 054 in parallel the appearance of features with low h c ratios h c 0 5 was also observed in the present work up to 1061 halogenated formulae were determined table 3 naturally occurring halogenated features were mainly detected in the condensed hydrocarbon like and the lignin like regions 178 and 146 features respectively the number of halogenated features increased as expected after chlorination particularly in the lignin like region 460 new halogenated features up to 657 new halogenated features were identified these halogenated signals are highlighted in the individual vk diagrams of each sample fig s5 and fig s6 for chlorinated and brominated features respectively as it can be seen most of the halogenated features occurring in natural water samples presented an o c ratio lower than 0 5 while a large fraction of the new formulae was significantly more oxidized o c 0 5 the analytical method that was employed in the present work involving spe under vacuum and esi hrms analysis is not able to efficiently capture and detect commonly targeted dbps because of their physicochemical properties i e their typically high vapour pressures and low molecular masses therefore those peaks assigned as halogenated features in the present study likely were related to semivolatile non volatile components fragments of halogenated dom which can occur by progressive halogenations of the α carbon of carbonyl groups for example the haloform reaction morris 1975 the addition of halogens to double bonds ghanbari et al 1983 and the additions to phenol rings gallard and von gunten 2002 3 4 classification of samples by pca in order to better understand the factors that differentiated raw and chlorinated samples a pca model was performed the first two principal components pc1 and pc2 explained 70 9 of the data variance see the main pcs eigenvalues in fig s7 the separation of chlorinated and untreated samples was clear in the score graphs of pc1 vs pc2 fig 4 chlorinated samples were related to low values of pc1 while untreated samples were related to high values of pc1 pc1 was therefore closely related to samples chlorination this pc was correlated with the concentrations of certain substances with the general formula cxhyoz table s3 lists those formulae the abundances of which were more closely correlated to pc1 as can be observed their h c ratios were compressed between 0 75 and 1 14 and their o c ratios ranged from 0 37 to 0 52 this is in agreement with zhang et al 2012 where it was observed that compounds with low degree of oxidation are more reactive toward free chlorine in surface water from shanghai and beijing catchment areas these features located in the lignin like region of the vk diagram presented negligible nitrogen content a dbe c that ranged from 0 50 to 0 69 and an a i 0 38 their dbe c ratio suggests the prevalence of aromatic structures 0 66 dbe c 0 5 and according to their h c ratio and a i they can be tentatively related to soil derived humics h c 1 5 and a i 0 5 as discussed by šantl temkiv et al 2013 however further instrumental analyses should be carried out to unambiguously identify their structure these tentatively identified humic derived lignin like features were highly intercorrelated see fig s8 and sample chlorination decreased their intensity in a statistically significant manner p bh values from 0 0009 to 0 0020 the ter sample exhibited a particularly low abundance of these lignin like features with concentrations of the same order than chlorinated samples which probably justified its clustering in the dendrogram fig s2 3 5 disinfection by products formation potentials and correlation with hrms features the thms and hans fps are detailed in table 1 thms fp ranged from 33 6 to 75 9 μg l 54 14 μg l and hans fp ranged between 1 4 and 5 1 μg l 3 8 1 2 μg l the concentrations of thms were as expected significantly higher than those of hans and followed a relatively close trend thms fp and hans fp correlated with a pearson correlation coefficient of r 0 59 and a spearman s rank correlation coefficient of ρ 0 74 toc was a satisfactory predictor of thms fp r2 0 60 and ρ 0 77 but it was a poor predictor of hans fp r2 0 24 and ρ 0 37 similarly total nitrogen tn inversely correlated with thms fp r2 0 58 and ρ 0 63 but was inadequately correlated with hans fp r2 0 14 and ρ 0 09 these results highlight the need to find more specific descriptors to understand the behaviour of a wider range of halogenated dbps thms fp and hans fp were compared to the intensities of those features that had been detected in at least 7 of the 10 analysed samples a total of 516 peaks were found to be correlated to thms fp ρ 0 625 and 208 of them were strongly correlated ρ 0 795 fig 5 shows the vk diagram with signals being represented as a function of ρ as can be seen the strongly correlated signals were mostly lignin like and or cram features h c ranging from 0 71 to 1 6 and o c ratios ranging from 0 06 to 0 52 these features also presented a very low nitrogen content average n c 0 005 interestingly the formulae in fig 5 strongly correlated to thms fp are similar to those peaks listed in table s3 that in the multivariate analyses were good descriptors of chlorinated raw samples differentiation however while both sets of peaks are similar in composition cxhyoz in h c ratio and in o c ratio only four particular features c13h18o3 c15h14o5 c15h16o5 and c15h20o3 were members of both lists corroborating that the formation of thms is just one of the multiple reactions that affect dom during water chlorination similar to our results hua et al 2015 also observed that the formation of thms and trihaloacetic acids during water chlorination was correlated with suva254 which is related to the presence of uv absorbing molecules containing labile double bonds and aromatic rings also beauchamp et al 2018 found that differential uv absorbance and thms concentrations were correlated with 0 62 r2 0 99 our results suggest that these compounds were particularly located in the lignin like compositional space of the van krevelen s dom on another note the number of features that correlated with hans fp was smaller 60 features were correlated with statistical significance ρ 0 625 and only 5 could be labelled as strongly correlated ρ 0 795 these features are good candidates to be used as predictors of hans fp these peaks were plotted in the lignin like region in a relatively narrow h c vs o c window h c ranging from 1 0 to 1 2 and o c ranging from 0 19 to 0 49 their nitrogen content was significantly high average n c 0 49 which is expected considering that hans are n containing dbps the ternary vk diagrams illustrate the differences in the n c ratios of those features related to thms fp fig s9 and those related to hans fp fig s10 4 conclusions the primary object of this study was to better understand how water chlorination modified the dom fingerprint obtained with hrms our results obtained from 10 different surface water samples showed that water chlorination indeed produced significant changes in the composition of dom and subsequently in their hrms spectra chlorinated samples exhibited signals with smaller m z lower kmd and as expected a higher number of halogenated features these changes were studied at fingerprinting level and from a multivariate analyses perspective significant changes were observed in the regions of the lignin like cram the soil humics and that of the fatty acids like features where several signals disappeared during chlorination as well as in the condensed hydrocarbon region where several new features halogenated and non halogenated were detected in the tannin like region several new features primarily corresponding to highly oxidized formulae were also detected overall these changes sufficed to successfully classifying the analysed samples according to their treatment status raw chlorinated and origin via hierarchical clustering analyses and pca scores in pca it was concluded that sample chlorination related to pc1 primarily involved a decrease in the concentration of non nitrogenized lignin like features up to 28 signals were found to be highly correlated cos2 α 0 95 to sample chlorination all of them with cxhyoz formulae and elemental ratios h c o c characteristic from the ligning like cram compositional space finally we identified two regions of the vk diagram located within the lignin like features that were strongly correlated ρ 0 795 to thms and hans fp to the best of our knowledge the present work is the first to identify surrogates of han generation during chlorination of surface waters recently williams et al 2019 described how removing certain portions of the dom pool in real plant scale significantly decrease the formation potential of individual chlorinated and brominated dbps our study is a promising step towards identifying appropriate surrogates capable of anticipating the risk that chlorination dbps may pose for the final consumer offering a higher selectivity than unspecific techniques such as toc and suva254 measurements moreover this approach may be applied to other relevant families of dbps however with the current results it is not possible to unambiguously affirm that these features correspond to direct precursors of thms and hans further studies should be conducted e g using liquid chromatography coupled to hrms curated libraries and standards to univocally identify compounds and individually test their dbps fp however our results clearly indicate that these two regions of the vk diagram play a crucial role in the formation of the analysed dbps declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

17985,in order to understand and minimize the formation of halogenated disinfection by products dbps it is important to investigate how dissolved organic matter dom contributes to their generation in the present study we analysed the dom profile of water samples from the barcelona catchment area by high resolution mass spectrometry hrms and we studied the changes after chlorination chlorination produced significant changes in the dom decreased the average m z and kendrick mass defect kmd of their spectra and decreased the number and abundance of lignin like features the van krevelen vk fingerprint exhibited several noticeable changes including the appearance of highly oxidized peaks in the tannin like region average o c 0 78 0 08 the appearance of features with low h c and the disappearance of more than half of the lipids like features up to 657 halogenated peaks were generated during sample chlorination most of which in the condensed hydrocarbons like and the lignin like region of the vk diagram around 200 features were found to be strongly correlated ρ 0 795 to the formation potential of trihalomethanes thms and 5 were correlated with the formation potential of haloacetonitrile hans they all were plotted in the lignin fraction of the vk diagram but both groups of features exhibited different nitrogen content those features related to hans fp had at least one nitrogen atoms in their structures whilst those related to thms did not graphical abstract image 1 keywords high resolution mass spectrometry water chlorination dissolved organic matter disinfection by products van krevelen diagram dbp formation potential 1 introduction water chlorination is an efficient and cost effective method for removing pathogens related to waterborne diseases such as typhoid fevers cholera botulism and dysentery its introduction in the early 20th century epa us 2000 leal et al 1909 traube 1894 is regarded as a major turning point in the history of water management notwithstanding the sanitary benefits of water chlorination the addition of disinfectants to water triggers the generation of a myriad of disinfection by products dbps some of which are carcinogenic and may cause several toxicological effects after chronic consumption even at trace levels font ribera et al 2018 villanueva et al 2015 subsequently the occurrence of halogenated dbps derived from water chlorination is an emerging concern and several regulations have been enacted at domestic and supranational level to minimize the exposure of population to them chinese department of health 2006 commission 1998 european parliament 2000 nhmrc and nrmmc 2011 us epa 2006 1998 brominated and chlorinated trihalomethanes tribromo trichloro bromodichloro and dibromochloromethane also known as thms have attracted the most attention of both academia and regulatory agencies but the list of identified halogenated dbps contains hundreds of molecules from families as diverse as haloacetic acids haloacetonitriles haloketones haloaldehydes halonitromethanes and haloacetamides among others richardson et al 2008 recently the use of non target analyses has revealed the existence of a high number of previously unknown halogenated dbps in drinking water richardson and ternes 2018 high resolution mass spectrometry hrms and ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry uhrms analyses have contributed to determine their elemental composition through highly accurate m z measurements zhang et al 2014 2012 zhang and yang 2018 adsorbable organic halides aox analyses often report the presence of a significant number of halogenated substances the structures of which are yet to be elucidated hua and reckhow observed that only 45 of the total aox could be explained by the presence of thms trihaloacetic acids and dihaloacetic acids hua and reckhow 2007 while yeh et al observed that the percentage of aox that could be justified by the occurrence of targeted dbps was rather variable 35 118 in swimming pool water yeh et al 2014 finally an unsettled amount of dbps halogenated or not may be generated during water chlorination without being detectable by aox or by conventional extraction and detection methods direct measurements of target dbp are undoubtedly useful however the prediction of the dbp formation potential fp is equally important particularly in those cases when adjusting the disinfection parameters is viable in this regard the characterization of dissolved organic matter dom has proved to be a promising tool several dom properties are closely related to the occurrence of dbp precursors such as thms and or can be used as descriptors for predicting their fps this includes dom s spectroscopic properties i e ultraviolet absorbance at λ 254 nm or suva254 hua et al 2015 and fluorescent signal roccaro et al 2009 its composition e g the presence of protein like organic matter chu et al 2010 aromatic moieties hua et al 2015 and suspended particulate matter hou et al 2018 and the bulk concentration of dom which can be accounted as total organic carbon toc lee et al 2009 or as dissolved organic carbon doc peng et al 2016 commonly predictive models are multi parametrical and contemplate a wide range of physicochemical conditions i e the concentrations of halide ions or the ph as well as chlorination parameters the reaction time the temperature the reagent dose etc sohn et al 2004 however these models mostly rely on a reduced number of selected dbp target methods can hardly cover the quantitative analysis of the whole set of dbps generated during water chlorination because of i the large number of identified dbps ii the elevated costs of obtaining high purity standards for all of them and iii the presence of unknown dbps therefore the risk of dbps formation should be addressed using more holistic approaches such as non target analyses based on hrms the advances in mass spectrometry ms have allowed the identification of individual components of dom which is one of the most heterogeneous mixtures in the environment woods et al 2009 high field strength fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance ms fticr ms is capable of unravelling complex dom mixtures across aquatic systems kellerman et al 2014 riedel et al 2016 and orbitrap ms has proven to be a valid alternative as it also is capable of detecting subtle changes in dom profiles despite of being able to assign fewer features due to its lower m z resolution power farré et al 2019 hawkes et al 2018 2016 patriarca et al 2018 yuthawong et al 2019 the hrms study of dom is often complemented with graphical representations fingerprinting such as van krevelen vk diagrams and kendrick mass defect kmd plots which assist in the visualization interpretation and comparison of dom profiles andersson et al 2019 kim et al 2003 lavonen et al 2013 the objective of the present study was to investigate the changes of the dom after water chlorination from a multivariate analysis perspective and exploring the changes in their fingerprint obtained with orbitrap ms in order to i understand which regions of the fingerprints were more susceptible to changes during disinfection reactions and ii to identify surrogate features to help predicting dbp formation to this aim we extracted and analysed the dom of ten surface water samples from barcelona catchment area dom was isolated by solid phase extraction spe and analysed by hrms instrumental analyses were conducted before and after lab scale chlorination tests in order to track the changes in the dom the method was finally validated by investigating the correlation between m z features and the concentrations of two families of halogenated dbps thms and haloacetonitriles hans chosen because of their

were taken from the ter river itself and from the three reservoirs sau susqueda and pasteral 169 hm3 233 hm3 and 2 hm3 respectively these reservoirs are relevant for the barcelona metropolitan area as they supply around 170 hm3 drinking water agència catalana de l aigua 2015 through interbasin water transfer and present certain differences in term of morphology trophic state and residence time with sau being the most eutrophic water body of the reservoirs chain all of which may have a potential impact in the nature and concentration of dbp precursors samples were taken at the specified depth see table 1 in amber glass bottles letting no head space the bottles were immediately refrigerated and transported to the laboratory where they were processed within 24 h following the general procedure schematized in fig 2 and described in the following sections 2 3 batch chlorination experiments the dbp fp was assessed following a modified version of the standard method apha 2005 to obtain between 1 and 3 mg l of residual free chlorine after 24 h of contact time as described in previous studies de vera et al 2015 doederer et al 2014 liu et al 2016 once determined the specific chlorine dose was added to a 250 ml head space free glass bottle the bottle was capped and stored in an incubator in the dark at 25 c for 24 h the residual chlorine was measured with a photometric cuvette test kit lck 310 hach lange gmbh düsseldorf germany after measuring their chlorine content and quenching them with ascorbic acid samples were extracted for dbp analysis see text s1 in the supporting information and for dom characterization see section 2 4 2 4 extraction of ppl dom raw and quenched chlorinated samples were processed following the same protocol aliquots of each sample were filtered through 0 7 μm mesh size glass fibre filters and extracted by spe according to the method described elsewhere dittmar and koch 2006 with minor modifications as previously implemented in farré et al 2019 briefly 250 ml of filtered sample were acidified to ph 2 0 by adding formic acid drop by drop and were extracted with a ppl cartridge 500 mg 3 ml these cartridges contain a styrene divinylbenzene polymeric phase modified with a non polar surface recent studies have shown that ppl cartridges are found among the most efficient sorbents for dom components enabling a broad coverage of dom constituents in one single collection while avoiding substantial leaching li et al 2017 and they have been extensively applied to extract and characterize dom from several water matrices arakawa et al 2017 farré et al 2019 li et al 2016 prior to the extraction cartridges were washed thrice with 1 0 ml of methanol and were soaked overnight with 1 0 ml of methanol after being conditioned the cartridges were washed with one volume of formic acid 0 1 v v then samples were loaded under vacuum at approx 2 ml min salts were rinsed off with 3 0 ml of formic acid 0 1 v v and cartridges were dried under vacuum for 15 min finally the elution was carried out with 2 00 ml of methanol the extracts were collected in previously tared liquid chromatography lc vials 500 μl of the methanolic extracts were diluted 1 1 with ultrapure water and stored at 20 c until their instrumental analysis procedural blanks consisting of 250 1 ml of ultrapure water were filtered and extracted following the same protocol and in parallel with real samples analyses quenched chlorination blanks were also processed 2 5 instrumental analysis of organic matter analyses were carried out by hrms using a ltq velos from thermo scientific san josé ca usa using a hybrid linear ion trap orbitrap analyser extracts of blanks raw samples and chlorinated samples were infused into the mass spectrometer at a flow of 8 μl min the ionisation was performed with an electrospray ionisation esi source operating in negative polarity the instrumental parameters were set as follows the capillary voltage was set at 3 1 kv the capillary and the source heater temperatures were maintained at 275 c and 45 c respectively the sheath gas and the auxiliary gas flows were set at 28 and 5 a u while the sweep gas flow was turned off 300 scans were acquired for every sample spectra were acquired in full scan mode with a resolution of 100 000 da fwhm and a m z range of 100 1000 the following signals were used as lock masses for internal calibration during spectra acquisition m z 369 08272 c16h17o10 m z 397 11402 c18h21o10 and m z 423 12967 c20h23o10 2 6 data treatment determination of elemental compositions and fingerprinting an averaged spectrum of each sample was obtained using the software xcalibur 2 2 thermo scientific spectra were exported as excel workbook format files and processed with a custom script in r v 3 5 using the rstudio environment v 1 1 463 r tools technology the elemental compositions of the spectral signals were tentatively determined with functions from the r package mfassignr schum et al 2019 the workflow is fully described in the supporting information text s2 briefly m z signals were assigned to elemental formulae chon0 5s0 2cl0 2br0 2 using the function mfassignr mfassign with the following restrictions maximum tolerable m z error 1 0 ppm m z range 100 1000 charge only monocharged formulae were considered range of o c 0 1 0 range of h c 0 3 2 5 range of dbeo 1 10 the presence of features with 32s 35cl or 79br atoms was double checked by searching isotopologues containing 34s 37cl and 81br respectively the experimental 37cl 35cl 34s 32s and 81br 79br ratios were compared to natural isotopic ratios as detailed in text s2 the final list of formulae was represented in vk diagrams based on their o c h c and n c ratios they were classified in predefined categories according to their location in the vk diagram these classification criteria detailed in table s1 have been accepted in a multitude of recent dom studies although it should be noted that they may not fully describe the structural diversity of the peaks that are contained in each compositional space and it should be stressed that further structural elucidation should be performed to identify each substance and to unambiguously classify it schymanski et al 2014 the aromaticity index ai of each formula was calculated according to equation 1 koch and dittmar 2006 1 a i 1 c o s 0 5 h c o s n p the double bound equivalent dbe normalized by the number of carbons was calculated according to equation 2 melendez perez et al 2016 2 d b e c 1 0 5 2 c h n c masses were transformed to kendrick mass km values by normalizing their iupac 12c based mass by 1 0011178 kmch2 1 0000000 kendrick 1963 then kmd were calculated as in equation 3 hughey et al 2001 and kmd plots were presented 3 k m d k m k m where km and km stand for the kendrick mass km and the truncated kendrick mass values respectively 2 7 data treatment descriptive statistics and multivariate analyses statistics and multivariate analyses were performed using the r packages vegan oksanen et al 2019 stats r core team 2019 and factominer lê et al 2008 among others the data normality was checked using shapiro wilk tests and the null hypothesis h0 was rejected when p 0 05 differences among raw samples and chlorinated samples were investigated using paired difference tests non normally distributed data was assessed with wilcoxon signed ranks tests while paired student s t tests were applied to normal datasets in both cases differences were considered significant at p values 0 05 in multiple comparisons p values were corrected using the bonferroni holm method p bh a matrix was built containing the total set of formulae assigned in raw and chlorinated samples and their spectral abundances multivariate analyses principal component analysis pca were carried out in order to elucidate trends among samples and to identify those features that better distinguished chlorinated from raw samples correlation among variables and principal components pc was quantified as the square cosine of their angle in the loading graph which may range from 0 α 90 orthogonal totally uncorrelated to 1 α 0 parallel perfectly correlated the dissimilarity among samples was explored using the function vegan vegdist and represented with hierarchical clustering dendrograms stats heatmap the statistical dependence between thms hans and the hrms formulae were assessed in terms of spearman s rank correlation only those formulae that had been detected in 70 of the samples were considered those pairs of variables that were correlated with spearman s rank coefficients ρ 0 625 and ρ 0 795 were considered to be statistically correlated and strongly correlated respectively these thresholds imply correlations with statistical significances of approximately p 5 00 10 2 and p 5 00 10 3 respectively according to equation 4 4 t ρ n 2 1 ρ 2 where n is the number of observations and t is the student s t statistic which is justified by the permutation argument kendall and stuart 1969 2 8 additional precautions and safety considerations in order to avoid sample contamination all the lab glassware employed in these experiments had been thoroughly cleaned as follows i washed with detergent ii immersed in nitric acid bath hno3 10 v v overnight iii rinsed with ultrapure water iv rinsed with acetone and v thoroughly dried with nitrogen experiments were carried out under extraction fume 3 results and discussion 3 1 data treatment and study of samples by hierarchical clustering analysis table 2 summarises the main characteristics of the infused spectra distinguishing raw samples from chlorinated ones as can be seen the infusion of the raw extracts offered spectra with 85 000 3000 peaks most of which approx 90 were found to be noise and low intensity artefacts once cleaned up spectra presented an average number of monoisotopic signals of 6800 200 this value was relatively constant through the different samples and no significant trends were observed linking the number of signals and the sampling point or the depth of the water column peaks were tentatively assigned to empirical formulae using a custom r script text s2 a matrix was built containing the detected features and their respective abundance in each sample samples were classified according to their dissimilarity by measuring their cao dissimilarity index cyd cao et al 1997 the resulting dendrogram fig s1 satisfactorily grouped samples according to their two main characteristics matrix river or reservoir water and water body ter river sau susqueda and pasteral once the chlorinated samples were introduced into the model fig s2 the type of treatment raw or chlorinated sample became the primary factor that drove the clustering this highlights that water chlorination had a decisive impact in the elemental composition of dom 3 2 effects of chlorination to organic matter spectra and its kmd as can be seen in table 2 the number of signals detected by esi significantly increased after chlorination p 0 0003 from 8475 297 to 9559 721 accordingly the number of peaks corresponding to monocharged molecules fragments with exclusively 12c atoms increased from 6832 235 to 8418 247 p 10 4 in parallel the average intensity of these peaks decreased significantly ratio 0 71 p 0 0003 more precisely their average m z weighted by intensity decreased from m z 361 9 to 345 15 p 0 0051 these changes imply the breakage of larger molecules to create smaller less intense transformation products which can be attributed to miscellaneous oxidative degradation reactions of dom kmd plots corroborated a decrease in the average molecular mass of the spectra after chlorination the number of peaks with m z 600 was lower after chlorination as it is exemplified in fig 3 which shows the kmd plots of the pasteral extracts and the dataset was compressed in a narrower m z window this behaviour was observed in the whole set of kmd plots which are collected in fig s3 in the supporting information in parallel the average kmd and the intensity averaged kmd decreased significantly p 0 0051 and p 0 0093 after chlorination as a general rule low kmd values can be related to hydrogen poorer molecules e g aromatic compounds to the detriment of aliphatic molecules nikolic 2011 and more oxidized molecules see table s2 from a mechanistic point of view this can be justified by the oxidation of hydroxyls to carbonyls which produces aldehydes and ketones from primary and secondary alcohols respectively deborde and von gunten 2008 hu et al 2003 kmd can also decrease as a result of the hydrolysis of ketones which produces highly oxidized molecules such as monohydroxyl acetone dihydroxyl acetone and ultimately lactate finally a decrease in the kmd can be justified because of the introduction of halogens to the molecular structure 3 3 determination of elemental composition and effects of chlorination on the vk regions the dom profiles of every sample were fingerprinted building vk diagrams based on the o c and h c ratios of each identified formulae fig s4 in the supplementary information collects the whole set of vk diagrams detailing the intensity and m z of each feature with the size and colour of the scattered points vk diagrams were used to automatically classify the detected features in vk compositional spaces defined by their o c and h c ratios fig 3 shows a vk diagram of pasteral s surface water raw and chlorinated extracts on the left and right respectively with their compositional spaces clearly delimited table 3 summarises the relative abundances and behaviour of the features according to their location in the vk diagram the group of features placed in the lignin like features region was the most abundant in the analysed samples 3532 peaks belonged to this compositional space equivalent to 73 of the total number of signals which can be expected in common natural surface waters with no significant anthropogenic pressure in freshwater dom s vk diagram this compositional space is shared by lignin related molecules and esi fragments and signals related to carboxyl rich alicyclic molecules cram lam et al 2007 among other organic substances with the same compositional characteristics the number of features assigned to this region decreased both in absolute and in relative terms after chlorination 1005 signals corresponding to lignin like signals decreased their intensity according to wilcoxon signed rank tests or paired student s t tests p 0 05 and 1225 signals disappeared completely the abundances of 606 lignin like features were unaltered only 91 features increased their concentrations and finally 665 new lignin like peaks appeared after chlorination among the latter 460 were assigned to halogenated formulae while the lignin like region decreased in terms of intensity and number of peaks it is no less true that it accumulated the highest number of new signals highlighting the complex behaviour of the lignin fraction during water chlorination lignin is composed of complex mixtures of polymers based on phenol moieties guaiacyl syringyl and p hydroxyphenylpropane aromatic moieties national research council us safe drinking water committee 1979 the chlorination of which is an importance source of halogenated dbps chuang et al 2015 lyon et al 2014 also observed that fluorescent organic matter corresponding to the parallel factor analysis parafac component c3 showed the highest reactivity to chlorination this component is associated with terrestrial humic like features which include lignin breakdown products degraded lignin and other aromatic intricate molecules in the present work the number of peaks tentatively related to soil derived humics defined in šantl temkiv et al 2013 as h c 1 5 and a i 0 5 also decreased from 2088 133 to 1768 157 p 0 0001 and their average intensity decreased by 65 on another note the number of peaks assigned as lipids like features and condensed hydrocarbon like features also decreased most lipids like signals that had been detected in the original samples 56 6 disappeared after chlorination and 11 0 significantly decreased their abundance p 0 05 similarly 203 condensed hydrocarbon like features disappeared during the treatment a total number of 143 new features appeared in the condensed hydrocarbon like compositional compartment 103 of which halogenated and 22 new signals 17 of which halogenated appeared in the lipid like compartment after chlorination chlorination caused the appearance of several new highly oxidized molecules with o c ratios 0 75 see for example the vk diagram in fig 3 a significant part of which belonged to the tannin like region the average o c ratio of those new formulae was 0 767 0 080 significantly higher p 10 4 than the o c ratio of the other registered tannin like m z 0 717 0 054 in parallel the appearance of features with low h c ratios h c 0 5 was also observed in the present work up to 1061 halogenated formulae were determined table 3 naturally occurring halogenated features were mainly detected in the condensed hydrocarbon like and the lignin like regions 178 and 146 features respectively the number of halogenated features increased as expected after chlorination particularly in the lignin like region 460 new halogenated features up to 657 new halogenated features were identified these halogenated signals are highlighted in the individual vk diagrams of each sample fig s5 and fig s6 for chlorinated and brominated features respectively as it can be seen most of the halogenated features occurring in natural water samples presented an o c ratio lower than 0 5 while a large fraction of the new formulae was significantly more oxidized o c 0 5 the analytical method that was employed in the present work involving spe under vacuum and esi hrms analysis is not able to efficiently capture and detect commonly targeted dbps because of their physicochemical properties i e their typically high vapour pressures and low molecular masses therefore those peaks assigned as halogenated features in the present study likely were related to semivolatile non volatile components fragments of halogenated dom which can occur by progressive halogenations of the α carbon of carbonyl groups for example the haloform reaction morris 1975 the addition of halogens to double bonds ghanbari et al 1983 and the additions to phenol rings gallard and von gunten 2002 3 4 classification of samples by pca in order to better understand the factors that differentiated raw and chlorinated samples a pca model was performed the first two principal components pc1 and pc2 explained 70 9 of the data variance see the main pcs eigenvalues in fig s7 the separation of chlorinated and untreated samples was clear in the score graphs of pc1 vs pc2 fig 4 chlorinated samples were related to low values of pc1 while untreated samples were related to high values of pc1 pc1 was therefore closely related to samples chlorination this pc was correlated with the concentrations of certain substances with the general formula cxhyoz table s3 lists those formulae the abundances of which were more closely correlated to pc1 as can be observed their h c ratios were compressed between 0 75 and 1 14 and their o c ratios ranged from 0 37 to 0 52 this is in agreement with zhang et al 2012 where it was observed that compounds with low degree of oxidation are more reactive toward free chlorine in surface water from shanghai and beijing catchment areas these features located in the lignin like region of the vk diagram presented negligible nitrogen content a dbe c that ranged from 0 50 to 0 69 and an a i 0 38 their dbe c ratio suggests the prevalence of aromatic structures 0 66 dbe c 0 5 and according to their h c ratio and a i they can be tentatively related to soil derived humics h c 1 5 and a i 0 5 as discussed by šantl temkiv et al 2013 however further instrumental analyses should be carried out to unambiguously identify their structure these tentatively identified humic derived lignin like features were highly intercorrelated see fig s8 and sample chlorination decreased their intensity in a statistically significant manner p bh values from 0 0009 to 0 0020 the ter sample exhibited a particularly low abundance of these lignin like features with concentrations of the same order than chlorinated samples which probably justified its clustering in the dendrogram fig s2 3 5 disinfection by products formation potentials and correlation with hrms features the thms and hans fps are detailed in table 1 thms fp ranged from 33 6 to 75 9 μg l 54 14 μg l and hans fp ranged between 1 4 and 5 1 μg l 3 8 1 2 μg l the concentrations of thms were as expected significantly higher than those of hans and followed a relatively close trend thms fp and hans fp correlated with a pearson correlation coefficient of r 0 59 and a spearman s rank correlation coefficient of ρ 0 74 toc was a satisfactory predictor of thms fp r2 0 60 and ρ 0 77 but it was a poor predictor of hans fp r2 0 24 and ρ 0 37 similarly total nitrogen tn inversely correlated with thms fp r2 0 58 and ρ 0 63 but was inadequately correlated with hans fp r2 0 14 and ρ 0 09 these results highlight the need to find more specific descriptors to understand the behaviour of a wider range of halogenated dbps thms fp and hans fp were compared to the intensities of those features that had been detected in at least 7 of the 10 analysed samples a total of 516 peaks were found to be correlated to thms fp ρ 0 625 and 208 of them were strongly correlated ρ 0 795 fig 5 shows the vk diagram with signals being represented as a function of ρ as can be seen the strongly correlated signals were mostly lignin like and or cram features h c ranging from 0 71 to 1 6 and o c ratios ranging from 0 06 to 0 52 these features also presented a very low nitrogen content average n c 0 005 interestingly the formulae in fig 5 strongly correlated to thms fp are similar to those peaks listed in table s3 that in the multivariate analyses were good descriptors of chlorinated raw samples differentiation however while both sets of peaks are similar in composition cxhyoz in h c ratio and in o c ratio only four particular features c13h18o3 c15h14o5 c15h16o5 and c15h20o3 were members of both lists corroborating that the formation of thms is just one of the multiple reactions that affect dom during water chlorination similar to our results hua et al 2015 also observed that the formation of thms and trihaloacetic acids during water chlorination was correlated with suva254 which is related to the presence of uv absorbing molecules containing labile double bonds and aromatic rings also beauchamp et al 2018 found that differential uv absorbance and thms concentrations were correlated with 0 62 r2 0 99 our results suggest that these compounds were particularly located in the lignin like compositional space of the van krevelen s dom on another note the number of features that correlated with hans fp was smaller 60 features were correlated with statistical significance ρ 0 625 and only 5 could be labelled as strongly correlated ρ 0 795 these features are good candidates to be used as predictors of hans fp these peaks were plotted in the lignin like region in a relatively narrow h c vs o c window h c ranging from 1 0 to 1 2 and o c ranging from 0 19 to 0 49 their nitrogen content was significantly high average n c 0 49 which is expected considering that hans are n containing dbps the ternary vk diagrams illustrate the differences in the n c ratios of those features related to thms fp fig s9 and those related to hans fp fig s10 4 conclusions the primary object of this study was to better understand how water chlorination modified the dom fingerprint obtained with hrms our results obtained from 10 different surface water samples showed that water chlorination indeed produced significant changes in the composition of dom and subsequently in their hrms spectra chlorinated samples exhibited signals with smaller m z lower kmd and as expected a higher number of halogenated features these changes were studied at fingerprinting level and from a multivariate analyses perspective significant changes were observed in the regions of the lignin like cram the soil humics and that of the fatty acids like features where several signals disappeared during chlorination as well as in the condensed hydrocarbon region where several new features halogenated and non halogenated were detected in the tannin like region several new features primarily corresponding to highly oxidized formulae were also detected overall these changes sufficed to successfully classifying the analysed samples according to their treatment status raw chlorinated and origin via hierarchical clustering analyses and pca scores in pca it was concluded that sample chlorination related to pc1 primarily involved a decrease in the concentration of non nitrogenized lignin like features up to 28 signals were found to be highly correlated cos2 α

consumer offering a higher selectivity than unspecific techniques such as toc and suva254 measurements moreover this approach may be applied to other relevant families of dbps however with the current results it is not possible to unambiguously affirm that these features correspond to direct precursors of thms and hans further studies should be conducted e g using liquid chromatography coupled to

fouling which causes frequent chemical cleaning and ultimately shortens membrane lifespan remains as a challenge in mbrs matin et al 2011 le clech et al 2006 biofouling due to unwanted deposition growth and metabolism of microorganisms on membrane surfaces and or inside membrane pores is considered as a thorny issue limiting applications of mbrs deng et al 2016 zhang et al 2016a membrane surface properties have a great impact on biofouling behaviors and an attractive strategy for biofouling control is to construct antibiofouling membrane surface that can inhibit bacterial proliferation and retard biofilm formation zhang et al 2016a zodrow et al 2009 recently the combination of polymeric materials with silver nanoparticles agnps has attracted much attention in membrane fabrication due to their strong disinfection capability yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2012a the membranes are usually fabricated by incorporating agnps in the membrane directly or immobilizing agnps on membrane surfaces ben sasson et al 2014 yin et al 2013 he et al 2017 huang et al 2016 however the uncontrollable release of agnps often leads to a fast loss of antibacterial ability and thus a short lifetime of agnps yin and dang 2015 huang et al 2014 to tackle these problems extensive efforts have been dedicated to developing nanomaterials to immobilize agnps and improve antimicrobial efficiency

cycle the fouled membranes were removed from the mbr for further investigation the amount of solids biofilm deposited on membrane surface was determined according to the procedure in the literature wang et al 2014 quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction qrt pcr was employed to characterize the total amount of bacteria on the membrane surface zhang et al 2009 the primers for

on an illumina miseq platform using the procedures documented in si section s2 based on the miseq system quick reference guide 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane characterization sem images fig 1 a c exhibit the surface morphology of pristine membrane m0 ag silica nanopollens modified membrane asnp m and ag silica nanospheres modified membrane asns m in fig 1b spherical ag silica nanospheres with uniform size 300 nm were homogeneously distributed over the membrane surface for the asnp m ag silica nanopollens which have numerous spikes on their surface can be clearly observed fig 1c fig s3a presents wide scan xps elemental survey spectra of m0 asns m and asnp m presence of si 2p and ag 3d peaks was observed in asns m and asnp m the o 1s spectrum of asns m and asnp m figs s3b and c showed a wide peak which could be fitted into three peaks the binding energy at 532 0 ev 531 8 ev and 532 0 ev for asns m and asnp m respectively was attributed to the crystal lattice oxygen of silica si o si and the peak at 533 0 ev 533 0 ev and 533 2 ev for asns m and asnp m respectively was assigned to surface hydroxyl groups of silica si o h zhang et al 2012b the existence of si o h suggests that there might be spare active sites for more ag reduction which could increase the loading capacity of silver nanoparticles it is noteworthy that the electrons of ionic cations could be held closer to oxygen ions compared to that of covalent cations leading to the signal appearing at lower binding energy pawlak et al 2002 the peak with the lower binding energy at 530 4 ev for both asns m and asnp m was observed which might be ascribed to the formation of si o ag through the reduction of ag on the surface of silica vasil kov et al 2018 meanwhile the ag 3d spectrum of asns m and asnp m is shown in figs s3d and e it can be seen that the ag 3d curves for asns m and asnp m could be deconvoluted into four peaks the gap of 6 0 ev between the two states ag 3d5 2 and ag 3d3 2 indicates the presence of metallic ag kang et al 2014 duan et al 2017 furthermore the ag 3d binding energy be appeared at a lower value i e 366 2 372 2 ev and 366 0 372 0 ev for asns m and asnp m respectively compared to the metallic ag be of ag 3d for metallic ag is about 368 2 374 2 ev suggesting successful binding of agnps with sio2 das et al 2013a the other two peaks with a distance of 6 2 ev were observed at the region of ag 3d5 2 and 3d3 2 respectively which might be associated with si o ag due to the positively charged silver ions on the surface of the agnps bound to the anionic oxygen of the silica surface zhang et al 2012b the introduction of ag silica changed the contact angle fig 1d from 75 1 1 9 m0 to 63 6 1 9 asns m and 62 7 0 7 asnp m which was attributed to the hydrophilic nature of silica as well as agnps prabhawathi et al 2012 yang et al 2014 compared to asns m surface hydrophilicity of asnp m was slightly enhanced likely due to more hydroxyl groups exposed on the surface of the silica nanopollens song et al 2016 in consistent with the hydrophilicity ag silica modified membranes enhanced water permeability fig 1e the incorporation of ag silica nanospheres increased water flux from 46 8 4 5 l m2 h m0 to 54 9 4 0 l m2 h and the ag silica nanopollens further improved water flux reaching 58 0 6 4 l m2 h due to its special morphology zeta potential of ag silica membrane surface as revealed by fig 1f was also slightly changed 33 0 mv for asns m asnp m compared to 30 mv for m0 attributed to the coverage of the membrane surface by the negatively charged silica nanoparticles 3 2 batch tests of ag ions release ag ions release is a major pathway for the bactericidal effects of agnps liu et al 2010 tian et al 2014 richter et al 2015 therefore enhanced agnps loading capacity as well as controlled ag ions release is of great importance to achieve sustainable membrane biofouling mitigation according to the results from icp ms experiments fig 2 a asnp m exhibited much higher original loading capacity of 107 7 10 9 μg ag cm2 compared to asns m 63 7 3 7 μg ag cm2 this should be associated with the larger surface area of silica nanopollens compared to silica nanospheres resulting in higher loading mass of ag on ag silica nanopollens 213 4 44 8 mg ag g sio2 than that on ag silica nanospheres 138 6 24 9 mg ag g sio2 to characterize the nature of porous structure n2 sorption analysis of silica nanoparticles and silica nanopollens was conducted the n2 adsorption and desorption isotherm of silica nanopollens fig s4 shows a typical type iv isotherm with a major capillary condensation step at a relative pressure p p 0 around 0 8 while no obvious hysteresis loop is observed for silica nanoparticles the surface area and corresponding pore structure of the synthesized silica nanopollens and silica nanoparticles are shown in si table s2 compared to silica nanoparticles silica nanopollens exhibited 550 and 750 increase in surface area and total pore volume respectively which might be attributed to the enlarged porous space between spikes as well as collapsed hollow cavities various of silica nanoparticles with higher porosity could serve as stable and efficient vector for biocides loading das et al 2013b tian et al 2014 compared to silica nanoparticles silica nanopollens could provide more sites for agnps growth during the fabrication process resulting in higher original agnps loading capacity of asnp m fig 2b presents silver release behaviors of the modified membranes and the results were also confirmed by mass balance analysis asns m exhibited significantly faster initial ag release in the first 4 d leading to a small portion of the loaded ag 33 remaining after 34 d exposure fig 2a in contrast the asnp m had a slower release rate with 78 ag on the membrane after 34 d soaking which was attributed to the accessible inner cavity of mesostructured of silica nanopollens favorable for controlling the ag release song et al 2016 2018 after 14 d exposure period ag release rate of the both modified membranes reached a stable and similar value 0 5 μg cm2 d it can be also observed that asnp m showed efficient antibacterial efficiency against e coli and s aureus fig 2c and d fig s5 asnp m exhibited a persistent antibacterial activity against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria after more than 20 d exposure fig 2c and d in comparison the antimicrobial capability of asns m was dramatically decreased indicating that the antibacterial effectiveness of asnp m was higher than that of asns m at approximately similar ag release rate in addition although ag m had the similar ag loading mass 129 42 μg cm2 to asnp m ag m showed lower antibacterial efficiency after 7 d exposure compared to asnp m fig s6 suggesting that the incorporation of silica nanopollens contributed to the long term antibacterial efficiency for silver modified membranes in this study silica nanopollens could potentially puncture bacterial cell membrane via needle like topology due to more contacting opportunities imparted by the presence of numerous spikes on silica nanopollens the loaded agnps on the nanopollens could dissolve to release a flow of ag into the cell within a short diffusional distance resulting in an increase in ag concentration in the biological cells the special agnps immobilization pattern and its associated controlled ag release ensure a long term effectiveness against biofouling for asnp m 3 3 mbr performance m0 asns m asnp m membranes were operated in the same bioreactor to examine the long term antibiofouling behaviors and ensure that all three types of membranes encountered the same operating conditions and mixed liquor due to the sludge bulking fig s7 the operation cycle of all the membranes was shortened in the last 30 d fig 3 a shows the evolution of tmp of membranes as a function of operation time in line with the results of batch test in section 3 2 asnp m exhibited a much better biofouling mitigation over the operation process the tmp increase rate of asnp m 0 88 0 34 kpa d was much lower than that of m0 2 32 0 86 kpa d and asns m 2 25 1 28 kpa d during the long term operation therefore using silica nanopollens as a nanocarrier matrix for agnps can effectively enhance silver loading and retard the depletion rate of ag in the membranes which could extend the anti biofouling performance pollutant removal was monitored to verify whether ag silica modified membrane can affect microbial metabolism in the bulk solution since agnps is capable of inhibiting microbial growth by leaching ag at high silver concentrations 100 ppb wastewater treatment process can be adversely impacted sukhorukova et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 liang et al 2010 it can be seen from fig 3b and c that the effluent cod and nh4 n was 24 5 14 5 mg l and 0 1 0 06 mg l respectively achieving successful pollutant removal this indicates that ag release from ag silica modified membranes did not have obvious influences on organic matter metabolism and nitrification 3 4 antifouling mechanisms visualization of the foulants on the membrane surface was conducted using clsm to elucidate the antibiofouling mechanisms of ag silica nanopollens modified membranes fig 4 a shows that m0 surface was almost completely covered with live microbial cells with almost no dead bacteria with representative top view of membranes shown in fig s8 in contrast the relative abundance of cells in the biofilm of asnp m was quite low and more than half were dead cells indicating that the asnp m substantially inhibited microbial adhesion and killed bacteria attached on membrane surface through effective ag release moreover most cells in biofilm on asns m were live attributed to the faster ag release from the ag silica nanopollens samples as discussed in section 3 2 which cannot achieve sustainable surface concentration of ag for a long term antibiofouling performance on the other hand the lower loading agnps capacity fig 2a is another reason likely causing the inefficiency in inactivating bacteria for asns m during long term operation fig 4b indicates the abundance of 16s rrna genes in the biofilm of three types of membranes the abundance of amplified dna product as revealed by qrt pcr is positively correlated with cell counting zhang et al 2009 as shown in fig 4b the amount of bacteria was substantially reduced when ag silica nanopollens were incorporated into membrane matrix the measurement of solids biomass of the cake layers of all the membranes table s3 further confirmed the antibiofouling effects i e a lower amount of volatile suspended solids for the biofilm of asnp m 1 5 0 4 mg cm2 surface compared to that of m0 2 8 1 0 mg cm2 and asns m 1 8 1 1 mg cm2 to further reveal biofilm properties qcm d analysis was used to evaluate the interaction between foulants and membrane surface as well as its viscoelastic properties gutman et al 2013 frequency shifts f after introducing membrane foulants are presented in fig 4c with the evolution of frequency shown in fig s9 the frequency shift has positive correlations with adhesion capability of foulants ying et al 2010 the foulant on the asnp m membrane surface had highest value of f compared to that of m0 and asns m indicating that only those foulants with strong adhesive characteristics could attach onto the asnp m membrane surface the foulants with strong adhesive properties might be attributed to cellular contents release due to agnps induced cell death zheng et al 2018 the ratio δd δf reflects the structural information of absorbed layer on the qcm d sensor i e its viscous or elastic nature gutman et al 2013 olsson et al 2010 fig 4c exhibits that the extracted foulant layers of asnp m are more fluid favorable for fouling compared to that of asns m and m0 confirming that only these foulants with stronger fouling propensity were accessible to asnp m membrane pores contreras et al 2011 sweity et al 2011 these results indicate that the incorporation of agnps and silica nanopollens affects the structure of fouling layer 3 5 bacterial community of the biofilm formed on membrane surfaces the fouling layers were scraped off from the fouled membrane modules for microbial community analysis using illumina mesiq the foulants samples at the end of 3rd 2nd and 1st operation cycle of m0 asns m and asnp m were chosen to discern the differences in bacterial communities on membrane surface which were collected at almost the same period 49 d 52 d and 48 d of operation time of m0 asns m and asnp m respectively to avoid the impact of evolution of microbial community of mbr system on the foulants following overlapping and quality control 111 961 sequence amplicons in the v3 v4 region were obtained for three membrane foulants samples table s4 it is obvious that the otus ace chao1 and shannon values of foulants sample collected from asns m surface were the lowest while the sample from asnp m had the highest values in the diversity estimators as mentioned above according to previous literature wang et al 2017 hu et al 2015 the decrease of microbial community diversity on agnps modified membrane might be attributed to the influences of ag release however ag silica nanopollens modification did not adversely affect the bacterial diversity on the membrane surface mainly due to its controlled ag release largely avoiding an acute strike of ag to bacterial cells on the membrane surface the microbial community compositions and structure of foulants are critical for biofilm maturation which might be in relation to their biofouling potential nagaraj et al 2019 ma et al 2013a the biofilm communities of foulants at phylum level are shown in fig 5 proteobacteria 33 0 52 7 actinobacteria 11 1 24 9 tm6 dependentiae 6 9 15 2 firmicutes 3 1 14 7 bacteroidetes 3 6 6 5 and chloroflexi 3 6 5 8 were the dominant phyla in all the foulants samples notably the relative abundance of proteobacteria and actinobacteria which were top two bacteria stains at phylum level of asnp m was lower than that of asns m and m0 which might be due to membrane biofouling mitigation it had been reported that the microorganisms belonging to proteobacteria e g β proteobacteria and γ proteobacteria are more likely to cause bacterial colonization on the membrane surface and the development of a biofilm lim et al 2012 meng et al 2009 in addition actinobacteria are a kind of filamentous bacteria which were thought to be the dominant bacteria for aggravating membrane biofouling in mbr system ma et al 2013c miura et al 2007 the relative abundance of firmicutes and bacteroidetes of asnp m were increased compared to m0 and asns m firmicutes are reported to be dominant bacteria in anaerobic bioreactor system gao et al 2010 ma et al 2013b suggesting that they were prone to proliferation under anaerobic condition according to the results from qcm d analysis the extracted foulant layers of asnp m had strongly adhesive property likely providing an anaerobic environment for firmicutes colonization bacteroides are associated with eps secretion which have affinities to membrane materials gao et al 2010 yu et al 2012 the results imply that bacteroides can be enriched on antibiofouling membrane surface mainly due to their function in the development of biofilm 4 conclusions in this study the antibiofouling performance and mechanisms of ag silica nanopollens modified membrane asnp m were systematically evaluated in a long term operated mbr for treating municipal wastewater long term operation of ag silica modified membranes revealed that using silica nanopollens as a carrier matrix for agnps and blending them in pvdf membranes offers an effective strategy to mitigate membrane biofouling mainly due to the enhanced silver loading quantity and controlled ag depletion rate for asnp m membrane foulants analysis indicated that asnp m could retard microbial proliferation through killing bacteria attached to their surface by effective ag release and only allow organic matter with strong adhesion properties to attach onto the membrane surface bacterial community analysis suggested that the incorporation of asnp m had a negative impact on colonization of bacteria that are capable of causing membrane biofouling e g proteobacteria and actinobacteria the current study suggests a great potential of the antibiofouling membrane to be used in mbrs for wastewater treatment and reclamation declaration of competing interest the authors

growth and metabolism of microorganisms on membrane surfaces and or inside membrane pores is considered as a thorny issue limiting applications of mbrs deng et al 2016 zhang et al 2016a membrane surface properties have a great impact on biofouling behaviors and an attractive strategy for biofouling control is to construct antibiofouling membrane surface that can inhibit bacterial proliferation and retard biofilm formation zhang et al 2016a zodrow et al 2009 recently the combination of polymeric materials with silver nanoparticles agnps has attracted much attention in membrane fabrication due to their strong disinfection capability yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2012a the membranes are usually fabricated by incorporating agnps in the membrane directly or immobilizing agnps on membrane surfaces ben sasson et al 2014 yin et al 2013 he et al 2017 huang et al 2016 however the uncontrollable release of agnps often leads to a fast loss of antibacterial ability and thus a short lifetime of agnps yin and dang 2015 huang et al 2014 to tackle these problems extensive efforts have been dedicated to developing nanomaterials to immobilize agnps and improve antimicrobial efficiency including nanozeolite wu et al 2015 silica nanospheres huang et al 2014 graphene oxide mahmoudi et al 2015 and biocarrier zhang et al 2012a the initial loading mass of ag and the rate of ag release hold the key to the efficacy and life time of the biofouling resistance of ag modified membrane zhang et al 2012a sufficient ag loading as well as stable ag release are both of great significance for long term performance inspired by nanopollens which can easily adhere to the hairy legs of a honey bee for pollination song et al 2016 barrier et al 2011 thorp 2000 due to their large specific surface area and enhanced interaction with microbes we developed biomimetic materials silica nanopollens as an agnps nanocarrier for membrane preparation silica nanopollens which have a structure of nanoscale channels as well as numerous spikes on the outer shell were supposed to improve silver delivery efficacy avoid agglomeration and control ag release towards bacteria in this study silica nanopollens

protocol described previously chen et al 2010 the pore size of membranes was investigated by a capillary flow porometer autosorb 6 quantachrome usa 2 5 2 biofilm analysis at the end of each operation cycle the fouled membranes were removed from the mbr for further investigation the amount of solids biofilm deposited on membrane surface was determined according to the procedure in the literature wang et al 2014 quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction qrt pcr was employed to characterize the total amount of bacteria on the membrane surface zhang et al 2009 the primers for amplification of 16s rrna genes were eub338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 and eub518r 5 attaccgcggctgctgg 3 further information on the amplification procedure can be found in si section s1 to further investigate the structure of biofilm clsm was adopted to characterize the composition of biofoulants on the membrane surface zhang et al 2016b the viable and dead cells were stained using live dead baclight bacterial viability kits molecular probes usa adhesion and fluidity properties of foulants were measured using qcm d q sense e4 gothenburg sweden through recording frequency and energy dissipation shifts under the same total organic carbon toc concentration chen et al 2017 2 5 3 microbial community analysis biofilm samples for sequencing were collected from the fouled membranes at the end of each operation cycle the biofilm on pristine membrane m0 and asns m was also analyzed for comparison all the samples were sent to majorbio bio pharm technology shanghai china for sequencing on an illumina miseq platform using the procedures documented in si section s2 based on the miseq system quick reference guide 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane characterization sem images fig 1 a c exhibit the surface morphology of pristine membrane m0 ag silica nanopollens modified membrane asnp m and ag silica nanospheres modified membrane asns m in fig 1b spherical ag silica nanospheres with uniform size 300 nm were homogeneously distributed over the membrane surface for the asnp m ag silica nanopollens which have numerous spikes on their surface can be clearly observed fig 1c fig s3a presents wide scan xps elemental survey spectra of m0 asns m and asnp m presence of si 2p and ag 3d peaks was observed in asns m and asnp m the o 1s spectrum of asns m and asnp m figs s3b and c showed a wide peak which could be fitted into three peaks the binding energy at 532 0 ev 531 8 ev and 532 0 ev for asns m and asnp m respectively was attributed to the crystal lattice oxygen of silica si o si and the peak at 533 0 ev 533 0 ev and 533 2 ev for asns m and asnp m respectively was assigned to surface hydroxyl groups of silica si o h zhang et al 2012b the existence of si o h suggests that there might be spare active sites for more ag reduction which could increase the loading capacity of silver nanoparticles it is noteworthy that the electrons of ionic cations could be held closer to oxygen ions compared to that of covalent cations leading to the signal appearing at lower binding energy pawlak et al 2002 the peak with the lower binding energy at 530 4 ev for both asns m and asnp m was observed which might be ascribed to the formation of si o ag through the reduction of ag on the surface of silica vasil kov et al 2018 meanwhile the ag 3d spectrum of asns m and asnp m is shown in figs s3d and e it can be seen that the ag 3d curves for asns m and asnp m could be deconvoluted into four peaks the gap of 6 0 ev between the two states ag 3d5 2 and ag 3d3 2 indicates the presence of metallic ag kang et al 2014 duan et al 2017 furthermore the ag 3d binding energy be appeared at a lower value i e 366 2 372 2 ev and 366 0 372 0 ev for asns m and asnp m respectively compared to the metallic ag be of ag 3d for metallic ag is about 368 2 374 2 ev suggesting successful binding of agnps with sio2 das et al 2013a the other two peaks with a distance of 6 2 ev were observed at the region of ag 3d5 2 and 3d3 2 respectively which might be associated with si o ag due to the positively charged silver ions on the surface of the agnps bound to the anionic oxygen of the silica surface zhang et al 2012b the introduction of ag silica changed the contact angle fig 1d from 75 1 1 9 m0 to 63 6 1 9 asns m and 62 7 0 7 asnp m which was attributed to the hydrophilic nature of silica as well as agnps prabhawathi et al 2012 yang et al 2014 compared to asns m surface hydrophilicity of asnp m was slightly enhanced likely due to more hydroxyl groups exposed on the surface of the silica nanopollens song et al 2016 in consistent with the hydrophilicity ag silica modified membranes enhanced water permeability fig 1e the incorporation of ag silica nanospheres increased water flux from 46 8 4 5 l m2 h m0 to 54 9 4 0 l m2 h and the ag silica nanopollens further improved water flux reaching 58 0 6 4 l m2 h due to its special morphology zeta potential of ag silica membrane surface as revealed by fig 1f was also slightly changed 33 0 mv for asns m asnp m compared to 30 mv for m0 attributed to the coverage of the membrane surface by the negatively charged silica nanoparticles 3 2 batch tests of ag ions release ag ions release is a major pathway for the bactericidal effects of agnps liu et al 2010 tian et al 2014 richter et al 2015 therefore enhanced agnps loading capacity as well as controlled ag ions release is of great importance to achieve sustainable membrane biofouling mitigation according to the results from icp ms experiments fig 2 a asnp m exhibited much higher original loading capacity of 107 7 10 9 μg ag cm2 compared to asns m 63 7 3 7 μg ag cm2 this should be associated with the larger surface area of silica nanopollens compared to silica nanospheres resulting in higher loading mass of ag on ag silica nanopollens 213 4 44 8 mg ag g sio2 than that on ag silica nanospheres 138 6 24 9 mg ag g sio2 to characterize the nature of porous structure n2 sorption analysis of silica nanoparticles and silica nanopollens was conducted the n2 adsorption and desorption isotherm of silica nanopollens fig s4 shows a typical type iv isotherm with a major capillary condensation step at a relative pressure p p 0 around 0 8 while no obvious hysteresis loop is observed for silica nanoparticles the surface area and corresponding pore structure of the synthesized silica nanopollens and silica nanoparticles are shown in si table s2 compared to silica nanoparticles silica nanopollens exhibited 550 and 750 increase in surface area and total pore volume respectively which might be attributed to the enlarged porous space between spikes as well as collapsed hollow cavities various of silica nanoparticles with higher porosity could serve as stable and efficient vector for biocides loading das et al 2013b tian et al 2014 compared to silica nanoparticles silica nanopollens could provide more sites for agnps growth during the fabrication process resulting in higher original agnps loading capacity of asnp m fig 2b presents silver release behaviors of the modified membranes and the results were also confirmed by mass balance analysis asns m exhibited significantly faster initial ag release in the first 4 d leading to a small portion of the loaded ag 33 remaining after 34 d exposure fig 2a in contrast the asnp m had a slower release rate with 78 ag on the membrane after 34 d soaking which was attributed to the accessible inner cavity of mesostructured of silica nanopollens favorable for controlling the ag release song et al 2016 2018 after 14 d exposure period ag release rate of the both modified membranes reached a stable and similar value 0 5 μg cm2 d it can be also observed that asnp m showed efficient antibacterial efficiency against e coli and s aureus fig 2c and d fig s5 asnp m exhibited a persistent antibacterial activity against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria after more than 20 d exposure fig 2c and d in comparison the antimicrobial capability of asns m was dramatically decreased indicating that the antibacterial effectiveness of asnp m was higher than that of asns m at approximately similar ag release rate in addition although ag m had the similar ag loading mass 129 42 μg cm2 to asnp m ag m showed lower antibacterial efficiency after 7 d exposure compared to asnp m fig s6 suggesting that the incorporation of silica nanopollens contributed to the long term antibacterial efficiency for silver modified membranes in this study silica nanopollens could potentially puncture bacterial cell membrane via needle like topology due to more contacting opportunities imparted by the presence of numerous spikes on silica nanopollens the loaded agnps on the nanopollens could dissolve to release a flow of ag into the cell within a short diffusional distance resulting in an increase in ag concentration in the biological cells the special agnps immobilization pattern and its associated controlled ag release ensure a long term effectiveness against biofouling for asnp m 3 3 mbr performance m0 asns m asnp m membranes were operated in the same bioreactor to examine the long term antibiofouling behaviors and ensure that all three types of membranes encountered the same operating conditions and mixed liquor due to the sludge bulking fig s7 the operation cycle of all the membranes was shortened in the last 30 d fig 3 a shows the evolution of tmp of membranes as a function of operation time in line with the results of batch test in section 3 2 asnp m exhibited a much better biofouling mitigation over the operation process the tmp increase rate of asnp m 0 88 0 34 kpa d was much lower than that of m0 2 32 0 86 kpa d and asns m 2 25 1 28 kpa d during the long term operation therefore using silica nanopollens as a nanocarrier matrix for agnps can effectively enhance silver loading and retard the depletion rate of ag in the membranes which could extend the anti biofouling performance pollutant removal was monitored to verify whether ag silica modified membrane can affect microbial metabolism in the bulk solution since agnps is capable of inhibiting microbial growth by leaching ag at high silver concentrations 100 ppb wastewater treatment process can be adversely impacted sukhorukova et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 liang et al 2010 it can be seen from fig 3b and c that the effluent cod and nh4 n was 24 5 14 5 mg l and 0 1 0 06 mg l respectively achieving successful pollutant removal this indicates that ag release from ag silica modified membranes did not have obvious influences on organic matter metabolism and nitrification 3 4 antifouling mechanisms visualization of the foulants on the membrane surface was conducted using clsm to elucidate the antibiofouling mechanisms of ag silica nanopollens modified membranes fig 4 a shows that m0 surface was almost completely covered with live microbial cells with almost no dead bacteria with representative top view of membranes shown in fig s8 in contrast the relative abundance of cells in the biofilm of asnp m was quite low and more than half were dead cells indicating that the asnp m substantially inhibited microbial adhesion and killed bacteria attached on membrane surface through effective ag release moreover most cells in biofilm on asns m were live attributed to the faster ag release from the ag silica nanopollens samples as discussed in section 3 2 which cannot achieve sustainable surface concentration of ag for a long term antibiofouling performance on the other hand the lower loading agnps capacity fig 2a is another reason likely causing the inefficiency in inactivating bacteria for asns m during long term operation fig 4b indicates the abundance of 16s rrna genes in the biofilm of three types of membranes the abundance of amplified dna product as revealed by qrt pcr is positively correlated with cell counting zhang et al 2009 as shown in fig 4b the amount of bacteria was substantially reduced when ag silica nanopollens were incorporated into membrane matrix the measurement of solids biomass of the cake layers of all the membranes table s3 further confirmed the antibiofouling effects i e a lower amount of volatile suspended solids for the biofilm of asnp m 1 5 0 4 mg cm2 surface compared to that of m0 2 8 1 0 mg cm2 and asns m 1 8 1 1 mg cm2 to further reveal biofilm properties qcm d analysis was used to evaluate the interaction between foulants and membrane surface as well as its viscoelastic properties gutman et al 2013 frequency shifts f after introducing membrane foulants are presented in fig 4c with the evolution of frequency shown in fig s9 the frequency shift has positive correlations with adhesion capability of foulants ying et al 2010 the foulant on the asnp m membrane surface had highest value of f compared to that of m0 and asns m indicating that only those foulants with strong adhesive characteristics could attach onto the asnp m membrane surface the foulants with strong adhesive properties might be attributed to cellular contents release due to agnps induced cell death zheng et al 2018 the ratio δd δf reflects the structural information of absorbed layer on the qcm d sensor i e its viscous or elastic nature gutman et al 2013 olsson et al 2010 fig 4c exhibits that the extracted foulant layers of asnp m are more fluid favorable for fouling compared to that of asns m and m0 confirming that only these foulants with stronger fouling propensity were accessible to asnp m membrane pores contreras et al 2011 sweity et al 2011 these results indicate that the incorporation of agnps and silica nanopollens affects the structure of fouling layer 3 5 bacterial community of the biofilm formed on membrane surfaces the fouling layers were scraped off from the fouled membrane modules for microbial community analysis using illumina mesiq the foulants samples at the end of 3rd 2nd and 1st operation cycle of m0 asns m and asnp m were chosen to discern the differences in bacterial communities on membrane surface which were collected at almost the same period 49 d 52 d and 48 d of operation time of m0 asns m and asnp m respectively to avoid the impact of evolution of microbial community of mbr system on the foulants following overlapping and quality control 111 961 sequence amplicons in the v3 v4 region were obtained for three membrane foulants samples table s4 it is obvious that the otus ace chao1 and shannon values of foulants sample collected from asns m surface were the lowest while the sample from asnp m had the highest values in the diversity estimators as mentioned above according to previous literature wang et al 2017 hu et al 2015 the decrease of microbial community diversity on agnps modified membrane might be attributed to the influences of ag release however ag silica nanopollens modification did not adversely affect the bacterial diversity on the membrane surface mainly due to its controlled ag release largely avoiding an acute strike of ag to bacterial cells on the membrane surface the microbial community compositions and structure of foulants are critical for biofilm maturation which might be in relation to their biofouling potential nagaraj et al 2019 ma et al 2013a the biofilm communities of foulants at phylum level are shown in fig 5 proteobacteria 33 0 52 7 actinobacteria 11 1 24 9 tm6 dependentiae 6 9 15 2 firmicutes 3 1 14 7 bacteroidetes 3 6 6 5 and chloroflexi 3 6 5 8 were the dominant phyla in all the foulants samples notably the relative abundance of proteobacteria and actinobacteria which were top two bacteria stains at phylum level of asnp m was lower than that of asns m and m0 which might be due to membrane biofouling mitigation it had been reported that the microorganisms belonging to proteobacteria e g β proteobacteria and γ proteobacteria are more likely to cause bacterial colonization on the membrane surface and the development of a biofilm lim et al 2012 meng et al 2009 in addition actinobacteria are a kind of filamentous bacteria which were thought to be the dominant bacteria for aggravating membrane biofouling in mbr system ma et al 2013c miura et al 2007 the relative abundance of firmicutes and bacteroidetes of asnp m were increased compared to m0 and asns m firmicutes are reported to be dominant bacteria in anaerobic bioreactor system gao et al 2010 ma et al 2013b suggesting that they were prone to proliferation under anaerobic condition according to the results from qcm d analysis the extracted foulant layers of asnp m had strongly adhesive property likely providing an anaerobic environment for firmicutes colonization bacteroides are associated with eps secretion which have affinities to membrane materials gao et al 2010 yu et al 2012 the results imply that bacteroides can be enriched on antibiofouling membrane surface mainly due to their function in the development of biofilm 4 conclusions in this study the antibiofouling performance and mechanisms of ag silica nanopollens modified membrane asnp m were systematically evaluated in a long term operated mbr for treating municipal wastewater long term operation of ag silica modified membranes revealed that using silica nanopollens as a carrier matrix for agnps and blending them in pvdf membranes offers an effective strategy to mitigate membrane biofouling mainly due to the enhanced silver loading quantity and controlled ag depletion rate for asnp m membrane foulants analysis indicated that asnp m could retard microbial proliferation through killing bacteria attached to their surface by effective ag release and only allow organic matter with strong adhesion properties to attach onto the membrane surface bacterial community analysis suggested that the incorporation of asnp m had a negative impact on colonization of bacteria that are capable of causing membrane biofouling e g proteobacteria and actinobacteria the current study suggests a great potential of the antibiofouling membrane to be used in mbrs for wastewater treatment and reclamation declaration of competing interest the authors

17987,thiosulfate s2o3 2 is frequently used as an ozone o3 quenching agent when investigating the ozonation of organic contaminants and the kinetics thereof in this study however o3 is activated by s2o3 2 resulting in a superfast degradation of o3 refractory contaminants therefore the focus of this study is the exploration into the enhancing role of s2o3 2 in the degradation of refractory organic contaminants by o3 which has been overlooked thus far results obtained from scavenging experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectra verify that oh generated from the reaction of s2o3 2 with o3 is mainly responsible for the superfast degradation of o3 refractory contaminants the oh yield from the o3 s2o3 2 process is determined to be 0 216 a plausible mechanism for the generation of oh from the o3 s2o3 2 process is proposed with the implementation of density functional theory dft initially ozone reacts with a sulfur of s2o3 2 to form ooosso3 2 the adduct then rearranges to oo o sso3 2 or hoo o sso3 2 in the presence of h which cleaves to give a sulfoxide radical cation and o2 ho2 o2 ho2 is rapidly transformed into oh by o3 through a series of steps degradation efficiency of o3 refractory contaminants of this process highly depends on the molar ratio of s2o3 2 and o3 s2o3 2 o3 the optimal s2o3 2 o3 is ph dependent in synthetic water e g 0 3 at ph 7 the presence of bicarbonate inhibits the degradation of refractory contaminants by the o3 s2o3 2 process humic acid exhibits a slight enhancing effect at low concentrations 0 1 0 2 mg c l and an inhibiting effect at higher concentrations 0 4 mg c l in addition the efficacy of the o3 s2o3 2 process in real water matrices is also confirmed graphical abstract image 1 keywords ozone thiosulfate s2o3 2 ozonation sulfur oxides degradation refractory organic contaminant 1 introduction ozone o3 has been universally applied in drinking and wastewater treatment in order to abate organic contaminants for decades von gunten 2003 nöthe et al 2009 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 yang et al 2017a o3 preferably reacts with compounds containing electron rich groups such as double bonds activated aromatic compounds and deprotonated amines buffle et al 2006 tekle röttering et al 2016 witkowski et al 2018 2019 knoop et al 2018 however it fails to oxidize a number of refractory contaminants such as saturated aliphatic compounds chlorine olefins and some aromatic compounds among others all of which are detected globally in increasing quantities phungsai et al 2019 reisz et al 2018 despite this these o3 refractory contaminants are typically degraded to a certain extent during ozonation this phenomenon is ascribed to the unique feature of o3 to decompose into a hydroxyl radical oh which reacts with these contaminants at near diffusion controlled rates von sonntag and von gunten 2012 accordingly the transformation of o3 into oh is essential for the degradation of refractory contaminants during ozonation a great deal of effort has been put into developing various methodologies that induce o3 to form oh including activation by peroxides e g h2o2 so5 fischbacher et al 2013 yang et al 2015 tan et al 2019 energy input e g sunlight rivas et al 2019 chávez et al 2016 ultraviolet chin and bérubé 2005 ultrasound guo et al 2015 and electrolysis yuan et al 2013 li et al 2015 and catalysis by metal ions or metal oxides nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 in addition a number of organic compounds e g phenol secondary and tertiary amines have been reported to react with o3 to produce oh as simplified equations 1 3 buffle and von gunten 2006 recently our group demonstrated that nitrogenous reducing agents e g hydroxylamine and nitrite facilitate elimination of o3 refractory contaminants by o3 as simplified equations 4 and 5 yang et al 2017b c 2016a the reason for this enhancing effect stems from the reaction of these two reducing agents with o3 which generates

e g so3 2 s2o3 2 and s2o4 2 are capable of reacting with oxidants to produce stronger oxidative species thereby enhancing organic contaminant degradation by these oxidants for example bisulfite activates permanganate to form the reactive mn iii species and a sulfate radical resulting in degradation of organic contaminants at extraordinarily high rates sun et al 2015 2016 gao et al 2019 feng et al 2018 reported that sulfite so3 2 activates fe vi to form fe v via a one electron transfer reaction while thiosulfate s2o3 2 reacts with fe vi to generate fe iv via a two electron transfer reaction both fe v and fe iv accelerate contaminant degradation by fe vi significantly as these two high valent iron intermediates exhibit reactivity toward organic contaminants 2 5 orders of magnitude higher than that of fe vi dithionate s2o4 2 has been found to enhance the degradation of atrazine atz by peroxymonosulfate through generating so4 song et al 2019 however very little attention has been paid to evaluating the effect of sulfur containing reducing agents on the o3 oxidation of refractory organic contaminants compared to nitrogen containing reducing agents sulfur containing reducing agents are more cost effective non toxic and do not generate toxic byproducts e g n nitrosodimethylamine ndma wang et al 2001 it is widely accepted that s2o3 2 is the most common quenching agent used to terminate reactions of o3 with targeted contaminants when investigating o3 contaminant oxidation kinetics and corresponding advanced oxidation processes jothinathan and hu 2018 yuan et al 2018 yong and lin 2012 xu et al 2019 in our recent study of contaminant oxidation kinetics by ozonation in ultrapure water we spiked test reactions with different concentrations so as to determine the appropriate dosage required for quenching dissolved o3 surprisingly we discovered that oxidation of o3 refractory contaminants was markedly accelerated by the addition of s2o3 2 at

pre determined volume of o3 stock solution was added to the mixture of dmpo and s2o3 2 or so3 2 ph 7 phosphate buffer the mixture was rapidly stirred and sampled with a 100 μl capillary tube which was inserted into the epr cavity epr experimental conditions were as follows a microwave frequency of 9 77 ghz and a microwave power of 20 02 mw a center field of 353 5 g a sweep width of 100 g a sweep time of 84 s a modulation frequency of 100 khz and a modulation amplitude of 1 0 g computational methods under the experimental ph range the dominant form of thiosulfate was found to be the divalent anion to elucidate the mechanism by which the hydroxyl radical is generated in our system the reaction between o3 and s2o3 2 was computationally investigated by means of the density functional theory dft the m06 2x functional together with the 6 311 g basis set was used in the dft calculations structural optimizations and frequency calculations were carried out for critical points along the potential energy profile intrinsic reaction coordinate irc analyses starting from the transition state structure were also performed in forward and reverse directions to confirm correct connections between transition states and minima thermochemistry results were calculated at a temperature of 298 15 k and a pressure of 1 0 atm the solvent effect was taken into account implicitly by adopting the solvation model based on density smd model marenich et al 2009 all electronic structure calculations were carried out by means of the gaussian09 program suite and the molecular structures were visualized using avogadro software version 1 2 0 hanwell et al 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of organic contaminants by o3 s2o3 2 fig 1 a represents the time course profiles of atz 1 μm degradation by o3 40 μm with and without s2o3 2 at ph 7 in the absence of s2o3 2 o3 degraded only 20 of initial atz within the time scale investigated t 20 s in solutions containing s2o3 2 and atz i e no o3 no degradation of atz was observed see fig s3 however atz degradation by o3 was appreciably accelerated in the presence of s2o3 2 it should be noted that the atz degradation mainly occurred within 0 4 s the first sampling point interestingly atz degradation was enhanced from 64 5 to 88 4 by an increase in the molar ratio of s2o3 2 to o3 s2o3 2 o3 from 0 05 to 0 3 after 20 s reaction time this was followed by a decrease to 58 1 when s2o3 2 o3 was 0 6 when the molar ratio was further increased above 2 atz degradation by o3 s2o3 2 became negligible therefore the addition of excess s2o3 2 to quench ozone mediated degradation of organic contaminants is plausible typically s2o3 2 o3 was higher than 10 in literature reports leitner and roshani 2010 similar degradation trends were observed for other organic contaminants including geosmin 2 mib dea and omethoate by o3 s2o3 2 as shown in fig 1 b degradation rates of above mentioned contaminants followed the order geosmin 2 mib dea omethoate the results suggest that s2o3 2 in a relatively low spiking concentration significantly accelerates the degradation of organic contaminants by o3 as a result of reactive species generated from the interaction between o3 and s2o3 2 however an addition of s2o3 2 does not always enhance the degradation s2o3 2 as a reducing agent can also quench the formed oxidizing species in the o3 s2o3 2 process it means that spiking s2o3 2 in a high concentration would inhibit the degradations of refractory organic contaminants hence process performance on the contaminant degradations was highly dependent on the s2o3 2 o3 residual concentrations of dissolved o3 were monitored during the reaction and are shown in fig s4 evidently only 10 of the initial o3 concentration 40 μm was decomposed in the absence of s2o3 2 with increasing concentrations of s2o3 2 decomposition of dissolved o3 was more rapid for example the residual concentration of o3 decreased from 31 5 μm to 3 3 μm when s2o3 2 concentration was increased from 2 μm to 12 μm when the s2o3 2 concentration was above 16 μm dissolved o3 decomposed completely within 1 s it is ascribed to the high rate constant for the reaction of o3 with s2o3 2 which was determined to be 1 5 108 m 1s 1 by a competitive kinetic method see text s1 and fig s5 these results were compatible with the superfast degradation of atz by o3 s2o3 2 3 2 identification of reactive species in the o3 s2o3 2 system results mentioned above indicate that the reactive oxidizing species produced from the interaction of o3 with s2o3 2 are responsible to a large extent for the degradation of organic contaminants as expected molecular o3 and oh are typically considered to be the chief reactive oxidizing species in the oxidation of organic contaminants during ozonation all of the above mentioned organic contaminants show extremely low reactivity toward o3 but high reactivity toward oh the second order rate constants for reactions of these organic contaminants with o3 and oh are shown in table s1 presumably enhanced degradation of these o3 refractory compounds can be attributed to oh generated by the o3 s2o3 2 process to verify the generation of oh during the reaction of o3 with s2o3 2 radical scavenging experiments were performed with the addition of excess oh scavenger t buoh 10 mm as can be seen in fig 2 a the degradation of atz by o3 s2o3 2 was considerably inhibited in the presence of excess t buoh with less than 10 of initial atz being degraded similarly geosmin and 2 mib degradation was significantly inhibited by the addition of 10 mm t buoh see fig s6 these two odorous compounds are recalcitrant to o3 and typically degraded by oh during ozonation these findings imply that the reaction of o3 with s2o3 2 presumably generates oh which is likely to be principally responsible for the enhancement in degradations of o3 refractory organic compounds to provide further direct evidence for the formation of oh from the reaction of o3 with s2o3 2 epr experiments were performed using dmpo as a spin trapping agent in the systems of o3 alone o3 so3 2 and o3 s2o3 2 as presented in fig 2 b a signal for the dmpo oh spin adduct 1 2 2 1 quartet with hyperfine constants of α n α h 14 9 g was detected for the o3 s2o3 2 process which was not visible in the processes of o3 and o3 so3 2 this result further confirmed that s2o3 2 successfully activated o3 to generate oh 3 3 oh yield from the o3 s2o3 2 process to better understand the formation of oh from the reaction of o3 with s2o3 2 the oh yield was evaluated which is termed as oh production as a function of ozone consumption ϕ δ oh δ o3 the oh yield was obtained via the t buoh assay which is based on the quantification of formaldehyde formed during the reaction of a hydroxyl radical with a large excess of t buoh fig 3 shows that the oh yield from the o3 s2o3 2 process was approximately 0 216 3 4 o3 s2o3 2 reaction mechanism the stoichiometry of the o3 s2o3 2 reaction was determined by measuring the formation of so4 2 and the consumption of dissolved o3 by addition of s2o3 2 at a concentration range from 2 μm to 12 μm and at a constant o3 concentration of 40 μm at ph 7 a high concentration of t buoh 10 mm was added into the above experimental solutions in order to avoid the potential influence of oh generated from the reaction of o3 with s2o3 2 in the s2o3 2 concentration range tested a complete transformation from s2o3 2 to so4 2 was observed as shown in fig s7 the formation of so4 2 increased linearly with increasing consumption of o3 the result suggests that 3 mol o3 are required for the elimination of 1 mol s2o3 2 and the concomitant formation of 2 mol so4 2 furthermore it indicated that the reaction of o3 with s2o3 2 was not the only oxygen transfer reaction if the reaction of o3 and s2o3 2 proceeded as the only o transfer reaction 5 mol o3 would be required it is well known that adduct formation is generally the first step in ozone reactions this pathway has been confirmed in many examples such as for reactions of ozone with halide ions amines sulfur compounds and even transition metal ions von sonntag and von gunten 2012 similarly it can be reasonably proposed that adduct formation at the sulfur atom is the first step during the reaction of o3 with s2o3 2 as depicted in reaction 6 as shown in fig 4 the formation of adduct cp1 is exothermic by 27 89 kcal mol at the m06 2x 6 311 g level indicating that cp1 is readily formed subsequently cp1 formation may be followed by o2 release which is generally referred to as an o atom transfer reaction see reaction 7 according to the spin conversion rule spin multiplicity of the product formed from the ozone adduct must be a singlet thus forming a singlet oxygen 1o2 the formation of 1o2 and osso3 2 is exothermic by 3 13 kcal mol a similar reaction pathway is observed in the reaction of o3 with hs mark et al 2011 in competition with the release of 1o2 adduct cp1 can also proceed with internal cyclization and o transfer which results in the formation of oo o sso3 2 cp2 as detailed in reaction 8 via transition state ts1 the energy barrier for cp1 to ts1 is only 1 10 kcal mol while cp2 1 lies below cp1 by 34 98 kcal mol indicating that this process is both kinetically and thermodynamically favored cp2 1 can isomerize to cp2 0 by overcoming an energy barrier of 5 84 kcal mol via transition state ts2 cp2 0 can cleave heterolytically to generate a sulfoxide radical cation osso3 and a superoxide radical anion o2 see reaction 9 reaction 9 is endothermic by only 8 56 kcal mol in the presence of h cp2 0 can form a peracid as given in reaction 10 which is exothermic by 141 71 kcal mol the formed peracid hoo o sso3 can cleave into a sulfoxide radical cation and ho2 as shown in reaction 11 the activation energy of this reaction has been calculated at g 14 2 kcal mol it should be noted that ho2 is in equilibrium with its conjugate base o2 with pka 4 8 as indicated in reaction 12 bielski et al 1985 consequently the equilibrium of ho2 o2 will shift towards o2 even at a marginally acidic ph the total potential energy profile supports the hypothesis that o2 can be readily formed from the reaction between o3 and s2o3 2 at 298 15 k and 1 atm o2 can undergo a rapid electron transfer reaction with o3 to produce an ozonide radical o3 as given in reaction 13 sehested et al 1983 according to the literature o3 is a critical precursor for oh detailed in reactions 14 and 15 elliot and mccracken 1989 6 o3 s2o3 2 ooosso3 2 7 ooosso3 2 osso3 2 1o2 8 ooosso3 2

of contaminants 3 5 1 solution ph solution ph is a critical factor for effective oxidation of organic contaminants by ozonation since reaction rates for ozone mediated compound dissociation are ph dependent as shown in fig 5 the elimination of atz exhibited a monotonic increase from 30 7 to 59 8 in the absence of s2o3 2 and an increase in ph from 4 to 9 this is consistent with the well documented fact that increasing ph favors the degradations of refractory organic contaminants during ozonation yang et al 2016a b 2017a b interestingly however atz elimination exhibited an increase followed by a decrease when spiked with 12 20 μm s2o3 2 during ozonation in the same ph range this implies that addition of a certain concentration of s2o3 2 changes the ph dependency of atz degradation during ozonation it should be noted that the enhancing effect of s2o3 2 on atz degradation by ozonation declined as ph increased for example atz degradation increased from 42 1 to 59 8 when s2o3 2 concentration was increased from 4 μm to 20 μm at ph 4 but decreased from 86 5 to 58 3 with the same s2o3 2 concentration range at ph 9 two aspects that could explain the ph dependent trend at ph 4 9 are 1 a ph increase leads to a decrease in o3 available to react with s2o3 2 an increase in ph enhances the reaction of o3 with oh and ensuing oh chain reactions which are in competition with the reaction of o3 with s2o3 2 a decrease in o3 available to react with s2o3 2 results in elevated formation of oh scavenged by s2o3 2 2 ph shifts the equilibrium of hso3 so3 2 a certain amount of hso3 so3 2 was observed in the reactions of o3 with excess s2o3 2 see fig s8 indicating that hso3 so3 2 is a significant intermediate in the reaction between o3 and s2o3 2 it can scavenge dissolved o3 and oh formed in the process hso3 so3 2 exists in different forms at various ph levels it has two pka values being pka1 1 9 and pka2 7 2 hso3 so3 2 exists predominantly as hso3 in a ph range of 1 9 7 2 and as so3 2 when the ph is above 7 2 see fig s9 hoigné et al 1985 rate constants for reactions of oh and o3 with hso3 so3 2 are both ph dependent oh reacts with so3 2 with a second order rate constant of 5 5 109 m 1s 1 which is slightly higher than that of the hso3 reaction 4 5 109 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 o3 reacts with so3 2 with a second order rate constant of 1 3 1 5 109 m 1s 1 which is three orders of magnitude higher than that of hso3 3 7 8 105 m 1s 1 hoffmann 1986 liu et al 2001 this suggests that a higher fraction of oh formed from the reaction of o3 and s2o3 2 would be scavenged by hso3 so3 2 at higher ph thereby reducing the amount of oh available for degradation of organic contaminants simultaneously hso3 so3 2 would also consume more o3 without oh formation at higher ph 3 5 2 bicarbonate bicarbonate is commonly detected in natural water as hco3 or co3 2 with a pka of 10 33 see reaction 16 it is typically considered as a scavenger of oh producing co3 during advanced oxidation processes via reaction 17 and 18 acero and von gunten 2000 since co3 has a lower reactivity than oh the transformation of oh to co3 would lead to a decline in degradation efficiency of recalcitrant organic contaminants as shown in fig 6 a elimination of atz dea 2 mib geosmin and omethoate decreased from 88 to 61 59 31 100 55 85 43 and 22 10 respectively with increasing bicarbonate concentration ranging from 0 to 4 mm in the o3 s2o3 2 process it should be noted that co3 formed by this process can selectively oxidize a number of organic and inorganic compounds yang et al 2019a neta et al 1988 such as atz with a second order rate constant of 4 0 106 m 1s 1 canonica et al 2005 huang and mabury 2000 however the degradation efficiency of organic contaminants by co3 in this case is inferior to that of oh accordingly the inhibiting effect of bicarbonate on organic contaminant degradation by o3 s2o3 2 varied depending on the organic contaminant 16 hco3 h co3 2 pka 10 33 17 hco3 oh co3 h2o k 9 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 18 co3 2 oh co3 ho k 10 3 9 108 m 1 s 1 3 5 3 humic acid humic acid is an important constituent of natural organic matter nom and thus was chosen as an indicator of nom with the aim of investigating its influence on the degradation of organic contaminants during the o3 s2o3 2 process as shown in fig 6 b degradation of atz dea 2 mib geosmin and omethoate showed a slight increase followed by a decline with increasing concentration of humic acid ranging from 0 1 to 0 5 mg c l evidently humic acid slightly enhances organic contaminant degradation at lower concentrations 0 1 0 2 mg c l while inhibiting it at higher concentrations 0 4 mg c l humic acid played a dual role as an activator of o3 for oh generation and a scavenger of oh generated in the o3 s2o3 2 process therefore the impact of nom on the degradation of organic contaminants by the o3 s2o3 2 process depended largely on the constituents of nom and the molar ratio of o3 and nom 3 5 4 contaminant degradation by o3 s2o3 2 in real water matrices degradation efficiency of organic contaminants by ozonation in the presence of s2o3 2 was evaluated in real water matrices experiments were conducted in surface water and tap water spiked with 2 μm atz as shown in fig 7 atz degradation exhibited an increase followed by a decrease in both surface and tap water backgrounds optimal s2o3 2 o3 for atz degradation was 0 06 for surface water and 0 14 for tap water this variation could be as a result of differing ph and water matrices of surface and tap water which can affect the extent to which dissolved o3 is consumed it should be noted that addition of s2o3 2 enhanced atz degradation by ozonation in a concentration range of 2 8 μm s2o3 2 o3 0 03 0 13 in surface water and 2 20 μm s2o3 2 o3 0 05 0 48 in tap water in conclusion addition of an appropriate concentration of s2o3 2 is indeed effective for accelerating degradations of recalcitrant organic contaminants by ozonation in real water matrices 4 conclusion in previous studies s2o3 2 has typically been used as a quenching agent in ozonation experiments without realizing its accelerating role in degradations of refractory organic contaminants by o3 this work initially demonstrates that s2o3 2 surprisingly activates o3 to produce oh in a yield of 0 216 rendering it available for rapid water decontamination the decontamination efficacy highly depends on the molar ratio of s2o3 2 and o3 a plausible mechanism for oh formation is proposed for the reaction of o3 with s2o3 2 using density function theory dft the availability of o3 s2o3 2 used in real water matrices is also confirmed nowadays o3 is widely used followed by a biological treatment step for removal of assimilable organic carbon aoc or biodegradable organic carbon bdoc to guarantee the disinfection and or oxidation efficiency o3 is readily overdosed the residual o3 may inhibit the subsequent biological process that plays a positive role in organic contaminants degradations an addition of s2o3 2 might have potential to quench the residual o3 and simultaneously enhance the degradations of refractory organic contaminants in addition undesirable by products such as bromate are typically observed during ozonation of bromide containing water yang et al 2019a b 2017c von gunten 2018 hence further studies will be performed to assess the formation of bromate and other brominated by products which may arise from the o3 s2o3 2 process declaration of competing interest the authors declare

17987,thiosulfate s2o3 2 is frequently used as an ozone o3 quenching agent when investigating the ozonation of organic contaminants and the kinetics thereof in this study however o3 is activated by s2o3 2 resulting in a superfast degradation of o3 refractory contaminants therefore the focus of this study is the exploration into the enhancing role of s2o3 2 in the degradation of refractory organic contaminants by o3 which has been overlooked thus far results obtained from scavenging experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectra verify that oh generated from the reaction of s2o3 2 with o3 is mainly responsible for the superfast degradation of o3 refractory contaminants the oh yield from the o3 s2o3 2 process is determined to be 0 216 a plausible mechanism for the generation of oh from the o3 s2o3 2 process is proposed with the implementation of density functional theory dft initially ozone reacts with a sulfur of s2o3 2 to form ooosso3 2 the adduct then rearranges to oo o sso3 2 or hoo o sso3 2 in the presence of h which cleaves to give a sulfoxide radical cation and o2 ho2 o2 ho2 is rapidly transformed into oh by o3 through a series of steps degradation efficiency of o3 refractory contaminants of this process highly depends on the molar ratio of s2o3 2 and o3 s2o3 2 o3 the optimal s2o3 2 o3 is ph dependent in synthetic water e g 0 3 at ph 7 the presence of bicarbonate inhibits the degradation of refractory contaminants by the o3 s2o3 2 process humic acid exhibits a slight enhancing effect at low concentrations 0 1 0 2 mg c l and an inhibiting effect at higher concentrations 0 4 mg c l in addition the efficacy of the o3 s2o3 2 process in real water matrices is also confirmed graphical abstract image 1 keywords ozone thiosulfate s2o3 2 ozonation sulfur oxides degradation refractory organic contaminant 1 introduction ozone o3 has been universally applied in drinking and wastewater treatment in order to abate organic contaminants for decades von gunten 2003 nöthe et al 2009 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 yang et al 2017a o3 preferably reacts with compounds containing electron rich groups such as double bonds activated aromatic compounds and deprotonated amines buffle et al 2006 tekle röttering et al 2016 witkowski et al 2018 2019 knoop et al 2018 however it fails to oxidize a number of refractory contaminants such as saturated aliphatic compounds chlorine olefins and some aromatic compounds among others all of which are detected globally in increasing quantities phungsai et al 2019 reisz et al 2018 despite this these o3 refractory contaminants are typically degraded to a certain extent during ozonation this phenomenon is ascribed to the unique feature of o3 to decompose into a hydroxyl radical oh which reacts with these contaminants at near diffusion controlled rates von sonntag and von gunten 2012 accordingly the transformation of o3 into oh is essential for the degradation of refractory contaminants during ozonation a great deal of effort has been put into developing various methodologies that induce o3 to form oh including activation by peroxides e g h2o2 so5 fischbacher

e g so3 2 s2o3 2 and s2o4 2 are capable of reacting with oxidants to produce stronger oxidative species thereby enhancing organic contaminant degradation by these oxidants for example bisulfite activates permanganate to form the reactive mn iii species and a sulfate radical resulting in degradation of organic contaminants at extraordinarily high rates sun et al 2015 2016 gao et al 2019 feng et al 2018 reported that sulfite so3 2 activates fe vi to form fe v via a one electron transfer reaction while thiosulfate s2o3 2 reacts with fe vi to generate fe iv via a two electron transfer reaction both fe v and fe iv accelerate contaminant degradation by fe vi significantly as these two high valent iron intermediates exhibit reactivity toward organic contaminants 2 5 orders of magnitude higher than that of fe vi dithionate s2o4 2 has been found to enhance the degradation of atrazine atz by peroxymonosulfate through generating so4 song et al 2019 however very little attention has been paid to evaluating the effect of sulfur containing reducing agents on the o3 oxidation of refractory organic contaminants compared to nitrogen containing reducing agents sulfur containing reducing agents are more cost effective non toxic and do not generate toxic byproducts e g n nitrosodimethylamine ndma wang et al 2001 it is widely accepted that s2o3 2 is the most common quenching agent used to terminate reactions of o3 with targeted contaminants when investigating o3 contaminant oxidation kinetics and corresponding advanced oxidation processes jothinathan and hu 2018 yuan et al 2018 yong and lin 2012 xu et al 2019 in our recent study of contaminant oxidation kinetics by ozonation in ultrapure water we spiked test reactions with different concentrations so as to determine the appropriate dosage required for quenching dissolved o3 surprisingly we discovered that oxidation of o3 refractory contaminants was markedly accelerated by the addition of s2o3 2 at relatively low concentrations during ozonation to the best of our knowledge this effect has thus far not been recognized in the context of ozone mediated water treatment processes moreover oxidizing

work allows initial sampling 0 4 s following ozone addition quenching mixtures contained an indigo agent for the determination of dissolved ozone and sulfite for the determination of organic contaminants sulfite was confirmed to be an appropriate quenching agent for the o3 s2o3 2 reaction see fig s2 experiments were typically conducted in 5 mm phosphate buffer and solution ph was adjusted by h2so4 0 1 m and or naoh 0 1 m quantification of oh yield the oh yield from the o3 s2o3 2 reaction was evaluated by the t buoh method where t buoh is present in a large excess 1 m over o3 0 60 μm at a constant s2o3 2 concentration 200 μm to fully scavenge the formed oh formaldehyde the principal end product of the scavenging reaction was quantified via its derivatives 2 4 dinitrophenylhydrazones using high performance liquid chromatography hplc 2 4 dinitrophenylhydrazine solution 0 1 ml 9 mm in acetonitrile and perchloric acid 0 05 ml 1 m in acetonitrile were added into the sample solution 0 85 ml and mixed well the resultant solution was kept in the dark for 45 min and then analyzed by hplc at a wavelength of 350 nm the yield of oh from the o3 s2o3 2 reaction was calculated by doubling the obtained formaldehyde yield analytical methods ozone in the stock solution was measured directly by uv spectrometry at a wavelength of 258 nm ε 3000 m 1cm 1 experimental concentrations of

c min and a 3 min hold epr experiments were performed on a bruker a200 spectrometer at room temperature 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrrolidine n oxide dmpo was selected as the spin trapping agent in this study a pre determined volume of o3 stock solution was added to the mixture of dmpo and s2o3 2 or so3 2 ph 7 phosphate buffer the mixture was rapidly stirred and sampled with a 100 μl capillary tube which was inserted into the epr cavity epr experimental conditions were as follows a microwave frequency of 9 77 ghz and a microwave power of 20 02 mw a center field of 353 5 g a sweep width of 100 g a sweep time of 84 s a modulation frequency of 100 khz and a modulation amplitude of 1 0 g computational methods under the experimental ph range the dominant form of thiosulfate was found to be the divalent anion to elucidate the mechanism by which the hydroxyl radical is generated in our system the reaction between o3 and s2o3 2 was computationally investigated by means of the density functional theory dft the m06 2x functional together with the 6 311 g basis set was used in the dft calculations structural optimizations and frequency calculations were carried out for critical points along the potential energy profile intrinsic reaction coordinate irc analyses starting from the transition state structure were also performed in forward and reverse directions to confirm correct connections between transition states and minima thermochemistry results were calculated at a temperature of 298 15 k and a pressure of 1 0 atm the solvent effect was taken into account implicitly by adopting the solvation model based on density smd model marenich et al 2009 all electronic structure calculations were carried out by means of the gaussian09 program suite and the molecular structures were visualized using avogadro software version 1 2 0 hanwell et al 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of organic contaminants by o3 s2o3 2 fig 1 a represents the time course profiles of atz 1 μm degradation by o3 40 μm with and without s2o3 2 at ph 7 in the absence of s2o3 2 o3 degraded only 20 of initial atz within the time scale investigated t 20 s in solutions containing s2o3 2 and atz i e no o3 no degradation of atz was observed see fig s3 however atz degradation by o3 was appreciably accelerated in the presence of s2o3 2 it should be noted that the atz degradation mainly occurred within 0 4 s the first sampling point interestingly atz degradation was enhanced from 64 5 to 88 4 by an increase in the molar ratio of s2o3 2 to o3 s2o3 2 o3 from 0 05 to 0 3 after 20 s reaction time this was followed by a decrease to 58 1 when s2o3 2 o3 was 0 6 when the molar ratio was further increased above 2 atz degradation by o3 s2o3 2 became negligible therefore the addition of excess s2o3 2 to quench ozone mediated degradation of organic contaminants is plausible typically s2o3 2 o3 was higher than 10 in literature reports leitner and roshani 2010 similar degradation trends were observed for other organic contaminants including geosmin 2 mib dea and omethoate by o3 s2o3 2 as shown in fig 1 b degradation rates of above mentioned contaminants followed the order geosmin 2 mib dea omethoate the results suggest that s2o3 2 in a relatively low spiking concentration significantly accelerates the degradation of organic contaminants by o3 as a result of reactive species generated from the interaction between o3 and s2o3 2 however an addition of s2o3 2 does not always enhance the degradation s2o3 2 as a reducing agent can also quench the formed oxidizing species in the o3 s2o3 2 process it means that spiking s2o3 2 in a high concentration would inhibit the degradations of refractory organic contaminants hence process performance on the contaminant degradations was highly dependent on the s2o3 2 o3 residual concentrations of dissolved o3 were monitored during the reaction and are shown in fig s4 evidently only 10 of the initial o3 concentration 40 μm was decomposed in the absence of s2o3 2 with increasing concentrations of s2o3 2 decomposition of dissolved o3 was more rapid for example the residual concentration of o3 decreased from 31 5 μm to 3 3 μm when s2o3 2 concentration was increased from 2 μm to 12 μm when the s2o3 2 concentration was above 16 μm dissolved o3 decomposed completely within 1 s it is ascribed to the high rate constant for the reaction of o3 with s2o3 2 which was determined to be 1 5 108 m 1s 1 by a competitive kinetic method see text s1 and fig s5 these results were compatible with the superfast degradation of atz by o3 s2o3 2 3 2 identification of reactive species in the o3 s2o3 2 system results mentioned above indicate that the reactive oxidizing species produced from the interaction of o3 with s2o3 2 are responsible to a large extent for the degradation of organic contaminants as expected molecular o3 and oh are typically considered to be the chief reactive oxidizing species in the oxidation of organic contaminants during ozonation all of the above mentioned organic contaminants show extremely low reactivity toward o3 but high reactivity toward oh the second order rate constants for reactions of these organic contaminants with o3 and oh are shown in table s1 presumably enhanced degradation of these o3 refractory compounds can be attributed to oh generated by the o3 s2o3 2 process to verify the generation of oh during the reaction of o3 with s2o3 2 radical scavenging experiments were performed with the addition of excess oh scavenger t buoh 10 mm as can be seen in fig 2 a the degradation of atz by o3 s2o3 2 was considerably inhibited in the presence of excess t buoh with less than 10 of initial atz being degraded similarly geosmin and 2 mib degradation was significantly inhibited by the addition of 10 mm t buoh see fig s6 these two odorous compounds are recalcitrant to o3 and typically degraded by oh during ozonation these findings imply that the reaction of o3 with s2o3 2 presumably generates oh which is likely to be principally responsible for the enhancement in degradations of o3 refractory organic compounds to provide further direct evidence for the formation of oh from the reaction of o3 with s2o3 2 epr experiments were performed using dmpo as a spin trapping agent in the systems of o3 alone o3 so3 2 and o3 s2o3 2 as presented in fig 2 b a signal for the dmpo oh spin adduct 1 2 2 1 quartet with hyperfine constants of α n α h 14 9 g was detected for the o3 s2o3 2 process which was not visible in the processes of o3 and o3 so3 2 this result further confirmed that s2o3 2 successfully activated o3 to generate oh 3 3 oh yield from the o3 s2o3 2 process to better understand the formation of oh from the reaction of o3 with s2o3 2 the oh yield was evaluated which is termed as oh production as a function of ozone consumption ϕ δ oh δ o3 the oh yield was obtained via the t buoh assay which is based on the quantification of formaldehyde formed during the reaction of a hydroxyl radical with a large excess of t buoh fig 3 shows that the oh yield from the o3 s2o3 2 process was approximately 0 216 3 4 o3 s2o3 2 reaction mechanism the stoichiometry of the o3 s2o3 2 reaction was determined by measuring the formation of so4 2 and the consumption of dissolved o3 by addition of s2o3 2 at a concentration range from 2 μm to 12 μm and at a constant o3 concentration of 40 μm at ph 7 a high concentration of t buoh 10 mm was added into the above experimental solutions in order to avoid the potential influence of oh generated from the reaction of o3 with s2o3 2 in the s2o3 2 concentration range tested a complete transformation from s2o3 2 to so4 2 was observed as shown in fig s7 the formation of so4 2 increased linearly with increasing consumption of o3 the result suggests that 3 mol o3 are required for the elimination of 1 mol s2o3 2 and the concomitant formation of 2 mol so4 2 furthermore it indicated that the reaction of o3 with s2o3 2 was not the only oxygen transfer reaction if the reaction of o3 and s2o3 2 proceeded as the only o transfer reaction 5 mol o3 would be required it is well known that adduct formation is generally the first step in ozone reactions this pathway has been confirmed in many examples such as for reactions of ozone with halide ions amines sulfur compounds and even transition metal ions von sonntag and von gunten 2012 similarly it can be reasonably proposed that adduct formation at the sulfur atom is the first step during the reaction of o3 with s2o3 2 as depicted in reaction 6 as shown in fig 4 the formation of adduct cp1 is exothermic by 27 89 kcal mol at the m06 2x 6 311 g level indicating that cp1 is readily formed subsequently cp1 formation may be followed by o2 release which is generally referred to as an o atom transfer reaction see reaction 7 according to the spin conversion rule spin multiplicity of the product formed from the ozone adduct must be a singlet thus forming a singlet oxygen 1o2 the formation of 1o2 and osso3 2 is exothermic by 3 13 kcal mol a similar reaction pathway is observed in the reaction of o3 with hs mark et al 2011 in competition with the release of 1o2 adduct cp1 can also proceed with internal cyclization and o transfer which results in the formation of oo o sso3 2 cp2 as detailed in reaction 8 via transition state ts1 the energy barrier for cp1 to ts1 is only 1 10 kcal mol while cp2 1 lies below cp1 by 34 98 kcal mol indicating that this process is both kinetically and thermodynamically favored cp2 1 can isomerize to cp2 0 by overcoming an energy barrier of 5 84 kcal mol via transition state ts2 cp2 0 can cleave heterolytically to generate a sulfoxide radical cation osso3 and a superoxide radical anion o2 see reaction 9 reaction 9 is endothermic by only 8 56 kcal mol in the presence of h cp2 0 can form a peracid as given in reaction 10 which is exothermic by 141 71 kcal mol the formed peracid hoo o sso3 can cleave into a sulfoxide radical cation and ho2 as shown in reaction 11 the activation energy of this reaction has been calculated at g 14 2 kcal mol it should be noted that ho2 is in equilibrium with its conjugate base o2 with pka 4 8 as indicated in reaction 12 bielski et al 1985 consequently the equilibrium of ho2 o2 will shift towards o2 even at a marginally acidic ph the total potential energy profile supports the hypothesis that o2 can be readily formed from the reaction between o3 and s2o3 2 at 298 15 k and 1 atm o2 can undergo a rapid electron transfer reaction with o3 to produce an ozonide radical o3 as given in reaction 13 sehested et al 1983 according to the literature o3 is a critical precursor for oh detailed in reactions 14 and 15 elliot and mccracken 1989 6 o3 s2o3 2 ooosso3 2 7 ooosso3 2 osso3 2 1o2 8 ooosso3 2

of contaminants 3 5 1 solution ph solution ph is a critical factor for effective oxidation of organic contaminants by ozonation since reaction rates for ozone mediated compound dissociation are ph dependent as shown in fig 5 the elimination of atz exhibited a monotonic increase from 30 7 to 59 8 in the absence of s2o3 2 and an increase in ph from 4 to 9 this is consistent with the well documented fact that increasing ph favors the degradations of refractory organic contaminants during ozonation yang et al 2016a b 2017a b interestingly however atz elimination exhibited an increase followed by a decrease when spiked with 12 20 μm s2o3 2 during ozonation in the same ph range this implies that addition of a certain concentration of s2o3 2 changes the ph dependency of atz degradation during ozonation it should be noted that the enhancing effect of s2o3 2 on atz degradation by ozonation declined as ph increased for example atz degradation increased from 42 1 to 59 8 when s2o3 2 concentration was increased from 4 μm to 20 μm at ph 4 but decreased from 86 5 to 58 3 with the same s2o3 2 concentration range at ph 9 two aspects that could explain the ph dependent trend at ph 4 9 are 1 a ph increase leads to a decrease in o3 available to react with s2o3 2 an increase in ph enhances the reaction of o3 with oh and ensuing oh chain reactions which are in competition with the reaction of o3 with s2o3 2 a decrease in o3 available to react with s2o3 2 results in elevated formation of oh scavenged by s2o3 2 2 ph shifts the equilibrium of hso3 so3 2 a certain amount of hso3 so3 2 was observed in the reactions of o3 with excess s2o3 2 see fig s8 indicating that hso3 so3 2 is a significant intermediate in the reaction between o3 and s2o3 2 it can scavenge dissolved o3 and oh formed in the process hso3 so3 2 exists in different forms at various ph levels it has two pka values being pka1 1 9 and pka2 7 2 hso3 so3 2 exists predominantly as hso3 in a ph range of 1 9 7 2 and as so3 2 when the ph is above 7 2 see fig s9 hoigné et al 1985 rate constants for reactions of oh and o3 with hso3 so3 2 are both ph dependent oh reacts with so3 2 with a second order rate constant of 5 5 109 m 1s 1 which is slightly higher than that of the hso3 reaction 4 5 109 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 o3 reacts with so3 2 with a second order rate constant of 1 3 1 5 109 m 1s 1 which is three orders of magnitude higher than that of hso3 3 7 8 105 m 1s 1 hoffmann 1986 liu et al 2001 this suggests that a higher fraction of oh formed from the reaction of o3 and s2o3 2 would be scavenged by hso3 so3 2 at higher ph thereby reducing the amount of oh available for degradation of organic contaminants simultaneously hso3 so3 2 would also consume more o3 without oh formation at higher ph 3 5 2 bicarbonate bicarbonate is commonly detected in natural water as hco3 or co3 2 with a pka of 10 33 see reaction 16 it is typically considered as a scavenger of oh producing co3 during advanced oxidation processes via reaction 17 and 18 acero and von gunten 2000 since co3 has a lower reactivity than oh the transformation of oh to co3 would lead to a decline in degradation efficiency of recalcitrant organic contaminants as shown in fig 6 a elimination of atz dea 2 mib geosmin and omethoate decreased from 88 to 61 59 31 100 55 85 43 and 22 10 respectively with increasing bicarbonate concentration ranging from 0 to 4 mm in the o3 s2o3 2 process it should be noted that co3 formed by this process can selectively oxidize a number of organic and inorganic compounds yang et al 2019a neta et al 1988 such as atz with a second order rate constant of 4 0 106 m 1s 1 canonica et al 2005 huang and mabury 2000 however the degradation efficiency of organic contaminants by co3 in this case is inferior to that of oh accordingly the inhibiting effect of bicarbonate on organic contaminant degradation by o3 s2o3 2 varied depending on the organic contaminant 16 hco3 h co3 2 pka 10 33 17 hco3 oh co3 h2o k 9 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 18 co3 2 oh co3 ho k 10 3 9 108 m 1 s 1 3 5 3 humic acid humic acid is an important constituent of natural organic matter nom and thus was chosen as an indicator of nom with the aim of investigating its influence on the degradation of organic contaminants during the o3 s2o3 2 process as shown in fig 6 b degradation of atz dea 2 mib geosmin and omethoate showed a slight increase followed by a decline with increasing concentration of humic acid ranging from 0 1 to 0 5 mg c l evidently humic acid slightly enhances organic contaminant degradation at lower concentrations 0 1 0 2 mg c l while inhibiting it at higher concentrations 0 4 mg c l humic acid played a dual role as an activator of o3 for oh generation and a scavenger of oh generated in the o3 s2o3 2 process therefore the impact of nom on the degradation of organic contaminants by the o3 s2o3 2 process depended largely on the constituents of nom and the molar ratio of o3 and nom 3 5 4 contaminant degradation by o3 s2o3 2 in real water matrices degradation efficiency of organic contaminants by ozonation in the presence of s2o3 2 was evaluated in real water matrices experiments were conducted in surface water and tap water spiked with 2 μm atz as shown in fig 7 atz degradation exhibited an increase followed by a decrease in both surface and tap water backgrounds optimal s2o3 2 o3 for atz degradation was 0 06 for surface water and 0 14 for tap water this variation could be as a result of differing ph and water matrices of surface and tap water which can affect the extent to which dissolved o3 is consumed it should be noted that addition of s2o3 2 enhanced atz degradation by ozonation in a concentration range of 2 8 μm s2o3 2 o3 0 03 0 13 in surface water and 2 20 μm s2o3 2 o3 0 05 0 48 in tap water in conclusion addition of an appropriate concentration of s2o3 2 is indeed effective for accelerating degradations of recalcitrant organic contaminants by ozonation in real water matrices 4 conclusion in previous studies s2o3 2 has typically been used as a quenching agent in ozonation experiments without realizing its accelerating role in degradations of refractory organic contaminants by o3 this work initially demonstrates that s2o3 2 surprisingly activates o3 to produce oh in a yield of 0 216 rendering it available for rapid water decontamination the decontamination efficacy highly depends on the molar ratio of s2o3 2 and o3 a plausible mechanism for oh formation is proposed for the reaction of o3 with s2o3 2 using density function theory dft the availability of o3 s2o3 2 used in real water matrices is also confirmed nowadays o3 is widely used followed by a biological treatment step for removal of assimilable organic carbon aoc or biodegradable organic carbon bdoc to guarantee the disinfection and or oxidation efficiency o3 is readily overdosed the residual o3 may inhibit the subsequent biological process that plays a positive role in organic contaminants degradations an addition of s2o3 2 might have potential to quench the residual o3 and simultaneously enhance the degradations of refractory organic contaminants in addition undesirable by products such as bromate are typically observed during ozonation of bromide containing water yang et al 2019a b 2017c von gunten 2018 hence further studies will be performed to assess the formation of bromate and other brominated by products which may arise from the o3 s2o3 2 process declaration of competing interest the authors declare

17988,dewatering and sulfide control are the key challenges in treating chemically enhanced primary treatment cept sludge in this study an electrochemical pretreatment ept approach with the input of 10 v 800 ma was explored for simultaneously improving the dewaterability of cept sludge and eliminating its sulfide production the effects of different electrode materials carbon and titanium and ept durations from 5 to 15 min were documented to reveal the underlying ept mechanism ept with titanium electrodes titanium ept led to limited improvement in dewaterability and sulfide control ept with carbon electrodes carbon ept for 15 min however led to decreases in capillary suction time and specific resistance in filtration of over 80 and the suppression of about 99 of hydrogen sulfide h2s g production over 5 days of anaerobic storage analysis of the characteristics of treated cept sludge revealed that carbon ept disintegrated sludge flocs with 70 reduction in sludge particle sizes and release of aromatic and tyrosine protein like substances thus enhancing sludge dewaterability the sulfur balance in the liquid and gaseous phases showed that most of the sulfur containing compounds remained in the solid phase as aliphatic sulfur and sulfonic acid after carbon ept thereby mitigating sulfide emission while the pattern of sulfur distribution in sludge with titanium ept was dominated by sulfide it was similar to the control sample reduction in bacteria associated with sulfide production i e lachnospiraceae in cept sludge after carbon ept also contributed to sulfide elimination this study demonstrates that ept can be a superior option for simultaneously enhancing the dewaterability of cept sludge and mitigating its sulfide production graphical abstract image 1 keywords sulfate reduction sludge treatment dewaterability enhancement electrochemical pretreatment 1 introduction the sludge production rate in the chemically enhanced primary treatment cept process is about 5 v v which is much higher than that of the activated sludge based process 1 metcalf and eddy 2014 with the assistance of chemical coagulants the cept process achieves high removal rates of total suspended solids organic matter and nutrients and allows the sedimentation basins to operate at twice the overflow rate in conventional primary treatment li et al 2018 due to its stable and efficient performance and large treatment capacity as well as the low energy consumption 0 4 0 5 kwh m3 curtis 2010 ødegaard 2016 the cept process has been widely applied in densely populated cities e g shanghai los angeles hong kong and is also an attractive wastewater treatment option for developing countries wang et al 2009 lin et al 2017 however the huge quantity of sludge produced by the cept process is always a concern for instance around 4000 tonnes of sludge 95 of the water content are generated per day from hong kong s stonecutter island sewage treatment works scitw the world s largest cept plant with a treatment capacity of 1 9 million m3 d hkdsd 2015 swann et al 2017 the treatment of cept sludge is becoming one of the most challenging environmental problems dewatering is an integral and essential step for reducing the sludge volume prior to subsequent treatment however cept sludge is notoriously difficult to be dewatered due to the strong repulsive force between sludge particles murugesan et al 2014 moreover the application of sulfate containing coagulants e g ferric sulfate and alum and or seawater infiltration intrusion in coastal cities can lead to a high concentration of sulfate ions in cept sludge pikaar et al 2014 the sulfate ions are later reduced to hydrogen sulfide h2s through a biological sulfate reduction process during sludge storage dewatering and transportation hao et al 2014 fisher et al 2018 causing severe toxic malodors and corrosion problems enhancing dewaterability and controlling sulfide are therefore the main challenges in achieving safe and efficient cept sludge treatment and disposal the addition of a polyelectrolyte 15 kg tonne of dry sludge is presently the most commonly used pretreatment in wastewater treatment plants wwtps to enhance sludge dewatering feng et al 2009 polyelectrolytes neutralize the negative charges on the sludge surface thus reducing the repulsive force between sludge flocs and facilitating solid liquid separation murugesan et al 2014 however the residual polymers in dewatered sludge and rejected water may pose an ecological hazard as their monomers are neurotoxic and carcinogenic polymer addition also results in a high operating cost of about 50 65 us tonne dried solid ds chen et al 2002 liang et al 2019 more importantly some cationic organic polymers e g polyacrylamide can be decomposed during sludge storage and transportation producing strong malodors chang et al 2005 the odorous gases including h2s g generated from cept sludge are typically treated with auxiliary processes such as physical adsorption chemical scrubbing bio filtration or oxidant addition e g chlorine hydrogen peroxide lin et al 2018 for example the hong kong government has invested around 0 2 billion us in scitw for mitigating sludge h2s by building covers bio scrubbing facilities and chemical dosing pipework although dosing with oxidants such as chlorine can effectively eliminate h2s h2s can be regenerated during sludge transportation due to the existence of sulfate ions additionally the added oxidants can be rapidly consumed by organics in the sludge before sulfide generation saby et al 2002 hao et al 2014 which deteriorates the effectiveness of oxidants for sulfide control more importantly current strategies cannot achieve sludge sulfide mitigation and dewaterability improvement simultaneously resulting in higher capital cost and cumbersome operation and maintenance electrochemical pretreatment ept has gained increasing interest as an emerging technique for treating sludge thanks to its small footprint ease of operation and zero chemical addition barrios et al 2015 masihi and gholikandi 2018 zeng et al 2019 ept has demonstrated its superiority in improving the dewaterability of biological waste sludge bws with 50 v input the dewaterability of bws can be enhanced by 36 yuan et al 2011 furthermore gharibi et al 2013 demonstrated that ept at 20 v improved the bws dewaterability by 76 disruption of the hydrated structure of bws flocs e g extracellular polymeric substances eps and cell lysis is considered to be the main mechanism behind the dewaterability enhancement via ept xiao et al 2019 on the other hand the potential of applying ept in the suppression of bws malodors including h2s was recently highlighted she et al 2017 even though the mechanism is unclear release of sludge bound metals via ept is regarded as one cause for sludge sulfide mitigation zeng et al 2019 meanwhile the potential contributions of oxidants such as chlorine and ohms heating produced via ept for sulfide control i e sulfide oxidation and or srb inactivation cannot be neglected these above studies on electrochemical bws treatment gave us the idea that the dewaterability and sulfide issues of cept sludge can be simultaneously addressed by ept more importantly cept sludge with a high conductivity resulting from coagulant dosing e g 15 45 mg l of fecl3 and or brackish water or seawater infiltration is compatible for ept he et al 2017 this study explores the potential of applying ept in enhancing the dewaterability of cept sludge and concurrently mitigating sulfide production the effectiveness and mechanism of ept with electrodes made of different materials titanium and carbon and different treatment times on sludge dewaterability and sulfide production were evaluated sludge dewaterability in terms of water content capillary suction time cst and specific resistance in filtration srf and sulfide control effectiveness i e dissolved sulfide and h2s g were systematically examined the changes in the characteristics of the sludge and microbial community structure were investigated and discussed the outcome of this study is essential in the optimization and scaling up of the ept process for efficient sludge treatment 2 methods and materials 2 1 cept sludge cept sludge was collected from a sludge transportation pipeline between the final

2009 1 energy consumption kwh l e cell it 1000v s where e cell is the applied voltage v i is the current a t is the time h and v s is the sample volume l the operation cost of ept is mainly contributed by energy consumption and the electrical cost in hong kong is was us 0 12 kwh 2 3 sludge dewaterability analysis the cst srf and water content were examined to evaluate the sludge dewatering behavior each test was run in triplicate and the average value was taken the water content after srf was measured following standard methods apha 2005 in the cst examination a stainless steel tube with an inner radius of 0 5 cm was used and the time it took for the sludge filtrate to wet the filter paper whatman 17 from a radius of 1 0 3 0 cm was defined as the cst the srf of the sludge was performed in a büchner funnel under a vacuum tightness of 0 05 mpa 50 ml of sludge was poured into the funnel fitted with a filter paper whatman 1 the volume of the collected filtrate at different times was then recorded until the flow of water stopped the srf is calculated using the following equations 1 srf 2bpa 2 μc 2 c 1 c i 100 c i c f 100 c f where b is the slope determined from

filtrate kg m3 μ is the filtrate viscosity n s m2 c i is the initial sludge water content without filtration and c f is the final water content after srf tests 2 4 sludge sulfide analysis sulfide arises before sludge dewatering and continuously accumulates during sludge storage and transportation sulfide present in wet sludge or sludge cake emits h2s g which is recognized as a surrogate of malodor problems in sewage treatment facilities to evaluate the sludge sulfide production different sulfur compounds remaining after ept were analyzed including h2s g in the gaseous phase dissolved sulfide in the liquid phase and sulfur containing compounds in the solid phase to mimic the in situ condition 90 ml of treated sludge was collected and transferred into 125 ml serum bottles for incubation for over five days under anaerobic conditions for sulfide analysis chen et al 2018 the serum bottles were sealed using teflon faced butyl rubber septa the sealed serum bottles were placed on a shaker operated at a temperature of 38 5 c and 750 rpm during the whole process syringes 60 ml with 21g 37 mm needles were used to relieve the pressure in the serum bottles and determine the produced gas volume h2s g in the gaseous phase was gradually dissolved into the alkaline solution ph 11 for sulfide determination using the methylene blue method apha 2005 liquid samples were collected using a disposable 10 ml syringe sulfate and dissolved sulfide were accordingly measured in the liquid samples jiang et al 2009 sludge samples without ept control a treated with ti ept for 15 min ti 15a and carbon ept for 15 min carbon 15a were immediately freeze dried for x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis another batch of xps analysis for sludge samples was conducted after five days anaerobic storage and the corresponding sample names are control b ti 15b and carbon 15b respectively fig s1 2 5 microbial community analysis after anaerobic storage for five days the samples ti 15 and c 15 were taken for microbial analysis with raw sludge as the comparison total genomic dna was extracted from the sludge pellets for bar coded pyrosequencing pcr bio rad s 1000 was used for amplification of the bacterial 16s rdna genes using primer 515f 806r and the v4 hypervariable regions were targeted pcr amplification was conducted with thermal cycling 94 c for 3 min followed by 30 cycles of 94 c for 30 s 50 c for 30 s and 72 c for 60 s and a final extension at 72 c for 10 min 2 6 analytical methods 2 6 1 sludge characteristics zeta potential of cept sludge was measured before and after ept using a zetaplus brookhaven instrument corporation usa xps physical electronics 5600 multi technique system was performed to examine the surface properties and elemental composition e g sulfur and nitrogen of the samples the particle size of sludge was measured with a laser diffraction particle size analyzer ls 13 320 beckman coulter usa dx is the diameter corresponding to x of the cumulative undersize e g d50 is the median diameter 2 6 2 sludge supernatant analysis after filtration the concentration of sulfate so4 2 was measured using an ion chromatograph shimadzu corporation hic 20a super fitted with a conductivity detector and an ic sa2 analytical column the concentrations of h2s and dissolved sulfide were measured with the methylene blue method apha 2005 soluble proteins pn were determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay with bovine serum albumin as standard smith et al 1985 while soluble polysaccharides ps were determined using the colorimetric method dubois et al 1956 the natural organic matter released before and after treatment was characterized using three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3deem fluorescence eem was performed f 4500 fl hitachi with scanning emission spectra from 250 to 500 nm in 1 nm increments and excitation wavelength from 230 to 400 nm in 10 nm increments ph was measured with a benchtop ph meter multi 9310 wtw germany mlss and mlvss were determined according to standard methods apha 2005 sludge conductivity was determined using a conductivity probe sx 650 sanxing china 2 6 3 statistical analysis pearson s correlation analysis was used to evaluate the correlations between i sludge dewaterability water content cst and srf and ii sludge particle size i e d10 d50 and d90 the correlation coefficient ranged from 0 to 1 where 1 indicates a perfect correlation while 0 denotes no correlation the statistical significance level was defined at the 95 confidence level p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 sludge dewaterability 3 1 1 dewaterability evaluation improving sludge dewaterability by reducing the water content volume reduction and enhancing filterability dewatering rate can significantly lower the operating cost of wwtps srf cst and water content are used to gauge sludge dewaterability and filterability hu et al 2018 specifically a lower water content a smaller srf and a shorter cst indicate a better sludge dewaterability the raw cept sludge was characterized by a long cst of 243 13 s a large srf of 188 17 1012 m kg and high water content of 95 1 in the dewatered sludge fig 2 a slight enhancement in dewaterability was achieved by ept with titanium electrodes titanium ept for 5 15 min the cst and srf values decreased to 189 9 s and 141 9 1012 m kg and the water content of dewatered sludge reduced to 91 in ti 15 however a significant enhancement in dewaterability was recorded for ept with carbon electrodes carbon ept in c 15 cst and srf dropped by 84 and 88 to 38 2s and 23 5 1012 m kg respectively with a water content of 72 in the dewatered sludge fig 2 the cept sludge was more susceptible to ept than bws and can be ascribed to the differences in sludge characteristics ept with 20 v input for 20 min can reduce the cst of bws by 36 through destroying the eps and cell membranes yuan et al 2011 by applying a lower input voltage of 10 v for a shorter treatment time of 15 min in c 15 the dewaterability of cept sludge was enhanced by over 80 bws was dominated by eps and biomass and its compacted and hydrated structure can only be disintegrated with intensive energy input the cept sludge possessed a high solid content rich organics and high salt content resulting in an elevated conductivity 4 5 ms cm that is about three times that of bws shao et al 2007 ibeid et al 2013 an increase in conductivity can help improve the current density and electrochemical efficacy thereby enhancing the effectiveness of ept 3 1 2 particle size and sludge dewaterability the filterability of sludge is highly related to particle size karr and keinath 1978 particle size distributions of raw and treated cept sludge using carbon ept and titanium ept are presented in the volume percentages shown in fig 3 overall the peak volume percentage of particle size shifted towards the left side smaller particle size after ept for 5 15 min raw sludge particles had a prominent peak at approximately 1168 1755 μm with a mean diameter of 267 10 μm the peak shifted down to 777 1020 μm 592 890 μm and 15 88 μm in c 5 c 10 and c 15 respectively and the mean diameters dropped to 144 17 μm 116 9 μm and 73 15 μm fig 3 in comparison only a slight change in particle size was obtained after titanium ept with mean particle sizes of 253 20 μm 213 8 μm and 168 10 μm in ti 5 ti 10 and ti 15 respectively pearson s correlation analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between particle size and dewaterability and the results are summarized in table 1 correlation values among d50 water content cst and srf are all greater than 0 89 implying a strong correlation between the mean particle size and dewaterability this correlation can also be confirmed through linear regression analysis as shown in fig s2 specifically d50 shown a strongest linear relationship with cst r 2 0 9349 followed by srf r 2 0 8835 indicating that sludge with a smaller particle size process a better dewaterability feng et al 2009 reported the relationship between sludge particle size and dewaterability however they observed significant decreases in cst and srf with increasing particle size after ultrasonic treatment which is contrary to our result and could be due to the addition of a polyelectrolyte during the ultrasonic treatment feng et al 2009 polyelectrolytes are effective in interparticle bridging formation of larger flocs and surface charge neutralization repulsive force reduction thus removing the interstitial water and improving sludge dewaterability lee and liu 2000 without any chemical addition in our study irreversible disintegration caused by ept was the major cause of the interstitial water release which is consistent with hydrodynamic cavitation and fenton sludge treatment cai et al 2018 the changes in the zeta potential of cept sludge further support the abovementioned statement on dewaterability fig s3 3 1 3 released components and structure of organic matter soluble organic matter released after ept was determined and further examined by 3deem fluorescence spectroscopy the concentrations of soluble cod pn and ps released from cept sludge with carbon ept were much higher than that of ti ept fig s4 this result was further supported by 3deem analysis the spectrum intensity remained almost unchanged after titanium ept for 5 15 min but it became stronger after carbon ept for 5 15 min indicating more soluble organic matter was released fig 4 two dominant fluorescent peaks were observed at λex em 240 320 nm and λex em 290 320 nm corresponding to the aromatic protein like substances and tryptophan protein like microbial byproducts according to the eem region chen et al 2003 the fluorescence intensities of the peaks in the eem spectra were in line with the tendency of sludge dewaterability indicated by cst srf and water content fig 2 the content of aromatic and tryptophan protein like substances in sludge has been found to be related to dewaterability zhen et al 2012a b li et al 2016 as confirmed by our findings with both aromatic and tryptophan protein like substances being more hydrophilic xu et al 2013 wu et al 2016 hydrophilic groups jeopardize sludge dewatering by attracting water with sludge flocs a higher concentration of hydrophilic substances in the bulk liquid implies more loss of hydrophilic groups from the sludge li et al 2019 directional transformation of aromatic and tryptophan protein like substances from the particulate to soluble phase caused by ept is therefore in favor of sludge dewaterability on the other hand tryptophan like substances are known to play an anchoring role in cell membranes and aromatic protein like substances and are abundant in the eps of sludge mahalakshmi et al 2007 wang et al 2018 however the intensive release of proteins or intracellular substances would also make the sludge sticky by increasing sludge viscosity which in turn would hinder the dewatering li et al 2020 an obvious increase about 53 in viscosity was observed after ept at 40 v for 20 min causing more difficulties in dewatering li et al 2016 in this study the viscosity remained at around 40 5 mpa s from the control test to c 15 fig s5 this was probably due to the lower content of eps in the cept sludge than in the bws and thus the impact of viscosity increase was not obvious 3 2 sulfide mitigation by ept 3 2 1 h2s in the gaseous phase h2s resulting from the bacterial reduction of sulfate is toxic and corrosive and it has been the target of malodor control during cept sludge treatment and disposal sun et al 2016 dalby et al 2018 the accumulated gas included h2s g of raw and treated cept sludge using titanium and carbon electrodes after five days of storage at 38 c are shown in fig 5 the control test generated 46 1 ml of gas containing 18193 712 ppm h2s g while all the treated sludge produced a lower gas volume with a maximum reduction of the total gas of 64 in c 15 in addition cept sludge with carbon ept shows better h2s g mitigation than that of titanium ept specifically by extending the treatment time from 5 to 15 min increases in h2s g removal efficiency of about 9 53 and 99 were achieved corresponding to the concentrations of 16539 705 8485 682 and 110 17 ppm in carbon ept i e c 5 c 10 and c 15 however titanium ept resulted in a higher h2s g concentration than the control test reaching 21573 665 22076 632 and 19416 657 ppm in ti 5 ti 10 and ti 15 respectively in addition to the decomposition of sulfur containing organics such as amino acids i e cysteine and taurine gostelow et al 2001 the h2s g resulting from the bacterial reduction of sulfate is the largest contributor to sulfide production dalby et al 2018 therefore sulfur transformations including sulfate and dissolved sulfide transformations were further investigated in the liquid phase 3 2 2 sulfide in the liquid phase changes in sulfate and total dissolved sulfide concentrations in the liquid phase overtime after ept are shown in fig 6 the initial concentration of sulfate in the cept sludge samples was 320 3 mg s l and the sulfate was fully consumed by the end of all tests within 24 h however carbon ept and titanium ept have significantly different effects on the total dissolved sulfide production as well as the sulfate reduction kinetics the transient concentration of sulfate showed a linear relationship with the time and fitted to the zero order kinetics with a reduction rate of 1 4 10 6 mol l 1 s 1 as s in control fig 6a titanium ept considerably hindered the sulfate reduction process for example ti 15 decreased the kinetics value to 4 8 10 7 mol l 1 s 1 as s in contrast carbon ept had little effect on inhibiting the sulfate reduction process specifically the sulfate reduction kinetics of c 5 c 10 and c 15 were around 1 4 10 6 1 3 10 6 and 1 0 10 6 mol l 1 s 1 as s respectively with the r 2 values exceeding 0 90 although biological sulfide production was slowed down with titanium ept the total sulfide production was not reduced about 83 of the reduced sulfate was converted to dissolved sulfide 265 11 mg s l within 50 h in titanium ept which is similar to that of the control test 270 10 mg s l fig 6b c 5 had a limited effect on the dissolved sulfide removal however only 112 4 and 8 2 mg s l of dissolved sulfide were detected in c 10 and c 15 after 50 h resulting in sulfide reductions of 59 and 97 respectively these results are consistent with the h2s g analysis in the gas phase based on the mass balance the amount of s from sulfate was converted neither to the liquid phase dissolved sulfide nor to the gas phase h2s g therefore the solid sludge phase was analyzed for the missing s 3 2 3 sulfur in the solid phase the sulfur containing compounds in the solid phases of the raw sludge and treated sludge before and after storage for five days were examined by xps fig 7 classification of the binding energies of different s species was based on the literature li et al 2009 liu et al 2012 the five peaks of sulfate 169 8 0 2 ev sulfonic acid 168 5 0 1 ev aromatic sulfur 164 6 0 2 ev aliphatic sulfur 163 5 0 1 ev and inorganic sulfur 162 2 0 4 ev can be seen in the s 2p spectrum of the sludge samples sulfate aromatic sulfur and aliphatic sulfur were the major compounds in the control a ti 15a and c 15a samples indicating that applying ept for 15 min had limited immediate effects on these sulfur containing compounds in the sludge as shown in fig 7a b and c however after 5 days of storage the total sulfur content and the composition changed significantly sulfate disappeared in the sludge fig 7d e and f which is consistent with the results of the liquid phase examination sulfate reduction pattern fig 6a the content of the sulfur containing compounds in ti 15b was similar to that of control b as indicated by the deconvolution results of xps analysis table s1 additionally the sulfur containing compounds in c 15b were dominated by aliphatic sulfur 48 and sulfonic acid 39 which increased by 12 and 10 respectively compared with the control b oxidation of dissolved sulfide is one of the main mechanisms for sludge sulfide elimination he et al 2009 around 90 of sulfide in the electrochemical system can be removed through indirect sulfide oxidation with different intermediate oxidants e g o2 and cl2 resulting from different electrode materials ntagia et al 2019 for instance carbon based electrodes tend to produce o2 while ti based electrodes tend to trigger chlorine generation pikaar et al 2011 however no regeneration of sulfate was observed with the removal of around 99 of the dissolved sulfide fig 6 implying that dissolved sulfide was not oxidized to sulfate after titanium ept and carbon ept it is likely that the oxidants were consumed by the organic substances in cept sludge before the sulfide began to be generated the missing s in this work based on the xps results seems to be stored in the solid phase as the organic fraction aliphatic sulfur and sulfonic acid these species are stable under ambient conditions and only decompose to h2s at high temperatures 150 c lin et al 2017 but their detailed formation pathway with ept is still not clear 3 2 4 microbial community analysis sulfide production from cept sludge is primarily attributed to microorganisms therefore the microbial community structure in the raw and treated cept sludge after five days of cultivation was characterized at the phylum level the raw and treated cept sludge samples showed similar distribution patterns in which firmicutes and bacteroidetes were the two main phyla fig s6 the microbial community structure changed significantly at the genus level fig 8 the most dominant genera of the microbial community in raw cept sludge were lachnospiraceae nk3a20 group 44 and u29 b03 23 for the microbial community in the c 15 sample however the abundance of the lachnospiraceae nk3a20 group and u29 b03 was reduced by 42 and 22 respectively leaving bacteroides 36 and ruminococcus 1 14 to become the major genera instead lachnospiraceae which are abundant in sewage sludge newton et al 2011 have genes linked to dissimilatory sulfate reduction for importing sulfate into the cytoplasm and producing h2s as a major metabolic end product hedberg et al 2012 haas 2016 furthermore lachnospiraceae are also responsible for biogas production e g hydrogen and carbon dioxide sträuber et al 2012 wang et al 2017 the microbial community analysis is consistent with the high biogas production described in section 3 2 1 u29 b03 are capable of degrading complex organics in the environment which is in favor of sulfide generation during the storage period baldwin et al 2015 on the contrary the ti 15 sample showed diverse genera of organisms which may facilitate the degradation of sludge particles and subsequently enhance sulfide generation 4 the potential application of ept development and application of the electrochemical process for sludge dewaterability enhancement and sulfide elimination are highly restricted by the high operating and maintenance costs and process stability as shown in table s2 ept in this study was compared and discussed against previous studies with emphasis on the electrode material operation mode energy consumption and effectiveness most studies use ti substrate electrodes with mixed metal coatings and require chemical addition such as persulfate s2o8 2 ferrous ion fe ii zero valent iron fe 0 permanganate mno4 and bisulfite hso3 zhen et al 2013 li et al 2016 guo et al 2017 masihi and gholikandi 2018 xiao et al 2019 the added chemicals can be activated as radicals and or flocculants by the electrical field facilitating disruption of the sludge flocs and ease the separation of the liquid from the sludge particles however chemical dosing is not the first option which is associated with additional operating costs and safety and health issues as well as secondary pollution generation pikaar et al 2015 without any chemical addition our study demonstrates the superiority of ept over previous studies in terms of dewaterability improvement energy consumption 4 kwh m3 and treatment efficiency 15 min the electrode material is crucial for electrochemical sludge treatment different electrode materials usually have specific impacts on sludge dewaterability in general electrodes can be categorized into two types active and nonactive chen 2004 active electrode made of carbon or graphite possesses a high affinity to adsorb hydroxyl radicals produced from water discharge thereby forming the chemisorbed active oxygen on the electrode surface the active oxygen only permits the primary oxidation of organics however the nonactive electrode such as titanium can physically adsorb hydroxyl radical and allow nonselective oxidation of organics it was found that the primary oxidation with carbon based electrodes is more beneficial to sludge dewatering for instance the advanced oxidation process using free radicals for promoting sludge dewaterability is the primary oxidation zhen et al 2012a b the carbon electrode performed better than the titanium electrode in this study not only for dewaterability enhancement but also in sulfide mitigation regarding the sulfide control she et al 2017 mentioned that h2s and other malodor components such as dimethylsulfide and free ammonia were mostly removed in a pilot scale by the electrochemical process but the mechanism was unclear by analyzing sulfide transformation in the gaseous liquid and solid phases the mechanism of sulfide elimination via ept was explored in this work sulfate reduction was not inhibited by the electrical field and most of the sulfur was transferred from the sulfate sink to the solid phase as organic sulfur moreover abundant reduction in sulfide producing bacteria can assist in sulfide generation control over the long term ept was proposed to be installed after the final sedimentation tank the chemical cost for dewatering 98 water content was around us 1 m3 zhai et al 2012 and the average cost for sulfide removal was estimated at us 5 kg s zhang et al 2008 one cubic meter of cept sludge contains 320 g s sulfate concentration is 320 mg s l with about 80 conversion from sulfate to sulfide fig 6 so 256 g s of sulfide needs to be removed the total chemical cost for dewatering and sulfide control for cept sludge is us 2 28 m3 without chemical dosing and considering only energy consumption the operation cost of ept is us 0 48 m3 4 kwh m3 us 0 12 kwh a saving of 78 was estimated with the implementation of ept for cept sludge treatment taking scitw as an example where 10 000 m3 sludge water content of 98 is generated per day the cost saving could reach us 18 000 day most importantly the sulfide problem can be effectively solved 5 conclusions an electrochemical pretreatment of cept sludge aiming at improving dewaterability and mitigating sulfide was investigated in this study ept with carbon electrodes showed much better performance than ept with titanium electrodes ept with carbon electrodes operated for 15 min enhanced sludge dewaterability by over 80 as evidenced by the 84 4 decrease in cst 88 3 drop in srf and 23 0 reduction in water content the disintegration of the sludge flocs was the main cause of the dewaterability enhancement furthermore the same treatment achieved h2s g and dissolved sulfide removal efficiencies of 99 and 97 respectively after anaerobic storage for five days sulfur containing compounds were largely transformed into a solid phase thus mitigating sulfide emission the microbial community of cept sludge was clearly altered at the genus level after ept and storage over 40 of lachnospiraceae which are capable of sulfide production were eliminated ept demonstrated a superior potential for enhancing the dewaterability of cept sludge and

17988,dewatering and sulfide control are the key challenges in treating chemically enhanced primary treatment cept sludge in this study an electrochemical pretreatment ept approach with the input of 10 v 800 ma was explored for simultaneously improving the dewaterability of cept sludge and eliminating its sulfide production the effects of different electrode materials carbon and titanium and ept durations from 5 to 15 min were documented to reveal the underlying ept mechanism ept with titanium electrodes titanium ept led to limited improvement in dewaterability and sulfide control ept with carbon electrodes carbon ept for 15 min however led to decreases in capillary suction time and specific resistance in filtration of over 80 and the suppression of about 99 of hydrogen sulfide h2s g production over 5 days of anaerobic storage analysis of the characteristics of treated cept sludge revealed that carbon ept disintegrated sludge flocs with 70 reduction in sludge particle sizes and release of aromatic and tyrosine protein like substances thus enhancing sludge dewaterability the sulfur balance in the liquid and gaseous phases showed that most of the sulfur containing compounds remained in the solid phase as aliphatic sulfur and sulfonic acid after carbon ept thereby mitigating sulfide emission while the pattern of sulfur distribution in sludge with titanium ept was dominated by sulfide it was similar to the control sample reduction in bacteria associated with sulfide production i e lachnospiraceae in cept sludge after carbon ept also contributed to sulfide elimination this study demonstrates that ept can be a superior option for simultaneously enhancing the dewaterability of cept sludge and mitigating its sulfide production graphical abstract image 1 keywords sulfate reduction sludge treatment dewaterability enhancement electrochemical pretreatment 1 introduction the sludge production rate in the chemically enhanced primary treatment cept process is about 5 v v which is much higher than that of the activated sludge based process 1 metcalf and eddy 2014 with the assistance of chemical coagulants the cept process achieves high removal rates of total suspended solids organic matter and nutrients and allows the sedimentation basins to operate at twice the overflow rate in conventional primary treatment li et al 2018 due to its stable and efficient performance and large treatment capacity as well as the low energy consumption 0 4 0 5 kwh m3 curtis 2010 ødegaard 2016 the cept process has been widely applied in densely populated cities e g shanghai los angeles hong kong and is also an attractive wastewater treatment option for developing countries wang et al 2009 lin et al 2017 however the huge quantity of sludge produced by the cept process is always a concern for instance around 4000 tonnes of sludge 95 of the water content are generated per day from hong kong s stonecutter island sewage treatment works scitw the world s largest cept plant with a treatment capacity of 1 9 million m3 d hkdsd 2015 swann et al 2017 the treatment of cept sludge is becoming one of the most challenging environmental problems dewatering is an integral and essential step for reducing the sludge volume prior to subsequent treatment however cept sludge is notoriously difficult to be dewatered due to the strong repulsive force between sludge particles murugesan et al 2014 moreover the application of sulfate containing coagulants e g ferric sulfate and alum and or seawater infiltration intrusion in coastal cities can lead to a high concentration of sulfate ions in cept sludge pikaar et al 2014 the sulfate ions are later reduced to hydrogen sulfide h2s through a biological sulfate reduction process during sludge storage dewatering and transportation hao et al 2014 fisher et al 2018 causing severe toxic malodors and corrosion problems enhancing dewaterability and controlling sulfide are therefore the main challenges in achieving safe and efficient cept sludge treatment and disposal the addition of a polyelectrolyte 15 kg tonne of dry sludge is presently the most commonly used pretreatment in wastewater treatment plants wwtps to enhance sludge dewatering feng et al 2009 polyelectrolytes neutralize the negative charges on the sludge surface thus reducing the repulsive force between sludge flocs and facilitating solid liquid separation murugesan et al 2014 however the residual polymers in dewatered sludge and rejected water may pose an ecological hazard as their monomers are neurotoxic and carcinogenic polymer addition also results in a high operating cost of about 50 65 us tonne dried solid ds chen et al 2002 liang et al 2019 more importantly some cationic organic polymers e g polyacrylamide can be decomposed during sludge storage and transportation producing strong malodors chang et al 2005 the odorous gases including h2s g generated from cept sludge are typically treated with auxiliary processes such as physical adsorption chemical scrubbing bio filtration or oxidant addition e g chlorine hydrogen peroxide lin et al 2018 for example the hong kong government has invested around 0 2 billion us in scitw for mitigating sludge h2s by building covers bio scrubbing facilities and chemical dosing pipework although dosing with oxidants such as chlorine can effectively eliminate h2s h2s can be regenerated during sludge transportation due to the existence of sulfate ions additionally the added oxidants can be rapidly consumed by organics in the sludge before sulfide generation saby et al 2002 hao et al 2014 which deteriorates the effectiveness of oxidants for sulfide control more importantly current strategies cannot achieve sludge sulfide mitigation and dewaterability improvement simultaneously resulting in higher capital cost and cumbersome operation and maintenance electrochemical pretreatment ept has gained increasing interest as an emerging technique for treating sludge thanks to its small footprint ease of operation and zero chemical addition barrios et al 2015 masihi and gholikandi 2018 zeng et al 2019 ept has demonstrated its superiority in improving the dewaterability of biological waste sludge bws with 50 v input the dewaterability of bws can be enhanced by 36 yuan et al 2011 furthermore gharibi et al 2013 demonstrated that ept at 20 v improved the bws dewaterability by 76 disruption of the hydrated structure of bws flocs e g extracellular polymeric substances eps and cell lysis is considered to be the main mechanism behind the dewaterability enhancement via ept xiao et al 2019 on the other hand the potential of applying ept in the suppression of bws malodors including h2s was recently highlighted she et al 2017 even though the mechanism is unclear release of sludge bound metals via ept is regarded as one cause for sludge sulfide mitigation zeng et al 2019 meanwhile the potential contributions of oxidants such as chlorine and ohms heating produced via ept for sulfide control i e sulfide oxidation and or srb inactivation cannot be neglected these above studies on electrochemical bws treatment gave us the idea that the dewaterability and sulfide issues of cept sludge can be simultaneously addressed by ept more importantly cept sludge with a high conductivity resulting from coagulant dosing e g 15 45 mg l of fecl3 and or brackish water or seawater infiltration is compatible for ept he et al 2017 this study explores the potential of applying ept in enhancing the dewaterability of cept sludge and concurrently mitigating sulfide production the effectiveness and mechanism of ept with electrodes made of different materials titanium and carbon and different treatment times on sludge dewaterability and sulfide production were evaluated sludge dewaterability in terms of water content capillary suction time cst and specific resistance in filtration srf and sulfide control effectiveness i e dissolved sulfide and h2s g were systematically examined the changes in the characteristics of the sludge and microbial community structure were investigated and discussed the outcome of this study is essential in the optimization and scaling up of the ept process for efficient sludge treatment 2 methods and materials 2 1 cept sludge cept sludge was collected from a sludge transportation pipeline between the final sedimentation tank and the sludge storage tank at scitw in hong kong fig 1 in this cept process ferric chloride 30 mg l and polymer 0 5 mg l are dosed to aid the settlement of the particulate matter

pretreatment three pairs of electrode rods were installed vertically in parallel 30 mm apart on the cover of a 500 ml plexiglas reactor phychemi hong kong fig 1 the electrode material is critical for electrochemical systems and in this study carbon c007912 model and titanium ti ti007915 model electrodes were used goodfellow cambridge ltd united kingdom because of their high chemical stability low cost and relatively inert electrochemistry zhang et al 2016 moreover carbon and titanium are the representatives of active and nonactive anode electrodes examining these two electrodes provides a basic selection measure for further study the surface area of each electrode rod was 9 5 cm2 diameter 3 mm working length 100 mm the raw sludge was treated at a constant input of 10 v 800 ma for 5 10 and 15 min with titanium electrodes tests denoted by ti 5 ti 10 and ti 15 and with carbon electrodes tests denoted by c 5 c 10 and c 15 at room temperature the input voltage of 10 v was chosen based on our preliminary experimental results a magnetic stirrer operating at 200 rpm was used to homogenize the sludge during the course of treatment voltage was supplied and recorded by a potentiostat princeton pmc 2000 ametek no chemicals were added during the electrochemical sludge treatment process the energy consumption in the electrochemical process was calculated based on eq 1 brillas et al 2009 1 energy consumption kwh l e cell it 1000v s where e cell is the applied voltage v i is the current a t is the time h and v s is the sample volume l the operation cost of ept is mainly contributed by energy consumption and the electrical cost in hong kong is was us 0 12 kwh 2 3 sludge dewaterability analysis the cst srf and water content were examined to evaluate the sludge dewatering behavior each test was run in triplicate and the average value was taken the water content after srf was measured following standard methods apha 2005 in the cst examination a stainless steel tube with an inner radius of 0 5 cm was used and the time it took for the sludge filtrate to wet the filter paper whatman 17 from a radius of 1 0 3 0 cm was defined as the cst the srf of the sludge was performed in a büchner funnel under a vacuum tightness of 0 05 mpa 50 ml of sludge was poured into the funnel fitted with a filter paper whatman 1 the volume of the collected filtrate at different times was then recorded until the flow of water stopped the srf is calculated using the following equations 1 srf 2bpa 2 μc 2 c 1 c i 100 c i c f 100 c f where b is the slope determined from the t vol vs vol plot vol is the volume of sludge filtrate m3 and t is the filtration time s p is the pressure of filtration n m2 a is the filtration area m2 c is the weight of solids unit volume of filtrate kg m3 μ is the filtrate viscosity n s m2 c i is the initial sludge water content without filtration and c f is the final water content after srf tests 2 4 sludge sulfide analysis sulfide arises before sludge dewatering and continuously accumulates during sludge storage and transportation sulfide present in wet sludge or sludge cake emits h2s g which is recognized as a surrogate of malodor problems in sewage treatment facilities to evaluate the sludge sulfide production different sulfur compounds remaining after ept were analyzed including h2s g in the gaseous phase dissolved sulfide in the liquid phase and sulfur containing compounds in the solid phase to mimic the in situ condition 90 ml of treated sludge was collected and transferred into 125 ml serum bottles for incubation for over five days under anaerobic conditions for sulfide analysis chen et al 2018 the serum bottles were sealed using teflon faced butyl rubber septa the sealed serum bottles were placed on a shaker operated at a temperature of 38 5 c and 750 rpm during the whole process syringes 60 ml with 21g 37 mm needles were used to relieve the pressure in the serum bottles and determine the produced gas volume h2s g in the gaseous phase was gradually dissolved into the alkaline solution ph 11 for sulfide determination using the methylene blue method apha 2005 liquid samples were collected using a disposable 10 ml syringe sulfate and dissolved sulfide were accordingly measured in the liquid samples jiang et al 2009 sludge samples without ept control a treated with ti ept for 15 min ti 15a and carbon ept for 15 min carbon 15a were immediately freeze dried for x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis another batch of xps analysis for sludge samples was conducted after five days anaerobic storage and the corresponding sample names are control b ti 15b and carbon 15b respectively fig s1 2 5 microbial community analysis after anaerobic storage for five days the samples ti 15 and c 15 were taken for microbial analysis with raw sludge as the comparison total genomic dna was extracted from the sludge pellets for bar coded pyrosequencing pcr bio rad s 1000 was used for amplification of the bacterial 16s rdna genes using primer 515f 806r and the v4 hypervariable regions were targeted pcr amplification was conducted with thermal cycling 94 c for 3 min followed by 30 cycles of 94 c for 30 s 50 c for 30 s and 72 c for 60 s and a final extension at 72 c for 10 min 2 6 analytical methods 2 6 1 sludge characteristics zeta potential of cept sludge was measured before and after ept using a zetaplus brookhaven instrument corporation usa xps physical electronics 5600 multi technique system was performed to examine the surface properties and elemental composition e g sulfur and nitrogen of the samples the particle size of sludge was measured with a laser diffraction particle size analyzer ls 13 320 beckman coulter usa dx is the diameter corresponding to x of the cumulative undersize e g d50 is the median diameter 2 6 2 sludge supernatant analysis after filtration the concentration of sulfate so4 2 was measured using an ion chromatograph shimadzu corporation hic 20a super fitted with a conductivity detector and an ic sa2 analytical column the concentrations of h2s and dissolved sulfide were measured with the methylene blue method apha 2005 soluble proteins pn were determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay with bovine serum albumin as standard smith et al 1985 while soluble polysaccharides ps were determined using the colorimetric method dubois et al 1956 the natural organic matter released before and after treatment was characterized using three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3deem fluorescence eem was performed f 4500 fl hitachi with scanning emission spectra from 250 to 500 nm in 1 nm increments and excitation wavelength from 230 to 400 nm in 10 nm increments ph was measured with a benchtop ph meter multi 9310 wtw germany mlss and mlvss were determined according to standard methods apha 2005 sludge conductivity was determined using a conductivity probe sx 650 sanxing china 2 6 3 statistical analysis pearson s correlation analysis was used to evaluate the correlations between i sludge dewaterability water content cst and srf and ii sludge particle size i e d10 d50 and d90 the correlation coefficient ranged from 0 to 1 where 1 indicates a perfect correlation while 0 denotes no correlation the statistical significance level was defined at the 95 confidence level p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 sludge dewaterability 3 1 1 dewaterability evaluation improving sludge dewaterability by reducing the water content volume reduction and enhancing filterability dewatering rate can significantly lower the operating cost of wwtps srf cst and water content are used to gauge sludge dewaterability and filterability hu et al 2018 specifically a lower water content a smaller srf and a shorter cst indicate a better sludge dewaterability the raw cept sludge was characterized by a long cst of 243 13 s a large srf of 188 17 1012 m kg and high water content of 95 1 in the dewatered sludge fig 2 a slight enhancement in dewaterability was achieved by ept with titanium electrodes titanium ept for 5 15 min the cst and srf values decreased to 189 9 s and 141 9 1012 m kg and the water content of dewatered sludge reduced to 91 in ti 15 however a significant enhancement in dewaterability was recorded for ept with carbon electrodes carbon ept in c 15 cst and srf dropped by 84 and 88 to 38 2s and 23 5 1012 m kg respectively with a water content of 72 in the dewatered sludge fig 2 the cept sludge was more susceptible to ept than bws and can be ascribed to the differences in sludge characteristics ept with 20 v input for 20 min can reduce the cst of bws by 36 through destroying the eps and cell membranes yuan et al 2011 by applying a lower input voltage of 10 v for a shorter treatment time of 15 min in c 15 the dewaterability of cept sludge was enhanced by over 80 bws was dominated by eps and biomass and its compacted and hydrated structure can only be disintegrated with intensive energy input the cept sludge possessed a high solid content rich organics and high salt content resulting in an elevated conductivity 4 5 ms cm that is about three times that of bws shao et al 2007 ibeid et al 2013 an increase in conductivity can help improve the current density and electrochemical efficacy thereby enhancing the effectiveness of ept 3 1 2 particle size and sludge dewaterability the filterability of sludge is highly related to particle size karr and keinath 1978 particle size distributions of raw and treated cept sludge using carbon ept and titanium ept are presented in the volume percentages shown in fig 3 overall the peak volume percentage of particle size shifted towards the left side smaller particle size after ept for 5 15 min raw sludge particles had a prominent peak at approximately 1168 1755 μm with a mean diameter of 267 10 μm the peak shifted down to 777 1020 μm 592 890 μm and 15 88 μm in c 5 c 10 and c 15 respectively and the mean diameters dropped to 144 17 μm 116 9 μm and 73 15 μm fig 3 in comparison only a slight change in particle size was obtained after titanium ept with mean particle sizes of 253 20 μm 213 8 μm and 168 10 μm in ti 5 ti 10 and ti 15 respectively pearson s correlation analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between particle size and dewaterability and the results are summarized in table 1 correlation values among d50 water content cst and srf are all greater than 0 89 implying a strong correlation between the mean particle size and dewaterability this correlation can also be confirmed through linear regression analysis as shown in fig s2 specifically d50 shown a strongest linear relationship with cst r 2 0 9349 followed by srf r 2 0 8835 indicating that sludge with a smaller particle size process a better dewaterability feng et al 2009 reported the relationship between sludge particle size and dewaterability however they observed significant decreases in cst and srf with increasing particle size after ultrasonic treatment which is contrary to our result and could be due to the addition of a polyelectrolyte during the ultrasonic treatment feng et al 2009 polyelectrolytes are effective in interparticle bridging formation of larger flocs and surface charge neutralization repulsive force reduction thus removing the interstitial water and improving sludge dewaterability lee and liu 2000 without any chemical addition in our study irreversible disintegration caused by ept was the major cause of the interstitial water release which is consistent with hydrodynamic cavitation and fenton sludge treatment cai et al 2018 the changes in the zeta potential of cept sludge further support the abovementioned statement on dewaterability fig s3 3 1 3 released components and structure of organic matter soluble organic matter released after ept was determined and further examined by 3deem fluorescence spectroscopy the concentrations of soluble cod pn and ps released from cept sludge with carbon ept were much higher than that of ti ept fig s4 this result was further supported by 3deem analysis the spectrum intensity remained almost unchanged after titanium ept for 5 15 min but it became stronger after carbon ept for 5 15 min indicating more soluble organic matter was released fig 4 two dominant fluorescent peaks were observed at λex em 240 320 nm and λex em 290 320 nm corresponding to the aromatic protein like substances and tryptophan protein like microbial byproducts according to the eem region chen et al 2003 the fluorescence intensities of the peaks in the eem spectra were in line with the tendency of sludge dewaterability indicated by cst srf and water content fig 2 the content of aromatic and tryptophan protein like substances in sludge has been found to be related to dewaterability zhen et al 2012a b li et al 2016 as confirmed by our findings with both aromatic and tryptophan protein like substances being more hydrophilic xu et al 2013 wu et al 2016 hydrophilic groups jeopardize sludge dewatering by attracting water with sludge flocs a higher concentration of hydrophilic substances in the bulk liquid implies more loss of hydrophilic groups from the sludge li et al 2019 directional transformation of aromatic and tryptophan protein like substances from the particulate to soluble phase caused by ept is therefore in favor of sludge dewaterability on the other hand tryptophan like substances are known to play an anchoring role in cell membranes and aromatic protein like substances and are abundant in the eps of sludge mahalakshmi et al 2007 wang et al 2018 however the intensive release of proteins or intracellular substances would also make the sludge sticky by increasing sludge viscosity which in turn would hinder the dewatering li et al 2020 an obvious increase about 53 in viscosity was observed after ept at 40 v for 20 min causing more difficulties in dewatering li et al 2016 in this study the viscosity remained at around 40 5 mpa s from the control test to c 15 fig s5 this was probably due to the lower content of eps in the cept sludge than in the bws and thus the impact of viscosity increase was not obvious 3 2 sulfide mitigation by ept 3 2 1 h2s in the gaseous phase h2s resulting from the bacterial reduction of sulfate is toxic and corrosive and it has been the target of malodor control during cept sludge treatment and disposal sun et al 2016 dalby et al 2018 the accumulated gas included h2s g of raw and treated cept sludge using titanium and carbon electrodes after five days of storage at 38 c are shown in fig 5 the control test generated 46 1 ml of gas containing 18193 712 ppm h2s g while all the treated sludge produced a lower gas volume with a maximum reduction of the total gas of 64 in c 15 in addition cept sludge with carbon ept shows better h2s g mitigation than that of titanium ept specifically by extending the treatment time from 5 to 15 min increases in h2s g removal efficiency of about 9 53 and 99 were achieved corresponding to the concentrations of 16539 705 8485 682 and 110 17 ppm in carbon ept i e c 5 c 10 and c 15 however titanium ept resulted in a higher h2s g concentration than the control test reaching 21573 665 22076 632 and 19416 657 ppm in ti 5 ti 10 and ti 15 respectively in addition to the decomposition of sulfur containing organics such as amino acids i e cysteine and taurine gostelow et al 2001 the h2s g resulting from the bacterial reduction of sulfate is the largest contributor to sulfide production dalby et al 2018 therefore sulfur transformations including sulfate and dissolved sulfide transformations were further investigated in the liquid phase 3 2 2 sulfide in the liquid phase changes in sulfate and total dissolved sulfide concentrations in the liquid phase overtime after ept are shown in fig 6 the initial concentration of sulfate in the cept sludge samples was 320 3 mg s l and the sulfate was fully consumed by the end of all tests within 24 h however carbon ept and titanium ept have significantly different effects on the total dissolved sulfide production as well as the sulfate reduction kinetics the transient concentration of sulfate showed a linear relationship with the time and fitted to the zero order kinetics with a reduction rate of 1 4 10 6 mol l 1 s 1 as s in control fig 6a titanium ept considerably hindered the sulfate reduction process for example ti 15 decreased the kinetics value to 4 8 10 7 mol l 1 s 1 as s in contrast carbon ept had little effect on inhibiting the sulfate reduction process specifically the sulfate reduction kinetics of c 5 c 10 and c 15 were around 1 4 10 6 1 3 10 6 and 1 0 10 6 mol l 1 s 1 as s respectively with the r 2 values exceeding 0 90 although biological sulfide production was slowed down with titanium ept the total sulfide production was not reduced about 83 of the reduced sulfate was converted to dissolved sulfide 265 11 mg s l within 50 h in titanium ept which is similar to that of the control test 270 10 mg s l fig 6b c 5 had a limited effect on the dissolved sulfide removal however only 112 4 and 8 2 mg s l of dissolved sulfide were detected in c 10 and c 15 after 50 h resulting in sulfide reductions of 59 and 97 respectively these results are consistent with the h2s g analysis in the gas phase based on the mass balance the amount of s from sulfate was converted neither to the liquid phase dissolved sulfide nor to the gas phase h2s g therefore the solid sludge phase was analyzed for the missing s 3 2 3 sulfur in the solid phase the sulfur containing compounds in the solid phases of the raw sludge and treated sludge before and after storage for five days were examined by xps fig 7 classification of the binding energies of different s species was based on the literature li et al 2009 liu et al 2012 the five peaks of sulfate 169 8 0 2 ev sulfonic acid 168 5 0 1 ev aromatic sulfur 164 6 0 2 ev aliphatic sulfur 163 5 0 1 ev and inorganic sulfur 162 2 0 4 ev can be seen in the s 2p spectrum of the sludge samples sulfate aromatic sulfur and aliphatic sulfur were the major compounds in the control a ti 15a and c 15a samples indicating that applying ept for 15 min had limited immediate effects on these sulfur containing compounds in the sludge as shown in fig 7a b and c however after 5 days of storage the total sulfur content and the composition changed significantly sulfate disappeared in the sludge fig 7d e and f which is consistent with the results of the liquid phase examination sulfate reduction pattern fig 6a the content of the sulfur containing compounds in ti 15b was similar to that of control b as indicated by the deconvolution results of xps analysis table s1 additionally the sulfur containing compounds in c 15b were dominated by aliphatic sulfur 48 and sulfonic acid 39 which increased by 12 and 10 respectively compared with the control b oxidation of dissolved sulfide is one of the main mechanisms for sludge sulfide elimination he et al 2009 around 90 of sulfide in the electrochemical system can be removed through indirect sulfide oxidation with different intermediate oxidants e g o2 and cl2 resulting from different electrode materials ntagia et al 2019 for instance carbon based electrodes tend to produce o2 while ti based electrodes tend to trigger chlorine generation pikaar et al 2011 however no regeneration of sulfate was observed with the removal of around 99 of the dissolved sulfide fig 6 implying that dissolved sulfide was not oxidized to sulfate after titanium ept and carbon ept it is likely that the oxidants were consumed by the organic substances in cept sludge before the sulfide began to be generated the missing s in this work based on the xps results seems to be stored in the solid phase as the organic fraction aliphatic sulfur and sulfonic acid these species are stable under ambient conditions and only decompose to h2s at high temperatures 150 c lin et al 2017 but their detailed formation pathway with ept is still not clear 3 2 4 microbial community analysis sulfide production from cept sludge is primarily attributed to microorganisms therefore the microbial community structure in the raw and treated cept sludge after five days of cultivation was characterized at the phylum level the raw and treated cept sludge samples showed similar distribution patterns in which firmicutes and bacteroidetes were the two main phyla fig s6 the microbial community structure changed significantly at the genus level fig 8 the most dominant genera of the microbial community in raw cept sludge were lachnospiraceae nk3a20 group 44 and u29 b03 23 for the microbial community in the c 15 sample however the abundance of the lachnospiraceae nk3a20 group and u29 b03 was reduced by 42 and 22 respectively leaving bacteroides 36 and ruminococcus 1 14 to become the major genera instead lachnospiraceae which are abundant in sewage sludge newton et al 2011 have genes linked to dissimilatory sulfate reduction for importing sulfate into the cytoplasm and producing h2s as a major metabolic end product hedberg et al 2012 haas 2016 furthermore lachnospiraceae are also responsible for biogas production e g hydrogen and carbon dioxide sträuber et al 2012 wang et al 2017 the microbial community analysis is consistent with the high biogas production described in section 3 2 1 u29 b03 are capable of degrading complex organics in the environment which is in favor of sulfide generation during the storage period baldwin et al 2015 on the contrary the ti 15 sample showed diverse genera of organisms which may facilitate the degradation of sludge particles and subsequently enhance sulfide generation 4 the potential application of ept development and application of the electrochemical process for sludge dewaterability enhancement and sulfide elimination are highly restricted by the high operating and maintenance costs and process stability as shown in table s2 ept in this study was compared and discussed against previous studies with emphasis on the electrode material operation mode energy consumption and effectiveness most studies use ti substrate electrodes with mixed metal coatings and require chemical addition such as persulfate s2o8 2 ferrous ion fe ii zero valent iron fe 0 permanganate mno4 and bisulfite hso3 zhen et al 2013 li et al 2016 guo et al 2017 masihi and gholikandi 2018 xiao et al 2019 the added chemicals can be activated as radicals and or flocculants by the electrical field facilitating disruption of the sludge flocs and ease the separation of the liquid from the sludge particles however chemical dosing is not the first option which is associated with additional operating costs and safety and health issues as well as secondary pollution generation pikaar et al 2015 without any chemical addition our study demonstrates the superiority of ept over previous studies in terms of dewaterability improvement energy consumption 4 kwh m3 and treatment efficiency 15 min the electrode material is crucial for electrochemical sludge treatment different electrode materials usually have specific impacts on sludge dewaterability in general electrodes can be categorized into two types active and nonactive chen 2004 active electrode made of carbon or graphite possesses a high affinity to adsorb hydroxyl radicals produced from water discharge thereby forming the chemisorbed active oxygen on the electrode surface the active oxygen only permits the primary oxidation of organics however the nonactive electrode such as titanium can physically adsorb hydroxyl radical and allow nonselective oxidation of organics it was found that the primary oxidation with carbon based electrodes is more beneficial to sludge dewatering for instance the advanced oxidation process using free radicals for promoting sludge dewaterability is the primary oxidation zhen et al 2012a b the carbon electrode performed better than the titanium electrode in this study not only for dewaterability enhancement but also in sulfide mitigation regarding the sulfide control she et al 2017 mentioned that h2s and other malodor components such as dimethylsulfide and free ammonia were mostly removed in a pilot scale by the electrochemical process but the mechanism was unclear by analyzing sulfide transformation in the gaseous liquid and solid phases the mechanism of sulfide elimination via ept was explored in this work sulfate reduction was not inhibited by the electrical field and most of the sulfur was transferred from the sulfate sink to the solid phase as organic sulfur moreover abundant reduction in sulfide producing bacteria can assist in sulfide generation control over the long term ept was proposed to be installed after the final sedimentation tank the chemical cost for dewatering 98 water content was around us 1 m3 zhai et al 2012 and the average cost for sulfide removal was estimated at us 5 kg s zhang et al 2008 one cubic meter of cept sludge contains 320 g s sulfate concentration is 320 mg s l with about 80 conversion from sulfate to sulfide fig 6 so 256 g s of sulfide needs to be removed the total chemical cost for dewatering and sulfide control for cept sludge is us 2 28 m3 without chemical dosing and considering only energy consumption the operation cost of ept is us 0 48 m3 4 kwh m3 us 0 12 kwh a saving of 78 was estimated with the implementation of ept for cept sludge treatment taking scitw as an example where 10 000 m3 sludge water content of 98 is generated per day the cost saving could reach us 18 000 day most importantly the sulfide problem can be effectively solved 5 conclusions an electrochemical pretreatment of cept sludge aiming at improving dewaterability and mitigating sulfide was investigated in this study ept with carbon electrodes showed much better performance than ept with titanium electrodes ept with carbon electrodes operated for 15 min enhanced sludge dewaterability by over 80 as evidenced by the 84 4 decrease in cst 88 3 drop in srf and 23 0 reduction in water content the disintegration of the sludge flocs was the main cause of the dewaterability enhancement furthermore the same treatment achieved h2s g and dissolved sulfide removal efficiencies of 99 and 97 respectively after anaerobic storage for five days sulfur containing compounds were largely transformed into a solid phase thus mitigating sulfide emission the microbial community of cept sludge was clearly altered at the genus level after ept and storage over 40 of lachnospiraceae which are capable of sulfide production were eliminated ept demonstrated a superior potential for enhancing the dewaterability of cept sludge and

17989,growing international exploitation of ceria nanoparticles ceo2 nps for varied applications has increased their release into wastewater treatment plants mass transfer of oxygen mto in wastewater biofilm is of considerable importance to influence the activity and purification ability of biofilm herein we investigated the spatial distribution of oxygen in gas liquid biofilm phases the microstructure of interfaces and the in situ microbial activity to reveal the impacts of ceo2 nps on mto in wastewater biofilm and the related mechanisms after exposure to 1 and 10 mg l ceo2 nps the oxygen transfer coefficient k la from gas to wastewater increased by 28 1 and 75 3 with a reduction of thickness in gas liquid boundary layer indicating the enhanced mto in gas liquid interface in contrast the mto in liquid biofilm interface was negatively affected and the thickness of liquid biofilms boundary layer significantly increased which was mainly attributed to the smoother surface and the decreased surface area difference of biofilm within biofilm the microbial activity was inhibited by 10 mg l ceo2 nps whereas the production of extracellular polymeric substance eps was significantly improved leading to a decline of 35 0 in the internal effective diffusivity d b and a 300 μm reduction of oxygen penetration depth moreover the relative activities of key enzymes involved in glycometabolism indicated the transition of embden meyerhof pathway to pentose phosphate pathway which probably contributed to the enhanced eps production and consequently increased mass transfer resistance in liquid biofilm interface and inner biofilm these results could potentially expand the knowledge on mass transfer of nutrients or pollutants in wastewater biofilm in response to nps exposure graphical abstract image 1 keywords ceria nanoparticles oxygen spatial profiles mass transfer gas liquid biofilm phases boundary layer metabolic pathway 1 introduction ceria nanoparticles ceo2 nps are increasingly found in a variety of consumer agricultural pharmaceutical and industrial products montini et al 2016 consequently the environmental release of ceo2 nps from various applications is expected to accumulate in wastewater treatment plants wwtps where biofilms are ubiquitous you et al 2017 limbach et al 2008 lazareva and keller 2014 predicted that the concentration of ceo2 nps in biosolids ranged from 1 39 to 9 10 mg kg in new york through a life cycle modeling approach based on the market study production estimates of 2010 previous studies have demonstrated that ceo2 nps in wastewater could decrease cell viability disturb microbial composition and lead to a reduction in pollutant removal of biofilms wang et al 2018 hou et al 2015 xu et al 2017 besides ceo2 nps could also affect the biogenic components of biofilms xu et al 2017 hochella et al 2019 among which oxygen is of importance to mediate the process performance and even disturbs the stability of biofilm tang et al 2017 garcia ochoa and gomez 2009 however at present little is known regarding the impacts of ceo2 nps on the mass transfer of oxygen mto in wastewater biofilm the mass transport processes of oxygen from a gas stream to the inner biofilm are comprised by a number of steps and resistances garcia ochoa and gomez 2009 mainly three phenomena in gas liquid biofilm phases are considered garcia ochoa and gomez 2009 guimerà et al 2016 1 oxygen moving across the gas liquid interphase external mass transport and transporting into liquid phase 2 oxygen transportation at the liquid biofilm interface intermediate mass transport 3 the transportation of oxygen within biofilm internal mass transport and their consumption by bacteria literature on the external oxygen transfer in biological processes in stirred tanks and bubble columns which are usually used for suspended culturing is nowadays abundant garcia ochoa and gomez 2009 puthli et al 2005 oppositely the characterization of external mass transport is scarce when modeling the mto in attached biofilm due to physical and physiological differences between suspended and attached growth systems in heterotrophic biofilms extensive experiments were conducted to investigate the oxygen distribution in liquid biofilm phase tang et al 2017 guimerà et al 2016 and efforts have recently been made for evaluating the intermediate and internal mto through fick s law of diffusion stewart 2003 nogueira et al 2015 however these studies provided limited information for accurately predicting the intermediate and internal mass transport resistance because of the heterogeneous structure and specific bioprocess in biofilm garcia ochoa and gomez 2009 documented that the mto was influenced by a high number of factors including physical properties of gas and liquid operational conditions and characteristics of biofilm it s reported that the nanosized particles could contribute to localized convection and enhance mass transport rate of oxygen in liquid krishnamurthy et al 2006 nevertheless zhou et al 2003 suggested that the addition of nps might increase or decrease the mass transport coefficient depending on the decrease in the film thickness or increase in viscosity of liquid furthermore hou et al 2014 found that the presence of zno nps in aerobic biofilms inhibited the microbial activities and thus disturbed o2 distributions in different deep sections our previous studies demonstrated that the addition of ceo2 nps could decrease the bacterial viability and affect the structural features of biofilm wang et al 2018 you et al 2015 which may further lead to a change in mto therefore a strong influence of ceo2 nps on the mto in wastewater biofilms was proposed not only due to the biofilms structure and bacterial viability affected by nps affecting the intermediate and internal mto but also because of the disturbed physical properties of bulk phase affecting the external mto with the addition of nps however scarcely any research has been conducted to elaborate the shifts of external intermediate and internal mto in gas liquid biofilm phases in the presence of ceo2 nps in addition microbes inherently utilize organic substrates to gain much energy catabolism and the precursors of the biomass synthesis anabolism by carbon metabolism which is usually coupled with respiration shimizua and matsuoka 2019a 2019b meanwhile the metabolic regulations of catabolism or anabolism are modulated by the growth rate growth condition such as oxygen limitation that alters the aerobiotic respiration towards fermentation shimizua and matsuoka 2019a as a result we hypothesized that the carbon metabolism in biofilm might be altered by ceo2 nps due to the affected mto and physiological activity of microbe unfortunately the metabolic regulation mechanisms with regard to the variation of mto in response to ceo2 nps have not been described in literature in this study we aimed to investigate the effects of ceo2 nps on o2 spatial distribution in gas liquid biofilm phases with an emphasis on the variation of external intermediate and internal mto particularly considering the heterogeneous structure of biofilm we proposed to measure 25 oxygen profiles in each biofilm instead of three random locations in previous studies to improve the reliability and accuracy of estimated parameters tang et al 2017 hou et al 2014 zhou et al 2013 finally the surface microstructures of biofilms in situ microbial activities and key enzymes activities involved in carbon metabolism were further examined to explore the potential mechanisms of mto in biofilm reactors conditioned with ceo2 nps 2 materials and methods 2 1 ceo2 nps biofilm cultivation and exposure experiments construction ceo2 nps were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo and the characteristics of ceo2 nps used here were identical to those introduced in our previous publication wang et al 2018 detailed information about the preparation and characteristics of ceo2 nps stock solution was available in the supporting information si mass transport process of oxygen was investigated in heterotrophic biofilms cultured in sequencing batch biofilm reactors sbbrs with each working volume of 3 l the introduced carriers inoculation and biofilm cultivation process were provided in our previous publication wang et al 2018 and the details were also provided in the si after more than 80 day operation the performance of sbbrs in terms of chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen and total phosphorus removal reached stable state then the batch exposure experiments lasting for 24 h were conducted similar to the previous publication three treatments of ceo2 nps were respectively designed as the environmentally relevant concentration 0 1 mg l and the potentially high concentration 1 and 10 mg l in the future you et al 2017 wang et al 2018 the respective bioreactor was denoted as sbbr 1 sbbr 2 and sbbr 3 and the reactor with no ceo2 nps addition was marked as sbbr 0 or the control group the details for performing the exposure experiments were shown in the si after the exposure experiment the biofilm samples were carefully collected for further measurements 2 2 microelectrode tests microelectrode system has been proved to be an efficient tool for the determination of oxygen micro distributions along and nearby the biofilm nogueira et al 2015 and thus has been extensively employed to study the mass transfer processes in biofilm tang et al 2017 guimerà et al 2016 in the present study mto in gas liquid biofilm phases was characterized through measuring different dissolved oxygen do profiles using an oxygen microelectrode ox100 unisense denmark and detailed information was given in the si biofilm was taken out with the fillers at the end of exposure experiment and fixed on the carrier in a rectangular tank details were also available in the si in each measurement the microelectrode tip started from the same level of altitude approximate 800 μm height above the liquid level and moved to the inner biofilm with a step of 100 μm due to the spatial heterogeneities of biofilm 25 profiles 5 5 composing a square 12 mm 12 mm were determined in each biofilm sample fig s1 to reduce the random errors and improve the reliability of sampling data 2 3 modeling for mto in gas liquid biofilm the oxygen transferred from the saturated gas phase to the inner biofilm do 0 mg l can be represented by a series of mass transport processes as illustrated in fig s2a the boundary layer is defined as the depth of profile between the linear parts wäsche et al 2002 thus l g l and l l b represents the thickness of gas liquid and liquid biofilm boundary layer respectively according to previous studies tang et al 2017 garcia ochoa and gomez 2009 guimerà et al 2016 the classical film theory and fick s diffusion law were applied to describe the mto processes towards the interphases gas liquid and liquid biofilm and inside biofilm respectively the detailed model equations were provided in the si based on the equations the external d ˆ g l intermediate d ˆ l b and internal d ˆ b diffusion coefficients were estimated by curve fitting of model estimates to experimental oxygen profile in the gas liquid boundary layer liquid biofilm boundary layer and inner biofilm respectively to calibrate these estimated diffusion coefficients the vertical distribution of oxygen was further simulated with profiling software using the numerical model based on a control volume approach with a unified equation suggested by berg et al 1998 the simulated results were displayed in fig s2b initially four zones including gas liquid boundary layer liquid phase liquid biofilm boundary layer and within biofilm were set each zone was equipped with a corresponding diffusion coefficient d g l d ˆ g l d w 2 09 10 5 cm2 s d l b d ˆ l b and d b d ˆ b respectively the oxygen concentrations at the top and bottom of the measured domain were chosen as the boundary conditions with profiling software the depth integrated oxygen consumption was further calculated to reflect the transfer flux in gas liquid biofilm berg et al 1998 to evaluate the quality of the simulated results to the measured concentration profile the normalized root mean square error nrmse is used 4 nrmse 1 n i 1 n c m i c i 2 c m 100 where n is the number of measured concentration in the oxygen profile c m i is the measured concentration and c i is the corresponding calculated concentration in the same depth c m represents the mean value of measured concentrations in general the nrmse value less than 10 indicates a satisfy fitting performance with less residual variance guimerà et al 2016 2 4 analysis methods the effects of ceo2 nps on the mto in the gas liquid interface were investigated by measuring the rate of reaeration briefly wastewater with different concentrations of ceo2 nps was purging with high purity nitrogen for 15 min to remove oxygen and then was reaerated in air immediately to record the oxygen concentrations through microsensors as a function of time in order to assess the mto in liquid biofilm interface the morphology and microstructure of irregularly shaped biofilm was examined through environmental scanning electron microscopy esem quanta 650 fei and high resolution atomic force microscopy afm dimension icon bruker both esem and afm have the advantages to image biofilms in their native state without any special preparation such as staining dehydration and fixation processes ruozi et al 2011 for a semi quantitative description of the acquired afm images the roughness r q and surface area difference sad of biofilm was calculated through nanoscope analysis bruker corporation generally rna derives from the actual ribosomes and therefore match living cells while dna include metabolically inactive or dead cells blazewicz et al 2013 giner et al 2020 the acridine orange fluorescent stain sigma st louis mo was used to specifically label rna and dna with orangey red and green fluorescent to visualize single stranded rna and double stranded dna at different wavelengths mcmaster and carmichael 1977 after staining confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm nikon a1 japan was introduced to in situ visualize the spatial distribution of cells with different functions wang et al 2018 in addition the details of our analyses concerning eps content adenosine triphosphate atp concentration dehydrogenase activity dha were all provided in the si the activities of key enzymes involved in carbon metabolisms including hexokinase hk glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase gapdh pyruvate kinase pk glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase gpdh and 6 phosphogluconate dehydrogenase pgdh were all determined using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay kits nanjing senbeijia biological technology co ltd china as described in the manufacturer instructions the test values of the present work were compared to their corresponding control values statistical analysis was tested by performing a paired t student s test with the significance of 5 level or more significance of 1 level 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of ceo2 nps on oxygen distribution in gas liquid biofilm phases in each biofilm sample 25 oxygen profiles were determined to construct representative 3 d plots in biofilm fig s3 from each 3 d plot distinctive differences in do levels at different locations were observed the heterogeneous distributions of oxygen were reflected not only in the planes parallel to the biofilm surface but also in the depth layer picioreanu et al 2000 reported that biofilm heterogeneity in depth mainly depended on the differences of mass transfer rate of substrates although obvious differences were observed in the presence and absence of ceo2 nps fig s3 it s hard to directly identify the actual effects of ceo2 nps due to biofilm heterogeneity furthermore in the following section we analyzed the oxygen concentrations of interfaces through the changing trends of oxygen profiles fig 1 based on the methods in fig s2a instead of comparing the oxygen concentrations at the same depth the oxygen concentration kept constant at around 9 59 mg l in the saturated gas phase and rapidly decreased in the gas liquid boundary layer in sbbr 0 the oxygen concentration maintained at 5 09 1 18 mg l after moving across the gas liquid interface fig 1a then the oxygen transferred into the bulk liquid and the oxygen concentration was 4 95 1 16 mg l before entering the liquid biofilm interface fig 1b after moving across the liquid biofilm interface the oxygen concentration decreased to 3 79 0 99 mg l fig 1c subsequently the oxygen transferred within biofilm and was consumed by the microbial metabolism until no oxygen was determined fig s3 as shown in fig 1 0 1 mg l ceo2 nps posed no measurable effects on the oxygen concentration around the various interfaces with the increase of ceo2 nps concentrations to 1 mg l the average oxygen concentration markedly increased to 5 92 mg l after moving across the gas liquid but the oxygen concentration after moving across liquid biofilm interface was not significantly affected when exposed to 10 mg l ceo2 nps the oxygen concentration respectively increased by 29 5 and 22 4 p 0 01 after moving across the gas liquid and liquid biofilm interface these results suggested that 10 mg l ceo2 nps could significantly enhance the transfer capability of oxygen from gas phase to inner biofilm surface which would be discussed in the following sections 3 2 effects of ceo2 nps on mto parameters it was reported that the thickness of boundary layer is of critical importance to oxygen transport in gas liquid biofilm interfaces since the mass resistance mainly exists in the boundary layer through which the mass transfer takes place by molecular diffusion wäsche et al 2002 according to the method mentioned in fig s2a the thickness of gas liquid boundary layers l g l and liquid biofilm boundary layer l l b were calculated in the absence and presence of ceo2 nps compared to the control the presence of 0 1 and 1 mg l ceo2 nps didn t elicit significant variations of l g l fig 2 a however after exposure to 10 mg l ceo2 nps l g l significantly decreased from 2172 to 1580 μm p 0 01 these results indicated that higher dosage of 10 mg l ceo2 nps compressed the thickness of gas liquid boundary layer reduced the external mass transfer resistance and thus enhanced the mass transfer of oxygen in sewage in control test the average value of l l b was 824 μm fig 2b which was much less than the l g l of 2172 μm the smaller value of l l b was probably attributed to the heterogeneous surface structures of biofilm as the concentration of ceo2 nps increased to 1 and 10 mg l l l b increased notably p 0 01 which was opposite to the changes of l g l these results suggested that the presence of 1 and 10 mg l ceo2 nps could raise the thickness of liquid biofilm boundary layer and further increased the intermediate mass transfer resistance specially the presence of 10 mg l ceo2 nps enhanced mto in gas liquid interface whereas reduced mto in liquid biofilm interface the opposite changes ultimately gave rise to a higher oxygen concentration after the liquid biofilm interface when compared to that in control fig 1c when considering the quantitative results in boundary layers it was found that l g l declined by 592 μm whereas l l b merely increased by 248 μm hence it was reasonable to infer that the improved transportation of oxygen in gas liquid boundary layer resulted in the higher do and the greater change of l g l played the dominating role in determining the oxygen within the biofilm additionally the depth of oxygen penetration within biofilm l b was diversely affected by different concentrations of ceo2 nps fig 2c after exposure to 0 1 mg l ceo2 nps the average value of l b increased from 1652 to 1888 μm p 0 05 as the dosage of ceo2 nps increased to 10 mg l the l b significantly decreased to 1352 μm p 0 01 the concentrations independent trends of l b in response to ceo2 nps probably resulted from the affected mto in the gas liquid biofilm interfaces the varied transport resistance and the consumption of microbial metabolism inside biofilm based on equation s 3 according to equations s 1 s 3 the effective diffusivity coefficients were key factors quantifying the mass transport performances of oxygen in gas liquid biofilm phases the parameters of d g l d l b and d b in the absence and presence of ceo2 nps were calculated and displayed in figs s4a c the average value of d g l was 4 93 10 9 m2 s 1 in control test with the increase of ceo2 nps concentrations the d g l value gradually increased and eventually rose to 8 44 10 9 m2 s 1 in 10 mg l ceo2 nps p 0 01 indicating the enhanced mto in gas liquid interface in contrast the d l b was reduced with different degrees after exposure to different concentrations of ceo2 nps notably the effective diffusivity in boundary layer figs s4a b showed the opposite tendency to the boundary layer thickness fig 2a b in the presence of ceo2 nps actually this would lead to a consistent contributor to the mass transfer rate in interfaces because of the inverse proportional relationship between them in equations s 1 and s 2 with regard to d b fig s4c the control value was calculated as 6 81 10 10 m2 s 1 which was much smaller than that in boundary layer and probably became the limiting rate of oxygen transport in gas liquid biofilm phases after exposure to ceo2 nps the d b decreased from 6 11 10 10 m2 s 1 in sbbr 1 to 4 43 10 10 m2 s 1 in sbbr3 revealing negative effects on d b induced by 10 mg l ceo2 nps the further simulated profiles using the profiling software with the calculated d g l d l b and d b showed a good agreement with measured profiles confirmed by the nrmse fig s4d 6 92 5 23 7 39 and 5 77 in the presence of 0 0 1 1 and 10 mg l ceo2 nps respectively which demonstrated the reasonability of the diffusion coefficients calculations figs s4a c furthermore the control test yields 2 86 10 3 nmol cm 2 s 1 for the depth integrated o2 consumption and the addition of 10 mg l ceo2 nps enhanced the oxygen flux in gas liquid biofilm with a depth integrated o2 consumption of 3 42 10 3 nmol cm 2 s 1 fig s5 these results clearly suggested that the mass transport efficiency of oxygen in boundary layers including gas liquid and liquid biofilm and inside biofilm were differently affected by ceo2 nps which thereby altered the oxygen mass fluxes in gas liquid biofilm the potential mechanisms are further explored in the next section 3 3 variations of mto in gas liquid biofilm phases and potential mechanisms 3 3 1 effects of ceo2 nps on external effective mto and reaeration rate generally the thickness of liquid film controlling the mass transfer resistance in gas liquid interface is highly related to the liquid properties garcia ochoa and gomez 2009 the addition of ceo2 nps would increase the quantity of small particles k sp 4 10 51 in sewage and thus probably affected the external effective mto here the curves of reoxygenation in the absence and presence of ceo2 nps were recorded to clarify the role of ceo2 nps in external mto as shown in fig 3 the oxygen concentration during reoxygenation process increased rapidly in the first 90 s and reached up to 8 mg l in control test then the oxygen concentration increased slowly in the following period of 90 s and approached to the saturated concentration this phenomenon indicated that the concentration of do in wastewater was mainly driven by the concentration gradient in this way the fick s equation was applied to fit the process of reoxygenation as expected the measured data fitted well with the fick s equation r2 0 99 and the related parameters were exhibited in the attached table in fig 3 the addition of 0 1 mg l ceo2 nps didn t affect the reoxygenation process in sewage which was consistent with the unchanged l g l in fig 2a to avoid data overlapping this curve was not presented obviously 180 s were taken to recover to saturated oxygen concentration in control test while 150 s were needed in the presence of 1 mg l ceo2 nps and the time for oxygen recovering were further shortened to 120 s in 10 mg l ceo2 nps indicating the enhanced reoxygenation rate in sewage in 1 and 10 mg l ceo2 nps the transport of oxygen from gas to wastewater was characterized by oxygen transfer coefficient k la and a higher value of k la suggests a lower transfer resistance and vice versa garcia ochoa and gomez 2009 in control k la was calculated as 1 95 10 2 s 1 with the dosage of 1 and 10 mg l ceo2 nps k la gradually increased to 2 50 10 2 s 1 and 3 42 10 2 s 1 these results confirmed that the addition of ceo2 nps could reduce the transfer resistance and thus enhanced the mass transfer rate between wastewater and gas fig s4a krishnamurthy et al 2006 also found that the formation of nanofluids which contained suspended nanoparticles in liquid enhanced mass transport due to the localized convection arising from the nanoparticles brownian motion meanwhile ma et al 2004 reported that gas liquid mass transfer was often accompanied by interfacial turbulence the nonuniformity of ceo2 nps in solution caused by brownian motion could result in local concentration or tension gradient which further led to the interfacial turbulence and consequently improved mass transfer considerably furthermore the addition of ceo2 nps constantly collided with the gas liquid boundary layer and acted as the mingle effect ruthiya et al 2004 which reduced the thickness of gas liquid boundary layer fig 2a and enhanced the external mto 3 3 2 effects of ceo2 nps on intermediate effective mto and interfacial microstructures the thickness of liquid biofilm boundary layer as well as the intermediate effective mto was found to depend on the surface structure of biofilm wäsche et al 2002 thereafter esem was applied to provide images of the morphology of irregularly shaped biofilm with and without ceo2 nps exposure in control test figs s6a and e a typical mushroom like structure with plenty of white secretion substances and dark pores were observed on the biofilm surface with the increased dosage of ceo2 nps from 0 1 to 10 mg l figs s6b d and f h the content of white secretion substances increased and the image color changed into gray white additionally the number of dark pores decreased and the biofilm surface tended to be even and uniform according to the related researches you et al 2015 the increased production of white secretion substances was confirmed to be eps supporting the physical barrier to protect the biofilm from the toxicity of ceo2 nps previous study has concluded that the exposure to ceo2 nps altered the composition and distribution of eps in wastewater biofilm wang et al 2018 which would consequently affect the surface structure of biofilm in the present study after exposure to ceo2 nps the production of eps gradually increased from 18 21 in control to 21 80 mg toc g biomass in 10 mg l ceo2 nps fig s7 which might be caused by microbial regulation wang et al 2018 you et al 2015 thus it can be inferred that the enhanced eps secretion could block up the pores and channels inside biofilm which gave rise to the uniform surface and the reduction of biofilm pores and intermediate effective mto afm with high resolution was introduced to further observe the microstructure of liquid biofilm interface before and after exposure to ceo2 nps the surface of biofilm was bright colorful in control test and the concave convex structure was visibly observed fig 4 a after exposure to ceo2 nps the biofilm was in monotonous color and presented smooth surface with fewer protrusions fig 4b d fig 4e h showed the 3 d projections of biofilm microstructure and the voltage v for a certain tip position represents the local contact potential difference lcpd in biofilm mohn et al 2012 in control test the highest lcpd was measured to be 342 8 mv after exposure to 1 and 10 mg l ceo2 nps the highest lcpd declined to 117 4 and 92 6 mv indicating the relatively smoother surface these afm images further confirmed that the presence of ceo2 nps changed the concave convex structure of biofilm into uniform and smooth surface generally the roughness r q describes the depth of valleys in biofilm picioreanu et al 2000 and the r q of biofilm surface was deemed to be negatively correlated with the mass transfer resistance zhang and bishop 1994 as illustrated in figs s8a and a slight increase of r q occurred in 0 1 and 1 mg l ceo2 nps while the r q decreased to 88 of control after exposure to 10 mg l ceo2 nps the changing trends of r q could not scientifically explain the increased l l b fig 2b or the reduction of d l b fig s4b in liquid biofilm interfaces in response to ceo2 nps which suggested that r q was not reasonable to characterize the intermediate mto variation picioreanu et al 2000 also found that increased biofilm roughness did not necessarily lead to an enhancement of intermediate mass transport since the width of the valleys is also important stoodley et al 1999 the sad is in general a comprehensive parameter reflecting the heterogeneity including the depth and width of the valleys of biofilm surface with the concentration of ceo2 nps increased to 10 mg l the sad shown in fig s8b gradually decreased from 42 7 in control to 11 8 exhibiting the uniform and smooth surface of biofilm these changes were adverse to the interfacial turbulence and the irregular motion of oxygen thus led to the enhancement of the l l b fig 2b the enhanced eps production and uniform surface structure derived from esem and afm consequences on the other hand could also prevent ceo2 nps transporting into the inner biofilm which was likely to be an important countermeasure of biofilm for the stress of ceo2 nps 3 3 3 effects of ceo2 nps on internal effective mto and microbial metabolism the oxygen transport within biofilm was highly related to the microbial metabolism and respiration guimerà et al 2016 dha has been widely accepted to estimate the microbial activity in environmental samples lazarova and manem 1995 meanwhile dha values were reported to correlate well with atp contents and the oxygen utilization rate trevors et al 1982 lazarova and manem 1995 fig s9 showed that the dha level significantly decreased p 0 05 after exposure to ceo2 nps similarly as the dosage of ceo2 nps increased to 10 mg l the atp content declined from 13 83 in control to 11 74 μmol l compared with atp dha is more sensitive to biochemical changes reichardt 1979 which might explain the differences in establishing a good correlation between dha and atp in this study after exposure to ceo2 nps the decreased atp and dha content revealed the inhibited activity of biofilm which probably suggested the reduced oxygen consumption by microbial metabolism rna and dna are fundamental components of bacterial cells and the fluorochrome enables a distinction to visualize them the spatial distributions of rna and dna were obtained through clsm as displayed in fig s10 in control test the clsm images was mainly presented in orange red indicating rna and cells with high activity was dominant after the cells being exposed to ceo2 nps the vision of clsm images gradually shifted to orange green and the density of dna increased the original color of 2 d images in each layer was processed numerically for the semi quantitative analysis of the 3 d clsm images and the results were shown in fig 5 a the total rna accounted for 68 18 and the ratio of rna dna was 2 14 in control while the addition of 10 mg l ceo2 nps decreased the rna dna value to 0 24 it s reported that the rna dna ratio has been used as a proxy for their relative activity in kinds of bacteria giner et al 2020 therefore the ratio of rna to dna was hierarchically calculated in vertical within biofilm as shown in fig 5b after exposure to ceo2 nps the rna dna value in each layer was much lower than that in control confirming the inhibited activity of biofilm caused by ceo2 nps notably in comparison with the control test the position of the highest microbial activity with maximum value of rna dna fig 5b moved towards the surface of biofilm in the presence of 1 and 10 mg l ceo2 nps which showed a similar tendency with l b in fig 2c it could be inferred that because of ceo2 nps exposure the decreased penetration depth of oxygen in biofilm would lead to the active bacteria in deeper parts moved towards the surface of biofilm for oxygen achievement to survive from or adapt to the changed conditions simultaneously considering the enhanced concentration of oxygen approaching to biofilm fig s3c and the inhibited microbe activity inside biofilm fig 5a and figs s9 s10 there would result in an enhancement of l b in biofilm in the presence of ceo2 nps however this is not the fact in fig 2c it s important to note that the depth of oxygen penetration within biofilm was not only correlated with the oxygen concentration and the microbial metabolism but also affected by the mass transfer resistance within biofilm after exposure to ceo2 nps the enhanced eps production fig s7 would definitely increase the mass transfer resistance since the diffusion coefficients of eps are lower than those of other components in biofilm sheng et al 2010 indeed the mass transfer coefficient of oxygen d b in fig s4c within biofilm significantly decreased after ceo2 nps exposure therefore the enhanced eps production that led to the reduced d b after ceo2 nps exposure was the dominant factor in decreasing the l b in biofilm which in turn altered the spatial distribution of bacterial activity fig 5b the degradation of glucose serving as the sole carbon source in this study was a critical step to produce metabolites and energy for microbes and usually cooccur with respiration shimizua and matsuoka 2019a the embden meyerhof pathway emp and pentose phosphate pathway ppp are the fundamental pathways of carbohydrate metabolism fig 6 a which are largely dependent on the catalysis of relevant enzymes as shown in fig 6b the activities of three key enzymes hk gapdh and pk in emp were inhibited in the presence of ceo2 nps which would negatively affect the subsequent aerobic respiration dominated by the tca cycle and atp synthesis fig s9 during the process of glycolysis the activity of gapdh was the most inhibited and declined by 46 35 after exposure to 10 mg l ceo2 nps which was one of the underlying reasons for the decreased dha concentrations fig s9 meanwhile the gapdh catalyzing glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate to glycerate 1 3 phosphate is coupled with the reduction of nad to nadh thus the content of nadh was likely to decrease with ceo2 nps treatment however the activities of two important enzymes gpdh and pgdh in ppp were enhanced in the presence of ceo2 nps it s interesting to find that the enzymatic reactions of gpdh and pgdh were coupled with the generation of nadph as a result the production of nadph was probably increased although nadh and nadph are chemically similar and function as unique electron carriers they play different physiological roles in metabolisms valdivia gonza lez et al 2012 basically nadh is used to generate atp in the respiratory chain reactions catabolism while nadph provides the reducing power for cell synthesis anabolism shimizua and matsuoka 2019a 2019b these results in fig 6b indicated that after exposure to ceo2 nps the metabolic pathways in biofilm would convert from emp together with aerobic respiration to generate abundant atp thus explained the decreased atp content to ppp which could be the metabolic regulation mechanisms of microbe to cope with ceo2 nps compared to emp the glycometabolism in ppp was oxidized to produce cell precursors and nadph for biomass synthesis with a small amount of oxygen shimizua and matsuoka 2019b which preferably occurred in biofilm with decreased do after ceo2 nps exposure furthermore nadph regarded as excellent redox cofactor played essential roles in protecting the cells from oxidative stress induced by ceo2 nps the most accepted toxicity mechanism of ceo2 nps cheng et al 2013 von moos and slaveykova 2014 more importantly the ppp benefits for the biomass synthesis which would certainly promote the production of eps to form potent physical defense thus also leading to the enhancement of internal mass transfer resistance 3 4 environmental implications the above mentioned results clearly demonstrated that the presence of ceo2 nps impacted the mto in the external intermediate and internal media of gas liquid biofilm three phases as schematically illustrated in fig 6c when ceo2 nps was released into wastewater the brownian motion caused by these tiny particles and the interfacial turbulence created by the uneven distribution of particles compressed the thickness of gas liquid boundary layer thus increased the oxygen concentration in wastewater however to resist against ceo2 nps more eps was secreted by microorganisms and the surface of biofilm became uniform and smooth which caused an enhancement of the thickness of gas liquid boundary layer and a reduction of intermediate effective diffusion despite the enhanced concentration of oxygen approaching to biofilm surface and the inhibited microbe activity within biofilm the increased mass transfer resistances resulted from the enhanced eps production were expected to be the most important reasons for the decreased penetration depth of oxygen in biofilm in the presence of 10 mg l ceo2 nps furthermore we found that the transition from emp to ppp was probably the metabolic regulation mechanism for the enhanced eps production to cope with ceo2 nps in addition to emp and ppp ceo2 nps may further affect the transformation from aerobic respiration mediated by tca cycle to respiro fermentative metabolism pathway due to oxygen limitation shimizua and matsuoka 2019a thus probably leading to far reaching effects to wastewater treatment to mitigate the negative effects induced by 10 mg l ceo2 nps the hydraulic regulation through controlling the aeration to accelerate the update of biofilms was feasible since this approach not only improves mass transfer of oxygen but also benefits to remove these nps adsorbed or entrapped in the surface of biofilm you et al 2016 in addition the shielding reagents such as humic acid and citrate might be injected to reduce the bioavailability and toxicity of ceo2 nps xu et al 2018 it should be noted that this study mainly focused on the transfer processes of oxygen from gas to biofilm three phase system in the presence of ceo2 nps much more pollutants e g cod no3 po4 3 etc in sewage were different from oxygen since they merely transported from the liquid phase to the biofilm matrix two phase system for removal according to the above discussion the mass transfer efficiency in liquid biofilm interface and within biofilm both decreased after exposure to ceo2 nps which would lead to a reduction of pollutants removal however as well performed adsorbents the enhanced eps production could provide more binding sites for pollutants and thus increase local concentration on the surface of biofilm you et al 2015 sheng et al 2010 therefore the positive or negative roles of eps in pollutants removal and mass transfer in the presence of ceo2 nps need to be further explored in practice biofilms in wastewater treatment was incubated in aeration or under a certain hydrodynamic condition however this study investigated the performance of oxygen transfer in a stable state with no aeration being advantages for the simplification of the transfer processes in gas liquid biofilm phases and the amplification for effects of ceo2 nps in the future more work needs to be conducted to better understand the effects of these small particles on mass transfer performance of microaggregates in actual wastewater environment 4 conclusions this study comprehensively investigated the variations of external intermediate and internal mass transfer of oxygen in heterogeneous wastewater biofilm in response to ceo2 nps main conclusions of this study are due to the brownian motion and interfacial turbulence caused by ceo2 nps the addition of 10 mg l ceo2 nps enhanced the external mass transfer efficiency from gas to wastewater which decreased the thickness of gas liquid boundary layer and increased the oxygen concentration in wastewater to resist against ceo2 nps more eps was secreted and the surface of biofilm turned into uniform and smooth which led to a reduction of the surface area difference and an enhancement of the thickness of liquid biofilm boundary layer compared to the external and intermediate mass transfer the internal mass transfer resistances controlled the overall transfer rate in gas liquid biofilm phases the transition of emp to ppp would likely be the metabolic regulation mechanism of microbe to cope with ceo2 nps contributing to the enhanced eps production and consequently increased the internal mass transfer resistances which further affected the spatial distribution of active bacteria to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that the transfer processes of oxygen in three phase system and the related mechanisms were elucidated this study would provide the basis for understanding the mass transport performance and removal efficiency

17989,growing international exploitation of ceria nanoparticles ceo2 nps for varied applications has increased their release into wastewater treatment plants mass transfer of oxygen mto in wastewater biofilm is of considerable importance to influence the activity and purification ability of biofilm herein we investigated the spatial distribution of oxygen in gas liquid biofilm phases the microstructure of interfaces and the in situ microbial activity to reveal the impacts of ceo2 nps on mto in wastewater biofilm and the related mechanisms after exposure to 1 and 10 mg l ceo2 nps the oxygen transfer coefficient k la from gas to wastewater increased by 28 1 and 75 3 with a reduction of thickness in gas liquid boundary layer indicating the enhanced mto in gas liquid interface in contrast the mto in liquid biofilm interface was negatively affected and the thickness of liquid biofilms boundary layer significantly increased which was mainly attributed to the smoother surface and the decreased surface area difference of biofilm within biofilm the microbial activity was inhibited by 10 mg l ceo2 nps whereas the production of extracellular polymeric substance eps was significantly improved leading to a decline of 35 0 in the internal effective diffusivity d b and a 300 μm reduction of oxygen penetration depth moreover the relative activities of key enzymes involved in glycometabolism indicated the transition of embden meyerhof pathway to pentose phosphate pathway which probably contributed to the enhanced eps production and consequently increased mass transfer resistance in liquid biofilm interface and inner biofilm these results could potentially expand the knowledge on mass transfer of nutrients or pollutants in wastewater biofilm in response to nps exposure graphical abstract image 1 keywords ceria nanoparticles oxygen spatial profiles mass transfer gas liquid biofilm phases boundary layer metabolic pathway 1 introduction ceria nanoparticles ceo2 nps are increasingly found in a variety of consumer agricultural pharmaceutical and industrial products montini et al 2016 consequently the environmental release of ceo2 nps from various applications is expected to accumulate in wastewater treatment plants wwtps where biofilms are ubiquitous you et al 2017 limbach et al 2008 lazareva and keller 2014 predicted that the concentration of ceo2 nps in biosolids ranged from 1 39 to 9 10 mg kg in new york through a life cycle modeling approach based on the market study production estimates of 2010 previous studies have demonstrated that ceo2 nps in wastewater could decrease cell viability disturb microbial composition and lead to a reduction in pollutant removal of biofilms wang et al 2018 hou et al 2015 xu et al 2017 besides ceo2 nps could also affect the biogenic components of biofilms xu et al 2017 hochella et al 2019 among which oxygen is of importance to mediate the process performance and even disturbs the stability of biofilm tang et al 2017 garcia ochoa and gomez 2009 however at present little is known regarding the impacts of ceo2 nps on the mass transfer of oxygen mto in wastewater biofilm the mass transport processes of oxygen from a gas stream to the inner biofilm are comprised by a number of steps and resistances garcia ochoa and gomez 2009 mainly three phenomena in gas liquid biofilm phases are considered garcia ochoa and gomez 2009 guimerà et al 2016 1 oxygen moving across the gas liquid interphase external mass transport and transporting into liquid phase 2 oxygen transportation at the liquid biofilm interface intermediate mass transport 3 the transportation of oxygen within biofilm internal mass transport and their consumption by bacteria literature on the external oxygen transfer in biological processes in stirred tanks and bubble columns which are usually used for suspended culturing is nowadays abundant garcia ochoa and gomez 2009 puthli et al 2005 oppositely the characterization of external mass transport is scarce when modeling the mto in attached biofilm due to physical and physiological differences between suspended and attached growth systems in heterotrophic biofilms extensive experiments were conducted to investigate the oxygen distribution in liquid biofilm phase tang et al 2017 guimerà et al 2016 and efforts have recently been made for evaluating the intermediate and internal mto through fick s law of diffusion stewart 2003 nogueira et al 2015 however these studies provided limited information for accurately predicting the intermediate and internal mass transport resistance because of the heterogeneous structure and specific bioprocess in biofilm garcia ochoa and gomez 2009 documented that the mto was influenced by a high number of factors including physical properties of gas and liquid operational conditions and characteristics of biofilm it s reported that the nanosized particles could contribute to localized convection and enhance mass transport rate of oxygen in liquid krishnamurthy et al 2006 nevertheless zhou et al 2003 suggested that the addition of nps might increase or decrease the mass transport coefficient depending on the decrease in the film thickness or increase in viscosity of liquid furthermore hou et al 2014 found that the presence of zno nps in aerobic biofilms inhibited the microbial activities and thus disturbed o2 distributions in different deep sections our previous studies demonstrated that the addition of ceo2 nps could decrease the bacterial viability and affect the structural features of biofilm wang et al 2018 you et al 2015 which may further lead to a change in mto therefore a strong influence of ceo2 nps on the mto in wastewater biofilms was proposed not only due to the biofilms structure and bacterial viability affected by nps affecting the intermediate and internal mto but also because of the disturbed physical properties of bulk phase affecting the external mto with the addition of nps however scarcely any research has been conducted to elaborate the shifts of external intermediate and internal mto in gas liquid biofilm phases in the presence of ceo2 nps in addition microbes inherently utilize organic substrates to gain much energy catabolism and the precursors of the biomass synthesis anabolism by carbon metabolism which is usually coupled with respiration shimizua and matsuoka 2019a 2019b meanwhile the metabolic regulations of catabolism or anabolism are modulated by the growth rate growth condition such as oxygen limitation that alters the aerobiotic respiration towards fermentation shimizua and matsuoka 2019a as a result we hypothesized that the carbon metabolism in biofilm might be altered by ceo2 nps due to the affected mto and physiological activity of microbe unfortunately the metabolic regulation mechanisms with regard to the variation of mto in response to ceo2 nps have not been described in literature in this study we aimed to investigate the effects of ceo2 nps on o2 spatial distribution in gas liquid biofilm phases with an emphasis on the variation of external intermediate and internal mto particularly considering the heterogeneous structure of biofilm we proposed to measure 25 oxygen profiles in each biofilm instead of three random locations in previous studies to improve the reliability and accuracy of estimated parameters tang et al 2017 hou et al 2014 zhou et al 2013 finally the surface microstructures of biofilms in situ microbial activities and key enzymes activities involved in carbon metabolism were further examined to explore the potential mechanisms of mto in biofilm reactors conditioned with ceo2 nps 2 materials and methods 2 1 ceo2 nps biofilm cultivation and exposure experiments construction ceo2 nps were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo and the characteristics of ceo2 nps used here were identical to those introduced in our previous publication wang et al 2018 detailed information about the preparation and characteristics of ceo2 nps stock solution was available in the supporting information si mass transport process of oxygen was investigated in heterotrophic biofilms cultured in sequencing batch biofilm reactors sbbrs with each working volume of 3 l the introduced carriers inoculation and biofilm cultivation process were provided in our previous publication wang et al 2018 and the details were also provided in the si after more than 80 day operation the performance of sbbrs in terms of chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen and total phosphorus removal reached stable state then the batch exposure experiments lasting for 24 h were conducted similar to the previous publication three treatments of ceo2 nps were respectively designed as the environmentally relevant concentration 0 1 mg l and the potentially high concentration 1 and 10 mg l in the future you et al 2017 wang et al 2018 the respective bioreactor was denoted as sbbr 1 sbbr 2 and sbbr 3 and the reactor with no ceo2 nps addition was marked as sbbr 0 or the control group the details for performing the exposure experiments were shown in the si after the exposure experiment the biofilm samples were carefully collected for further measurements 2 2 microelectrode tests microelectrode system has been proved to be an efficient tool for the determination of oxygen micro distributions along and nearby the biofilm nogueira et al 2015 and thus has been extensively employed to study the mass transfer processes in biofilm tang et al 2017 guimerà et al 2016 in the present study mto in gas liquid biofilm phases was characterized through measuring different dissolved oxygen do profiles using an oxygen microelectrode ox100 unisense denmark and detailed information was given in the si biofilm was taken out with the fillers at the end of exposure experiment and fixed on the carrier in a rectangular tank details were also available in the si in each measurement the microelectrode tip started from the same level of altitude approximate 800 μm height above the liquid level and moved to the inner biofilm with a step of 100 μm due to the spatial heterogeneities of biofilm 25 profiles 5 5 composing a square 12 mm 12 mm were determined in each biofilm sample fig s1 to reduce the random errors and improve the reliability of sampling data 2 3 modeling for mto in gas liquid biofilm the oxygen transferred from the saturated gas phase to the inner biofilm do 0 mg l can be represented by a series of mass transport processes as illustrated in fig s2a the boundary layer is defined as the depth of profile between the linear parts wäsche et al 2002 thus l g l and l l b represents the thickness of gas liquid and liquid biofilm boundary layer respectively according to previous studies tang et al 2017 garcia ochoa and gomez 2009 guimerà et al 2016 the classical film theory and fick s diffusion law were applied to describe the mto processes towards the interphases gas liquid and liquid biofilm and inside biofilm respectively the detailed model equations were provided in the si based on the equations the external d ˆ g l intermediate d ˆ l b and internal d ˆ b diffusion coefficients were estimated by curve fitting of model estimates to experimental oxygen profile in the gas liquid boundary layer liquid biofilm boundary layer and inner biofilm respectively to calibrate these estimated diffusion coefficients the vertical distribution of oxygen was further simulated with profiling software using the numerical model based on a control volume approach with a unified equation suggested by berg et al 1998 the simulated results were displayed in fig s2b initially four zones including gas liquid boundary layer liquid phase liquid biofilm boundary layer and within biofilm were set each zone was equipped with a corresponding diffusion coefficient d g l d ˆ g l d w 2 09 10 5 cm2 s d l b d ˆ l b and d b d ˆ b respectively the oxygen concentrations at the top and bottom of the measured domain were chosen as the boundary conditions with profiling software the depth integrated oxygen consumption was further calculated to reflect the transfer flux in gas liquid biofilm berg et al 1998 to evaluate the quality of the simulated results to the measured concentration profile the normalized root mean square error nrmse is used 4 nrmse 1 n i 1 n c m i c i 2 c m 100 where n is the number of measured concentration in the oxygen profile c m i is the measured concentration and c i is the corresponding calculated concentration in the same depth c m represents the mean value of measured concentrations in general the nrmse value less than 10 indicates a satisfy fitting performance with less residual variance guimerà et al 2016 2 4 analysis methods the effects of ceo2 nps on the mto in the gas liquid interface were investigated by measuring the rate of reaeration briefly wastewater with different concentrations of ceo2 nps was purging with high purity nitrogen for 15 min to remove oxygen and then was reaerated in air immediately to record the oxygen concentrations through microsensors as a function of time in order to assess the mto in liquid biofilm interface the morphology and microstructure of irregularly shaped biofilm was examined through environmental scanning electron microscopy esem quanta 650 fei and high resolution atomic force microscopy afm dimension icon bruker both esem and afm have the advantages to image biofilms in their native state without any special preparation such as staining dehydration and fixation processes ruozi et al 2011 for a semi quantitative description of the acquired afm images the roughness r q and surface area difference sad of biofilm was calculated through nanoscope analysis bruker corporation generally rna derives from the actual ribosomes and therefore match living cells while dna include metabolically inactive or dead cells blazewicz et al 2013 giner et al 2020 the acridine orange fluorescent stain sigma st louis mo was used to specifically label rna and dna with orangey red and green fluorescent to visualize single stranded rna and double stranded dna at different wavelengths mcmaster and carmichael 1977 after staining confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm nikon a1 japan was introduced to in situ visualize the spatial distribution of cells with different functions wang et al 2018 in addition the details of our analyses concerning eps content adenosine triphosphate atp concentration dehydrogenase activity dha were all provided in the si the activities of key enzymes involved in carbon metabolisms including hexokinase hk glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase gapdh pyruvate kinase pk glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase gpdh and 6 phosphogluconate dehydrogenase pgdh were all determined using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay kits nanjing senbeijia biological technology co ltd china as described in the manufacturer instructions the test values of the present work were compared to their corresponding control values statistical analysis was tested by performing a paired t student s test with the significance of 5 level or more significance of 1 level 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of ceo2 nps on oxygen distribution in gas liquid biofilm phases in each biofilm sample 25 oxygen profiles were determined to construct representative 3 d plots in biofilm fig s3 from each 3 d plot distinctive differences in do levels at different locations were observed the heterogeneous distributions of oxygen were reflected not only in the planes parallel to the biofilm surface but also in the depth layer picioreanu et al 2000 reported that biofilm heterogeneity in depth mainly depended on the differences of mass transfer rate of substrates although obvious differences were observed in the presence and absence of ceo2 nps fig s3 it s hard to directly identify the actual effects of ceo2 nps due to biofilm heterogeneity furthermore in the following section we analyzed the oxygen concentrations of interfaces through the changing trends of oxygen profiles fig 1 based on the methods in fig s2a instead of comparing the oxygen concentrations at the same depth the oxygen concentration kept constant at around 9 59 mg l in the saturated gas phase and rapidly decreased in the gas liquid boundary layer in sbbr 0 the oxygen concentration maintained at 5 09 1 18 mg l after moving across the gas liquid interface fig 1a then the oxygen transferred into the bulk liquid and the oxygen concentration was 4 95 1 16 mg l before entering the liquid biofilm interface fig 1b after moving across the liquid biofilm interface the oxygen concentration decreased to 3 79 0 99 mg l fig 1c subsequently the oxygen transferred within biofilm and was consumed by the microbial metabolism until no oxygen was determined fig s3 as shown in fig 1 0 1 mg l ceo2 nps posed no measurable effects on the oxygen concentration around the various interfaces with the increase of ceo2 nps concentrations to 1 mg l the average oxygen concentration markedly increased to 5 92 mg l after moving across the gas liquid but the oxygen concentration after moving across liquid biofilm interface was not significantly affected when exposed to 10 mg l ceo2 nps the oxygen concentration respectively increased by 29 5 and 22 4 p 0 01 after moving across the gas liquid and liquid biofilm interface these results suggested that 10 mg l ceo2 nps could significantly enhance the transfer capability of oxygen from gas phase to inner biofilm surface which would be discussed in the following sections 3 2 effects of ceo2 nps on mto parameters it was reported that the thickness of boundary layer is of critical importance to oxygen transport in gas liquid biofilm interfaces since the mass resistance mainly exists in the boundary layer through which the mass transfer takes place by molecular diffusion wäsche et al 2002 according to the method mentioned in fig s2a the thickness of gas liquid boundary layers l g l and liquid biofilm boundary layer l l b were calculated in the absence and presence of ceo2 nps compared to the control the presence of 0 1 and 1 mg l ceo2 nps didn t elicit significant variations of l g l fig 2 a however after exposure to 10 mg l ceo2 nps l g l significantly decreased from 2172 to 1580 μm p 0 01 these results indicated that higher dosage of 10 mg l ceo2 nps compressed the thickness of gas liquid boundary layer reduced the external mass transfer resistance and thus enhanced the mass transfer of oxygen in sewage in control test the average value of l l b was 824 μm fig 2b which was much less than the l g l of 2172 μm the smaller value of l l b was probably attributed to the heterogeneous surface structures of biofilm as the concentration of ceo2 nps increased to 1 and 10 mg l l l b increased notably p 0 01 which was opposite to the changes of l g l these results suggested that the presence of 1 and 10 mg l ceo2 nps could raise the thickness of liquid biofilm boundary layer and further increased the intermediate mass transfer resistance specially the presence of 10 mg l ceo2 nps enhanced mto in gas liquid interface whereas reduced mto in liquid biofilm interface the opposite changes ultimately gave rise to a higher oxygen concentration after the liquid biofilm interface when compared to that in control fig 1c when considering the quantitative results in boundary layers it was found that l g l declined by 592 μm whereas l l b merely increased by 248 μm hence it was reasonable to infer that the improved transportation of oxygen in gas liquid boundary layer resulted in the higher do and the greater change of l g l played the dominating role in determining the oxygen within the biofilm additionally the depth of oxygen penetration within biofilm l b was diversely affected by different concentrations of ceo2 nps fig 2c after exposure to 0 1 mg l ceo2 nps the average value of l b increased from 1652 to 1888 μm p 0 05 as the dosage of ceo2 nps increased to 10 mg l the l b significantly decreased to 1352 μm p 0 01 the concentrations independent trends of l b in response to ceo2 nps probably resulted from the affected mto in the gas liquid biofilm interfaces the varied transport resistance and the consumption of microbial metabolism inside biofilm based on equation s 3 according to equations s 1 s 3 the effective diffusivity coefficients were key factors quantifying the mass transport performances of oxygen in gas liquid biofilm phases the parameters of d g l d l b and d b in the absence and presence of ceo2 nps were calculated and displayed in figs s4a c the average value of d g l was 4 93 10 9 m2 s 1 in control test with the increase of ceo2 nps concentrations the d g l value gradually increased and eventually rose to 8 44 10 9 m2 s 1 in 10 mg l ceo2 nps p 0 01 indicating the enhanced mto in gas liquid interface in contrast the d l b was reduced with different degrees after exposure to different concentrations of ceo2 nps notably the effective diffusivity in boundary layer figs s4a b showed the opposite tendency to the boundary layer thickness fig 2a b in the presence of ceo2 nps actually this would lead to a consistent contributor to the mass transfer rate in interfaces because of the inverse proportional relationship between them in equations s 1 and s 2 with regard to d b fig s4c the control value was calculated as 6 81 10 10 m2 s 1 which was much smaller than that in boundary layer and probably became the limiting rate of oxygen transport in gas liquid biofilm phases after exposure to ceo2 nps the d b decreased from 6 11 10 10 m2 s 1 in sbbr 1 to 4 43 10 10 m2 s 1 in sbbr3 revealing negative effects on d b induced by 10 mg l ceo2 nps the further simulated profiles using the profiling software with the calculated d g l d l b and d b showed a good agreement with measured profiles confirmed by the nrmse fig s4d 6 92 5 23 7 39 and 5 77 in the presence of 0 0 1 1 and 10 mg l ceo2 nps respectively which demonstrated the reasonability of the diffusion coefficients calculations figs s4a c furthermore the control test yields 2 86 10 3 nmol cm 2 s 1 for the depth integrated o2 consumption and the addition of 10 mg l ceo2 nps enhanced the oxygen flux in gas liquid biofilm with a depth integrated o2 consumption of 3 42 10 3 nmol cm 2 s 1 fig s5 these results clearly suggested that the mass transport efficiency of oxygen in boundary layers including gas liquid and liquid biofilm and inside biofilm were differently affected by ceo2 nps which thereby altered the oxygen mass fluxes in gas liquid biofilm the potential mechanisms are further explored in the next section 3 3 variations of mto in gas liquid biofilm phases and potential mechanisms 3 3 1 effects of ceo2 nps on external effective mto and reaeration rate generally the thickness of liquid film controlling the mass transfer resistance in gas liquid interface is highly related to the liquid properties garcia ochoa and gomez 2009 the addition of ceo2 nps would increase the quantity of small particles k sp 4 10 51 in sewage and thus probably affected the external effective mto here the curves of reoxygenation in the absence and presence of ceo2 nps were recorded to clarify the role of ceo2 nps in external mto as shown in fig 3 the oxygen concentration during reoxygenation process increased rapidly in the first 90 s and reached up to 8 mg l in control test then the oxygen concentration increased slowly in the following period of 90 s and approached to the saturated concentration this phenomenon indicated that the concentration of do in wastewater was mainly driven by the concentration gradient in this way the fick s equation was applied to fit the process of reoxygenation as expected the measured data fitted well with the fick s equation r2 0 99 and the related parameters were exhibited in the attached table in fig 3 the addition of 0 1 mg l ceo2 nps didn t affect the reoxygenation process in sewage which was consistent with the unchanged l g l in fig 2a to avoid data overlapping this curve was not presented obviously 180 s were taken to recover to saturated oxygen concentration in control test while 150 s were needed in the presence of 1 mg l ceo2 nps and the time for oxygen recovering were further shortened to 120 s in 10 mg l ceo2 nps indicating the enhanced reoxygenation rate in sewage in 1 and 10 mg l ceo2 nps the transport of oxygen from gas to wastewater was characterized by oxygen transfer coefficient k la and a higher value of k la suggests a lower transfer resistance and vice versa garcia ochoa and gomez 2009 in control k la was calculated as 1 95 10 2 s 1 with the dosage of 1 and 10 mg l ceo2 nps k la gradually increased to 2 50 10 2 s 1 and 3 42 10 2 s 1 these results confirmed that the addition of ceo2 nps could reduce the transfer resistance and thus enhanced the mass transfer rate between wastewater and gas fig s4a krishnamurthy et al 2006 also found that the formation of nanofluids which contained suspended nanoparticles in liquid enhanced mass transport due to the localized convection arising from the nanoparticles brownian motion meanwhile ma et al 2004 reported that gas liquid mass transfer was often accompanied by interfacial turbulence the nonuniformity of ceo2 nps in solution caused by brownian motion could result in local concentration or tension gradient which further led to the interfacial turbulence and consequently improved mass transfer considerably furthermore the addition of ceo2 nps constantly collided with the gas liquid boundary layer and acted as the mingle effect ruthiya et al 2004 which reduced the thickness of gas liquid boundary layer fig 2a and enhanced the external mto 3 3 2 effects of ceo2 nps on intermediate effective mto and interfacial microstructures the thickness of liquid biofilm boundary layer as well as the intermediate effective mto was found to depend on the surface structure of biofilm wäsche et al 2002 thereafter esem was applied to provide images of the morphology of irregularly shaped biofilm with and without ceo2 nps exposure in control test figs s6a and e a typical mushroom like structure with plenty of white secretion substances and dark pores were observed on the biofilm surface with the increased dosage of ceo2 nps from 0 1 to 10 mg l figs s6b d and f h the content of white secretion substances increased and the image color changed into gray white additionally the number of dark pores decreased and the biofilm surface tended to be even and uniform according to the related researches you et al 2015 the increased production of white secretion substances was confirmed to be eps supporting the physical barrier to protect the biofilm from the toxicity of ceo2 nps previous study has concluded that the exposure to ceo2 nps altered the composition and distribution of eps in wastewater biofilm wang et al 2018 which would consequently affect the surface structure of biofilm in the present study after exposure to ceo2 nps the production of eps gradually increased from 18 21 in control to 21 80 mg toc g biomass in 10 mg l ceo2 nps fig s7 which might be caused by microbial regulation wang et al 2018 you et al 2015 thus it can be inferred that the enhanced eps secretion could block up the pores and channels inside biofilm which gave rise to the uniform surface and the reduction of biofilm pores and intermediate effective mto afm with high resolution was introduced to further observe the microstructure of liquid biofilm interface before and after exposure to ceo2 nps the surface of biofilm was bright colorful in control test and the concave convex structure was visibly observed fig 4 a after exposure to ceo2 nps the biofilm was in monotonous color and presented smooth surface with fewer protrusions fig 4b d fig 4e h showed the 3 d projections of biofilm microstructure and the voltage v for a certain tip position represents the local contact potential difference lcpd in biofilm mohn et al 2012 in control test the highest lcpd was measured to be 342 8 mv after exposure to 1 and 10 mg l ceo2 nps the highest lcpd declined to 117 4 and 92 6 mv indicating the relatively smoother surface these afm images further confirmed that the presence of ceo2 nps changed the concave convex structure of biofilm into uniform and smooth surface generally the roughness r q describes the depth of valleys in biofilm picioreanu et al 2000 and the r q of biofilm surface was deemed to be negatively correlated with the mass transfer resistance zhang and bishop 1994 as illustrated in figs s8a and a slight increase of r q occurred in 0 1 and 1 mg l ceo2 nps while the r q decreased to 88 of control after exposure to 10 mg l ceo2 nps the changing trends of r q could not scientifically explain the increased l l b fig 2b or the reduction of d l b fig s4b in liquid biofilm interfaces in response to ceo2 nps which suggested that r q was not reasonable to characterize the intermediate mto variation picioreanu et al 2000 also found that increased biofilm roughness did not necessarily lead to an enhancement of intermediate mass transport since the width of the valleys is also important stoodley et al 1999 the sad is in general a comprehensive parameter reflecting the heterogeneity including the depth and width of the valleys of biofilm surface with the concentration of ceo2 nps increased to 10 mg l the sad shown in fig s8b gradually decreased from 42 7 in control to 11 8 exhibiting the uniform and smooth surface of biofilm these changes were adverse to the interfacial turbulence and the irregular motion of oxygen thus led to the enhancement of the l l b fig 2b the enhanced eps production and uniform surface structure derived from esem and afm consequences on the other hand could also prevent ceo2 nps transporting into the inner biofilm which was likely to be an important countermeasure of biofilm for the stress of ceo2 nps 3 3 3 effects of ceo2 nps on internal effective mto and microbial metabolism the oxygen transport within biofilm was highly related to the microbial metabolism and respiration guimerà et al 2016 dha has been widely accepted to estimate the microbial activity in environmental samples lazarova and manem 1995 meanwhile dha values were reported to correlate well with atp contents and the oxygen utilization rate trevors et al 1982 lazarova and manem 1995 fig s9 showed that the dha level significantly decreased p 0 05 after exposure to ceo2 nps similarly as the dosage of ceo2 nps increased to 10 mg l the atp content declined from 13 83 in control to 11 74 μmol l compared with atp dha is more sensitive to biochemical changes reichardt 1979 which might explain the differences in establishing a good correlation between dha and atp in this study after exposure to ceo2 nps the decreased atp and dha content revealed the inhibited activity of biofilm which probably suggested the reduced oxygen consumption by microbial metabolism rna and dna are fundamental components of bacterial cells and the fluorochrome enables a distinction to visualize them the spatial distributions of rna and dna were obtained through clsm as displayed in fig s10 in control test the clsm images was mainly presented in orange red indicating rna and cells with high activity was dominant after the cells being exposed to ceo2 nps the vision of clsm images gradually shifted to orange green and the density of dna increased the original color of 2 d images in each layer was processed numerically for the semi quantitative analysis of the 3 d clsm images and the results were shown in fig 5 a the total rna accounted for 68 18 and the ratio of rna dna was 2 14 in control while the addition of 10 mg l ceo2 nps decreased the rna dna value to 0 24 it s reported that the rna dna ratio has been used as a proxy for their relative activity in kinds of bacteria giner et al 2020 therefore the ratio of rna to dna was hierarchically calculated in vertical within biofilm as shown in fig 5b after exposure to ceo2 nps the rna dna value in each layer was much lower than that in control confirming the inhibited activity of biofilm caused by ceo2 nps notably in comparison with the control test the position of the highest microbial activity with maximum value of rna dna fig 5b moved towards the surface of biofilm in the presence of 1 and 10 mg l ceo2 nps which showed a similar tendency with l b in fig 2c it could be inferred that because of ceo2 nps exposure the decreased penetration depth of oxygen in biofilm would lead to the active bacteria in deeper parts moved towards the surface of biofilm for oxygen achievement to survive from or adapt to the changed conditions simultaneously considering the enhanced concentration of oxygen approaching to biofilm fig s3c and the inhibited microbe activity inside biofilm fig 5a and figs s9 s10 there would result in an enhancement of l b in biofilm in the presence of ceo2 nps however this is not the fact in fig 2c it s important to note that the depth of oxygen penetration within biofilm was not only correlated with the oxygen concentration and the microbial metabolism but also affected by the mass transfer resistance within biofilm after exposure to ceo2 nps the enhanced eps production fig s7 would definitely increase the mass transfer resistance since the diffusion coefficients of eps are lower than those of other components in biofilm sheng et al 2010 indeed the mass transfer coefficient of oxygen d b in fig s4c within biofilm significantly decreased after ceo2 nps exposure therefore the enhanced eps production that led to the reduced d b after ceo2 nps exposure was the dominant factor in decreasing the l b in biofilm which in turn altered the spatial distribution of bacterial activity fig 5b the degradation of glucose serving as the sole carbon source in this study was a critical step to produce metabolites and energy for microbes and usually cooccur with respiration shimizua and matsuoka 2019a the embden meyerhof pathway emp and pentose phosphate pathway ppp are the fundamental pathways of carbohydrate metabolism fig 6 a which are largely dependent on the catalysis of relevant enzymes as shown in fig 6b the activities of three key enzymes hk gapdh and pk in emp were inhibited in the presence of ceo2 nps which would negatively affect the subsequent aerobic respiration dominated by the tca cycle and atp synthesis fig s9 during the process of glycolysis the activity of gapdh was the most inhibited and declined by 46 35 after exposure to 10 mg l ceo2 nps which was one of the underlying reasons for the decreased dha concentrations fig s9 meanwhile the gapdh catalyzing glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate to glycerate 1 3 phosphate is coupled with the reduction of nad to nadh thus the content of nadh was likely to decrease with ceo2 nps treatment however the activities of two important enzymes gpdh and pgdh in ppp were enhanced in the presence of ceo2 nps it s interesting to find that the enzymatic reactions of gpdh and pgdh were coupled with the generation of nadph as a result the production of nadph was probably increased although nadh and nadph are chemically similar and function as unique electron carriers they play different physiological roles in metabolisms valdivia gonza lez et al 2012 basically nadh is used to generate atp in the respiratory chain reactions catabolism while nadph provides the reducing power for cell synthesis anabolism shimizua and matsuoka 2019a 2019b these results in fig 6b indicated that after exposure to ceo2 nps the metabolic pathways in biofilm would convert from emp together with aerobic respiration to generate abundant atp thus explained the decreased atp content to ppp which could be the metabolic regulation mechanisms of microbe to cope with ceo2 nps compared to emp the glycometabolism in ppp was oxidized to produce cell precursors and nadph for biomass synthesis with a small amount of oxygen shimizua and matsuoka 2019b which preferably occurred in biofilm with decreased do after ceo2 nps exposure furthermore nadph regarded as excellent redox cofactor played essential roles in protecting the cells from oxidative stress induced by ceo2 nps the most accepted toxicity mechanism of ceo2 nps cheng et al 2013 von moos and slaveykova 2014 more importantly the ppp benefits for the biomass synthesis which would certainly promote the production of eps to form potent physical defense thus also leading to the enhancement of internal mass transfer resistance 3 4 environmental implications the above mentioned results clearly demonstrated that the presence of ceo2 nps impacted the mto in the external intermediate and internal media of gas liquid biofilm three phases as schematically illustrated in fig 6c when ceo2 nps was released into wastewater the brownian motion caused by these tiny particles and the interfacial turbulence created by the uneven distribution of particles compressed the thickness of gas liquid boundary layer thus increased the oxygen concentration in wastewater however to resist against ceo2 nps more eps was secreted by microorganisms and the surface of biofilm became uniform and smooth which caused an enhancement of the thickness of gas liquid boundary layer and a reduction of intermediate effective diffusion despite the enhanced concentration of oxygen approaching to biofilm surface and the inhibited microbe activity within biofilm the increased mass transfer resistances resulted from the enhanced eps production were expected to be the most important reasons for the decreased penetration depth of oxygen in biofilm in the presence of 10 mg l ceo2 nps furthermore we found that the transition from emp to ppp was probably the metabolic regulation mechanism for the enhanced eps production to cope with ceo2 nps in addition to emp and ppp ceo2 nps may further affect the transformation from aerobic respiration mediated by tca cycle to respiro fermentative metabolism pathway due to oxygen limitation shimizua and matsuoka 2019a thus probably leading to far reaching effects to wastewater treatment to mitigate the negative effects induced by 10 mg l ceo2 nps the hydraulic regulation through controlling the aeration to accelerate the update of biofilms was feasible since this approach not only improves mass transfer of oxygen but also benefits to remove these nps adsorbed or entrapped in the surface of biofilm you et al 2016 in addition the shielding reagents such as humic acid and citrate might be injected to reduce the bioavailability and toxicity of ceo2 nps xu et al 2018 it should be noted that this study mainly focused on the transfer processes of oxygen from gas to biofilm three phase system in the presence of ceo2 nps much more pollutants e g cod no3 po4 3 etc in sewage were different from oxygen since they merely transported from the liquid phase to the biofilm matrix two phase system for removal according to the above discussion the mass transfer efficiency in liquid biofilm interface and within biofilm both decreased after exposure to ceo2 nps which would lead to a reduction of pollutants removal however as well performed adsorbents the enhanced eps production could provide more binding sites for pollutants and thus increase local concentration on the surface of biofilm you et al 2015 sheng et al 2010 therefore the positive or negative roles of eps in pollutants removal and mass transfer in the presence of ceo2 nps need to be further explored in practice biofilms in wastewater treatment was incubated in aeration or under a certain hydrodynamic condition however this study investigated the performance of oxygen transfer in a stable state with no aeration being advantages for the simplification of the transfer processes in gas liquid biofilm phases and the amplification for effects of ceo2 nps in the future more work needs to be conducted to better understand the effects of these small particles on mass transfer performance of microaggregates in actual wastewater environment 4 conclusions this study comprehensively investigated the variations of external intermediate and internal mass transfer of oxygen in heterogeneous wastewater biofilm in response to ceo2 nps main conclusions of this study are due to the brownian motion and interfacial turbulence caused by ceo2 nps the addition of 10 mg l ceo2 nps enhanced the external mass transfer efficiency from gas to wastewater which decreased the thickness of gas liquid boundary layer and increased the oxygen concentration in wastewater to resist against ceo2 nps more eps was secreted and the surface of biofilm turned into uniform and smooth which led to a reduction of the surface area difference and an enhancement of the thickness of liquid biofilm boundary layer compared to the external and intermediate mass transfer the internal mass transfer resistances controlled the overall transfer rate in gas liquid biofilm phases the transition of emp to ppp would likely be the metabolic regulation mechanism of microbe to cope with ceo2 nps contributing to the enhanced eps production and consequently increased the internal mass transfer resistances which further affected the spatial distribution of active bacteria to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that the transfer processes of oxygen in three phase system and the related mechanisms were elucidated this study would provide the basis for understanding the mass transport performance and removal efficiency
