8955,optimizing irrigation and nitrogen n fertilization cooperative application to coordinate the balance between agricultural production and ecological environment is a vital challenge for sustainable agricultural production here a three year field experiment was conducted from 2018 to 2020 in the semi arid region of north china to investigate the effects of different irrigation amounts w1 50 etc etc is the crop evapotranspiration w2 75 etc w3 100 etc w4 125 etc and nitrogen fertilization rates f1 75 kg ha 1 f2 150 kg ha 1 f3 225 kg ha 1 f4 300 kg ha 1 on growth yield water and fertilizer use efficiency and soil n residue of spring wheat by drip fertigation and explore the optimal combination of irrigation amount and n fertilization rate based on a multi objective optimization method the results showed that leaf area index lai dry matter accumulation yield water use efficiency wue and economic return of spring wheat increased first and then decreased with increasing irrigation at the same level of n fertilization these parameters peaked at w3 with w1 performed poorly and low irrigation amount was detrimental to the function of fertilizer at the same level of irrigation lai dry matter accumulation yield and economic return all demonstrated significant diminishing return effects with increasing n fertilization whereas nitrogen partial factor productivity npfp reduced with increasing n fertilization furthermore with the simultaneous increase of irrigation and n fertilization the accumulation of soil nitrate nitrogen no3 n decreased in the 0 40 cm soil layer and increased in the 60 100 cm soil layer the partial least squares path model pls pm revealed that irrigation had a direct positive effect on spring wheat yield rather than n fertilization and irrigation had a direct negative effect on soil n residue based on the multi objective optimization model established by multiple regression analysis and the elitist non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii the irrigation amount of 337 3 354 9 mm combined with the n fertilization rate of 181 2 198 6 kg ha 1 could obtain the optimal comprehensive benefits of wheat yield economic return water and fertilizer utilization efficiency and environmental impact this study can provide an important scientific basis for the management and optimization of irrigation and fertilization for spring wheat in semi arid region of china and other similar regions around the world keywords water and nitrogen coupling multi objective optimization genetic algorithm environmentally friendly agriculture spring wheat yield data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water and fertilizer are two essential elements of agricultural production agriculture worldwide used the vast majority of land surface water and 72 of groundwater mainly for irrigation food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2022 in china agricultural irrigation is the largest water user li et al 2020 however due to water resource scarcity agricultural development in china has been limited to some extent li et al 2021 additionally nitrogen n is a crucial component that affects crop growth and yield long et al 2021 from 1980 2020 the amount of n fertilizer greatly exceeded the demand for crops and it led to several environmental problems particularly in the semi arid regions zhang et al 2020 the semi arid regions of china possess ample land and solar resources with tremendous potential for grain production chen et al 2022 however due to the growing population and food demand the overexploitation of agriculture has resulted in various ecological issues such as soil degradation vashisht et al 2015 and groundwater pollution kanter et al 2020 spring wheat is one of the main food crops in this region accounting for over 30 of the local cultivated area jiang et al 2019 as precipitation is scarce groundwater is the main source of water for wheat production tang et al 2018 currently the primary issue with wheat production is the lack of precise quantitative irrigation and fertilization cooperative applications the unregulated and excessive use of irrigation and nitrogen fertilizers to achieve higher yields has resulted in the waste of resources and environmental pollution tang et al 2021 optimizing the inputs of irrigation and n fertilizer is an effective way to coordinate high crop yield low resource consumption and a friendly eco environment liu et al 2019 ballester et al 2021 water and n fertilizer management are interdependent elements that cannot be optimized as independent factors hu et al 2010 this is because crop yield depends on water availability while yield levels depend on the amount of nitrogen applied soil nitrogen can only be taken up and used by plants if it is dissolved in water low soil moisture content affects the diffusion and transport of soil nitrogen gong 2009 which reduces the n uptake by crop roots and ultimately affects yield wang et al 2006 with the rapid development of social economy and agricultural technologies achieving high yield is no longer the only goal of agricultural production the integration of environment friendly and resource saving agriculture has gradually become a long term goal for sustainable development liu et al 2020 in northern china the conventional surface irrigation based management strategy for spring wheat involves 600 mm of irrigation and 200 kg ha 1 n fertilizer kamran et al 2023 however large scale promotion and application of surface irrigation in water scarce dryland areas such as through surface flood irrigation is not a sustainable means of crop production wang et al 2016 in recent years researchers have explored new irrigation and fertilization techniques to improve the water and nutrient use efficiency of wheat in arid regions drip fertigation is an option that reduces crop water requirements and nitrogen loss without compromising yield sun et al 2022 compared with traditional irrigation and fertilization drip irrigation and fertilization technology can accurately and timely apply water and fertilizer near the plant root zone via the pipeline system thereby reducing fertilizer loss and improving water and fertilizer use efficiency ma et al 2022 eissa et al 2018 have reported an increase in wheat yield and water use efficiency by 28 4 40 and 27 6 41 8 respectively through the combination of drip irrigation and n fertilizer application in semi arid areas resulting in the effective utilization of water and fertilizer furthermore drip fertigation has been shown to increase net income by more than 10 compared to flood fertigation in northern china making it a financially lucrative option for local farmers yuan et al 2022 however it should be noted that the potential environmental risks associated with fertilizer application are often overlooked li et al 2022 demonstrated a 32 reduction in nitrate nitrogen leaching through the optimization of irrigation and n management in spring wheat production systems thereby mitigating the risk of soil environmental pollution however previous studies have determined the optimal solution based on the results of field experiments on wheat production without further modelling analysis and optimization which often leads to inaccurate results consequently the development of sustainable water and fertilizer management strategies has become essential to ensure agricultural production and ecological balance in arid and semi arid regions unfortunately the cooperative effects of irrigation and n fertilization on yield economic return water and fertilizer use efficiency and environmental impact in drip irrigation spring wheat in semi arid regions of northern china are still unclear further research is necessary to elucidate these critical aspects synchronizing irrigation and fertilization with crop demand considering temporal and spatial variations is a wise water and fertilizer management strategy that depends on various factors such as irrigation and fertilization methods and crop types behera panda 2009 song et al 2021 therefore it is crucial to select an appropriate optimization method based on regional and crop characteristics among various methods the genetic algorithm ga is widely used for solving the optimal management system of crops especially for multi objective optimization problems the evaluation results of ga are reliable and reasonable luo et al 2016 suhaimi et al 2018 and it can be easily integrated with other methods in this study we hypothesized that the current irrigation and n management for spring wheat in the semi arid region of north china are excessive li et al 2021 yuan et al 2022 kamran et al 2023 we further postulated that these practices are not conducive to higher production returns instead optimizing irrigation and n fertilization rates based on multiple regression with nsga ii could improve resource use efficiency increase yield and economic return and promote environmentally friendly agriculture thus the purposes of this study were 1 to explore the collaborative effects of different irrigation and n fertilization amounts on leaf area index dry matter accumulation yield economic return water and nitrogen use efficiency and soil nitrogen residue through field experiment and to dissect the correlations among the factors using pearson correlation and pls pm analysis 2 to establish a comprehensive evaluation index system based on high yield economic benefit water and nitrogen use efficiency and friendly environment and use multiple regression model combined with nsga ii for multi objective optimization 3 to determine the optimal irrigation and n fertilization rates on comprehensive benefit for spring wheat in the semi arid region this study can provide a theoretical basis and support for the decision system of spring wheat production in the semi arid region of china 2 materials and methods 2 1 climate and soil conditions at the experimental site the field experiments were carried out during 2018 2020 at the

were buried around each plot to prevent the influence of lateral infiltration of water and nutrients between the plots the test plot was equipped with two 1 m wide paths for irrigation and field monitoring and sampling and 1 m wide protective rows were set around the test plot the irrigation scheme was implemented based on the growth stage of wheat following planting a uniform micro sprinkler

applied four times during the cropping seasons 20 at the seedling stooling stage 30 at the stooling jointing stage 30 at the heading flowering stage and 20 at the flowering filling stage each application was done via drip irrigation in the middle of each irrigation stage after dissolving solid nitrogen fertilizers in water one day before irrigation differential pressure tanks were used for fertilization with each plot equipped with one 12 l tank the amount of irrigation was calculated based on crop evapotranspiration etc and when rainfall occurred the effective rainfall amount was subtracted from the irrigation schedule water meters were installed at different irrigation levels to strictly control the amount of irrigation the process of irrigation and n fertilization during the

parameters in production was solved fig a firstly the function was constructed with irrigation amount and nitrogen fertilizer rate as independent variables and multiple objective benefits as dependent variables multi objective optimization is performed by an optimization algorithm to obtain set of pareto solutions of irrigation amount and nitrogen fertilizer rate respectively elitist non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii search the solution area quickly to avoid premature convergence and can obtain uniformly distributed pareto solutions in this paper the nsga ii was used to optimize the search within the regression model to obtain the set of pareto solutions 2 4 1 construction of objective function correlation between grain yield wue npfp ni soil n residue and influencing factors

pareto solution in this paper what was involved was a multi objective optimization problem seeking to maximize wheat yield economic return wue and npfp simultaneously and to minimise environmental impact thus pareto solution could not be unique and was the set of pareto solutions 2 6 data analysis the value of each indicator was the mean of three replicates per treatment spss version 24 0 ibm

and by 0 30 5 34 2 88 12 65 and 2 91 7 21 in 2020 respectively at the same nitrogen fertilization rate lai tended to increase and then decrease with increasing amount of irrigation and excessive irrigation w4 reduced lai compared with f1 f2 f3 and f4 increased dry matter accumulation by 2 99 8 75 8 77 20 42 and 5 25 16 32 in 2018 and by 4 27 7 36 8 94 19 48 and 4 95 10 23 in 2019 and by 3 44

irrigation w1 w2 w3 and w4 increased yield by 12 24 31 67 and 22 96 in 2018 and by 9 43 29 33 and 18 70 in 2019 and by 13 63 28 44 and 23 07 respectively compared with the low nitrogen fertilization

wue increased and then decreased in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively wue was the largest in w2 while w3 and w4 decreased and the increase of irrigation amount significantly decreased wue wue also increased and then decreased with the increase of nitrogen fertilization rate npfp decreased with the increase of nitrogen fertilization rate compared with the low nitrogen fertilization f1 f2 f3 and f4 decreased npfp by 42 6 47 8 60 9 65 5 and 72 4 74 4 in 2018 and by 45 8 48 6 61 1 64 8 and 71 6 74 0 in 2019 and by 47 9 48 2 61 9 64 1 and 72 4 74 0 in 2020 respectively table 2 3 3 soil no3 n accumulation year irrigation amount nitrogen fertilization rate the two and three way had extremely significant effects on soil no3 n accumulation p 0 01 table a the accumulation of no3 n in 0 100 cm soil layer increased with the increase of nitrogen fertilization rate but decreased with the increase of irrigation amount compared with the low nitrogen fertilization rate f1 f2 f3 and f4 increased the soil no3 n accumulation by 12 69 37 08 31 68 58 85 and 58 18 77 94 in 2018 and by 21 35 26 14 39 80 53 95 and 66 95 73 58 in 2019 and by 3 51 18 04 17 59 30 19 and 33 94 61 83 in 2020 respectively the largest amount of no3 n accumulated in the 0 40 cm soil layer in addition no3 n gradually migrated downwards with increasing irrigation amount compared with 2018 the average accumulation of no3 n in the 0 100 cm soil layer increased by 4 86 in 2020 while the soil no3 n in the 40 100 cm increased by 8 76 fig 5 the indicates that a higher amount of no3 n was leached into the deeper soil layers and accumulated each year 3 4 economic return year irrigation amount nitrogen fertilization rate and the two way had significant effects on net income p 0 05 table a with the increase of irrigation and nitrogen fertilization input the economic return increased and then decreased net income was 5001 9394 cny ha 1 in 2018 5870 10686 cny ha 1 in 2019 and 5426 9744 cny ha 1 in 2020 respectively table 3 the highest profit increased by more than 80 compared with the lowest income level in 2018 2019 and 2020 this result suggests that improper irrigation and fertilization management could reduce the actual production return for three years water fees were only 507 564 and 564 cny ha 1 lower at the low irrigation w1 than at the full irrigation w3 water expenditure was a relatively small proportion of total inputs but the reduction in irrigation led to a significant loss in economic return at the same irrigation level economic return increased and then decreased with increasing nitrogen fertilization inputs and excessive fertilization inputs did not increase return but rather deteriorated soil properties and increased the risk of groundwater pollution 3 5 relations between grain yield economic return wue npfp and soil no3 n accumulation correlation analysis demonstrated that wheat growth indicators and yield significantly affected wue and net income lai was significantly positively correlated with dry matter accumulation in 2018 2019 and 2020 yield was significantly positively correlated with wue and net income whereas npfp was extremely significant and negative with soil no3 n accumulation fig 6 pls pm was used to further evaluate the relationship between irrigation nitrogen fertilization crop growth soil nitrogen residue water and fertilization utilization and economic return fig 7 the model revealed that irrigation had an extremely significant positive effect on crop growth 0 677 and yield formation 0 246 but irrigation had a significant and direct negative effect on soil n residue 0 455 the differences in fertilization did not directly affect crop yield but nitrogen fertilization had a significant positive effect on crop growth 0 331 and soil n residue 0 793 crop yield had significant positive effects on wue 0 798 npfp 0 472 and economic return 0 997 3 6 multi objective optimization of irrigation amount and nitrogen fertilizer rate based on the three year experimental data water and nitrogen input were used as independent variables and crop yield economic return water use efficiency nitrogen partial productivity and soil nitrogen residue were used as response variables based on the least square method the data were analyzed by sigmaplot 12 5 to establish a binary quadratic regression equation table b the five regression equations all showed significant quadratic polynomial correlation p 0 001 indicating that the regression models could be used to determine the effects of irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer on the optimization objectives in spring wheat production the response surface demonstrated that the coupling effects of water and nitrogen fertilizer input on spring wheat yield economic return and water use efficiency showed a downward convex shape when wheat yield economic return and water use efficiency reached the maximum the amount of irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer required for wheat were similar but the values required to maximize npfp and minimize soil n residue were significantly different fig 8 to simultaneously meet the five objectives of crop yield maximization economic benefit maximization water use efficiency maximization nitrogen partial productivity maximization and soil nitrogen residue minimization we combined multiple regression with genetic algorithm for multi objective optimization to determine the optimal irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer input we used a set of pareto solutions based on multi objective optimization obtained through python 3 7 10 to bring the regression equation as an objective function into the genetic algorithm for global optimization table c each optimal solution represented a set of water and nitrogen optimization solutions based on the multi objective optimization of water saving fertilizer conserving yield increasing income generating and pollution reducing the optimal irrigation amount was determined to be in the range of 337 3 354 9 mm and the nitrogen fertilization rate to be in the range of 181 2 198 6 kg ha 1 fig b 4 discussion 4 1 effects of different irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer regimes on wheat growth yield and economic return the growth and development of plants are influenced by the interaction and dependence between water and nutrients water serves as a solvent for soil nutrients and affects their migration and uptake while appropriate fertilization can promote crop growth enhance photosynthesis and transpiration and improve water uptake and utilization leading to the view of water promoting fertilizer and water regulated by fertilizer ju et al 2009 sun et al 2019 many studies have shown that irrigation and fertilization significantly affect crop growth and yield zain et al 2021 and the morphological characteristics and dry matter accumulation during plant growth reflect crop growth increasing irrigation can promote leaf area index lai and biomass accumulation gheysari et al 2017 whereas insufficient irrigation may inhibit fertilizer uptake and utilization affecting both nutritional and reproductive growth and ultimately impacting yield formation fan et al 2020 in this study the lai dry matter accumulation and yield of spring wheat initially increased and then decreased with increasing irrigation reaching a maximum under full irrigation excessive irrigation decreased lai dry matter accumulation and yield however wheat yield was still significantly higher than that of low and medium irrigation levels water is still the most critical factor in crop yield formation in the semi arid region ali et al 2019 furthermore pls pm analysis also demonstrated that irrigation had a stronger positive effect on wheat growth and yield rather than fertilization however n fertilization plays an essential role in improving wheat yield vogeler et al 2021 when n fertilization rate exceeds a reasonable range crop growth can be negatively affected by reduced stress tolerance excess nutrient growth and reduced light energy utilization ultimately leading to reduced yield xue et al 2015 in this study both n fertilization and irrigation had a significant main effect on wheat yield with irrigation having a greater effect on wheat yield than n fertilization hochman and horan 2018 also found similar results as a shallow root crop wheat mainly absorbs soil moisture and nutrients from the plow layer wang et al 2014 however excessive irrigation reduces the accumulation of nitrogen in the root zone which affects wheat s absorption of soil nitrogen in the plow layer and leads to a decrease in wheat yield furthermore crop yield is not only related to its physiological characteristics and field management but also to soil and climate conditions the soil type in the experimental area is chestnut soil and there is a significant deposition layer of calcium carbonate below 40 cm of soil excessive irrigation may lead to secondary salinization which can adversely affect crop growth gao et al 2022 economic return is a primary objective in agricultural production this study reveals that reducing irrigation can lead to greater economic losses compared with low irrigation full irrigation resulted in an economic return increase of over 80 in different years from a water saving irrigation perspective while the economic return of medium irrigation is about 30 lower than full irrigation it can save up to 25 of water table 3 however the main reason why farmers are reluctant to save water is due to the lower economic return resulting from reduced irrigation additionally under the same irrigation level the economic return initially increased with an increase in n fertilization rate but then decreased this suggests that a high n fertilizer input does not necessarily increase net income which is consistent with the findings of wang et al 2018 in semi arid regions to achieve sustainable agricultural production more precise irrigation management should be considered such as implementing moderate irrigation strategies 4 2 effects of different water and nitrogen fertilizer regimes on water and fertilizer use efficiency wue accurately expresses the relationship between crop production and water consumption providing a better reflection of actual production wue was higher under deficit irrigation whereas wue decreased under excessive irrigation but could be improved by optimizing irrigation wang et al 2018 compared with deficit irrigation wue decreased in full irrigation and excessive irrigation and an appropriate increase in n fertilizer supply could improve wue to a certain extent reflecting the coupling relationship between water and nitrogen both wheat yield and wue increased and then decreased with water and nitrogen inputs which was consistent with the results of xiao et al 2021 water deficit can lead to a decrease in nitrogen utilization ability of plants which is related to the reduction in soil nitrogen availability or root nitrogen uptake capacity under water deficit liu et al 2015 moreover excessive fertilization may increase the crop canopy and excessive transpiration resulting in a decrease in wue npfp is a crucial indicator for evaluating nitrogen use efficiency li et al 2020 reported that reducing n fertilization rates could significantly increase npfp whereas excessive n fertilization significantly reduced it which is consistent with our study moreover we found that the interaction between irrigation and n fertilization had a significant effect on npfp specifically npfp increased and then decreased with increasing irrigation one possible explanation for this is that irrigation promotes fertilizer uptake but excessive irrigation can lead to the leaching of fertilizer beyond the root zone this impairs n uptake by plant roots and results in a decrease in npfp although low nitrogen resulted in higher npfp at all irrigation levels it did not meet the production requirements thus moderate to adequate n fertilization was more profitable for both yield and npfp 4 3 effects of different irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer regimes on soil nitrogen residue soil nitrogen residue after crop harvest is a crucial indicator of soil quality and the environment shi et al 2020 after the crop has taken up soil nitrogen during the current growing season any remaining nitrogen accumulates in the soil and the amount of n taken up by subsequent crops is minimal only 21 23 of the nitrogen was taken up by the crop hajrasuliha et al 1998 in northern china soil n residue increases significantly when wheat is planted with an n fertilization rate exceeding 200 kg ha 1 fang et al 2006 in the study soil n residues also increased significantly when the n fertilization rate exceeded 225 kg ha 1 however the crops uptake and utilization of water and nutrients have limits excessive n fertilization led to a significant accumulation of residual n in non root soil layers which could easily result in soil n leaching thompson et al 2007 additionally nitrogen transport is significantly affected by irrigation lenka et al 2013 in this experiment conducted in a drip irrigation system nitrogen transport after fertilization was affected by several parameters such as drip irrigation system operation irrigation amount fertilizer concentration and soil properties petraityte et al 2022 at the same irrigation level n residue in the soil followed a pattern with the highest residue found at w1 the lowest irrigation level and the lowest at w4 the highest irrigation level the amount of n residue in the 100 cm soil layer decreased as irrigation levels increased this finding can be attributed to the fact that fertilizer n conversion to soil n is inhibited at low irrigation levels leading to a higher accumulation of fertilizer n in the soil chen et al 2014 inorganic nitrogen is the primary form of n taken up by crops and its transport in the soil is driven by water schröder 2014 when the soil surface is dry transpiration by plants or evaporation from the surface causes the transport of soil n with water however under irrigation conditions the increased shallow soil moisture level leads to soil n leaching with water excessive irrigation causes soil n to migrate to deeper soils resulting in groundwater contamination zhou et al 2022 in this study the soil n residue in the 100 cm layer was high under low irrigation however crop uptake of n was limited resulting in a significant amount of n remaining in the soil surface layer this excess n could potentially escape to the environment and pollute the atmosphere therefore the combination of low irrigation w1 and different n fertilization rates is a poor coupling pattern when full irrigation increases to excessive levels soil n combines with deep water infiltration resulting in soil n migration below the 100 cm soil layer appropriate n fertilization rates and irrigation regimes can reduce deep infiltration of n and decrease residue while excessive irrigation increases the risks of nutrient leaching and groundwater contamination 4 4 suitable irrigation and nitrogen interval based on multi objective optimization to achieve a balance between crop yield economic return resource use efficiency and environmental impact it is crucial to adopt optimal irrigation and nitrogen n fertilizer management strategies however due to the complex interplay between irrigation and n fertilization and their effects on multiple objectives of spring wheat production it is not possible to devise an optimal water and fertilizer strategy based solely on qualitative analysis hence it is imperative to quantify the response of multiple objectives to different levels of irrigation and n fertilization and to identify appropriate intervals for water and n fertilizer application multi objective optimization based on multiple regression combined with genetic algorithm overcomes the subjective weighting in earlier studies by experts making the optimization solution more objective in this study a coordinated optimal solution was found for multiple production objectives in spring wheat production the optimization process sought to simultaneously maximize wheat yield economic return water use efficiency wue and nitrogen partial factor productivity npfp while minimizing environmental pollution resulting in a set of pareto solutions rather than a unique optimal solution each pareto solution represented a set of water and nitrogen optimization solutions which improved the flexibility and operability of the optimization solution the optimal irrigation amount of 337 3 354 9 mm and nitrogen fertilization rate of 181 2 198 6 kg ha 1 were obtained with a 95 confidence interval which aimed to achieve water and fertilizer conservation yield increase income generation and pollution reduction 5 conclusions appropriate water and nitrogen inputs was conducive to the growth of spring wheat could increase yield and economic return and reduce soil n residue irrigation and n fertilization had significant effects on lai dry matter accumulation yield water and fertilizer use efficiency and economic return under the same irrigation amount the yield economic return dry matter lai and water use efficiency increased and then decreased with increasing n fertilization rate under full irrigation these parameters were significantly better than the other irrigation management while the fertilizer use efficiency decreased with the increase of n fertilization rate furthermore the no3 n accumulation in the 60 100 cm soil layer increased with increases in irrigation amount n fertilization rate and year period and the risk of soil n leaching increased the multi objective optimization was conducted based on multiple regression models and genetic algorithms it was concluded that the multi objective high yield income efficiency and friendly environment optimization and sustainable production can be achieved when the irrigation amount was 337 3 354 9 mm and the nitrogen fertilization rate was 181 2 198 6 kg ha 1 in the semi arid region of

8955,optimizing irrigation and nitrogen n fertilization cooperative application to coordinate the balance between agricultural production and ecological environment is a vital challenge for sustainable agricultural production here a three year field experiment was conducted from 2018 to 2020 in the semi arid region of north china to investigate the effects of different irrigation amounts w1 50 etc etc is the crop evapotranspiration w2 75 etc w3 100 etc w4 125 etc and nitrogen fertilization rates f1 75 kg ha 1 f2 150 kg ha 1 f3 225 kg ha 1 f4 300 kg ha 1 on growth yield water and fertilizer use efficiency and soil n residue of spring wheat by drip fertigation and explore the optimal combination of irrigation amount and n fertilization rate based on a multi objective optimization method the results showed that leaf area index lai dry matter accumulation yield water use efficiency wue and economic return of spring wheat increased first and then decreased with increasing irrigation at the same level of n fertilization these parameters peaked at w3 with w1 performed poorly and low irrigation amount was detrimental to the function of fertilizer at the same level of irrigation lai dry matter accumulation yield and economic return all demonstrated significant diminishing return effects with increasing n fertilization whereas nitrogen partial factor productivity npfp reduced with increasing n fertilization furthermore with the simultaneous increase of irrigation and n fertilization the accumulation of soil nitrate nitrogen no3 n decreased in the 0 40 cm soil layer and increased in the 60 100 cm soil layer the partial least squares path model pls pm revealed that irrigation had a direct positive effect on spring wheat yield rather than n fertilization and irrigation had a direct negative effect on soil n residue based on the multi objective optimization model established by multiple regression analysis and the elitist non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii the irrigation amount of 337 3 354 9 mm combined with the n fertilization rate of 181 2 198 6 kg ha 1 could obtain the optimal comprehensive benefits of wheat yield economic return water and fertilizer utilization efficiency and environmental impact this study can provide an important scientific basis for the management and optimization of irrigation and fertilization for spring wheat in semi arid region of china and other similar regions around the world keywords water and nitrogen coupling multi objective optimization genetic algorithm environmentally friendly agriculture spring wheat yield data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water and fertilizer are two essential elements of agricultural production agriculture worldwide used the vast majority of land surface water and 72 of groundwater mainly for irrigation food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2022 in china agricultural irrigation is the largest water user li et al 2020 however due to water resource scarcity agricultural development in china has been limited to some extent li et al 2021 additionally nitrogen n is a crucial component that affects crop growth and yield long et al 2021 from 1980 2020 the amount of n fertilizer greatly exceeded the demand for crops and it led to several environmental problems particularly in the semi arid regions zhang et al 2020 the semi arid regions of china possess ample land and solar resources with tremendous potential for grain production chen et al 2022 however due to the growing population and food demand the overexploitation of agriculture has resulted in various ecological issues such as soil degradation vashisht et al 2015 and groundwater pollution kanter et al 2020 spring wheat is one of the main food crops in this region accounting for over 30 of the local cultivated area jiang et al 2019 as precipitation is scarce groundwater is the main source of water for wheat production tang et al 2018 currently the primary issue with wheat production is the lack of precise quantitative irrigation and fertilization cooperative applications the unregulated and excessive use of irrigation and nitrogen fertilizers to achieve higher yields has resulted in the waste of resources and environmental pollution tang et al 2021 optimizing the inputs of irrigation and n fertilizer is an effective way to coordinate high crop yield low resource consumption and a friendly eco environment liu et al 2019 ballester et al 2021 water and n fertilizer management are interdependent elements that cannot be optimized as independent factors hu et al 2010 this is because crop yield depends on water availability while yield levels depend on the amount of nitrogen applied soil nitrogen can only be taken up and used by plants if it is dissolved in water low soil moisture content affects the diffusion and transport of soil nitrogen gong 2009 which reduces the n uptake by crop roots and ultimately affects yield wang et al 2006 with the rapid development of social economy and agricultural technologies achieving high yield is no longer the only goal of agricultural production the integration of environment friendly and resource saving agriculture has gradually become a long term goal for sustainable development liu et al 2020 in northern china the conventional surface irrigation based management strategy for spring wheat involves 600 mm of irrigation and 200 kg ha 1 n fertilizer kamran et al 2023 however large scale promotion and application of surface irrigation in water scarce dryland areas such as through surface flood irrigation is not a sustainable means of crop production wang et al 2016 in recent years researchers have explored new irrigation and fertilization techniques to improve the water and nutrient use efficiency of wheat in arid regions drip fertigation is an option that reduces crop water requirements and nitrogen loss without compromising yield sun et al 2022 compared with traditional irrigation and fertilization drip irrigation and fertilization technology can accurately and timely apply water and fertilizer near the plant root zone via the pipeline system thereby reducing fertilizer loss and improving water and fertilizer use efficiency ma et al 2022 eissa et al 2018 have reported an increase in wheat yield and water use efficiency by 28 4 40 and 27 6 41 8 respectively through the combination of drip irrigation and n fertilizer application in semi arid areas resulting in the effective utilization of water and fertilizer furthermore drip fertigation has been shown to increase net income by more than 10 compared to flood fertigation in northern china making it a financially lucrative option for local farmers yuan et al 2022 however it should be noted that the potential environmental risks associated with fertilizer application are often overlooked li et al 2022 demonstrated a 32 reduction in nitrate nitrogen leaching through the optimization of irrigation and n management in spring wheat production systems thereby mitigating the risk of soil environmental pollution however previous studies have determined the optimal solution based on the results of field experiments on wheat production without further modelling analysis and optimization which often leads to inaccurate results consequently the development of sustainable water and fertilizer management strategies has become essential to ensure agricultural production and ecological balance in arid and semi arid regions unfortunately the cooperative effects of irrigation and n fertilization on yield economic return water and fertilizer use efficiency and environmental impact in drip irrigation spring wheat in semi arid regions of northern china are still unclear further research is necessary to elucidate these critical aspects synchronizing irrigation and fertilization with crop demand considering temporal and spatial variations is a wise water and fertilizer management strategy that depends on various factors such as irrigation and fertilization methods and crop types behera panda 2009 song et al 2021 therefore it is crucial to select an appropriate optimization method based on regional and crop characteristics among various methods the genetic algorithm ga is widely used for solving the optimal management system of crops especially for multi objective optimization problems the evaluation results of ga are reliable and reasonable luo et al 2016 suhaimi et al 2018 and it can be easily integrated with other methods in this study we hypothesized that the current irrigation and n management for spring wheat in the semi arid region of north china are excessive li et al 2021 yuan et al 2022 kamran et al 2023 we further postulated that these practices are not conducive to higher production returns instead optimizing irrigation and n fertilization rates based on multiple regression with nsga ii could improve resource use efficiency increase yield and economic return and promote environmentally friendly agriculture thus the purposes of this study were 1 to explore the collaborative effects of different irrigation and n fertilization amounts on leaf area index dry matter accumulation yield economic return water and nitrogen use efficiency and soil nitrogen residue through field experiment and to dissect the correlations among the factors using pearson correlation and pls pm analysis 2 to establish a comprehensive evaluation index system based on high yield economic benefit water and nitrogen use efficiency and friendly environment and use multiple regression model combined with nsga ii for multi objective optimization 3 to determine the optimal irrigation and n fertilization rates on comprehensive benefit for spring wheat in the semi arid region this study can provide a theoretical basis and support for the decision system of spring wheat production in the semi arid region of china 2 materials and methods 2 1 climate and soil conditions at the experimental site the field experiments were carried out during 2018 2020 at the

spring wheat and the recommendations of soil formula fertilization and nutrient experts the seasonal nitrogen fertilizer included low nitrogen fertilization f1 75 kg ha 1 medium nitrogen fertilization f2 150 kg ha 1 regular nitrogen fertilization f3 225 kg ha 1 and high nitrogen fertilization f4 300 kg ha 1 the 16 treatments were replicated three times with randomized block arrangement there were total of 48 plots with each plot area of 30 m2 7 5 m 4 m plot side ridges were 30 cm wide and 20 cm high the plots were separated from each other by 1 m protective rows and 40 cm deep plastic sheets were buried around each plot to prevent the influence of lateral infiltration of water and nutrients between the plots the test plot was equipped with two 1 m wide paths for irrigation and field monitoring and sampling and 1 m wide protective rows were set around the test plot the irrigation scheme was implemented based on the growth stage of wheat following planting a uniform micro sprinkler irrigation of 45 mm was applied to ensure seedling emergence after which drip irrigation was employed once the seedlings emerged drip irrigation belts were laid between the two rows of wheat in the plot in addition to seedling emergence irrigation a total of five irrigation times were applied during the seedling stooling stooling jointing jointing heading heading flowering and flowering filling stages with the drip irrigation system the irrigation schedule involved a three day cycle with drip irrigation taking place in the middle of each growth stage urea n 46 diammonium phosphate n 18 p2o5 46 and potassium sulfate k2o 50 were used as fertilizers before planting phosphorus 120 kg ha 1 and potassium 90 kg ha 1 fertilizers were applied as basal fertilizers the nitrogen fertilizers were applied four times during the cropping seasons 20 at the seedling stooling stage 30 at the stooling jointing stage 30 at the heading flowering stage and 20 at the flowering filling stage each application was done via drip irrigation in the middle of each irrigation stage after dissolving solid nitrogen fertilizers in water one day before irrigation differential pressure tanks were used for fertilization with each plot equipped with one 12 l tank the amount of irrigation was calculated based on crop evapotranspiration etc and when rainfall occurred the effective rainfall amount was subtracted from the irrigation schedule water meters were installed at different irrigation levels to strictly control the amount of irrigation the process of irrigation and n fertilization during the entire growing season is depicted in fig 2 the spring wheat cultivar yongliang 4 was planted on 1st may in 2018 8th may in 2019 and 3rd may in 2020 respectively the harvest dates were on 15th august

population in order to improve the flexibility level of optimization and increase the choice of optimal allocation solutions for irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer application the population size was selected as 100 and the values on each gene locus of the initial individual were generated in the following ways 13 x i d max x i min x i min x i where d random random is a random function d is a random value between 0 1 2 5 2 fitness function the fitness of individual was determined by non dominated level and crowding distance each individual corresponds not to a certain fitness value but to

the largest amount of no3 n accumulated in the 0 40 cm soil layer in addition no3 n gradually migrated downwards with increasing irrigation amount compared with 2018 the average accumulation of no3 n in the 0 100 cm soil layer increased by 4 86 in 2020 while the soil no3 n in the 40 100 cm increased by 8 76 fig 5 the indicates that a higher amount of no3 n was leached into the deeper soil layers and accumulated each year 3 4 economic return year irrigation amount nitrogen fertilization rate and the two way had significant effects on net income p 0 05 table a with the increase of irrigation and nitrogen fertilization input the economic return increased and then decreased net income was 5001 9394 cny ha 1 in 2018 5870 10686 cny ha 1 in 2019 and 5426 9744 cny ha 1 in 2020 respectively table 3 the highest profit increased by more than 80 compared with the lowest income level in 2018 2019 and 2020 this result suggests that improper irrigation and fertilization management could reduce the actual production return for three years water fees were only 507 564 and 564 cny ha 1 lower at the low irrigation w1 than at the full irrigation w3 water expenditure was a relatively small proportion of total inputs but the reduction in irrigation led to a significant loss in economic return at the same irrigation level economic return increased and then decreased with increasing nitrogen fertilization inputs and excessive fertilization inputs did not increase return but rather deteriorated soil properties and increased the risk of groundwater pollution 3 5 relations between grain yield economic return wue npfp and soil no3 n accumulation correlation analysis demonstrated that wheat growth indicators and yield significantly affected wue and net income lai was significantly positively correlated with dry matter accumulation in 2018 2019 and 2020 yield was significantly positively correlated with wue and net income whereas npfp was extremely significant and negative with soil no3 n accumulation fig 6 pls pm was used to further evaluate the relationship between irrigation nitrogen fertilization crop growth soil nitrogen residue water and fertilization utilization and economic return fig 7 the model revealed that irrigation had an extremely significant positive effect on crop growth 0 677 and yield formation 0 246 but irrigation had a significant and direct negative effect on soil n residue 0 455 the differences in fertilization did not directly affect crop yield but nitrogen fertilization had a significant positive effect on crop growth 0 331 and soil n residue 0 793 crop yield had significant positive effects on wue 0 798 npfp 0 472 and economic return 0 997 3 6 multi objective optimization of irrigation amount and nitrogen fertilizer rate based on the three year experimental data water and nitrogen input were used as independent variables and crop yield economic return water use efficiency nitrogen partial productivity and soil nitrogen residue were used as response variables based on the least square method the data were analyzed by sigmaplot 12 5 to establish a binary quadratic regression equation table b the five regression equations all showed significant quadratic polynomial correlation p 0 001 indicating that the regression models could be used to determine the effects of irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer on the optimization objectives in spring wheat production the response surface demonstrated that the coupling effects of water and nitrogen fertilizer input on spring wheat yield economic return and water use efficiency showed a downward convex shape when wheat yield economic return and water use efficiency reached the maximum the amount of irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer required for wheat were similar but the values required to maximize npfp and minimize soil n residue were significantly different fig 8 to simultaneously meet the five objectives of crop yield maximization economic benefit maximization water use efficiency maximization nitrogen partial productivity maximization and soil nitrogen residue minimization we combined multiple regression with genetic algorithm for multi objective optimization to determine the optimal irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer input we used a set of pareto solutions based on multi objective optimization obtained through python 3 7 10 to bring the regression equation as an objective function into the genetic algorithm for global optimization table c each optimal solution represented a set of water and nitrogen optimization solutions based on the multi objective optimization of water saving fertilizer conserving yield increasing income generating and pollution reducing the optimal irrigation amount was determined to be in the range of 337 3 354 9 mm and the nitrogen fertilization rate to be in the range of 181 2 198 6 kg ha 1 fig b 4 discussion 4 1 effects of different irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer regimes on wheat growth yield and economic return the growth and development of plants are influenced by the interaction and dependence between water and nutrients water serves as a solvent for soil nutrients and affects their migration and uptake while appropriate fertilization can promote crop growth enhance photosynthesis and transpiration and improve water uptake and utilization leading to the view of water promoting fertilizer and water regulated by fertilizer ju et al 2009 sun et al 2019 many studies have shown that irrigation and fertilization significantly affect crop growth and yield zain et al 2021 and the morphological characteristics and dry matter accumulation during plant growth reflect crop growth increasing irrigation can promote leaf area index lai and biomass accumulation gheysari et al 2017 whereas insufficient irrigation may inhibit fertilizer uptake and utilization affecting both nutritional and reproductive growth and ultimately impacting yield formation fan et al 2020 in this study the lai dry matter accumulation and yield of spring wheat initially increased and then decreased with increasing irrigation reaching a maximum under full irrigation excessive irrigation decreased lai dry matter accumulation and yield however wheat yield was still significantly higher than that of low and medium irrigation levels water is still the most critical factor in crop yield formation in the semi arid region ali et al 2019 furthermore pls pm analysis also demonstrated that irrigation had a stronger positive effect on wheat growth and yield rather than fertilization however n fertilization plays an essential role in improving wheat yield vogeler et al 2021 when n fertilization rate exceeds a reasonable range crop growth can be negatively affected by reduced stress tolerance excess nutrient growth and reduced light energy utilization ultimately leading to reduced yield xue et al 2015 in this study both n fertilization and irrigation had a significant main effect on wheat yield with irrigation having a greater effect on wheat yield than n fertilization hochman and horan 2018 also found similar results as a shallow root crop wheat mainly absorbs soil moisture and nutrients from the plow layer wang et al 2014 however excessive irrigation reduces the accumulation of nitrogen in the root zone which affects wheat s absorption of soil nitrogen in the plow layer and leads to a decrease in wheat yield furthermore crop yield is not only related to its physiological characteristics and field management but also to soil and climate conditions the soil type in the experimental area is chestnut soil and there is a significant deposition layer of calcium carbonate below 40 cm of soil excessive irrigation may lead to secondary salinization which can adversely affect crop growth gao et al 2022 economic return is a primary objective in agricultural production this study reveals that reducing irrigation can lead to greater economic losses compared with low irrigation full irrigation resulted in an economic return increase of over 80 in different years from a water saving irrigation perspective while the economic return of medium irrigation is about 30 lower than full irrigation it can save up to 25 of water table 3 however the main reason why farmers are reluctant to save water is due to the lower economic return resulting from reduced irrigation additionally under the same irrigation level the economic return initially increased with an increase in n fertilization rate but then decreased this suggests that a high n fertilizer input does not necessarily increase net income which is consistent with the findings of wang et al 2018 in semi arid regions to achieve sustainable agricultural production more precise irrigation management should be considered such as implementing moderate irrigation strategies 4 2 effects of different water and nitrogen fertilizer regimes on water and fertilizer use efficiency wue accurately expresses the relationship between crop production and water consumption providing a better reflection of actual production wue was higher under deficit irrigation whereas wue decreased under excessive irrigation but could be improved by optimizing irrigation wang et al 2018 compared with deficit irrigation wue decreased in full irrigation and excessive irrigation and an appropriate increase in n fertilizer supply could improve wue to a certain extent reflecting the coupling relationship between water and nitrogen both wheat yield and wue increased and then decreased with water and nitrogen inputs which was consistent with the results of xiao et al 2021 water deficit can lead to a decrease in nitrogen utilization ability of plants which is related to the reduction in soil nitrogen availability or root nitrogen uptake capacity under water deficit liu et al 2015 moreover excessive fertilization may increase the crop canopy and excessive transpiration resulting in a decrease in wue npfp is a crucial indicator for evaluating nitrogen use efficiency li et al 2020 reported that reducing n fertilization rates could significantly increase npfp whereas excessive n fertilization significantly reduced it which is consistent with our study moreover we found that the interaction between irrigation and n fertilization had a significant effect on npfp specifically npfp increased and then decreased with increasing irrigation one possible explanation for this is that irrigation promotes fertilizer uptake but excessive irrigation can lead to the leaching of fertilizer beyond the root zone this impairs n uptake by plant roots and results in a decrease in npfp although low nitrogen resulted in higher npfp at all irrigation levels it did not meet the production requirements thus moderate to adequate n fertilization was more profitable for both yield and npfp 4 3 effects of different irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer regimes on soil nitrogen residue soil nitrogen residue after crop harvest is a crucial indicator of soil quality and the environment shi et al 2020 after the crop has taken up soil nitrogen during the current growing season any remaining nitrogen accumulates in the soil and the amount of n taken up by subsequent crops is minimal only 21 23 of the nitrogen was taken up by the crop hajrasuliha et al 1998 in northern china soil n residue increases significantly when wheat is planted with an n fertilization rate exceeding 200 kg ha 1 fang et al 2006 in the study soil n residues also increased significantly when the n fertilization rate exceeded 225 kg ha 1 however the crops uptake and utilization of water and nutrients have limits excessive n fertilization led to a significant accumulation of residual n in non root soil layers which could easily result in soil n leaching thompson et al 2007 additionally nitrogen transport is significantly affected by irrigation lenka et al 2013 in this experiment conducted in a drip irrigation system nitrogen transport after fertilization was affected by several parameters such as drip irrigation system operation irrigation amount fertilizer concentration and soil properties petraityte et al 2022 at the same irrigation level n residue in the soil followed a pattern with the highest residue found at w1 the lowest irrigation level and the lowest at w4 the highest irrigation level the amount of n residue in the 100 cm soil layer decreased as irrigation levels increased this finding can be attributed to the fact that fertilizer n conversion to soil n is inhibited at low irrigation levels leading to a higher accumulation of fertilizer n in the soil chen et al 2014 inorganic nitrogen is the primary form of n taken up by crops and its transport in the soil is driven by water schröder 2014 when the soil surface is dry transpiration by plants or evaporation from the surface causes the transport of soil n with water however under irrigation conditions the increased shallow soil moisture level leads to soil n leaching with water excessive irrigation causes soil n to migrate to deeper soils resulting in groundwater contamination zhou et al 2022 in this study the soil n residue in the 100 cm layer was high under low irrigation however crop uptake of n was limited resulting in a significant amount of n remaining in the soil surface layer this excess n could potentially escape to the environment and pollute the atmosphere therefore the combination of low irrigation w1 and different n fertilization rates is a poor coupling pattern when full irrigation increases to excessive levels soil n combines with deep water infiltration resulting in soil n migration below the 100 cm soil layer appropriate n fertilization rates and irrigation regimes can reduce deep infiltration of n and decrease residue while excessive irrigation increases the risks of nutrient leaching and groundwater contamination 4 4 suitable irrigation and nitrogen interval based on multi objective optimization to achieve a balance between crop yield economic return resource use efficiency and environmental impact it is crucial to adopt optimal irrigation and nitrogen n fertilizer management strategies however due to the complex interplay between irrigation and n fertilization and their effects on multiple objectives of spring wheat production it is not possible to devise an optimal water and fertilizer strategy based solely on qualitative analysis hence it is imperative to quantify the response of multiple objectives to different levels of irrigation and n fertilization and to identify appropriate intervals for water and n fertilizer application multi objective optimization based on multiple regression combined with genetic algorithm overcomes the subjective weighting in earlier studies by experts making the optimization solution more objective in this study a coordinated optimal solution was found for multiple production objectives in spring wheat production the optimization process sought to simultaneously maximize wheat yield economic return water use efficiency wue and nitrogen partial factor productivity npfp while minimizing environmental pollution resulting in a set of pareto solutions rather than a unique optimal solution each pareto solution represented a set of water and nitrogen optimization solutions which improved the flexibility and operability of the optimization solution the optimal irrigation amount of 337 3 354 9 mm and nitrogen fertilization rate of 181 2 198 6 kg ha 1 were obtained with a 95 confidence interval which aimed to achieve water and fertilizer conservation yield increase income generation and pollution reduction 5 conclusions appropriate water and nitrogen inputs was conducive to the growth of spring wheat could increase yield and economic return and reduce soil n residue irrigation and n fertilization had significant effects on lai dry matter accumulation yield water and fertilizer use efficiency and economic return under the same irrigation amount the yield economic return dry matter lai and water use efficiency increased and then decreased with increasing n fertilization rate under full irrigation these parameters were significantly better than the other irrigation management while the fertilizer use efficiency decreased with the increase of n fertilization rate furthermore the no3 n accumulation in the 60 100 cm soil layer increased with increases in irrigation amount n fertilization rate and year period and the risk of soil n leaching increased the multi objective optimization was conducted based on multiple regression models and genetic algorithms it was concluded that the multi objective high yield income efficiency and friendly environment optimization and sustainable production can be achieved when the irrigation amount was 337 3 354 9 mm and the nitrogen fertilization rate was 181 2 198 6 kg ha 1 in the semi arid region of

8956,organic substitution partial substitution of chemical fertilizer with organic fertilizer is an effective approach to address soil degradation caused by excessive application of chemical fertilizers particularly in saline areas this study aimed to evaluate the effects of different organic substitution proportions by using organic fertilizer made from agricultural wastes on saline sodic soil properties and sunflower helianthus annuus l growth in an arid saline area additionally the study tried to reveal the possible mechanism of organic substitution on soil quality improvement from soil structure a two year field experiment was conducted in the hetao irrigation district northwest china during the sunflower growing season in 2019 and 2020 the study soil type is saline sodic soil with ece of 18 3 ds m 1 ph of 8 3 and exchange sodium percentage esp of 18 in the 0 0 2 m soil layer with a silt loam soil texture based on the recommended total n input 180 kg ha 1 for sunflower four treatments were designed with three replicates i ck no fertilization ii of0 chemical fertilization only iii of1 organic fertilizer substituting 50 of the urea n and iv of2 organic fertilizer substituting 100 of the urea n totally 12 plots were arranged in a randomized complete block design the results showed that in the 0 0 4 m soil player compared with of0 of1 and of2 significantly decreased bulk density by 4 and 6 respectively and turbidity of soil suspension by 36 and 66 respectively additionally of1 and of2 significantly increased soil total porosity in 0 0 4 m soil player mainly in macro porosity 30 µm and meso porosity 0 2 30 µm and increased soil water content compared with of0 and ck the improvement of soil structure was attributed to the amelioration of sodicity reduction of sodium adsorption ratio sar or cation ratio of soil structural stability cross and as its consequence leaching of salt out of the surface layers furthermore compared with of0 and of2 of1 maintained a stable no3 n supply and significantly increased agronomic efficiency of applied nitrogen by 29 and 22 respectively moreover of1 on average significantly increased grain yield by 9 and 8 crop water productivity by 12 and 4 and net income by 7 and 23 respectively mantel tests revealed that soil water content in the root zone and no3 n concentration in the maturity stage were key indicators significantly affecting sunflower growth under the organic substitution in conclusion from the perspective of improving the soil properties crop water fertilizer productivity and economic benefits organic fertilizer substituting 50 of the urea n was recommended for sunflower production under the arid saline environment graphical abstract ga1 keywords soil structure soil salinity and sodicity soil nitrogen organic fertilizer data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction soil salinity and sodicity are global environmental problems seriously limiting the productivity of cultivated land hassani et al 2020 it is estimated that 19 5 45 million ha of irrigated field is affected by excessive salts worldwide fao 2020 the salt affected soil in china covers a total area of about 3 6 107 ha accounting for 5 of arable land mao et al 2016 saline sodic soil has many negative characteristics including detrimental levels of neutral soluble salts and high proportion of na weil and brady 2017 high levels of soil sodicity and salinity can deteriorate soil structure and limit plant growth which reduces agriculture productivity choudhari and kharche 2018 therefore improving the quality of saline sodic soil is essential to increase crop productivity and prevent the degradation of natural resources the hetao irrigation district hid located in the arid area of northwest china is the largest single gravity irrigation district in china and even asia currently 70 of the farmland in the hid is subject to varying degrees of salinity liu et al 2016 under this salt induced soil degradation farmers have typically increased chemical fertilizer application amounts to increase crop production gao et al 2014 li et al 2020b the chronic and excessive application of chemical fertilizers has adversely impacted field soil quality such as soil acidification and salinization haj amor et al 2022 han et al 2015 which could further worse soil structure wan et al 2020 and impede salt leaching and plant growth therefore the choice of fertilizer in saline sodic soils is of central importance to prevent soil degradation the application of organic fertilizers including livestock manure green manure straw or mixture of manure and compost is considered as an effective way to ameliorate the physiochemical properties of saline sodic soils aluoch et al 2022 chen et al 2021a li et al 2019 liu et al 2021 however compared with chemical fertilizers organic fertilizers typically contain lower levels of n and p green 2015 and release nutrients slowly zhai et al 2022 therefore relying solely on organic fertilizers may not provide plants with sufficient nutrients leading to crop failure seufert et al 2012 as a result the organic substitution i e partial substitution of chemical fertilizer with organic fertilizer has emerged as an alternative way for improving soil properties and increasing crop yields compared with chemical fertilizer the partial substitution of chemical fertilizer with pig manure compost exhibited the better effect on improving soil nutrients such as soil organic carbon no3 n total n available p and available k han et al 2021 chen et al 2021b reported that partial substitution of chemical fertilizer with green manure can improve soil structure by promoting aggregates stability by increasing soil organic carbon and decreasing exchangeable na content in saline sodic soil another study on saline sodic soil showed that straw return coupled with nitrogen fertilizer significantly reduced soil bulk density ph ece and exchangeable na content ran et al 2022 therefore organic substitution could ameliorate soil structure by decreasing exchangeable na thus enhancing the leaching of salt from the topsoil and improving the availability of soil nutrition this can ultimately increase crop yield and water fertilizer productivity by providing appropriate soil environment qaswar et al 2020 zhai et al 2022 however it is important to note that organic fertilizers mostly composts produced from intensive poultry raising can be diverse and complex in composition and have the potential to negatively affect the soil a recent study highlighted that the organic fertilizers poultry waste and farmyard manure resulted in a higher accumulation of certain metals zn cu fe and co in soil which led that crops grown on the soil may pose serious health hazards following consumption akhter et al 2022 furthermore the optimal proportion of organic fertilizer substitution varies by organic fertilizer types crop varieties soil types and study areas for instance zhai et al 2022 reported that a cow manure substitution proportion of 15 was a viable short term agronomic practice for maize zea mays l grown on a luvisol in the north temperate zone but 30 was the preferable selection for long term ecological benefits li et al 2022 found that a pig manure substitution proportion of 50 was recommended for wheat triticum aestivum l grown on a anthrosol in the middle subtropics whereas higher proportions were suggested for rice oryza sativa l for pineapple ananas comosus l grown on a fluvisol in the tropics a sheep manure substitution proportion of 20 increased yield by 13 0 over the two seasons compared with the traditional fertilization and significantly improved the nitrogen agronomic efficiency liang et al 2022 therefore to gain a deeper understanding of the amelioration processes and application methods application rates or substitution ratios involved in the improvement of soil quality by organic fertilizers it is essential to clarify the organic fertilizer s components and conduct site crop specific studies in addition agricultural waste resources such as rapeseed oil residue and edible fungi residue are cheap and available in agricultural areas for a long time these resources have been disposed of and burned at will causing serious environmental pollution it is estimated that about 200 billion kg of edible fungi residue in 2020 were produced in china zhang et al 2022b these abandoned resources typically containing abundant organic matter have the potential to greatly improve soil fertility if added into the soil williams et al 2001 however agricultural wastes have not been widely used in field practice in china and there are few reports on the effects of organic fertilizer made from agricultural waste resources on saline sodic soils therefore it is particularly urgent to comprehensively evaluate the improving effects of organic fertilizer made from agricultural wastes on soil quality of saline sodic areas sunﬂower helianthus annuus l is the dominant commercial crop in the hid and serves as the primary revenue source for the local farmers accordingly a two year field trial was conducted to plant sunflower with the organic substitution practice by using organic fertilizer produced by agricultural wastes on a saline sodic soil in the hid our hypothesis was that saline sodic soil would be positively affected by the organic substitution approach and this improvement could be deeper understood from the perspective of soil structural characteristics including the ionic absorption and subsequence processes such as clay dispersion and pore size distribution to test this hypotheses different rates of organic substitution treatments were established while maintaining the same amount of applied n taking no fertilizer application as the control check ck the specific purposes of this research were to a study the effects of the organic substitution practice on soil properties and analyze the interactions among salinity sodicity and soil structure b evaluate the sunflower s responses to organic substitution with different substitution rates and c assess the economic benefits of sunflower production at different organic fertilizer substitution rates based on the results from this study an optimal organic substitution rate would be suggested to schedule fertilization for sunflower production under the arid saline environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 the overview of study area during the 2019 and 2020 growing

fertilizer were applied once as base fertilizer before planting and incorporated to a depth of 0 2 m field experiments included 12 plots which were arranged in a randomized complete block design with plot size of 8 10 m and 1 0 m interval between plots as a buffer zone the plastic film 8 µm thick 0 7 m wide was flattened over the soil surface for all four treatments the sunflower helianthus annuus l cultivar ad6199 was planted on 5 june of 2019 and 6 june of 2020 and harvested on 13 september of 2019 and 15 september of 2020 two rows of sunflower seeds were planted on each sheet of plastic film using a hill drop planter with 0 3 m between rows narrow row and 0 6 m between plants and the wide row width of 0 7 m between the two films in this study border irrigation was used the total irrigation amount was 120 mm and 80 mm during the growing season in 2019 and 2020 respectively the timings of the irrigation were at planting budding and flowering stages no irrigation at flowering stages in 2020 due to high rainfall 44 mm each irrigation amount was 40 mm in accordance with common local practices field management consisted of regular weeding and use of pesticides 2 3 data collection 2 3 1 meteorological data a weather station hobo h21 001 onset usa and a 20 cm diameter evaporation pan were installed in a grassy yard within 100 m of the trial field to monitor daily air temperature rainfall and pan evaporation ep the ep was recorded daily at 8 00 am 2 3 2 soil structural properties after the sunflower harvest in 2020 soil bulk density and total porosity were measured using 100 cm3 volume steel cylinders for undisturbed soil samples at soil depths of 0 0 2 m and 0 2 0 4 m respectively we also estimated the macro porosity 30 µm meso porosity 0 2 30 µm and micro porosity 0 2 µm as the difference between the volumetric water content at h water suction kpa 10 kpa and 0 kpa h 10 kpa and 1500 kpa and h 1500 kpa respectively the dispersion of clay particles is one of the main processes that cause the degradation of soil structure chorom et al 1994 to assess the soil structural stability the spontaneous dispersion of the soil was determined by reference to rengasamy 2002 we placed the air dried soil sample 20 g into a 250 ml transparent graduated cylinder and slowly added 200 ml distilled water along the sides of the graduated cylinder taking care not to disturb the soil after about 5 h any particles dispersed from the soil were gently stirred into a suspension and left for 2 h the suspension was then pumped from a depth of 0 1 m for turbidity measurement the turbidity of the soil suspensions was measured at 25 c using a laboratory turbidimeter wzs 186 shanghai china to quantify the amount of dispersed particles smaller than 2 mm and recorded in nephelometric turbidity units ntu 2 3 3 soil moisture and salinity soil samples were collected under the film in the center of each plot at 0 1 m intervals from 0 to 0 2 m and at 0 2 m intervals from 0 4 to 1 0 m using a 0 04 m diameter auger at the major growth stages of sunflower soil water content was measured gravimetrically then the soil volumetric water content swc v g 100 g 1

the crop without suffering water stress is the readily available water raw allen et al 1998 3 r a w p t a w p f c p w p z r where fc is 0 31 m3 m 3 and pwp is 0 19 m3 m 3 for the root zone 0 0 6 m z r is the main root depth 0 6 m and p is the average portion 0 1 of taw that can be depleted from the root zone before water stress occurs the value of p is crop specific and is 0 45 for sunflower allen et al 1998 the refill point rp for sunflower in this soil which is the lower limit of raw is 0 26 m3 m 3 the upper limit of raw is fc the remaining soil samples were air dried and sieved through a 2 mm sieve a soil saturated extract was prepared for chemical analysis and ph was measured with a ph meter phs 3 c shanghai china then clear extracts of saturated soil pastes were obtained by centrifugation 4000 rpm 30 min the ece was measured with a conductivity meter dds 11a shanghai china the amounts of exchangeable cations cmolc kg 1 were determined using the ammonium acetate 1 n richards 1954 esp exchangeable sodium percentage richards 1954 was determined as 4 e s p n a e x c e c 100 where naex is concentration of exchangeable cations cmolc kg 1 and cec is the cation exchange capacity cmolc kg 1 since cec or sum of exchangeable cations are often determined using laborious and time consuming laboratory procedures it may be more appropriate and economical to determine soil esp indirectly from a simpler soil index bower and hatcher 1962 this index is the sodium adsorption ratio sar which is usually defined as richards 1954 5 s a r n a c a m g 2 therefore we only determined soil esp before planting in 2019 furthermore for the soil samples during the experiment we determined sar concentrations of co 3 2 hco 3 cl and so 4 2 were measured by titration and na k ca2 and mg2 with an atomic absorption spectrophotometer the detailed methods of ions concentration measurement were described by richards 1954 in addition we calculated cross cation ratio of soil

en us microsoft 365 p excel 3 results 3 1 soil structural properties significant differences in soil bulk density and turbidity of soil suspensions among the same soil layers in the different fertilization treatments were found fig 3 however there was no significant difference in bulk density between ck and of0 in the same soil layer p 0 05 compared with of0 the bulk density of of1 and of2 on average reduced by 4 and 6 in the 0 0 4 m soil layer respectively in addition the turbidity of soil suspension was the lowest in of2 which was 66 and 47 lower than in of0 and of1 treatments in the 0 0 4 m soil layer respectively fig 3b for the soil porosity the total porosity of of1 and of2 was significantly higher than that of ck and of0 this difference was reflected in the macro porosity and meso porosity but there was no significant difference in the micro porosity fig 3d f 3 2 soil moisture 3 2 1 soil water distribution in profile there were significant differences in soil water content among the treatments except for the mature stage in 2020 fig 4 the water content of the 0 20 cm soil in the of1 and of2 was significantly higher than that in the of0 and ck at the seeding and mature stages in 2019 at the seeding stage in the 2020 the soil water content in the of1 was significantly higher than in the other treatments with significant differences observed in the 0 20 cm and 60 100 cm soil layer however no significant differences were observed among the treatments at the mature stage in 2020 which was probably impacted by the increased rainfall 3 2 2 temporal dynamics of soil water storage in root zone the soil water storage in root zone 0 60 cm was significantly affected by organic fertilizer substitution proportion fig 5 the soil water storage of the of1 and of2 was above refill point rp and significantly higher than that of the of0 and ck p 0 05 furthermore the soil water storage during the sunflower growing season under the ck and of0 was almost entirely below the rp this suggested that the organic substitution could improve soil water storage and thus facilitate sunflower water uptake from the soil 3 3 soil salinity 3 3 1 soil ece and na distribution in profile the different organic fertilizer substitution proportions redistributed the soil ece and na fig 6 as the main cation in the soil na and ece showed similar changes in the soil profile fig 6e f take ece for example at the seeding and mature stages in 2019 the ece of of0 was the highest among all fertilization treatments and with the increasing organic substitution proportion the soil salinity decreased gradually p 0 05 in 2020 there were significant differences in ece among the four treatments in the 20 100 cm soil layer at the seeding stage and ece in the 20 100 cm soil depth layer was higher than that in the 0 20 cm soil layer probably due to the pre planting irrigation effect the ece of of2 and of1 was significantly smaller than that of the of0 in the 0 60 cm soil layer at the mature stage p 0 05 moreover at the mature stage of 2020 the ece in the root zone of of2 was lower than the salinity tolerance threshold 4 8 ds m 1 of sunflower tanji and kielen 2002 3 3 2 soil sar and cross in the root zone to better evaluate the impact of sodicity on soil structure we calculated the soil sar and cross in the root zone the soil sar and cross in root zone was significantly affected by organic fertilizer substitution proportion table 4 across the two years the of1 and of2 significantly decreased sar and cross in addition cross and sar show similar changes in value taking cross for example at the seeding stage the of1 and of2 significantly decreased coss by 25 and 44 in 2019 and by 17 and 29 in 2020 compared with of0 treatment respectively at the mature stage the of1 and of2 significantly decreased cross by 44 and 56 in 2019 and by 37 and 62 in 2020 compared with of0 respectively 3 4 soil nitrogen 3 4 1 soil nitrate nitrogen there were significant differences in soil no3 n concentration among the treatments p 0 05 fig 7 at the seeding stage in 2019 and 2020 the no3 n concentration decreased gradually with the increasing organic substitution proportion p 0 05 which may be related to the quick availability of chemical fertilizer at the mature stage in 2019 the soil no3 n concentration under of1 was highest with a mean value of 24 mg kg 1 in the root zone at the mature stage in 2020 the of2 exhibited a higher no3 n concentration than the other treatments with peak no3 n 43 mg kg 1 was found in the 20 40 cm soil player 3 4 2 aen pfpn ran and rrn the n related indices including ae n pfp n ra n and rr n were significantly p 0 05 affected by different organic fertilizer substitution treatments fig 8 in 2019 and 2020 the ae n and pfp n of of1 was significantly higher than those of of0 and of2 which was mainly due to the higher yield under the same nitrogen application in 2019 the ra n of of1 was improved which was 1 7 and 2 1 times higher than that of of0 and of2 respectively additionally the rr n of of1 was 67 which was significantly higher than that of of0 and of2 p 0 05 in 2020 compared with of0 of1 and of2 increased the ra n by 30 and 37 respectively similarly of1 and of2 treatments raised the rr n p 0 05 3 5 plant growth 3 5 1 plant height and leaf area index the plant height ph and leaf area index lai were significantly p 0 05 affected by the different organic fertilizer substitution treatments the plant height showed an s shaped growth curve which leveled off after 79 dap fig 9a b the largest plant height was always determined under the of1 with the peak value 135 cm in 2020 at the mature stage in 2019 and 2020 compared with ck the plant height of of1 was increased by 19 and 16 respectively the larger lai was recorded with of1 which was significantly p 0 05 higher than of0 of2 and ck fig 9c d however there was no significant difference in plant height and lai among of0 and of2 during the late growing season in 2020 3 5 2 grain yield et a and wp c the grain yield and wp c were significantly p 0 05 affected by the different organic substitution proportions we found that the grain yield and wp c of of1 were highest in both years fig 10 on average over the two years compared with of0 and of2 of1 significantly increased grain yield by 9 and 8 respectively and wp c by 12 and 4 respectively moreover the wp c of of1 and of2 was significantly higher than that of of0 and ck in the dry year 2019 while there was no significant difference between of0 of1 and of2 in the wet year 2020 for et a of1 and of2 were significantly lower than of0 and ck in 2019 while there was no significant difference p 0 05 among the four treatments in 2020 3 6 relationships between soil properties and plant height lai yield mantel tests were further conducted to quantify the relative contribution of the soil physicochemical properties to the plant height ph lai and yield of sunflower at the mature stage fig 11 considering the slow release of plant available mineral nitrogen from organic fertilizer seufert et al 2012 we evaluated the effects of no3 n concentration on crop growth from seeding stage and mature stage in 2019 there were signiﬁcant correlations between swcr soil water content in the root zone no3 nmr no3 n concentration in the root zone at mature stage and no3 nmd no3 n concentration in the deep soil at mature stage and ph lai and yield p 0 01 mantel s r 0 4 fig 11a in 2020 no3 nsr no3 n concentration in the root zone at seeding stage and no3 nsd no3 n concentration in the deep soil at seeding stage had signiﬁcant impacts on the ph lai and yield besides swcr no3 nmr and no3 nmd p 0 01 mantel s r 0 4 fig 11b 3 7 economic benefits analysis the farmers income is strongly correlated with the prices of agricultural products table 5 showed the economic benefit of sunflower production under the different organic substitution proportions the sunflower grain price in inner mongolia decreased by 16 from 2019 to 2020 as shown in the market quotation in the official website of bayannur city agriculture and animal husbandry bureau in 2019 compared with of0 and of2 the of1 treatment increased the net income by 4 and 22 respectively similarly in 2020 the net incomes of of1 were 11 and 24 higher than that of of0 and of2 respectively these results suggested that of1 could still increase the net income of sunflower production compared with the other treatments when grain prices decreased this is because of1 ensured the higher yield and lower fertilizer expenses 4 discussion high concentration of neutral salts in saline sodic soils can alleviate the dispersion of sodium unfortunately when soluble salts are leached out of the soil especially if sar of the leaching water is high curtin et al 1994 the saline sodic soil will rapidly become a sodic soil with degraded soil structure due to the soil dispersion rengasamy and olson 1991 weil and brady 2017 therefore reducing soil dispersion is the key to prevent further deterioration of saline sodic soil structure our results indicated that organic substitution treatments of1 and of2 significantly lowered the turbidity a quantitative indicator of the number of dispersed particles smaller than 2 mm of topsoil suspensions increased soil macro porosity and meso porosity and decreased soil bulk density fig 3 improvement in the soil structure was mainly attributed to the amelioration of sodicity table 4 as its consequence leaching of salt out of the surface horizons the possible mechanisms fig 12 are as follows i ca2 contained in the organic fertilizer and ca2 released by the reaction between h2co3 the microbial decomposition of the organic fertilizer releases co2 which dissolves in water to form h2co3 and native caco3 substituted na from the exchange complex and thereby na was leached from the topsoil this reduced the thickness of ionic swarm weil and brady 2017 and stabilized soil aggregates thus reducing dispersion chorom and rengasamy 1997 ghosh et al 2010 ii the release of microbial polysaccharides as a byproduct of the organic fertilizer decomposition sumner 1993 which on its own and interacting with ca2 further stabilize soil aggregates oades 1984 to summarize the organic substitution improved soil aggregation barzegar et al 1997 and thus improving the stability of this saline sodic soil the most crucial constraining factor is water for food production in the arid areas the results of our study showed that organic substitution treatments of1 and of2 were superior to treatments without organic fertilizer in maintaining soil water content at 0 20 cm fig 4 and the soil water storage in the sunflower root zone of organic substitution treatments exceeded the refill point during sunflower growth period fig 5 these findings agreed with prior studies liu et al 2013 zhai et al 2022 moreover salinity transport with water is the main pathway of soil salt movement xia et al 2016 results indicated that organic substitution treatments were conducive to reduce salinity in the root zone as seen in the fig 6 the amelioration of soil water and salt conditions was probably explained by organic substitution improved soil structure by ameliorating soil sodicity table 4 and increasing soil macro porosity and meso porosity fig 3 which was conducive to soil salt leaching and water retention in general the n from organic fertilizer is not directly available for plant uptake and must be mineralized to inorganic n sims 1995 addition of fertilizers or presence of salts may increase net mineralization of soil organic n however as sar is increased the nutrient contribution from organic matter is decreased because of the ability of cations to stimulate mineralization of organic n decreases as their ionic potential decreases i e a13 fe3 ca2 mg2 k na naidu and rengasamy 1993 in agricultural soils the no3 n is commonly measured to estimate the available n carter and gregorich 2006 in this study the no3 n concentration of of2 was always lower than that of of1 and of0 in 2019 until the mature stage in 2020 the no3 n concentration of of2 was significantly higher than that under of0 of1 and ck moreover the no3 n concentration of of1 in the soil was also higher in the late growth stage under organic substitution this was mainly due to i the decrease of sar in soil na was removed from the exchange complex fig 12 led to the increase of organic n mineralization ii with the decrease of ph urease activity increased thereby availability of nitrogen was greatly increased naidu and rengasamy 1993 iii the improvement of microbial community structure gu et al 2019 han et al 2021 li et al 2022 increased soil organic c turnover and organic mineralization efficiency resulting in the improvement of nutrient supply luan et al 2019 morra et al 2021 in addition the release of mineral n from organic sources is slow seufert et al 2012 and studies have shown that the n in organic fertilizers cannot be completely decomposed within one year sims 1995 this was consistent with the results of zhou et al 2020 in this study the increased application of p and k in of1 and of2 especially p p in of1 and of2 was 33 6 and 67 2 higher than that in of0 33 6 kg ha 1 would inevitably affect soil nutrients and crop growth previous study showed that organic fertilizer application could transform the least available ca10 p into the more available ca2 p and ca8 p thereby increasing p availability and crop growth li et al 2020a additionally taiwo et al 2018 found that the soil s k fixing capacities were reduced after organic fertilizer application leading to more k was released and the ability to fix k decreased with increase of organic fertilizer rates therefore the effect of p and k released from organic fertilizer on soil and crop growth should also be considered which is the key point of our next research in addition the change in ph caused by organic fertilizer can directly and indirectly affect nutrients availability such as p which was recognized as a factor in improving crop growth curtin et al 1992 qadir and schubert 2002 chen et al 2021b reported that soil ph was decreased and soil available p and p use efficiency were increased in saline sodic soil under organic amendments addition furthermore organic fertilizers especially animal manures generally contain high concentration of heavy metals which could result in metal accumulation in soils with long term and frequent application fan et al 2013 zhao et al 2014 a 22 year fertilization and cropping study indicated that pig manure led to metal accumulation in red soil mainly cd followed by cu resulting in the increase of metal availability except for pb zhou et al 2015 although the organic fertilizers in this study were made from agricultural waste resources rapeseed oil residue edible fungi residue and crop straw and the heavy metal content in it was far below the standard limits in china tables s1 and s2 it was unclear whether long term application would lead to heavy metal accumulation therefore the monitoring of nutrients such as p and heavy metal content needs to be strengthened in the further study previous studies have indicated that the organic substitution approach can improve crop yield although there are differences in the substitution rate of organic fertilizer when obtaining the best yield liu et al 2021 zhai et al 2022 zhang et al 2022a our results indicated that of1 significantly increased plant height lai and sunflower yield fig 9 and fig 10 compared with of0 certainly resulted from a more favorable soil environment with improved soil structure increased water availability reduced salinity and provided sufficient nutrients although of2 also improved soil quality and mitigated salt stress its no3 n concentration was still low except for the maturity stage in 2020 fig 7 which resulted in the grain yield in of2 was significantly lower than that in of1 our findings were consistent with li et al 2022 who similarly considered that a 50 organic substitution rate was optimal for the maximum grain yield in wheat rice rotation additionally wp c is used to assess crop water productivity as a ratio of yield to actual evapotranspiration et a zhang et al 2009 in this study of1 and of2 significantly increased the wp c compared with ck and of0 in 2019 because the lower et a however there was no significant difference in wp c for of0 of1 and of2 in 2020 this was due to the higher rainfall 120 mm in 2020 and more water consumption occurred in soil evaporation which might mask the difference mantel tests indicated that the correlation between ece and ph lai and yield was weaker mantel s r 0 2 compared with soil water and no3 n concentration mantel s r 0 4 fig 11 that is to say the effects of soil water and nitrogen status on sunflower growth was greater than that of salinity and sodicity under organic substitution on the one hand organic substitution significantly ameliorated soil sodicity thereby improving soil structure and strengthening salt leaching which is the main reason on the other hand the salt tolerance of sunflower should also be considered a study in the hid suggested that sunflower cultivar ld5009 was the most salt tolerant crop among wheat maize and sunflower with the highest salinity tolerance index tong et al 2015 the data showed that the varieties used in this study increased yield by 12 compared with ld5009 china seed business network 2011 therefore compared with water and n the lower effect of soil salinity and sodicity on crop growth under organic substitution was due to i the salts leaching of the surface soil was strengthened by the improved soil structural properties due to the amelioration of the soil sodicity ii the high salt tolerance of the sunflower variety used in this study mantel tests founded that the effect of swcr on crop growth was stronger mantel s r 0 4 p 0 01 than that of swcd in the two seasons this might be attributed to the following reasons i the improved porosity in the topsoil fig 3 was conducive to maintaining soil water fig 4 and fig 5 under organic substitution thereby promoting the crop growth ii the main water uptake position by the sunflower roots located the 0 0 5 m layer in this study area qiao et al 2006 in addition the more remarkable effect of no3 nsd on crop growth in 2020 compared with 2019 might be due to the slow n release of organic fertilizer seufert et al 2012 and the increased porosity under organic substitution which was beneficial to the n transport from deeper to upper soils for crop uptake chen et al 2021b zhang et al 2022a mantel tests also indicated that swcr and no3 nm i e no3 nmr and no3 nmd had a stronger effect mantel s r 0 4 p 0 01 on crop growth in the two seasons fig 11 and the results of soil properties and yield showed that the of2 and of1 compared with the of0 significantly increased swcr fig 4 and maintained a steady release of n thereby not decreasing or even significantly increasing the yield fig 10 this indicated that swcr and no3 nm were key indicators significantly affecting sunflower yield this was consistent with the findings of he et al 2022 from the grower s perspective on fertility any increase in the amount of fertilizer makes sense only if it profitably improves yields or enhances quality hera 1996 our results showed that compared with of0 and of2 of1 treatment increased net income two year average by 7 and 23 in sunflower production table 4 this is because of1 maintained a relatively low fertilizer input and ensured a higher crop yield accordingly the organic substitution measure can serve as a viable tool to reduce production risks and to improve farmers livelihoods under arid saline areas however organic substitution practice has not been widely promoted among chinese farmers a government led price subsidy mechanism coupled with the essential technical support associated with research and development extension and training could motivate growers to adapt organic fertilizers xu et al 2014 5 conclusions through two year field experiment we tried to reveal the possible mechanism of organic substitution on soil quality improvement from the perspective of soil structure our findings indicated that the organic substitution approach of1 and of2 significantly improved soil structural properties as evidenced by decreasing in soil suspension turbidity and bulk density and increasing in meso porosity 0 2 30 µm and macro porosity 30 µm the improvement of soil structure was related to the amelioration of sodicity reduction of sar or cross and as its consequence leaching of salt out of the surface layers moreover of1 could provide sufficient nitrogen supply throughout the growth period compared with of0 and of2 thereby increasing sunflower yield and improving crop water fertilizer productivity additionally of1 significantly increased net income mantel tests showed that swcr and no3 nm were key indicators significantly affecting sunflower growth under organic substitution therefore from the perspective of improving the soil properties crop water fertilizer productivity and economic benefits it is suggested that organic fertilizer substituting 50 of the urea n for sunflower production under the arid saline environment the results of this study are intended to provide guidance to the scientific application of organic substitution technology for agricultural production in arid saline areas thereby

8956,organic substitution partial substitution of chemical fertilizer with organic fertilizer is an effective approach to address soil degradation caused by excessive application of chemical fertilizers particularly in saline areas this study aimed to evaluate the effects of different organic substitution proportions by using organic fertilizer made from agricultural wastes on saline sodic soil properties and sunflower helianthus annuus l growth in an arid saline area additionally the study tried to reveal the possible mechanism of organic substitution on soil quality improvement from soil structure a two year field experiment was conducted in the hetao irrigation district northwest china during the sunflower growing season in 2019 and 2020 the study soil type is saline sodic soil with ece of 18 3 ds m 1 ph of 8 3 and exchange sodium percentage esp of 18 in the 0 0 2 m soil layer with a silt loam soil texture based on the recommended total n input 180 kg ha 1 for sunflower four treatments were designed with three replicates i ck no fertilization ii of0 chemical fertilization only iii of1 organic fertilizer substituting 50 of the urea n and iv of2 organic fertilizer substituting 100 of the urea n totally 12 plots were arranged in a randomized complete block design the results showed that in the 0 0 4 m soil player compared with of0 of1 and of2 significantly decreased bulk density by 4 and 6 respectively and turbidity of soil suspension by 36 and 66 respectively additionally of1 and of2 significantly increased soil total porosity in 0 0 4 m soil player mainly in macro porosity 30 µm and meso porosity 0 2 30 µm and increased soil water content compared with of0 and ck the improvement of soil structure was attributed to the amelioration of sodicity reduction of sodium adsorption ratio sar or cation ratio of soil structural stability cross and as its consequence leaching of salt out of the surface layers furthermore compared with of0 and of2 of1 maintained a stable no3 n supply and significantly increased agronomic efficiency of applied nitrogen by 29 and 22 respectively moreover of1 on average significantly increased grain yield by 9 and 8 crop water productivity by 12 and 4 and net income by 7 and 23 respectively mantel tests revealed that soil water content in the root zone and no3 n concentration in the maturity stage were key indicators significantly affecting sunflower growth under the organic substitution in conclusion from the perspective of improving the soil properties crop water fertilizer productivity and economic benefits organic fertilizer substituting 50 of the urea n was recommended for sunflower production under the arid saline environment graphical abstract ga1 keywords soil structure soil salinity and sodicity soil nitrogen organic fertilizer data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction soil salinity and sodicity are global environmental problems seriously limiting the productivity of cultivated land hassani et al 2020 it is estimated that 19 5 45 million ha of irrigated field is affected by excessive salts worldwide fao 2020 the salt affected soil in china covers a total area of about 3 6 107 ha accounting for 5 of arable land mao et al 2016 saline sodic soil has many negative characteristics including detrimental levels of neutral soluble salts and high proportion of na weil and brady 2017 high levels of soil sodicity and salinity can deteriorate soil structure and limit plant growth which reduces agriculture productivity choudhari and kharche 2018 therefore improving the quality of saline sodic soil is essential to increase crop productivity and prevent the degradation of natural resources the hetao irrigation district hid located in the arid area of northwest china is the largest single gravity irrigation district in china and even asia currently 70 of the farmland in the hid is subject to varying degrees of salinity liu et al 2016 under this salt induced soil degradation farmers have typically increased chemical fertilizer application amounts to increase crop production gao et al 2014 li et al 2020b the chronic and excessive application of chemical fertilizers has adversely impacted field soil quality such as soil acidification and salinization haj amor et al 2022 han et al 2015 which could further worse soil structure wan et al 2020 and impede salt leaching and plant growth therefore the choice of fertilizer in saline sodic soils is of central importance to prevent soil degradation the application of organic fertilizers including livestock manure green manure straw or mixture of manure and compost is considered as an effective way to ameliorate the physiochemical properties of saline sodic soils aluoch et al 2022 chen et al 2021a li et al 2019 liu et al 2021 however compared with chemical fertilizers organic fertilizers typically contain lower levels of n and p green 2015 and release nutrients slowly zhai et al 2022 therefore relying solely on organic fertilizers may not provide plants with sufficient nutrients leading to crop failure seufert et al 2012 as a result the organic substitution i e partial substitution of chemical fertilizer with organic fertilizer has emerged as an alternative way for improving soil properties and increasing crop yields compared with chemical fertilizer the partial substitution of chemical fertilizer with pig manure compost exhibited the better effect on improving soil nutrients such as soil organic carbon no3 n total n available p and available k han et al 2021 chen et al 2021b reported that partial substitution of chemical fertilizer with green manure can improve soil structure by promoting aggregates stability by increasing soil organic carbon and decreasing exchangeable na content in saline sodic soil another study on saline sodic soil showed that straw return coupled with nitrogen fertilizer significantly reduced soil bulk density ph ece and exchangeable na content ran et al 2022 therefore organic substitution could ameliorate soil structure by decreasing exchangeable na thus enhancing the leaching of salt from the topsoil and improving the availability of soil nutrition this can ultimately increase crop yield and water fertilizer productivity by providing appropriate soil environment qaswar et al 2020 zhai et al 2022 however it is important to note that organic fertilizers mostly composts produced from intensive poultry raising can be diverse and complex in composition and have the potential to negatively affect the soil a recent study highlighted that the organic fertilizers poultry waste and farmyard manure resulted in a higher accumulation of certain metals zn cu fe and co in soil which led that crops grown on the soil may pose serious health hazards following consumption akhter et al 2022 furthermore the optimal proportion of organic fertilizer substitution varies by organic fertilizer types crop varieties soil types and study areas for instance zhai et al 2022 reported that a cow manure substitution proportion of 15 was a viable short term agronomic practice for maize zea mays l grown on a luvisol in the north temperate zone but 30 was the preferable selection for long term ecological benefits li et al 2022 found that a pig manure substitution proportion of 50 was recommended for wheat triticum aestivum l grown on a anthrosol in the middle subtropics whereas higher proportions were suggested for rice oryza sativa l for pineapple ananas comosus l grown on a fluvisol in the tropics a sheep manure substitution proportion of 20 increased yield by 13 0 over the two seasons compared with the traditional fertilization and significantly improved the nitrogen agronomic efficiency liang et al 2022 therefore to gain a deeper understanding of the amelioration processes and application methods application rates or substitution ratios involved in the improvement of soil quality by organic fertilizers it is essential to clarify the organic fertilizer s components and conduct site crop specific studies in addition agricultural waste resources such as rapeseed oil residue and edible fungi residue are cheap and available in agricultural areas for a long time these resources have been disposed of and burned at will causing serious environmental pollution it is estimated that about 200 billion kg of edible fungi residue in 2020 were produced in china zhang et al 2022b these abandoned resources typically containing abundant organic matter have the potential to greatly improve soil fertility if added into the soil williams et al 2001 however agricultural wastes have not been widely used in field practice in china and there are few reports on the effects of organic fertilizer made from agricultural waste resources on saline sodic soils therefore it is particularly urgent to comprehensively evaluate the improving effects of organic fertilizer made from agricultural wastes on soil quality of saline sodic areas sunﬂower helianthus annuus l is the dominant commercial crop in the hid and serves as the primary revenue source for the local farmers accordingly a two year field trial was conducted to plant sunflower with the organic substitution practice by using organic fertilizer produced by agricultural wastes on a saline sodic soil in the hid our hypothesis was that saline sodic soil would be positively affected by the organic substitution approach and this improvement could be deeper understood from the perspective of soil structural characteristics including the ionic absorption and subsequence processes such as clay dispersion and pore size distribution to test this hypotheses different rates of organic substitution treatments were established while maintaining the same amount of applied n taking no fertilizer application as the control check ck the specific purposes of this research were to a study the effects of the organic substitution practice on soil properties and analyze the interactions among salinity sodicity and soil structure b evaluate the sunflower s responses to organic substitution with different substitution rates and c assess the economic benefits of sunflower production at different organic fertilizer substitution rates based on the results from this study an optimal organic substitution rate would be suggested to schedule fertilization for sunflower production under the arid saline environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 the overview of study area during the 2019 and 2020 growing

sodic solonchaks iuss working group wrb 2015 in the study area is developed from the alluvial material of the yellow river the physical properties of the soil for the 0 100 cm profile are given in the table 1 the top 0 20 cm soil was categorized as a saline sodic soil abrol et al 1988 with ph of 8 3 ece electrical conductivity of saturated extract of 18 3 ds m 1 sar sodium adsorption ratio of 16 0 mmolc l 1 0 5 esp exchangeable sodium percentage of 18 and cross cation ratio of soil structural stability of 18 7 mmolc l 1 0 5 table 2 the initial organic matter content was 3 6 g kg 1 total n content was 0 6 g kg 1 available p content was 5 1 mg kg 1 and available k content was 34 5 mg kg 1 for the top tillage layer the groundwater level fluctuates between 2 and 3 5 m below the surface depending on the irrigation of the surrounding farmlands according to the traditional practice totally 200 mm water allocated from the yellow river was applied to leach salt before sunflower planting in early may annually the rainfall amounted to 41 and 120 mm during the sunflower growing seasons in 2019 and 2020 respectively and the average temperatures were 21 6 and 21 7 c respectively fig 2 compared with the mean rainfall of 92 mm over the same period in 1990 2010 zhou and feng 2020 2019 was a dry year and 2020 was a wet year additionally the cumulative pan evaporation ep values were 454 mm 2019 and 499 mm 2020 mm in the growing seasons respectively leading to evaporation rainfall ratios of 11 2019 and 4 2020 2 2 experimental design and field management the field experiment consisted of four treatments with three replicates each i ck no fertilizer ii of0 organic fertilizer substituting 0 of the urea n i e chemical fertilization only iii of1 organic fertilizer substituting 50 of

study were oil residue edible fungi residue and crushed crop straw which were fermented by fermenting bacteria to produce organic fertilizer it contained 79 organic matter 7 n 1 p and 0 3 k further detailed information on the organic fertilizers can be found in the supplementary data chemical fertilizers used were urea 46 n diammonium phosphate 21 n 24 p and potassium sulfate 45 k details of the organic and chemical fertilizer application amounts in each treatment can be seen in table 3 according to the local traditional fertilization practice of cropping sunflower organic and chemical fertilizer were applied once as base fertilizer before planting and incorporated to a depth of 0 2 m field experiments included 12 plots which were arranged in a randomized complete block design with plot size of 8 10 m and 1 0 m interval between plots as a buffer zone the plastic film 8 µm thick 0 7 m wide was flattened over the soil surface for all four treatments the sunflower helianthus annuus l cultivar ad6199 was planted on 5 june of 2019 and 6 june of 2020 and harvested on 13 september of 2019 and 15 september of 2020 two rows of sunflower seeds were planted on each sheet of plastic film using a hill drop planter with 0 3 m between rows narrow row and 0 6 m between plants and the wide row width of 0 7 m between the two films in this study border irrigation was used the total irrigation amount was 120 mm and 80 mm during the growing season in 2019 and 2020 respectively the timings of the irrigation were at planting budding and flowering stages no irrigation at flowering stages in 2020 due to high rainfall 44 mm each irrigation amount was 40 mm in accordance with common local practices field management consisted of regular weeding and use of pesticides 2 3 data collection 2 3 1 meteorological data a weather station hobo h21 001 onset usa and a 20 cm diameter evaporation pan were installed in a grassy yard within 100 m of the trial field to monitor daily air temperature rainfall and pan evaporation ep the ep was recorded daily at 8 00 am 2 3 2 soil structural properties after the sunflower harvest in 2020 soil bulk density and total porosity were measured using 100 cm3 volume steel cylinders for undisturbed soil samples at soil depths of 0 0 2 m and 0 2 0 4 m respectively we also estimated the macro porosity 30 µm meso porosity 0 2 30 µm and micro porosity 0 2 µm as the difference between the volumetric water content at h water suction kpa 10 kpa and 0 kpa h 10 kpa and 1500 kpa and h 1500 kpa respectively the dispersion of clay particles is one of the main processes that cause the degradation of soil structure chorom et al 1994 to assess the soil structural stability the spontaneous dispersion of the soil was determined by reference to rengasamy 2002 we placed the air dried soil sample 20 g into a 250 ml transparent graduated cylinder and slowly added 200 ml distilled water along the sides of the graduated cylinder taking care not to disturb the soil after about 5 h any particles dispersed from the soil were gently stirred into a suspension and left for 2 h the suspension was then pumped from a depth of 0 1 m for turbidity measurement the turbidity of the soil suspensions was measured at 25 c using a laboratory turbidimeter wzs 186 shanghai china to quantify the amount of dispersed particles smaller than 2 mm and recorded in nephelometric turbidity units ntu 2 3 3 soil moisture and salinity soil samples were collected under the film in the center of each plot at 0 1 m intervals from 0 to 0 2 m and at 0 2 m intervals from 0 4 to 1 0 m using a 0 04 m diameter auger at the major growth stages of sunflower soil water content was measured gravimetrically then the soil volumetric water content swc v g 100 g 1

et al 1998 the refill point rp for sunflower in this soil which is the lower limit of raw is 0 26 m3 m 3 the upper limit of raw is fc the remaining soil samples were air dried and sieved through a 2 mm sieve a soil saturated extract was prepared for chemical analysis and ph was measured with a ph meter phs 3 c shanghai china then clear extracts of saturated soil pastes were obtained by centrifugation 4000 rpm 30 min the ece was measured with a conductivity meter dds 11a shanghai china the amounts of exchangeable cations cmolc kg 1 were determined using the ammonium acetate 1 n richards 1954 esp exchangeable sodium percentage richards 1954 was determined as 4 e s p n a e x c e c 100 where naex is concentration of exchangeable cations cmolc kg 1 and cec is the cation exchange capacity cmolc kg 1 since cec or sum of exchangeable cations are often determined using laborious and time consuming laboratory procedures it may be more appropriate and economical to determine soil esp indirectly from a simpler soil index bower and hatcher 1962 this index is the sodium adsorption ratio sar which is usually defined as richards 1954 5 s a r n a c a m g 2 therefore we only determined soil esp before planting in 2019 furthermore for the soil samples during the experiment we determined sar concentrations of co 3 2 hco 3 cl and so 4 2 were measured by titration and na k ca2 and mg2 with an atomic absorption spectrophotometer the detailed methods of ions concentration measurement were described by richards 1954 in addition we calculated cross cation ratio of soil

en us microsoft 365 p excel 3 results 3 1 soil structural properties significant differences in soil bulk density and turbidity of soil suspensions among the same soil layers in the different fertilization treatments were found fig 3 however there was no significant difference in bulk density between ck and of0 in the same soil layer p 0 05 compared with of0 the bulk density of of1 and of2 on average reduced by 4 and 6 in the 0 0 4 m soil layer respectively in addition the turbidity of soil suspension was the lowest in of2 which was 66 and 47 lower than in of0 and of1 treatments in the 0 0 4 m soil layer respectively fig 3b for the soil porosity the total porosity of of1 and of2 was significantly higher than that of ck and of0 this difference was reflected in the macro porosity and meso porosity but there was no significant difference in the micro porosity fig 3d f 3 2 soil moisture 3 2 1 soil water distribution in profile there were significant differences in soil water content among the treatments except for the mature stage in 2020 fig 4 the water content of the 0 20 cm soil in the of1 and of2 was significantly higher than that in the of0 and ck at the seeding and mature stages in 2019 at the seeding stage in the 2020 the soil water content in the of1 was significantly higher than in the other treatments with significant differences observed in the 0 20 cm and 60 100 cm soil layer however no significant differences were observed among the treatments at the mature stage in 2020 which was probably impacted by the increased rainfall 3 2 2 temporal dynamics of soil water storage in root zone the soil water storage in root zone 0 60 cm was significantly affected by organic fertilizer substitution proportion fig 5 the soil water storage of the of1 and of2 was above refill point rp and significantly higher than that of the of0 and ck p 0 05 furthermore the soil water storage during the sunflower growing season under the ck and of0 was almost entirely below the rp this suggested that the organic substitution could improve soil water storage and thus facilitate sunflower water uptake from the soil 3 3 soil salinity 3 3 1 soil ece and na distribution in profile the different organic fertilizer substitution proportions redistributed the soil ece and na fig 6 as the main cation in the soil na and ece showed similar changes in the soil profile fig 6e f take ece for example at the seeding and mature stages in 2019 the ece of of0 was the highest among all fertilization treatments and with the increasing organic substitution proportion the soil salinity decreased gradually p 0 05 in 2020 there were significant differences in ece among the four treatments in the 20 100 cm soil layer at the seeding stage and ece in the 20 100 cm soil depth layer was higher than that in the 0 20 cm soil layer probably due to the pre planting irrigation effect the ece of of2 and of1 was significantly smaller than that of the of0 in the 0 60 cm soil layer at the mature stage p 0 05 moreover at the mature stage of 2020 the ece in the root zone of of2 was lower than the salinity tolerance threshold 4 8 ds m 1 of sunflower tanji and kielen 2002 3 3 2 soil sar and cross in the root zone to better evaluate the impact of sodicity on soil structure we calculated the soil sar and cross in the root zone the soil sar and cross in root zone was significantly affected by organic fertilizer substitution proportion table 4 across the two years the of1 and of2 significantly decreased sar and cross in addition cross and sar show similar changes in value taking cross for example at the seeding stage the of1 and of2 significantly decreased coss by 25 and 44 in 2019 and by 17 and 29 in 2020 compared with of0 treatment respectively at the mature stage the of1 and of2 significantly decreased cross by 44 and 56 in 2019 and by 37 and 62 in 2020 compared with of0 respectively 3 4 soil nitrogen 3 4 1 soil nitrate nitrogen there were significant differences in soil no3 n concentration among the treatments p 0 05 fig 7 at the seeding stage in 2019 and 2020 the no3 n concentration decreased gradually with the increasing organic substitution proportion p 0 05 which may be related to the quick availability of chemical fertilizer at the mature stage in 2019 the soil no3 n concentration under of1 was highest with a mean value of 24 mg kg 1 in the root zone at the mature stage in 2020 the of2 exhibited a higher no3 n concentration than the other treatments with peak no3 n 43 mg kg 1 was found in the 20 40 cm soil player 3 4 2 aen pfpn ran and rrn the n related indices including ae n pfp n ra n and rr n were significantly p 0 05 affected by different organic fertilizer substitution treatments fig 8 in 2019 and 2020 the ae n and pfp n of of1 was significantly higher than those of of0 and of2 which was mainly due to the higher yield under the same nitrogen application in 2019 the ra n of of1 was improved which was 1 7 and 2 1 times higher than that of of0 and of2 respectively additionally the rr n of of1 was 67 which was significantly higher than that of of0 and of2 p 0 05 in 2020 compared with of0 of1 and of2 increased the ra n by 30 and 37 respectively similarly of1 and of2 treatments raised the rr n p 0 05 3 5 plant growth 3 5 1 plant height and leaf area index the plant height ph and leaf area index lai were significantly p 0 05 affected by the different organic fertilizer substitution treatments the plant height showed an s shaped growth curve which leveled off after 79 dap fig 9a b the largest plant height was always determined under the of1 with the peak value 135 cm in 2020 at the mature stage in 2019 and 2020 compared with ck the plant height of of1 was increased by 19 and 16 respectively the larger lai was recorded with of1 which was significantly p 0 05 higher than of0 of2 and ck fig 9c d however there was no significant difference in plant height and lai among of0 and of2 during the late growing season in 2020 3 5 2 grain yield et a and wp c the grain yield and wp c were significantly p 0 05 affected by the different organic substitution proportions we found that the grain yield and wp c of of1 were highest in both years fig 10 on average over the two years compared with of0 and of2 of1 significantly increased grain yield by 9 and 8 respectively and wp c by 12 and 4 respectively moreover the wp c of of1 and of2 was significantly higher than that of of0 and ck in the dry year 2019 while there was no significant difference between of0 of1 and of2 in the wet year 2020 for et a of1 and of2 were significantly lower than of0 and ck in 2019 while there was no significant difference p 0 05 among the four treatments in 2020 3 6 relationships between soil properties and plant height lai yield mantel tests were further conducted to quantify the relative contribution of the soil physicochemical properties to the plant height ph lai and yield of sunflower at the mature stage fig 11 considering the slow release of plant available mineral nitrogen from organic fertilizer seufert et al 2012 we evaluated the effects of no3 n concentration on crop growth from seeding stage and mature stage in 2019 there were signiﬁcant correlations between swcr soil water content in the root zone no3 nmr no3 n concentration in the root zone at mature stage and no3 nmd no3 n concentration in the deep soil at mature stage and ph lai and yield p 0 01 mantel s r 0 4 fig 11a in 2020 no3 nsr no3 n concentration in the root zone at seeding stage and no3 nsd no3 n concentration in the deep soil at seeding stage had signiﬁcant impacts on the ph lai and yield besides swcr no3 nmr and no3 nmd p 0 01 mantel s r 0 4 fig 11b 3 7 economic benefits analysis the farmers income is strongly correlated with the prices of agricultural products table 5 showed the economic benefit of sunflower production under the different organic substitution proportions the sunflower grain price in inner mongolia decreased by 16 from 2019 to 2020 as shown in the market quotation in the official website of bayannur city agriculture and animal husbandry bureau in 2019 compared with of0 and of2 the of1 treatment increased the net income by 4 and 22 respectively similarly in 2020 the net incomes of of1 were 11 and 24 higher than that of of0 and of2 respectively these results suggested that of1 could still increase the net income of sunflower production compared with the other treatments when grain prices decreased this is because of1 ensured the higher yield and lower fertilizer expenses 4 discussion high concentration of neutral salts in saline sodic soils can alleviate the dispersion of sodium unfortunately when soluble salts are leached out of the soil especially if sar of the leaching water is high curtin et al 1994 the saline sodic soil will rapidly become a sodic soil with degraded soil structure due to the soil dispersion rengasamy and olson 1991 weil and brady 2017 therefore reducing soil dispersion is the key to prevent further deterioration of saline sodic soil structure our results indicated that organic substitution treatments of1 and of2 significantly lowered the turbidity a quantitative indicator of the number of dispersed particles smaller than 2 mm of topsoil suspensions increased soil macro porosity and meso porosity and decreased soil bulk density fig 3 improvement in the soil structure was mainly attributed to the amelioration of sodicity table 4 as its consequence leaching of salt out of the surface horizons the possible mechanisms fig 12 are as follows i ca2 contained in the organic fertilizer and ca2 released by the reaction between h2co3 the microbial decomposition of the organic fertilizer releases co2 which dissolves in water to form h2co3 and native caco3 substituted na from the exchange complex and thereby na was leached from the topsoil this reduced the thickness of ionic swarm weil and brady 2017 and stabilized soil aggregates thus reducing dispersion chorom and rengasamy 1997 ghosh et al 2010 ii the release of microbial polysaccharides as a byproduct of the organic fertilizer decomposition sumner 1993 which on its own and interacting with ca2 further stabilize soil aggregates oades 1984 to summarize the organic substitution improved soil aggregation barzegar et al 1997 and thus improving the stability of this saline sodic soil the most crucial constraining factor is water for food production in the arid areas the results of our study showed that organic substitution treatments of1 and of2 were superior to treatments without organic fertilizer in maintaining soil water content at 0 20 cm fig 4 and the soil water storage in the sunflower root zone of organic substitution treatments exceeded the refill point during sunflower growth period fig 5 these findings agreed with prior studies liu et al 2013 zhai et al 2022 moreover salinity transport with water is the main pathway of soil salt movement xia et al 2016 results indicated that organic substitution treatments were conducive to reduce salinity in the root zone as seen in the fig 6 the amelioration of soil water and salt conditions was probably explained by organic substitution improved soil structure by ameliorating soil sodicity table 4 and increasing soil macro porosity and meso porosity fig 3 which was conducive to soil salt leaching and water retention in general the n from organic fertilizer is not directly available for plant uptake and must be mineralized to inorganic n sims 1995 addition of fertilizers or presence of salts may increase net mineralization of soil organic n however as sar is increased the nutrient contribution from organic matter is decreased because of the ability of cations to stimulate mineralization of organic n decreases as their ionic potential decreases i e a13 fe3 ca2 mg2 k na naidu and rengasamy 1993 in agricultural soils the no3 n is commonly measured to estimate the available n carter and gregorich 2006 in this study the no3 n concentration of of2 was always lower than that of of1 and of0 in 2019 until the mature stage in 2020 the no3 n concentration of of2 was significantly higher than that under of0 of1 and ck moreover the no3 n concentration of of1 in the soil was also higher in the late growth stage under organic substitution this was mainly due to i the decrease of sar in soil na was removed from the exchange complex fig 12 led to the increase of organic n mineralization ii with the decrease of ph urease activity increased thereby availability of nitrogen was greatly increased naidu and rengasamy 1993 iii the improvement of microbial community structure gu et al 2019 han et al 2021 li et al 2022 increased soil organic c turnover and organic mineralization efficiency resulting in the improvement of nutrient supply luan et al 2019 morra et al 2021 in addition the release of mineral n from organic sources is slow seufert et al 2012 and studies have shown that the n in organic fertilizers cannot be completely decomposed within one year sims 1995 this was consistent with the results of zhou et al 2020 in this study the increased application of p and k in of1 and of2 especially p p in of1 and of2 was 33 6 and 67 2 higher than that in of0 33 6 kg ha 1 would inevitably affect soil nutrients and crop growth previous study showed that organic fertilizer application could transform the least available ca10 p into the more available ca2 p and ca8 p thereby increasing p availability and crop growth li et al 2020a additionally taiwo et al 2018 found that the soil s k fixing capacities were reduced after organic fertilizer application leading to more k was released and the ability to fix k decreased with increase of organic fertilizer rates therefore the effect of p and k released from organic fertilizer on soil and crop growth should also be considered which is the key point of our next research in addition the change in ph caused by organic fertilizer can directly and indirectly affect nutrients availability such as p which was recognized as a factor in improving crop growth curtin et al 1992 qadir and schubert 2002 chen et al 2021b reported that soil ph was decreased and soil available p and p use efficiency were increased in saline sodic soil under organic amendments addition furthermore organic fertilizers especially animal manures generally contain high concentration of heavy metals which could result in metal accumulation in soils with long term and frequent application fan et al 2013 zhao et al 2014 a 22 year fertilization and cropping study indicated that pig manure led to metal accumulation in red soil mainly cd followed by cu resulting in the increase of metal availability except for pb zhou et al 2015 although the organic fertilizers in this study were made from agricultural waste resources rapeseed oil residue edible fungi residue and crop straw and the heavy metal content in it was far below the standard limits in china tables s1 and s2 it was unclear whether long term application would lead to heavy metal accumulation therefore the monitoring of nutrients such as p and heavy metal content needs to be strengthened in the further study previous studies have indicated that the organic substitution approach can improve crop yield although there are differences in the substitution rate of organic fertilizer when obtaining the best yield liu et al 2021 zhai et al 2022 zhang et al 2022a our results indicated that of1 significantly increased plant height lai and sunflower yield fig 9 and fig 10 compared with of0 certainly resulted from a more favorable soil environment with improved soil structure increased water availability reduced salinity and provided sufficient nutrients although of2 also improved soil quality and mitigated salt stress its no3 n concentration was still low except for the maturity stage in 2020 fig 7 which resulted in the grain yield in of2 was significantly lower than that in of1 our findings were consistent with li et al 2022 who similarly considered that a 50 organic substitution rate was optimal for the maximum grain yield in wheat rice rotation additionally wp c is used to assess crop water productivity as a ratio of yield to actual evapotranspiration et a zhang et al 2009 in this study of1 and of2 significantly increased the wp c compared with ck and of0 in 2019 because the lower et a however there was no significant difference in wp c for of0 of1 and of2 in 2020 this was due to the higher rainfall 120 mm in 2020 and more water consumption occurred in soil evaporation which might mask the difference mantel tests indicated that the correlation between ece and ph lai and yield was weaker mantel s r 0 2 compared with soil water and no3 n concentration mantel s r 0 4 fig 11 that is to say the effects of soil water and nitrogen status on sunflower growth was greater than that of salinity and sodicity under organic substitution on the one hand organic substitution significantly ameliorated soil sodicity thereby improving soil structure and strengthening salt leaching which is the main reason on the other hand the salt tolerance of sunflower should also be considered a study in the hid suggested that sunflower cultivar ld5009 was the most salt tolerant crop among wheat maize and sunflower with the highest salinity tolerance index tong et al 2015 the data showed that the varieties used in this study increased yield by 12 compared with ld5009 china seed business network 2011 therefore compared with water and n the lower effect of soil salinity and sodicity on crop growth under organic substitution was due to i the salts leaching of the surface soil was strengthened by the improved soil structural properties due to the amelioration of the soil sodicity ii the high salt tolerance of the sunflower variety used in this study mantel tests founded that the effect of swcr on crop growth was stronger mantel s r 0 4 p 0 01 than that of swcd in the two seasons this might be attributed to the following reasons i the improved porosity in the topsoil fig 3 was conducive to maintaining soil water fig 4 and fig 5 under organic substitution thereby promoting the crop growth ii the main water uptake position by the sunflower roots located the 0 0 5 m layer in this study area qiao et al 2006 in addition the more remarkable effect of no3 nsd on crop growth in 2020 compared with 2019 might be due to the slow n release of organic fertilizer seufert et al 2012 and the increased porosity under organic substitution which was beneficial to the n transport from deeper to upper soils for crop uptake chen et al 2021b zhang et al 2022a mantel tests also indicated that swcr and no3 nm i e no3 nmr and no3 nmd had a stronger effect mantel s r 0 4 p 0 01 on crop growth in the two seasons fig 11 and the results of soil properties and yield showed that the of2 and of1 compared with the of0 significantly increased swcr fig 4 and maintained a steady release of n thereby not decreasing or even significantly increasing the yield fig 10 this indicated that swcr and no3 nm were key indicators significantly affecting sunflower yield this was consistent with the findings of he et al 2022 from the grower s perspective on fertility any increase in the amount of fertilizer makes sense only if it profitably improves yields or enhances quality hera 1996 our results showed that compared with of0 and of2 of1 treatment increased net income two year average by 7 and 23 in sunflower production table 4 this is because of1 maintained a relatively low fertilizer input and ensured a higher crop yield accordingly the organic substitution measure can serve as a viable tool to reduce production risks and to improve farmers livelihoods under arid saline areas however organic substitution practice has not been widely promoted among chinese farmers a government led price subsidy mechanism coupled with the essential technical support associated with research and development extension and training could motivate growers to adapt organic fertilizers xu et al 2014 5 conclusions through two year field experiment we tried to reveal the possible mechanism of organic substitution on soil quality improvement from the perspective of soil structure our findings indicated that the organic substitution approach of1 and of2 significantly improved soil structural properties as evidenced by decreasing in soil suspension turbidity and bulk density and increasing in meso porosity 0 2 30 µm and macro porosity 30 µm the improvement of soil structure was related to the amelioration of sodicity reduction of sar or cross and as its consequence leaching of salt out of the surface layers moreover of1 could provide sufficient nitrogen supply throughout the growth period compared with of0 and of2 thereby increasing sunflower yield and improving crop water fertilizer productivity additionally of1 significantly increased net income mantel tests showed that swcr and no3 nm were key indicators significantly affecting sunflower growth under organic substitution therefore from the perspective of improving the soil properties crop water fertilizer productivity and economic benefits it is suggested that organic fertilizer substituting 50 of the urea n for sunflower production under the arid saline environment the results of this study are intended to provide guidance to the scientific application of organic substitution technology for agricultural production in arid saline areas thereby

8957,the indo gangetic plains igp in north west nw india are facing a severe decline in ground water due to prevalent rice based cropping systems to combat this issue conservation agriculture ca with an alternative crop s such as maize is being promoted recently surface drip fertigation has also been evaluated as a viable option to address low nutrient use efficiency and water scarcity problems for cereals while the individual benefits of ca and sub surface drip ssd irrigation on water economy are well established information regarding their combined effect in cereal based systems is lacking therefore we conducted a two year field experiment in maize under an ongoing ca based maize wheat system to evaluate the complementarity of ca with ssd irrigation through two technological interventions ca residue retained ca ssd pca partial ca without residue ssd at different n rates 0 120 and 150 kg n ha 1 in comparison to traditional furrow irrigated fi ca and conventional tillage ct at 120 kg n ha 1 our results showed that ca had the highest grain yield 8 2 t ha 1 followed by pca 8 1 t ha 1 the grain yield under ca at 150 kg n ha 1 was 27 and 30 higher than ca and ct respectively even at the same n level 120 kg n ha 1 ca outperformed ca and ct by 16 and 18 respectively the physiological performance of maize also revealed that ca based plots with 120 kg n ha 1 had 12 and 3 higher photosynthesis rate at knee high and silking respectively compared to fi ca and ct overall compared to the fi ca and ct ssd based ca and pca saved 54 irrigation water and increased water productivity wp by more than twice similarly a greater number of split n application through fertigation in pca and ca increased agronomic nitrogen use efficiency nue and recover efficiency by 8 19 and 14 25 respectively net returns from pca and ca at 150 kg n ha 1 were significantly higher by us 491 and 456 respectively than the fi ca and ct treatments therefore ca coupled with ssd provided tangible benefits in terms of yield irrigation water saving wp nue and profitability efforts should be directed towards increasing farmers awareness of the benefits of such promising technology for the cultivating food grains and commercial crops such as maize concurrently government support and strict policies are required to enhance the system adaptability graphical abstract ga1 keywords conservation agriculture net returns nitrogen use efficiency photosynthesis subsurface drip irrigation fertigation water productivity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the traditional rice wheat rw systems in india s indo gangetic plains igp are being criticised for its environmental and sustainability issues which includes declining factor productivity soil health deterioration residue burning and greenhouse gas emissions and deepening of groundwater levels jat et al 2019 bhatt et al 2021 the decline in the groundwater table has led the governments of punjab and haryana to declare certain areas as dark zones where rice cultivation is no longer considered sustainable the groundwater table in north western nw india declined 0 2 m yr 1 during 1973 2001 while during 2000 2006 it got hastened by fivefold 1 0 m yr 1 humphreys et al 2010 the deepening of ground water table demands installation of heavy power pump for lifting groundwater which increases the input energy use and cost of cultivation further if appropriate measures on prudent groundwater use are not implemented promptly the igp in nw india may face a severe water shortage which could lead to widespread socioeconomic stress alternative techniques to save water and increase irrigation water productivity comprise shifting to conservation agriculture ca practices no tillage and straw mulching cultivation on permanent raised beds pb soil matric potential based irrigation scheduling micro irrigation methods and diversification of rice with c4 crop like maize yadvinder singh et al 2014 majeed et al 2015 parihar et al 2016a patra et al 2021a there are numerous benefits associated with replacement of rice with maize in the existing rw cropping system towards improvement of soil health jat et al 2013 biomass accumulation radiation use efficiency patra et al 2021a system productivity devkota et al 2013 parihar et al 2016b choudhary et al 2018 diversification of rw with maize wheat mw system is a win win solution for achieving sustainable water use as the water productivity wp of maize is 8 22 times higher than rice gathala et al 2013 and maize requires 80 85 less water to produce one kg of grain than rice bouman 2009 for such reasons the area under maize cultivation in north west nw india has recently increased owing largely to favourable government policies that encourage maize cultivation to save irrigation water and electricity costs sharma et al 2015 however conventional till maize ct cultivation comprising of 6 7 tillage operations and flood irrigation results in high energy use unproductive loss of irrigation water and nitrogen n fertilizer sandhu et al 2019 mutuku et al 2020 patra et al 2021b and overall economic non profitability aryal et al 2015 in the recent time with emergence of water scarcity issue drip irrigation gained attention as an economically viable option for irrigating the field crops such as maize yolcu and cetin 2015 jat et al 2019 patra et al 2021a and wheat chen et al 2015 chouhan et al 2015 sidhu et al 2019 to increase the wp however because of field inconvenience like interference of drip laterals with tillage and harvesting implements and intercultural operations the field adoption of surface drip irrigation was very less sub surface drip overcomes these bottlenecks and improve farmers acceptance of drip irrigation in cereal based systems in contrast to surface drip irrigation the ssd system reduces evaporation losses from the soil surface allows water and nutrients to be delivered directly to the crop root zone resulting in efficient water and nutrient use reduction in weed emergence labour costs and facilitates seeding with ca based no tillage practices jat et al 2019 sidhu et al 2019 furthermore precise n fertigation in multiple splits through ssd may open a new avenue for redesigning n management protocol in ca based maize system with conventional broadcasting of n fertilizers in ca a larger amounts of n fertilizers remain on crop residues which encourages volatilization losses wan et al 2021 thus to increase the nue and water economy effective n placement along with water at the active crop root zone via ssd in residue retained ca based maize systems could be beneficials while numerous studies have examined the individual benefits of ca and ssd in terms of water and nitrogen savings there is a lack of comprehensive research exploring complementarity of ca and ssd can work together to impact crop physiological responses crop productivity water productivity wp and nitrogen use efficiency nue in cereals such as maize in light of existing knowledge gaps a 2 year study was conducted with the objectives of i assessing the effect of bundling of ca with ssd ca at different n doses on physiological performance of maize and ii estimating the yield benefits irrigation water savings water and n use efficiency and farm profitability of maize under mw system in different combinations of tillage nitrogen irrigation and residue management it was hypothesized that coupling of ca with ssd would improve crop physiological responses and thus water and n use efficiency over furrow irrigated ca and ct plots 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and climate a two year field experiment 2018 and 2019 was conducted under an ongoing ca based maize wheat mw system initiated since 5 years in kharif 2014 at the fixed site with same set of technological interventions at the borlaug institute for south asia bisa cimmyt 30 99 n 75 44 e 229 m above the sea level punjab india the climate is semi arid and sub tropical with three well defined seasons i e hot and dry summer season march june wet monsoon season late june mid september dry winter season october february the experimental site has an alluvial origin flat and well drained sandy loam soil typic haplustept which was fairly uniform to a depth of 120 cm the ph 1 2 soil water ratio and ec are 7 9 8 5 and 0 58 ds m 1 respectively 2 2 climatic data during experimentation the annual average rainfall is 734 mm with approximately 75 80 falling between july and october the rainfall maximum temperature tmax and minimum temperature tmin were measured daily using a davis weather station davis vantage pro 2 weather station installed at the experimental site 2 3 experimental design and treatments in this study we evaluated the effect of two sub surface drip ssd based ca practices i e pca and ca at three nitrogen rates including one control n0 0 n120 120 and n150 150 kg n ha 1 in comparison to furrow irrigated ca and ct with 120 kg n ha 1 n120 across two cropping seasons 2018 and 2019 the three treatments under pca were comprised of residue removed permanent bed pb ssd irrigation without n n0 pca 120 kg n ha 1 n120 pca and 150 kg n ha 1 n150 pca similarly the three treatments under ca were residue retained wr pb ssd without n n0 ca 120 kg n ha 1 n120 ca and 150 kg n ha 1 n150 ca the rest treatments were furrow irrigated fi ca n120 ca and ct n120 ct the details of treatments adopted in this study are given in table 1 the experiment was laid out in a randomized complete block design rcbd with three replications the area of each experimental unit plot was 80 8 m2 2 4 sub surface drip irrigation system and irrigation management the sub surface drip laterals having 16 mm inner diameter were installed at 20 cm soil depth by using two row tractor operated drip laying machine with depth control mechanism developed by bisa cimmyt ludhiana punjab india sidhu et al 2019 the lateral depth of ssd was chosen based on the result of preliminary exploratory study on evaluation of different depths for laying laterals in mw system on pbs in the adjacent plot of the experimental field data not reported this study found that maize yield was similar at 15 and 20 cm lateral depths but decreased significantly at 25 cm depth however 20 cm of lateral depth was deemed ideal for maize on pb in order to facilitate long term tillage operations the laterals used in this study had line sourced emitters spaced at 30 cm apart with a capacity of 2 0 l h 1 at a pressure of 135 kpa for the entire wetting of a plot area 81 m2 the laterals are 67 5 cm apart compatible with bed width and placed at 20 cm depth in the center of each bed so each lateral served one row of maize fig 1 the drip system was fitted with hydro cyclone filter and screen filter 100 micron mesh size for filtration of groundwater venturi injectors were used for fertigation in sub surface drip ssd plots and the required suction was developed by upstream and downstream pressure difference in ssd plots irrigation was scheduled based on soil matric potential using tensiometers monitored with a soilspec vacuum gauge installed at 20 cm depth in between two rows at the center of each plot tensiometers installed as per gupta et al 2016 were regularly read each morning between 9 00 10 00 a m the maize crop under ssd plots were irrigated when soil moisture potential smp decreased to 50 1 kpa till the crop reached physiological maturity the ssd plots received 9 and 14 irrigations each of 10 mm in 2018 and 2019 respectively which amounted to 90 and 140 mm of irrigation water in total sidhu et al 2019 can be refereed for further details about the ssd system in traditional furrow irrigated plots a total of 200 and 300 mm water each of 50 mm was applied based on critical crop growth stage based scheduling approach irrigation was avoided when sufficient rainfall occurred at any critical crop growth stage due to the comparatively good and evenly distributed rainfall during the 2018 cropping period a total of four irrigations were applied at the 6 leaf knee high 50 silking and dough stage in contrast the 2019 period received 33 less rainfall than the previous season necessitating the use of 6 irrigations one irrigation was given at 5 das and the other five were scheduled at 6 leaf late knee high tasseling 50 silking and dough stages respectively the volume of water applied for each irrigation was measured with the help of water meter dasmesh mechanical works punjab india fitted to the delivery pipe close to the experimental plots 2 5 crop management after installation of subsurface drip lines beds pb were formed in kharif 2014 using a 4 wheel drive tractor operated bed planter the same beds were kept undisturbed and maintained as permanent beds pb during succeeding crop seasons the mid furrow to mid furrow widths of the beds were 67 5 cm while the flat tops width and furrow depths were 37 and 15 cm respectively fig 1 permanent beds were reshaped once a year and crop were sown using multi crop bed planter on top of the raised bed a row of maize hybrid p3396 was planted with plant to plant spacing of 20 cm in the ca and ct plots maize was shown by double disc planter fitted with an inclined plate seed metering mechanism maize hybrid was sown at a seed rate of 20 kg ha 1 in all treatments on june 15 and june 20 2018 and 2019 respectively on the ca and ca plots approximately 25 of the residues from the preceding crops were retained whereas all residues were removed in the pca and ct plots a basal dose of 23 5 kg n 60 kg p2o5 as dap was drilled along with seed at sowing to all the plots except control or n0 plots where ssp was used instead of dap in addition to p2o5 each plot received a dose of 30 kg k2o as mop at the time of sowing in drip irrigated treatments the rest amount of n i e 96 5 and 126 5 kg n were applied as urea through irrigation fertigation at 15 day interval in 4 equal split starting at 21 days after sowing das the remaining 96 5 kg n for ca and ct was top dressed in two equal splits at knee high and pre tasselling stage of maize 2 6 measured and calculated parameters 2 6 1 fractional intercepted photosynthetic active radiation photosynthetically active radiation par was measured by using a line quantum sensor li 191sa licor inc lin184 coln ne usa with a data logger the incident solar radiation received i0 above the canopy was measured by aligning the sensor to face the sky the transmitted radiation it through the canopy were measured by keeping the sensor just above the soil facing the canopy coverage the fractional intercepted par fipar was calculated using the following equation nobel 1980 rai et al 2019 1 fipar i 0 it i 0 2 6 2 leaf area index a portable leaf area meter li cor 3000 was used to measure the area of the leaves five representative plants from each plot were tagged and individual plant s leaf area was measured at periodic interval beginning 20 days after sowing das to measure leaf area the scanning head of the instrument was fixed over each leaf s petiole and was passed through the leaves the leaf area from 5 plants were averaged and expressed as leaf area per plant the final leaf area index lai was calculated using the following formula 2 lai total leaf area cm 2 plant 1 ground area spacing cm 2 plant 1 2 6 3 plant nitrogen analysis nitrogen uptake and n remobilization the collected plant samples were first allowed to dry in the sun before being dried in a hot air oven at 60 c until a consistent moisture was obtained the oven dried samples of maize were grounded by retsch mixer mill mm 400 and used for nitrogen analysis nitrogen content n in stover and grain were determined by chns analyser euro ea 3000 the n uptake in grain and stover were computed by multiplying n content with respective yields the vegetative stage n uptake vn is basically n accumulated in biomass till the end of the vegetative stage and was calculated by using following formula 3 vn uptake total biomass produced till the end of vegetative stage n content in biomass the remobilized vn into grain were calculated by balance method ciampitti and vyn 2011 4 remobilized vn into grain vn uptake stover n uptake at harvest 2 6 4 nitrogen use efficiency and water productivity in this study nitrogen use efficiency was measured by two ways i e apparent n recovery arn agronomic efficiency aen to calculate these efficiencies the following formulae were used 5 ar n t u n c u n a f n 100 6 ae n g y f g y c a f n 100 where tun is the total n uptake grain stover from fertilized plot kg ha 1 cun is the total grain stover n uptake from unfertilized control plot kg ha 1 afn is the amount of applied fertilizer n kg ha 1 gyf is the grain yield in fertilized plot kg ha 1 and gyc is the grain yield in unfertilized control plot kg ha 1 the water productivity wp was computed as the ratio of maize grain yield to the amount of water use expressed in kg m 3 both the total water use and irrigation water applied were used as denominator for computation of wp pereira et al 2012 çetin and kara 2019 this results in two different wp indicators described in eqs 7 and 8 7 total water productivity wp total grain yield total water rainfall irrigation use 8 irrigation water productivity wp irrig grain yield irrigation water use 2 6 5 measurement of photosynthesis and transpiration rate photosynthesis rate pn μmol co2 m 2 s 1 and transpiration rate tn nmol h2o m 2 s 1 were measured at two stages viz knee high 34 das and silking stage 62 das in vivo using a photosynthetic system li 6400 licor usa under saturated light conditions photosynthetically active radiation was set as 1200 μmol m 2 s 1 at the knee high stage five plants from each plot were chosen at random and one fully expanded youngest leaf from each individual was measured the same plants were then tagged separately for subsequent measurement at the silking stage during the silking stage readings were taken from the cob leaf immature cob of each plant that had previously been tagged the measurements were taken between 11 00 am to 11 30 am the ambient co2 level was 380 ppm and the air temperature was 35 c the leaves were enclosed in the chamber and the net exchange of co2 between leaf and the atmosphere was computed the pn and tn were calculated by the infrared gas analyzer s irga s inbuilt microcomputer using this rate of change and other factors such as the leaf area enclosed the volume of enclosure and the temperature anand et al 2007 pandey et al 2017 2 6 6 specific leaf nitrogen photosynthetic nitrogen and water use efficiency following the photosynthetic measurements the area of each leaf was measured using the same portable leaf area meter the leaves were then excised and fresh mass were also recorded finally the leaves were sliced and representative samples were dried to a constant mass to estimate dry mass and n content the leaf n content was determined using the chns elemental analyser euro ea elemental analyser polo technologies pavia the specific leaf nitrogen sln was calculated at the panicle initiation pi stage when maximum leaf expansion is expected from n content and leaf area of dry mass allison et al 1997 sln was calculated using eq 8 and expressed as mmol n m 2 9 sln leaf weight n concentration leaf area photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency pnue the ratio of net photosynthetic rate pn to leaf n content is an important parameter in determining the response of leaf n to carbon exchange rate the photosynthetic nue pnue nmol co2 mmol 1 n s 1 was computed according to anand et al 2007 10 pnue rate of photosynthesis specific leaf nitrogen content leaves are the organ completing the processes of both water transpiration and co2 assimilation photosynthetic water use efficiency pwue μmol co2 mmol 1 h2o is often used to characterize the process the pwue was estimated using eq 10 guo et al 2016 11 pwue rate of photosynthesis rate of transpiration 2 6 7 biomass accumulation yield attributes grain yield and protein yield dry matter accumulation was measured on a regular basis by uprooting three maize plants from each plot the collected plant samples were air dried for 7 8 days before being oven dried at 65 oc for 2 days to achieve a constant weight which was expressed as g of dry matter per plant the yield attributes viz the number of cobs per hectare cob length cm cob girth cm the number of grains per row and cob and 100 grains weight were estimated using standard protocol as described in parihar et al 2018a for recording crop yield two border rows from both the border directions along the row and 0 5 m in perpendicular direction across the row length wise were excluded to harvest the net plot area all cobs from each net plot were sun dried and threshed after separating the stover and removing the husk and silk the final grain yield was adjusted at 14 5 moisture and was expressed in t ha 1 the maize stover was cut from ground level and weighed after sun drying thus the weight of total harvested produce cob stover from the net plot was recorded and expressed as biological yield t ha 1 the protein content of the maize crop was determined by multiplying the estimated nitrogen content by the standard factor of 6 25 as recommended by fao 2003 merrill and watt 1973 the protein yield was then calculated by multiplying the grain yield by the protein content 2 7 economic analysis partial budgeting was used to calculate the economics of the sdi system as explained by sidhu et al 2019 after taking into account the 80 subsidy provided by the government of india on the actual cost us 3477 90 ha 1 the annual depreciation was calculated using the straight line depreciation method after considering a salvage value of 10 and 15 years useful life span of the ssd system sidhu et al 2019 as a result the final cost incurred for ssd installation for a single crop in the mw system came to us 20 87 across the study years 2018 and 2019 gross returns gr and net returns nr were calculated on the basis of inputs used and outputs obtained considering the incurred variable cost the cost of human labor was calculated considering the eight hour person day as defined by indian labor law in addition the amount of machinery time hours per hectare required to perform a specific on farm operation was calculated the total cost of all on farm operations was calculated by adding the cost time diesel and electricity used to complete each operation summing the input costs yielded the total variable cost tvc the gross returns gr included income from the sale of grain and stover of maize the gr was calculated by using market minimum support price msp for maize grain the tvc including annual depreciation cost us 20 87 was subtracted from the gr to determine the nr fixed costs such as land value and interest were not included in this economic analysis all economic analysis was conducted in indian rupees inr which were then converted into us 2 8 statistical analysis the anova was conducted for all the agronomic data viz n uptake n use efficiency yield attributes yield and biological yield using the statistical analysis system sas institute cary nc for rcbd if anova was found significant the differences between treatment means were compared using the lsd test at p 0 05 gomez and gomez 1984 3 results 3 1 weather total rainfall during the 2018 maize crop june 15 to october 10 was 723 9 mm almost half of which was received in july and september fig 2a higher than the long term june october average of 600 6 mm the 2019 maize season was drier than the previous year with nearly half of the rainfall falling in august fig 2a and total cropping period june 20 to october 13 rainfall was 488 2 mm monthly pan evaporation of both cropping season tended to be similar or lower than the long term average except for much lower values in october each year and higher values in june during 2018 mean monthly maximum tmax and minimum tmin temperatures were lower than or comparable to long term values fig 2b tmax and tmin were similar to and higher than the corresponding long term maximum and minimum averages in 2019 the highest tmax and lowest tmin of both seasons were recorded in june and october respectively 3 2 leaf area index and fractional intercepted photosynthetically active radiation the two year mean leaf area index lai during 30 60 75 and 105 das significantly varied among the treatments fig 3 across the treatments the lai increased till 60 75 das and attained the plateau at 30 das the lai did not vary among the n fertilized treatments during the active growth phase n150 ca had the highest lai followed by n150 pca n120 ca and n120 pca respectively however the lai in n150 pca and n120 ca was comparable throughout the cropping season similar lai was recorded between furrow irrigated ca n120 ca and ct n120 ct plots at 75 das the lai in the ca based n150 ca treatment was nearly 1 2 times that of the furrow irrigated n120 ca and n120 ct treatments the ca plots with residue retention had higher lai than residue removed pca plots fractional intercepted photosynthetically active radiation fipar was significantly influenced by tillage irrigation nitrogen and residue management options fig 4 the maximum light interception by crop canopy was observed between 55 and 70 das in all the treatments coinciding with the beginning of the reproductive phase of the maize during this period the largest fipar 0 90 0 95 were recorded in n150 ca plots followed by n150 pca 0 86 0 90 n120 ca 0 81 0 86 and n120 pca 0 77 0 82 on an average residue retained ssd ca plots intercepted more radiation than residue removed pca plots the fipar in ct and ca based plots with 120 kg n ha 1 were comparable during the peak growth period ssd adoption improved light interception by a minimum of 11 over furrow irrigation 3 3 photosynthetic parameters the tillage residue n and irrigation management practices significantly p 0 05 influenced the rate of photosynthesis pn and transpiration tn table 2 the pn was found to be higher in n150 ca during knee high and silking 24 and 34 mol co2 m 2 s 1 respectively which was comparable to n150 pca and n120 ca and 18 and 14 higher than n120 pca the pn under n120 ca was 12 and 3 higher than furrow irrigated treatments n120 ca and n120 ct at knee high and silking stages respectively similarly pn of n150 ca was 22 and 6 higher at knee high and silking stage respectively as compared to the ca and ct at silking residue retention had a greater effect on pn in the ca plots than in the pca plots where residues were removed the effect was more pronounced at higher n dose 150 kg ha 1 at both the knee high and silking stages the photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency pnue was similar in the subsurface drip irrigated ca and pca treatments table 2 the ssd irrigated n150 ca treatment had the highest pnue 90 55 and 311 0 μmol co2 g 1 n s 1 which was 26 18 and 10 50 higher than the furrow irrigated n120 ca and n120 ct at knee high and silking respectively at the knee high stage pnue was similar in furrow irrigated ca and ct based plots but at the silking stage it was 22 higher in ca based plots at knee high stage the transpiration rate tn in n fertigated pca and ca treatments was 15 33 higher than in furrow irrigated ca and ct respectively table 2 however at this stage the tn did not differ significantly between the ca and pca treatments the tn in the residue retained and residue removed plots was nearly identical at both the stages at the silking stage the n150 ca treatment had the highest tn 7 81 mmol h2o m 2 s 1 which was statistically at par to the n150 pca 7 51 mmol h2o m 2 s 1 and 19 higher than furrow irrigated ca and ct treatments at the knee high stage the photosynthetic water use efficiency pwue did not differ across different crop establishment options residue n and irrigation management practices except for n120 pca which had lowest pwue table 2 the pwue was greater in control treatments than in the n fertilized treatments at knee high stage however among n fertilized treatments n150 ca had the highest knee high stage pwue at silking the pwue was highest in ca treatment n120 ca 4 62 μmol co2 mmol 1 h2o which was statistically similar to n120 pca n150 ca and n120 ct all n fertilized treatments had statistically similar specific leaf nitrogen sln content at knee high stage ranging from 253 6 to 284 mmol n m 2 the sln under n120 ct was 11 higher than n120 ca treatment at knee high fig 5 similar to tasseling the sln content at silking was alike in all n fertilized treatment except n120 ca which had lowest sln at same n application rate 120 kg ha 1 the sln in ca based n120 ca was 11 and 9 higher than furrow irrigated n120 ca and n120 ct respectively 3 4 yield attributing characters cob length and grains per cob were significantly p 0 05 affected by tillage residue n and irrigation management options table 3a table 3b the cob length and grains per cob were similar p 0 05 in pca ca and ca plots apart from control plots the lowest cob length and grains per cob were observed in n120 ct 19 5 cm and 517 two year mean while the highest was observed in n150 ca treatment 22 2 cm and 604 grains cob 1 the average cob length and grains per cob in n150 ca plots were 14 and 17 higher than n120 ct respectively ssd treatments with 120 kg n i e n120 pca and n120 ca had 6 longer higher average cob length and grains per cob than n120 ct the ca plots recorded 7 longer cob length and 5 more grains per cob than the pca plots however among all n fertilized treatments the effect of tillage residue n rate and irrigation on cob girth grains per row 100 grain weight and cobs per hectare was non significant table 3b 3 5 biomass accumulation and biological yield the dry matter accumulation was faster during the first 60 days then the biomass increased at a slower rate fig 6 the n150 ca plots showed largest 2 years mean biomass accumulation which was nearly similar to biomass production under n150 pca among the n fertilized treatments n120 ct had the lowest biomass accumulation which was statistically at par with n120 ca surface residue retention had a significant positive effect on biomass accumulation fig 6 the biological yield was 31 and 36 higher in the n150 ca than in furrow irrigated n120 ca and n120 ct treatments respectively table 4 similarly at the same n application rate of 120 kg ha 1 n120 ca produced 17 and 22 higher biological yield than n120 ca and n120 ct on an average ca based plots produced 5 higher biological yield than pca based plots further the biological yield of the n120 ca treatment was 4 2 higher than n120 ct treatment 3 6 grain and stover yields maize grain yield gy was significantly affected by p 0 05 tillage residue n and irrigation management options table 4 the gy of all ssd fertigated ca and pca treatments were significantly higher than that of the n120 ca and n120 ct plots across the years ca based n150 pca 8 54 and 7 79 t ha 1 and n150 ca 8 17 and 8 23 t ha 1 treatments had similar gy which was significantly higher than other ca and ca ct treatments the ca based n150 ca treatment produced highest two year mean grain yield 8 20 t ha 1 and was statistically at par with n150 pca 8 17 t ha 1 the maize grain yield was 27 and 30 higher under n150 ca than the furrow irrigated n120 ca 6 46 t ha 1 and n120 ct 6 33 t ha 1 respectively at the same n level maize yields in n120 ca were 16 and 18 higher as compared to the n120 ca and n120 ct respectively on average ca based plots had higher gy than pca based plots tillage residue n and irrigation management options all had a significant p 0 05 effect on stover yield table 4 across the years all n fertigated ca and pca plots produced more stover yield than the furrow irrigated n120 ca and n120 ct plots similar to the gy highest stover yield was recorded under n150 ca which was 33 and 38 higher than ca and ct respectively 3 7 grain and stover nitrogen uptake and protein yield significant differences p 0 05 in both grain and stover n uptake were observed between ssd fertigated and conventionally n broadcasted furrow irrigated treatments i e n120 ca and n120 ct table 5 n uptake was higher in treatments with higher n dose 150 kg ha 1 the n150 ca treatment had the highest two year mean grain n uptake 113 kg ha 1 that was statistically comparable to the pca treatment n150 pca 108 kg ha 1 among n fertilized treatments significantly p 0 05 lower grain n uptake was recorded in furrow irrigated n120 ca and n120 ct which showed a similar uptake pattern table 5 the average uptake of these treatments was 39 lower than n150 ca treatment on an average ca treatments recorded 29 higher grain n uptake than the ca and ct similar to grain n uptake across the years ssd fertigated pca and ca treatments recorded higher stover n uptake than ca and ct at the same n level the uptake of pca and ca was statistically equal the grain n content did not differ statistically p 0 05 between treatments or years data not reported however grain protein yield ranged significantly p 0 05 from 48 78 to 72 9 kg ha 1 depending on tillage residue irrigation method and n application fig 7 protein yield was higher in ssd fertigated treatments than in furrow irrigated ca and ct the highest protein yield 70 42 kg ha 1 two year mean was obtained under n150 ca which was comparable to n150 pca 67 38 kg ha 1 and n120 ca 60 29 kg ha 1 even at same n level 120 kg ha 1 ssd treatment n120 pca and n120 ca produced 19 and 14 higher protein yields respectively than the mean yield of n120 ca and n120 ct 3 8 vegetative stage n uptake and its remobilization into grain the vegetative stage n uptake vnu and its remobilization into grain was significantly affected by tillage residue n and irrigation management fig 8 vnu was 36 and 33 higher p 0 05 under n fertigated pca and ca treatments compared to furrow irrigated treatments ca and ct the highest vnu was found in n150 pca 110 kg ha 1 which was statistically at par with n150 ca 107 kg ha 1 the ssd fertigated plots with 120 kg n ha 1 i e n120 ca and n120 pca recorded 13 and 18 higher vnu than ca n120 ca and ct n120 ct respectively similarly the average vnu increase in n150 ca and n150 pca treatments was 45 and 52 compared to ca and ct a similar pattern was also observed for remobilized n fig 8 the remobilized n from vegetative stage in n150 ca n150 pca n120 ca and n120 pca was 48 56 18 and 15 higher than the average of furrow irrigated ca 46 kg ha 1 and ct 43 3 kg ha 1 averages respectively 3 9 nitrogen use efficiency the ca and pca treatments increased two year mean agronomic n use efficiency aen by 8 32 19 14 and 13 63 24 89 respectively over ct and ca table 6 the highest aen 42 95 kg grain kg 1 n was recorded in pca treatment with 120 kg n i e n120 pca which was nearly equal to aen of ca based n120 ca 42 67 kg grain kg 1 n at same level of n 120 kg ha 1 adoption of ssd irrigation gave additional 8 28 and 6 90 kg of grains per kg of applied n over furrow irrigated ca and ct across two year of experimentation the apparent n recovery arn was increased by 11 80 19 29 and 5 57 16 62 in ssd based ca and pca treatments than furrow irrigated ca and ct respectively table 6 however the mean arn was similar in all ssd fertigated ca and pca based treatments which ranged between 70 41 and 73 47 the arn of ca based n150 ca was 18 53 and 14 16 higher respectively than furrow irrigated n120 ca and n120 ct 3 10 water productivity across the years total water use was affected by rainfall whereas across the treatment the water use varied due to contrasting irrigation management practices i e subsurface drip irrigation ssd in pca and ca treatments and conventional furrow irrigation fi in ca and ct table 7 as compared to 2018 cropping period almost 1 5 times higher amount of irrigation water was applied in ssd and fi plots during 2019 the irrigation water saving for maize production under ssd irrigated ca and pca treatments were 55 0 and 53 3 average 54 15 in the years 2018 and 2019 respectively table 7 water productivity wp was significantly p 0 05 affected by tillage residue n and irrigation management practices table 7 the highest two year mean irrigation water productivity wpirrig 7 53 kg m 3 was recorded under n150 pca treatment which was statistically at par with n150 ca 7 48 kg m 3 the wpirrig of these treatments were 2 78 times greater than the average wpirrig of n120 ca 2 72 kg m 3 and n120 ct 2 66 kg m 3 even at same level of n 120 kg ha 1 ssd irrigated n120 ca produced 2 5 times more wpirrig than furrow irrigated n120 ca and n120 ct in terms of total water productivity wptotal treatment n150 ca was the most productive followed by n150 pca n120 ca and n120 pca table 7 however the values were less than wpirrig as rainfall was added as denominator 3 11 economics across the years the cost of cultivation coc was higher in residue retained n fertilized treatments ca and ca as compared to no residue treatments pca and ct table 8 regardless of n rate the largest net returns nr were observed under ssd fertigated ca and pca based plots table 8 the maximum nr us 1657 ha 1 was observed in pca based n150 pca which was statistically comparable to ca n150 ca us 1622 ha 1 the pca based treatment n150 pca fetched 478 and 504 average 491 us higher nr than n120 ca and n120 ct treatments respectively whereas the nr under n150 ca was higher by 443 and 469 average 456 us than the same ca and ct respectively the nr under ssd based treatments with n dose of 120 kg were also higher than the nr of ca and ct the net benefit cost ratio nbcr was significantly higher 3 04 3 91 in ssd fertigated ca and pca treatments than conventionally broadcasted furrow irrigated ca 2 51 and ct 2 51 treatments highest nbcr was observed under n150 pca 3 91 treatment followed by ca based n150 ca 3 40 the average nbcr in furrow irrigated ca and ct was 1 55 and 1 51 times lower than n150 pca and n150 ca plots respectively the lowest nbcr 3 04 among ssd fertigated treatments was recorded under n120 ca treatment which was 21 higher than furrow irrigated n120 ca and n120 ct s nbcr table 8 4 discussion 4 1 leaf area index fractional intercepted photosynthetically active radiation and photosynthetic behaviour a higher n application in a greater number of splits with drip irrigation improved the lai under ca based treatments alike to our finding amanullah et al 2010 reported a positive correlation of n rate and split with lai and light interception further retention of crop residue improved the lai and fipar under ca based plot as it increased the nutrient and water availability sandhu et al 2019 nayak et al 2022 similarly other studies by sampathkumar and pandian 2012 qin et al 2016 and irmak et al 2022 have also reported a larger lai increment under drip irrigation since lai and leaf area duration lad have a direct impact on the interception of incoming par the larger fipar was observed in the ssd treatment with a lai of 6 7 which is considered optimal for intercepting the maximum incoming radiation flux chanh et al 1993 guo et al 2012 the knee high stage rate of photosynthesis pn was observed higher in the n fertigated ssd plots which was mainly due to early application of 1st n split 24 and 32 kg n at 21 das in ca pca based plots on contrary the lesser pn under ca and ct at knee high stage 34 das was mainly due to late application of 1st n split 48 kg n the early n top dressing at 21 das in ssd treatments boosted early season crop growth and biomass accumulation at knee high stage in addition a frequent n and water application based on soil moisture potential smp have been shown to enhance the n and moisture availability in the root zone eltarabily et al 2019 bronson et al 2019 resulting in increased pn and transpiration rate tn at knee high and silking under ssd fertigated ca and pca plots a high regulated soil moisture levels with minimal variation can help reduce crop stress and improve both pn and tn ultimately leading to an increase in crop yield patra et al 2021a on the other hand with surface irrigation under ca and ct the soil moisture and n content deplete to suboptimal level to reduce pn and tn shen et al 2020 umair et al 2019 a suboptimal moisture can lead to closure of stomata which in turn can negatively affects pn kumar et al 2011 grassi and magnani 2005 ripley et al 2007 moreover keeping crop residue for a medium term together with ssd creates favourable soil environment that enhances crop growth habbib et al 2020 parihar et al 2016b which leads to an increase in pnue and photosynthetic water use efficiency pwue the similar value of pnue between control and n fertigated plots at knee high stage was due to less pn and lesser specific leaf nitrogen sln under control resulting in a ratio similar to the fertigated plots however the improvement in pnue under all n fertigated ca and pca plots over ca and ct is mainly because of higher rate photosynthesis the 22 lower knee high pnue under ct compared to ca plots is mainly due to 1 2 times lower sln denominator in ca 4 2 nitrogen uptake specific leaf nitrogen remobilization and nitrogen use efficiency during early stages of development plants grew predominantly in isolated form with minor competition for light under such condition plant n concentration does not vary significantly with leaf area increment lemaire et al 2007 qiang et al 2019 this might be the reason behind statistically similar sln at knee high under all n fertilized treatments however as sln is the leaf n content per unit leaf area we may find the source of difference in sln by inspecting the numerical differences between treatments in leaf n content g and leaf area m2 the amplitude of specific leaf area increase was bigger than leaf n content in all n applied ca treatments at both knee high stage and silking resulting in a slightly lower sln under ca compared to pca treatments poorter and evans 1998 habbib et al 2020 in another way the greater crop growth of ca caused more dilution of leaf n per unit leaf area the same dilution effect resulted in lower sln in ca plots compared to ct plots a higher n uptake under ca and pca based plots indicate higher n availability under ssd fertigation the increased n availability is primarily due to lower leaching losses with more frequent application wu et al 2014 lv et al 2019 less volatilization losses due to sub surface application lamm and trooien 2003 engel et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 and less denitrification due to higher ammonium nh4 concentrations in the fertilized zone with localized application inhibiting nitrifying bacteria and nitrification gao et al 2019 ning et al 2019 root morphological plasticity differ in heterogenous soil fengqin et al 2018 root proliferates when it encounters nutrient rich zone meng et al 2012 to capture the nutrients effectively under ca and pca a frequent n application with 5 splits under ssd fertigated ca and pca plots ensured crop s stage wise n requirement whereas application of whole n dose in 3 split under ca and ct with flood irrigation failed to meet the stage specific n requirement also the reduced root activity further decreased the n uptake under ct plots patel and rajput 2000 zhou et al 2017 the vegetative stage n remobilization to grain was observed higher in the ssd fertigated ca and pca treatments which was mainly due to higher n accumulation in plant biomass till flowering higher n accumulation in vegetative parts increases n remobilization to grain in the late reproductive stage nayak et al 2022 according to pan et al 1986 a balanced contribution from reproductive stage n uptake and remobilized n from vegetative part contributes to a higher nue if crop n uptake is insufficient at the reproductive stage due to increased n demand n remobilization is accelerated triboi and triboi blondel 2002 the higher crop growth and grain filling rate under ca and pca plots increased the grain n demand which in turn increased the remobilization of n to grains we recorded comparatively lower stover n in residue retained plots which can be because of higher remobilization of n to grain under ca over pca nitrogen use efficiency nue is an important indicator often used to describe how effectively crop utilizes the n to support growth and photosynthesis we observed higher agronomic n use efficiency aen and apparent n recovery arn under ca and pca practices which further indicates higher n availability and lower n losses yolcu and cetin 2015 jat et al 2019 contrarily flooding or conventional furrow irrigation and broadcasting n fertilizer on the soil surface resulted in significant nitrogen losses in ct and ca plots lowering nue liu et al 2014 further the markedly higher maize grain yield and total n uptake under ssd fertigated ca and pca plots compared to furrow irrigated ca and ct resulted in significantly higher aen and arn respectively jat and sandhu et al 2019 2019 4 3 water use water productivity yield attributes and crop yield our study showed on average 54 irrigation water saving in maize under ssd irrigated ca and pca compared to fi ca and ct this saving was mainly due to reduction elimination of non beneficial water components viz evaporation deep percolation and seepage and surface runoff irmak et al 2016 umair et al 2019 ajaz et al 2020 frequent water application at a lower rate surface retention of crop residue improvement of water stable aggregates and improved soil physical and chemical properties are the causes that lead to improved crop growth and water productivity li et al 2021 patra et al 2021a raina et al 2013 similar to our findings chen et al 2015 sandhu et al 2019 and jat et al 2019 also reported reduction in irrigation water use and higher water productivity wp using ssd systems in cereal crops like maize and wheat etc the higher numerical wp value under ca versus pca was due to crop residue retention which may have contributed to soil moisture conservation by improving soil health reducing evaporation loss and thus lowering irrigation water requirement gathala et al 2013 irmak et al 2016 parihar et al 2016a the ssd fertigated ca practice recorded highest stover and grain yield followed by pca the 27 and 30 increase in grain yield under ca over ca and ct respectively was mainly the result of increased number of grains per cob and cob length in previous study patra et al 2021b reported a stronger correlation between cob length grains per cob with grain yield in ssd fertigated ca and pca plots than in conventionally fertilized furrow irrigated ca and ct plots the number of grains per cob increases as a result of proper grain filling which in turn is linked to better availability of nitrogen and moisture as well as reduced inter plant competition wu et al 2019 inter plant competition for water and nutrients may result in more barren grains per cob if water and nutrients become limiting sangoi 2001 in ca and ct irrigation at longer intervals resulted in higher degree of inter plant competition for available soil moisture and n singandhupe et al 2003 which may have increased the barren grains cob 1 and consequently decreased yield improving distribution of lai in cereal crops could be a desirable way to improve assimilation of photosynthates yin et al 2000 shiratsuchi et al 2006 jing et al 2007 our study showed enhanced lai and par interception in drip fertigated ca and pca plots over ca and ct our findings are consistent with those of amanullah et al 2010 amanullah and shah 2011 who observed an increase in mean leaf area leaf area per plant and light interception with increasing n rate and number of splits in maize further a higher root density under ssdf martinez hernandez et al 1991 led to greater uptake of moisture and nutrients thereby enhancing the conversion of solar radiation into photosynthates the improved grain and biomass yield under surface residue retention could also be explained by improved soil moisture and thermal regimes govaerts et al 2007 govaerts et al 2009 better soil physical and biochemical properties verhulst et al 2010 parihar et al 2016b parihar et al 2018b and improved nutrient availability and uptake nayak et al 2022 etc 4 4 economics the higher net return nr observed for subsurface drip fertigated ca and pca treatments was attributed to a combination of factors including increased crop yield reduced costs of land preparation seeding fertilizer application and irrigation the lower nr recorded under ca plots over pca was due to cost associated with retaining 25 of the previous wheat residues in the field in our study the pca and ca plots with 120 and 150 kg n ha 1 had a 21 7 and 40 6 higher nr respectively than the average nr of ca and ct plots with 120 kg n ha 1 a number of researchers reported higher nr in ssd fertigated ca with or without residue retention which is consistent with our findings for example jat et al 2019 reported that ssd in ca based mws provided 5 4 higher profitability over the conventional system flood irrigation similarly in a zt based rice wheat system sidhu et al 2019 reported 24 7 and 29 8 higher nr under ca ztrw residue ssd and pca ztrw no residue ssd system over flood irrigated conventional system ctrw no residue flooding in addition as in our case here the coc was calculated after deducting an 80 goi subsidy from the actual cost of a drip irrigation system 5 conclusions the study aimed to assess complementarity of two novel technological interventions viz ca and ssd on physiological behaviour as well as crop yield resource use efficiency and profitability of maize in water scarce igp of nw india the results indicated that the photosynthetic n use efficiency and water productivity were significantly improved at the key crop growth stages of maize under ca with ssd based plots ca pca the higher biomass and n accumulation till the end of vegetative stage provided a greater source strength for proper grain filling leading to improved maize yield furthermore ca with ssd based treatments resulted in more dense and greener leaves from flowering to maturity ensuring greater availability of photosynthates during the grain filling stage this coupled with vegetative stage remobilized biomass and nitrogen further enhanced maize yield the retention of crop residue acted as an add on to the benefits of ssd based improved water and n management helping to reduce unproductive n and moisture losses thus our study presents compelling evidence of the benefits of implementing the ca ssd technological intervention in maize cultivation including water conservation improving nitrogen use efficiency increased water productivity and crop yield these findings could serve as a strong backstop for popularization of ca technology in water scarce agroecology of igp greater efforts should be directed toward raising farmers awareness about the benefits of such promising technology for the cultivation of food grain as well as commercial crops like maize also it is crucial to acknowledge that achieving these benefits requires significant expertise and knowledge in ssd usage as well as a clear understanding of the associated costs and potential difficulties for farmers declaration of competing interest the

8957,the indo gangetic plains igp in north west nw india are facing a severe decline in ground water due to prevalent rice based cropping systems to combat this issue conservation agriculture ca with an alternative crop s such as maize is being promoted recently surface drip fertigation has also been evaluated as a viable option to address low nutrient use efficiency and water scarcity problems for cereals while the individual benefits of ca and sub surface drip ssd irrigation on water economy are well established information regarding their combined effect in cereal based systems is lacking therefore we conducted a two year field experiment in maize under an ongoing ca based maize wheat system to evaluate the complementarity of ca with ssd irrigation through two technological interventions ca residue retained ca ssd pca partial ca without residue ssd at different n rates 0 120 and 150 kg n ha 1 in comparison to traditional furrow irrigated fi ca and conventional tillage ct at 120 kg n ha 1 our results showed that ca had the highest grain yield 8 2 t ha 1 followed by pca 8 1 t ha 1 the grain yield under ca at 150 kg n ha 1 was 27 and 30 higher than ca and ct respectively even at the same n level 120 kg n ha 1 ca outperformed ca and ct by 16 and 18 respectively the physiological performance of maize also revealed that ca based plots with 120 kg n ha 1 had 12 and 3 higher photosynthesis rate at knee high and silking respectively compared to fi ca and ct overall compared to the fi ca and ct ssd based ca and pca saved 54 irrigation water and increased water productivity wp by more than twice similarly a greater number of split n application through fertigation in pca and ca increased agronomic nitrogen use efficiency nue and recover efficiency by 8 19 and 14 25 respectively net returns from pca and ca at 150 kg n ha 1 were significantly higher by us 491 and 456 respectively than the fi ca and ct treatments therefore ca coupled with ssd provided tangible benefits in terms of yield irrigation water saving wp nue and profitability efforts should be directed towards increasing farmers awareness of the benefits of such promising technology for the cultivating food grains and commercial crops such as maize concurrently government support and strict policies are required to enhance the system adaptability graphical abstract ga1 keywords

introduction the traditional rice wheat rw systems in india s indo gangetic plains igp are being criticised for its environmental and sustainability issues which includes declining factor productivity soil health deterioration residue burning and greenhouse gas emissions and deepening of groundwater levels jat et al 2019 bhatt et al 2021 the decline in the groundwater table has led the governments of punjab and haryana to declare certain areas as dark zones where rice cultivation is no longer considered sustainable the groundwater table in north western nw india declined 0 2 m yr 1 during 1973 2001 while during 2000 2006 it got hastened by fivefold 1 0 m yr 1 humphreys et al 2010 the deepening of ground water table demands installation of heavy power pump for lifting groundwater which increases the input energy use and cost of cultivation further if appropriate measures on prudent groundwater use are not implemented promptly the igp in nw india may face a severe water shortage which could lead to widespread socioeconomic stress alternative techniques to save water and increase irrigation water productivity comprise shifting to conservation agriculture ca practices no tillage and straw mulching cultivation on permanent raised beds pb soil matric potential based irrigation scheduling micro irrigation methods and diversification of rice with c4 crop like maize yadvinder singh et al 2014 majeed et al 2015 parihar et al 2016a patra et al 2021a there are numerous benefits associated with replacement of rice with maize in the existing rw cropping system towards improvement of soil health jat et al 2013 biomass accumulation radiation use efficiency patra et al 2021a system productivity devkota et al 2013 parihar et al 2016b choudhary et al 2018 diversification of rw with maize wheat mw system is a win win solution for achieving sustainable water use as the water productivity wp of maize is 8 22 times higher than rice gathala et al 2013 and maize requires 80 85 less water to produce one kg of grain than rice bouman 2009 for such reasons the area under maize cultivation in north west nw india has recently increased owing largely to favourable government policies that encourage maize cultivation to save irrigation water and electricity costs sharma et al 2015 however conventional till maize ct cultivation comprising of 6 7 tillage operations and flood irrigation results in high energy use unproductive loss of irrigation water and nitrogen n fertilizer sandhu et al 2019 mutuku et al 2020 patra et al 2021b and overall economic non profitability aryal et al 2015 in the recent time with emergence of water scarcity issue drip irrigation gained attention as an economically viable option for irrigating the field crops such as maize yolcu and cetin 2015 jat et al 2019 patra et al 2021a and wheat chen et al 2015 chouhan et al 2015 sidhu et al 2019 to increase the wp however because of field inconvenience like interference of drip laterals with tillage and harvesting implements and intercultural operations the field adoption of surface drip irrigation was very less sub surface drip overcomes these bottlenecks and improve farmers acceptance of drip irrigation in cereal based systems in contrast to surface drip irrigation the ssd system reduces evaporation losses from the soil surface allows water and nutrients to be delivered directly to the crop root zone resulting in efficient water and nutrient use reduction in weed emergence labour costs and facilitates seeding with ca based no tillage practices jat et al 2019 sidhu et al 2019 furthermore precise n fertigation in multiple splits through ssd may open a new avenue for redesigning n management protocol in ca based maize system with conventional broadcasting of n fertilizers in ca a larger amounts of n fertilizers remain on crop residues which encourages volatilization losses wan et al 2021 thus to increase the nue and water economy effective n placement along with water at the active crop root zone via ssd in residue retained ca based maize systems could be beneficials while numerous studies have examined the individual benefits of ca and ssd in terms of water and nitrogen savings there is a lack of comprehensive research exploring complementarity of ca and ssd can work together to impact crop physiological responses crop productivity water productivity wp and nitrogen use efficiency nue in cereals such as maize in light of existing knowledge gaps a 2 year study was conducted with the objectives of i assessing the effect of bundling of ca with ssd ca at different n doses on physiological performance of maize and ii estimating the yield benefits irrigation water savings water and n use efficiency and farm profitability of maize under mw system in different combinations of tillage nitrogen irrigation and residue management it was hypothesized that coupling of ca with ssd would improve crop physiological responses and thus water and n use efficiency over furrow irrigated ca and ct plots 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and climate a two year field experiment 2018 and 2019 was conducted under an ongoing ca based maize wheat mw system initiated since 5 years in kharif 2014 at the fixed site with same set of technological interventions at the borlaug institute for south asia bisa cimmyt 30 99 n 75 44 e 229 m above the sea level punjab india the climate is semi arid and sub tropical with three well defined seasons i e hot and dry summer season march june wet monsoon season late june mid september dry winter season october february the experimental site has an alluvial origin flat and well drained sandy loam soil typic haplustept which was fairly uniform to a depth of 120 cm the ph 1 2 soil water ratio and ec are 7 9 8 5 and 0 58 ds m 1 respectively 2 2 climatic data during experimentation the annual average rainfall is 734 mm with approximately 75 80 falling between july and october the rainfall maximum temperature tmax and minimum temperature tmin were measured daily using a davis weather station davis vantage pro 2 weather station installed at the experimental site 2 3 experimental design and treatments in this study we evaluated the effect of two sub surface drip ssd based ca practices i e pca and ca at three nitrogen rates including one control n0 0 n120 120 and n150 150 kg n ha 1 in comparison to furrow irrigated ca and ct with 120 kg n ha 1 n120 across two cropping seasons 2018 and 2019 the three treatments under pca were comprised of residue removed permanent bed pb ssd irrigation without n n0 pca 120 kg n ha 1 n120 pca and 150 kg n ha 1 n150 pca similarly the three treatments under ca were residue retained wr pb ssd without n n0 ca 120 kg n ha 1 n120 ca and 150 kg n ha 1 n150 ca the rest treatments were furrow irrigated fi ca n120 ca and ct n120 ct the details of treatments adopted in this study are given in table 1 the experiment was laid out in a randomized complete block design rcbd with three replications the area of each experimental unit plot was 80 8 m2 2 4 sub surface drip irrigation system and irrigation management the sub surface drip laterals having 16 mm inner diameter were installed at 20 cm soil depth by using two row tractor operated drip laying machine with depth control mechanism developed by bisa cimmyt ludhiana punjab india sidhu et al 2019 the lateral depth of ssd was chosen based on the result of preliminary exploratory study on evaluation of different depths for laying laterals in mw system on pbs in the adjacent plot of the experimental field data not reported this study found that maize yield was similar at 15 and 20 cm lateral depths but decreased significantly at 25 cm depth however 20 cm of lateral depth was deemed ideal for maize on pb in order to facilitate long term tillage operations the laterals used in this study had line sourced emitters spaced at 30 cm apart with a capacity of 2 0 l h 1 at a pressure of 135 kpa for the entire wetting of a plot area 81 m2 the laterals are 67 5 cm apart compatible with bed width and placed at 20 cm depth in the center of each bed so each lateral served one row of maize fig 1 the drip system was fitted with hydro cyclone filter and screen filter 100 micron mesh size for filtration of groundwater venturi injectors were used for fertigation in sub surface drip ssd plots and the required suction was developed by upstream and downstream pressure difference in ssd plots irrigation was scheduled based on soil matric potential using tensiometers monitored with a soilspec vacuum gauge installed at 20 cm depth in between two rows at the center of each plot tensiometers installed as per gupta et al 2016 were regularly read each morning between 9 00 10 00 a m the maize crop under ssd plots were irrigated when soil moisture potential smp decreased to 50 1 kpa till the crop reached physiological maturity the ssd plots received 9 and 14 irrigations each of 10 mm in 2018 and 2019 respectively which amounted to 90 and 140 mm of irrigation water in total sidhu et al 2019 can be refereed for further details about the ssd system in traditional furrow irrigated plots a total of 200 and 300 mm water each of 50 mm was applied based on critical crop growth stage based scheduling approach irrigation was avoided when sufficient rainfall occurred at any critical crop growth stage due to the comparatively good and evenly distributed rainfall during the 2018 cropping period a total of four irrigations were applied at the 6 leaf knee high 50 silking and dough stage in contrast the 2019 period received 33 less rainfall than the previous season necessitating the use of 6 irrigations one irrigation was given at 5 das and the other five were scheduled at 6 leaf late knee high tasseling 50 silking and dough stages respectively the volume of water applied for each irrigation was measured with the help of water meter dasmesh mechanical works punjab india fitted to the delivery pipe close to the experimental plots 2 5 crop management after installation of subsurface drip lines beds pb were formed in kharif 2014 using a 4 wheel drive tractor operated bed planter the same beds were kept undisturbed and maintained as permanent beds pb during succeeding crop seasons the mid furrow to mid furrow widths of the beds were 67 5 cm while the flat tops width and furrow depths were 37 and 15 cm respectively fig 1 permanent beds were reshaped once a year and crop were sown using multi crop bed planter on top of the raised bed a row of maize hybrid p3396 was planted with plant to plant spacing of 20 cm in the ca and ct plots maize was shown by double disc planter fitted with an inclined plate seed metering mechanism maize hybrid was sown at a seed rate of 20 kg ha 1 in all treatments on june 15 and june 20 2018 and 2019 respectively on the ca and ca plots approximately 25 of the residues from the preceding crops were retained whereas all residues were removed in the pca and ct plots a basal dose of 23 5 kg n 60 kg p2o5 as dap was drilled along with seed at sowing to all the plots except control or n0 plots where ssp was used instead of dap in addition to p2o5 each plot received a dose of 30 kg k2o as mop at the time of sowing in drip irrigated treatments the rest amount of n i e 96 5 and 126 5 kg n were applied as urea through irrigation fertigation at 15 day interval in 4 equal split starting at 21 days after sowing das the remaining 96 5 kg n for ca and ct was top dressed in two equal splits at knee high and pre tasselling stage of maize 2 6 measured and calculated parameters 2 6 1 fractional intercepted photosynthetic active radiation photosynthetically active radiation par

conditions photosynthetically active radiation was set as 1200 μmol m 2 s 1 at the knee high stage five plants from each plot were chosen at random and one fully expanded youngest leaf from each individual was measured the same plants were then tagged separately for subsequent measurement at the silking stage during the silking stage readings were taken from the cob leaf immature cob of each plant that had previously been tagged the measurements were taken between 11 00 am to 11 30 am the ambient co2 level was 380 ppm and the air temperature was 35 c the leaves were enclosed in the chamber and the net exchange of co2 between leaf and the atmosphere was computed the pn and tn were calculated by the infrared gas analyzer s irga s inbuilt microcomputer using this rate of change and other factors such as the leaf area enclosed the volume of enclosure and the temperature anand et al 2007 pandey et al 2017 2 6 6 specific leaf nitrogen photosynthetic nitrogen and water use efficiency following the photosynthetic measurements the area of each leaf was measured using the same portable leaf area meter the leaves were then excised and fresh mass were also recorded finally the leaves were sliced and representative samples were dried to a constant mass to estimate dry mass and n content the leaf n content was determined using the chns elemental analyser euro ea elemental

girth cm the number of grains per row and cob and 100 grains weight were estimated using standard protocol as described in parihar et al 2018a for recording crop yield two border rows from both the border directions along the row and 0 5 m in perpendicular direction across the row length wise were excluded to harvest the net plot area all cobs from each net plot were sun dried and threshed after separating the stover and removing the husk and silk the final grain yield was adjusted at 14 5 moisture and was expressed in t ha 1 the maize stover was cut from ground level and weighed after sun drying thus the weight of total harvested produce cob stover from the net plot was recorded and expressed as biological yield t ha 1 the protein content of the maize crop was determined by multiplying the estimated nitrogen content by the standard factor of 6 25 as recommended by fao 2003 merrill and watt 1973 the protein yield was then calculated by multiplying the grain yield by the protein

government of india on the actual cost us 3477 90 ha 1 the annual depreciation was calculated using the straight line depreciation method after considering a salvage value of 10 and 15 years useful life span of the ssd system sidhu et al 2019 as a result the final cost incurred for ssd installation for a single crop in the mw system came to us 20 87 across the study years 2018 and 2019 gross returns gr and net returns nr were calculated on the basis of inputs used and outputs obtained considering the incurred variable cost the cost of human labor was calculated considering the eight hour person day as defined by indian labor law in addition the amount of machinery time hours per hectare required to perform a specific on farm operation was calculated the total cost of all on farm operations was calculated by adding the cost time diesel and electricity used to complete each operation summing the input costs yielded the total variable cost tvc the gross returns gr included income from the sale of grain and stover of maize the gr was calculated by using market minimum support price msp for maize grain the tvc including annual depreciation cost us 20 87 was subtracted

nbcr 3 04 among ssd fertigated treatments was recorded under n120 ca treatment which was 21 higher than furrow irrigated n120 ca and n120 ct s nbcr table 8 4 discussion 4 1 leaf area index fractional intercepted photosynthetically active radiation and photosynthetic behaviour a higher n application in a greater number of splits with drip irrigation improved the lai under ca based treatments alike to our finding amanullah et al 2010 reported a positive correlation of n rate and split with lai and light interception further retention of crop residue improved the lai and fipar under ca based plot as it increased the nutrient and water availability sandhu et al 2019 nayak et al 2022 similarly other studies by sampathkumar and pandian 2012 qin et al 2016 and irmak et al 2022 have also reported a larger lai increment under drip irrigation since lai and leaf area duration lad have a direct impact on the interception of incoming par the larger fipar was observed in the ssd treatment with a lai of 6 7 which is considered optimal for intercepting the maximum incoming radiation flux chanh et al 1993 guo et al 2012 the knee high stage rate of photosynthesis pn was observed higher in the n fertigated ssd plots which was mainly due to early application of 1st n split 24 and 32 kg n at 21 das in ca pca based plots on contrary the lesser pn under ca and ct at knee high stage 34 das was mainly due to late application of 1st n split 48 kg n the early n top dressing at 21 das in ssd treatments boosted early season crop growth and biomass accumulation at knee high stage in addition a frequent n and water application based on soil moisture potential smp have been shown to enhance the n and moisture availability in the root zone eltarabily et al 2019 bronson et al 2019 resulting in increased pn and transpiration rate tn at knee high and silking under ssd fertigated ca and pca plots a high regulated soil moisture levels with minimal variation can help reduce crop stress and improve both pn and tn ultimately leading to an increase in crop yield patra et al 2021a on the other hand with surface irrigation under ca and ct the soil moisture and n content deplete to suboptimal level to reduce pn and tn shen et al 2020 umair et al 2019 a suboptimal moisture can lead to closure of stomata which in turn can negatively affects pn kumar et al 2011 grassi and magnani 2005 ripley et al 2007 moreover keeping crop residue for a medium term together with ssd creates favourable soil environment that enhances crop growth habbib et al 2020 parihar et al 2016b which leads to an increase in pnue and photosynthetic water use efficiency pwue the similar value of pnue between control and n fertigated plots at knee high stage was due to less pn and lesser specific leaf nitrogen sln under control resulting in a ratio similar to the fertigated plots however the improvement in pnue under all n fertigated ca and pca plots over ca and ct is mainly because of higher rate photosynthesis the 22 lower knee high pnue under ct compared to ca plots is mainly due to 1 2 times lower sln denominator in ca 4 2 nitrogen uptake specific leaf nitrogen remobilization and nitrogen use efficiency during early stages of development plants grew predominantly in isolated form with minor competition for light under such condition plant n concentration does not vary significantly with leaf area increment lemaire et al 2007 qiang et al 2019 this might be the reason behind statistically similar sln at knee high under all n fertilized treatments however as sln is the leaf n content per unit leaf area we may find the source of difference in sln by inspecting the numerical differences between treatments in leaf n content g and leaf area m2 the amplitude of specific leaf area increase was bigger than leaf n content in all n applied ca treatments at both knee high stage and silking resulting in a slightly lower sln under ca compared to pca treatments poorter and evans 1998 habbib et al 2020 in another way the greater crop growth of ca caused more dilution of leaf n per unit leaf area the same dilution effect resulted in lower sln in ca plots compared to ct plots a higher n uptake under ca and pca based plots indicate higher n availability under ssd fertigation the increased n availability is primarily due to lower leaching losses with more frequent application wu et al 2014 lv et al 2019 less volatilization losses due to sub surface application lamm and trooien 2003 engel et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 and less denitrification due to higher ammonium nh4 concentrations in the fertilized zone with localized application inhibiting nitrifying bacteria and nitrification gao et al 2019 ning et al 2019 root morphological plasticity differ in heterogenous soil fengqin et al 2018 root proliferates when it encounters nutrient rich zone meng et al 2012 to capture the nutrients effectively under ca and pca a frequent n application with 5 splits under ssd fertigated ca and pca plots ensured crop s stage wise n requirement whereas application of whole n dose in 3 split under ca and ct with flood irrigation failed to meet the stage specific n requirement also the reduced root activity further decreased the n uptake under ct plots patel and rajput 2000 zhou et al 2017 the vegetative stage n remobilization to grain was observed higher in the ssd fertigated ca and pca treatments which was mainly due to higher n accumulation in plant biomass till flowering higher n accumulation in vegetative parts increases n remobilization to grain in the late reproductive stage nayak et al 2022 according to pan et al 1986 a balanced contribution from reproductive stage n uptake and remobilized n from vegetative part contributes to a higher nue if crop n uptake is insufficient at the reproductive stage due to increased n demand n remobilization is accelerated triboi and triboi blondel 2002 the higher crop growth and grain filling rate under ca and pca plots increased the grain n demand which in turn increased the remobilization of n to grains we recorded comparatively lower stover n in residue retained plots which can be because of higher remobilization of n to grain under ca over pca nitrogen use efficiency nue is an important indicator often used to describe how effectively crop utilizes the n to support growth and photosynthesis we observed higher agronomic n use efficiency aen and apparent n recovery arn under ca and pca practices which further indicates higher n availability and lower n losses yolcu and cetin 2015 jat et al 2019 contrarily flooding or conventional furrow irrigation and broadcasting n fertilizer on the soil surface resulted in significant nitrogen losses in ct and ca plots lowering nue liu et al 2014 further the markedly higher maize grain yield and total n uptake under ssd fertigated ca and pca plots compared to furrow irrigated ca and ct resulted in significantly higher aen and arn respectively jat and sandhu et al 2019 2019 4 3 water use water productivity yield attributes and crop yield our study showed on average 54 irrigation water saving in maize under ssd irrigated ca and pca compared to fi ca and ct this saving was mainly due to reduction elimination of non beneficial water components viz evaporation deep percolation and seepage and surface runoff irmak et al 2016 umair et al 2019 ajaz et al 2020 frequent water application at a lower rate surface retention of crop residue improvement of water stable aggregates and improved soil physical and chemical properties are the causes that lead to improved crop growth and water productivity li et al 2021 patra et al 2021a raina et al 2013 similar to our findings chen et al 2015 sandhu et al 2019 and jat et al 2019 also reported reduction in irrigation water use and higher water productivity wp using ssd systems in cereal crops like maize and wheat etc the higher numerical wp value under ca versus pca was due to crop residue retention which may have contributed to soil moisture conservation by improving soil health reducing evaporation loss and thus lowering irrigation water requirement gathala et al 2013 irmak et al 2016 parihar et al 2016a the ssd fertigated ca practice recorded highest stover and grain yield followed by pca the 27 and 30 increase in grain yield under ca over ca and ct respectively was mainly the result of increased number of grains per cob and cob length in previous study patra et al 2021b reported a stronger correlation between cob length grains per cob with grain yield in ssd fertigated ca and pca plots than in conventionally fertilized furrow irrigated ca and ct plots the number of grains per cob increases as a result of proper grain filling which in turn is linked to better availability of nitrogen and moisture as well as reduced inter plant competition wu et al 2019 inter plant competition for water and nutrients may result in more barren grains per cob if water and nutrients become limiting sangoi 2001 in ca and ct irrigation at longer intervals resulted in higher degree of inter plant competition for available soil moisture and n singandhupe et al 2003 which may have increased the barren grains cob 1 and consequently decreased yield improving distribution of lai in cereal crops could be a desirable way to improve assimilation of photosynthates yin et al 2000 shiratsuchi et al 2006 jing et al 2007 our study showed enhanced lai and par interception in drip fertigated ca and pca plots over ca and ct our findings are consistent with those of amanullah et al 2010 amanullah and shah 2011 who observed an increase in mean leaf area leaf area per plant and light interception with increasing n rate and number of splits in maize further a higher root density under ssdf martinez hernandez et al 1991 led to greater uptake of moisture and nutrients thereby enhancing the conversion of solar radiation into photosynthates the improved grain and biomass yield under surface residue retention could also be explained by improved soil moisture and thermal regimes govaerts et al 2007 govaerts et al 2009 better soil physical and biochemical properties verhulst et al 2010 parihar et al 2016b parihar et al 2018b and improved nutrient availability and uptake nayak et al 2022 etc 4 4 economics the higher net return nr observed for subsurface drip fertigated ca and pca treatments was attributed to a combination of factors including increased crop yield reduced costs of land preparation seeding fertilizer application and irrigation the lower nr recorded under ca plots over pca was due to cost associated with retaining 25 of the previous wheat residues in the field in our study the pca and ca plots with 120 and 150 kg n ha 1 had a 21 7 and 40 6 higher nr respectively than the average nr of ca and ct plots with 120 kg n ha 1 a number of researchers reported higher nr in ssd fertigated ca with or without residue retention which is consistent with our findings for example jat et al 2019 reported that ssd in ca based mws provided 5 4 higher profitability over the conventional system flood irrigation similarly in a zt based rice wheat system sidhu et al 2019 reported 24 7 and 29 8 higher nr under ca ztrw residue ssd and pca ztrw no residue ssd system over flood irrigated conventional system ctrw no residue flooding in addition as in our case here the coc was calculated after deducting an 80 goi subsidy from the actual cost of a drip irrigation system 5 conclusions the study aimed to assess complementarity of two novel technological interventions viz ca and ssd on physiological behaviour as well as crop yield resource use efficiency and profitability of maize in water scarce igp of nw india the results indicated that the photosynthetic n use efficiency and water productivity were significantly improved at the key crop growth stages of maize under ca with ssd based plots ca pca the higher biomass and n accumulation till the end of vegetative stage provided a greater source strength for proper grain filling leading to improved maize yield furthermore ca with ssd based treatments resulted in more dense and greener leaves from flowering to maturity ensuring greater availability of photosynthates during the grain filling stage this coupled with vegetative stage remobilized biomass and nitrogen further enhanced maize yield the retention of crop residue acted as an add on to the benefits of ssd based improved water and n management helping to reduce unproductive n and moisture losses thus our study presents compelling evidence of the benefits of implementing the ca ssd technological intervention in maize cultivation including water conservation improving nitrogen use efficiency increased water productivity and crop yield these findings could serve as a strong backstop for popularization of ca technology in water scarce agroecology of igp greater efforts should be directed toward raising farmers awareness about the benefits of such promising technology for the cultivation of food grain as well as commercial crops like maize also it is crucial to acknowledge that achieving these benefits requires significant expertise and knowledge in ssd usage as well as a clear understanding of the associated costs and potential difficulties for farmers declaration of competing interest the

8958,irrigation management has become a critical concern in the face of increasing water scarcity and food demand particularly in the arid and semi arid regions of the world however the effects of climate and soil texture on irrigation schedules remain unclear in the present study a two year trial 2019 2020 was conducted in three greenhouses with different climates and soil textures under drip irrigation the irrigation schedules were based on the cumulative evaporation ce of a 20 cm pan three treatments with different amounts of irrigation i were set in 2019 three irrigation frequencies if in combination with three irrigation amounts were set in 2020 a numerical model hydrus 2d was applied to simulate the soil water balance of greenhouse tomatoes tomato yield and irrigation water use efficiency iwue were measured and the responses of photosynthetic indices to soil water availability swa were quantified the results indicated that the soil water content swc simulated by hydrus 2d was in accordance with the observed data with average root mean square error rmse mean bias error mbe and index agreement ia reaching 0 0127 cm3 cm 3 0 0010 cm3 cm 3 and 0 9275 respectively among the four photosynthetic indices the normalized photosynthetic rate exhibited the highest degree of fit r2 0 9678 with swa 0 20 cm increased irrigation frequency high if reduced the deep drainage by 24 6 10 5 and 3 0 in sandy loam loam and silty clay soils respectively it was concluded that frequent irrigation with low amount can be applied to sandy loamy soil whereas a lower irrigation frequency and larger single irrigation amount are recommended for silty clay soil our study provides theoretical support for irrigation management in semiarid regions with similar climates and soil textures

especially in arid regions has become the dominant limiting factor for sustainable agricultural development trenberth et al 2014 yang et al 2020 tomato is a vegetable crop planted worldwide across china the tomato cultivation area has reached 1 11 million hectares with an annual production of 64 87 million tons ranking first in the world faostat 2020 greenhouse tomato production is challenging owing to a shortage of water resources in northwest china yang et al 2017 zheng et al 2013 improving the irrigation management is an effective method to alleviate this problem abbaszadeh et al 2020 yuan et al 2021 drip irrigation is an efficient and water saving irrigation method widely used in greenhouse tomato production shu et al 2020 wu et al 2022 however differences in the environment and soil textures in greenhouses pose many challenges to the design of drip irrigation systems such as the setting of irrigation amount and frequency modeling the water balance in soil plant atmosphere continuum spac systems is helpful for improving irrigation management boanares et al 2020 li and wang 2021 water transport in spac is co regulated by the demand from the atmosphere and the supply from the soil sperry et al 2016 sperry and love 2015 thus directly affecting the soil water balance the reference evapotranspiration et 0 computed by the fao56 penman monteith equation has been used to determine the amount of irrigation required for crop production which is mainly affected by meteorological factors allen et al 1998 pereira et al 2015 wetting patterns in soils with various textures differ after irrigation events karimi et al 2022 2020 lecaros arellano et al 2021 affecting plant root morphology and root water uptake rwu activity ahmad and li 2021 nazari et al 2021 soil hydraulic characteristics such as hydraulic conductivity and soil water retention curves affect the soil water movement and water transport from the soil to the atmosphere cai et al 2021 vereecken et al 2022 considering the influence of soil textures on water saving irrigation scheduling existing evidence demonstrated that higher irrigation frequency and smaller irrigation amount could be applied to soils with sandy textures to reduce deep drainage which is not possible in silty soil du et al 2017 yi et al 2022 because sandy soil has higher hydraulic conductivity and lower field capacity than those of loamy soil however the effects of climate and soil texture on the soil water balance and irrigation schedules are not yet completely understood the development of effective irrigation strategies requires not only an understanding of the soil water balance but also knowledge on the response of plants to soil water availability swa plants undergo a series of physiological changes in response to different swa baker et al 2007 hura et al 2007 yan et al 2016 among plant physiological parameters photosynthetic indices i e net photosynthesis rate transpiration rate stomatal conductance and intercellular co2 concentration are regarded as the essential indicators of plant growth because of their close correlation to yield and water use efficiency huang et al 2020 piao et al 2008 yan et al 2017b analyzed the relationship between the physiological indices of four typical vegetation types and swa on the loess plateau and found that the normalized photosynthetic rate was the optimal index reflecting the physiological status of plants similarly extensive research has been conducted to clarify the feedback mechanisms of photosynthetic characteristics to swa in large scale vegetation systems sadras and milroy 1996 wu et al 2011a b thus quantifying the relationship between swa and plant photosynthetic indices would be useful for determining the right plant water management strategies soltani et al 2000 xia et al 2015 because of the complexity of field measurements and high cost of equipment the use of models for simulating the soil water content e g swap swat and hydrus has become a mainstream method jamei et al 2022 shiri et al 2020 šimůnek et al 2008 siyal et al 2009 hydrus 2d has been widely applied in drip irrigation since skaggs et al 2004 successfully used this model to compare experimental observations with drip irrigation simulations under different irrigation amounts and durations compared with other models hydrus 2d performed better in simulating the water balance in two dimensional and variably saturated soil owing to its ability to handle soil heterogeneity advanced numerical methods and extensive validation patra et al 2021 šimůnek et al 2016 solat et al 2021 therefore in the present study hydrus 2d was used as a robust tool to simulate the soil water dynamics three typical sites representing the soil characteristics and climate in shaanxi province northwest china were selected for this study detailed information is shown in table s1 the objectives of this study were to ⅰ model the soil water balance process and evaluate the validity of the simulation ⅱ quantify the response of tomato photosynthetic indices to soil water availability and ⅲ evaluate the irrigation schedules of greenhouse tomato under drip irrigation considering the three different soil textures 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental sites the trials were conducted in greenhouses at three sites in shaanxi province northwest china the experimental station of the academy of agricultural sciences in yuling northwest a f university in yangling and the academy of agricultural sciences in hanzhong fig 1 the greenhouses at each experimental site were of the same size measuring 85 m in length 17 m in width and 4 m in height the physical characteristics of the soil used in the experiments are listed in table 1 the pressure plate method ankeny 1992 and retc software van genuchten et al 1991 were used to determine the hydraulic properties of the three test soils soil water retention curves and soil hydraulic conductivity curves fig 2 during the experimental period a standard automatic weather station in the middle of the greenhouse was used to collect and calculate daily meteorological data including solar radiation r n and vapor pressure

tomato seedlings solanum lycopersicum l cv jinpeng were transplanted to a greenhouse at the fifth leaf stage to ensure plant survival each plot was irrigated with 20 mm of water after transplantation three replicates were randomly assigned to each treatment in the greenhouses the planting pattern fig 4a for the experiments consisted of two drip lines and two rows of tomatoes each plot size was 6 m 1 2 m with 40 seedlings planted in two rows spaced 50 cm apart the drippers along each drip line were placed 30 cm apart and the discharge rate for each dripper was 1 8 l h the plots were separated to a depth of 60 cm using a plastic film to prevent water movement between them a water meter was placed in each plot to record the amount of irrigation trials were conducted during the spring summer season of 2019 and 2020 march to july and were arranged in the same greenhouse in 2019 three treatments using different irrigation levels were assigned low irrigation w1 0 5 cumulative evaporation ce medium irrigation w2 0 7 ce and high irrigation w3 0 9 ce the occurrence of irrigation events was based on the evaporation amount of a 20 cm pan when the ce reaches 20 2 mm in 2020 three irrigation frequencies were added based on the 2019 experiment the irrigation frequency was determined based on the cumulative pan evaporation the plants were irrigated when the cumulative evaporation reached 20 2 mm f1 low frequency 15 2 mm f2 medium frequency and 10 2 mm f3 high frequency each frequency was associated with three irrigation amounts 0 5 0 7 and 0 9 ce for a total of nine treatments fig 4b referring to previous research on the irrigation schedule of a 20 cm evaporating pan ertek et al 2006 sezen et al 2019 and the water demand characteristics of tomatoes in each growth period allen et al 1998 the actual irrigation amount in different growth stages should be multiplied by a coefficient which is 0 6 1 15 and 0 8 at the initial middle and late stages of tomato growth the irrigation events in 2019 and 2020 are shown in figs s1 and s2 respectively 2 3 measurements and calculation 2 3 1 soil water content tdr time domain reflectometry tube probes trime iph imko germany were used to measure the soil water content swc and were calibrated according to the method described by yi et al 2014 the tdr tubes were placed below the tomato plant p1 between the tomato plant p2 and in the middle of the bare section p3 fig 4c previous studies indicated that most of tomato roots were distributed within 0 40 cm of the top soil layer under drip irrigation machado and oliveira 2005

relationship between soil water availability and photosynthetic indices existing evidence demonstrated that a logistic equation can effectively describe the response of photosynthetic indices to changes in swa lacape et al 1998 wu et al 2011a b the logistic equation used was as follows 10 y a 1 a 2 1 x swa a 3 a 4 a 2 where y is the normalized photosynthetic index x swa is the soil water

as shown in fig 4d the left and right boundaries were set to zero flux because the deep groundwater table was far below the simulation area the bottom boundary was set as free drainage two half circles with a diameter of 1 cm on the top boundary represented the emitter which were set as variable fluxes i e flux1 and flux2 the other areas on the top boundary were set as atmospheric boundaries during irrigation the flux of the drip emitters is described in hydrus 2d as follows 23 q q l 2 π r where q is the input water flux of an individual emitter cm day q is the emitter flow rate 1 8 l h r is the radius of the drip emitter 0 5 cm and l is the spacing between the drip emitters 30 cm when the irrigation events ended the variable flux boundary became a no flux condition the duration of the variable flux was determined by the amount of irrigation applied 2 4 5 calibration and validation this numerical simulation used one day as the time unit and was run throughout the course of the 2 year experiment the soil hydraulic parameters were calibrated using w1 data and the data from w2 and w3 were used to validate the model and optimize the parameters in 2019 the calibrated and optimized

the three test greenhouses fig 3 shows the variation in the daily average net radiation rn vapor pressure deficit vpd and pan evaporation pe over the entire tomato growth period in 2019 and 2020 as shown in figs 3 and s4 the daily pe and vpd increased with the increase in daily average rn compared with that in the other two sites the total pan evaporation in yulin reached the maximum in 2019 350 7 mm and 2020 377 8 mm with reference to fig 3 the columns in fig s3 show the frequency distribution of environmental data the intervals in the largest frequency distribution and normal distribution curve revealed spatial variations in rn and vpd for example the average rn values in the three test greenhouses decreased in the order of yuling yangling hanzhong the fractions of sand silt and clay determine the soil texture which influences the physical and hydraulic properties of the soil profile table 1 and fig 2 the hydraulic conductivity curves indicated that the water retaining property of silty clay was the best among the three test soils fig 2 moreover the lowest fc value in sandy loam 0 2731 cm3 cm3 caused the surface soil water to evaporate more easily the soil hydraulic parameters listed in table 2 provide detailed information on the water distribution in the soil after irrigation 3 2 calibration and validation of the hydrus 2d model in 2019 fig 5 shows the coefficient of determination r2 between the simulated and measured swc at three positions p1 p2 and p3 good agreement was observed between the simulated and measured values r2 0 8 at all depths as shown in fig 5 the values of r2 for p1 p2 and p3 in the sandy loam loam and silty clay soils were 0 8573 0 8899 0 8275 0 8369 0 9217 0 8775 and 0 9176 0 9476 0 9105 respectively the statistical indicators rmse mbe and ia used to compare the simulated and observed swc values at p1 below the plant for the three soil textures are shown in fig 6 as shown in the figure the rmse mbe ia value at 10 20 40 and 60 cm soil depth ranged between 0 0129 cm3 cm 3 0 0048 cm3 cm 3 0 9405 and 0 0152 cm3 cm 3 0 0045 cm3 cm 3 0 9848 between 0 0118 cm3 cm 3 0 0039 cm3 cm 3 0 8574 and 0 0154 cm3 cm 3 0 0028 cm3 cm 3 0 9704 between

rmse mbe ia value for the sandy loam loam and silty clay at all depths was 0 0109 cm3 cm 3 0 0003 cm3 cm 3 0 9238 0 0104 cm3 cm 3 0 0013 cm3 cm 3 0 9244 and 0 0168 cm3 cm 3 0 0012 cm3 cm 3 0 9342 respectively during the entire growing season swc fluctuated depending on the irrigation events which differed depending on soil depth irrigation amount and soil texture after the irrigation events the swc increment in the surface soil 10 and 20 cm was greater than that in the deep soil 40 and 60 cm furthermore the fluctuation range of swc at the same depth was determined by the amount of irrigation and soil texture and a wide fluctuation range was recorded mainly in the w3 treatment and in silt clay soil 3 3 simulation of soil water dynamics in 2020 fig 7 shows the simulated changes in swc in different soil layers during the entire growing period for all treatments at the three positions p1 p2 and p3 differences were observed at the three positions in the top soil layer 10 cm and these differences gradually decreased with increasing depth especially at 60 cm soil depth notably the differences were greater in the silty clay soil than in the other two soil textures at 10 and 20 cm soil depths the swc at the three positions in each treatment increased in the following order p3 p2 p1 under high irrigation levels the swc at p2 40 and 60 cm was slightly higher than that at p1 in addition smaller differences in swc between p3 p1 and p2 were observed when the irrigation frequency increased the peak value of swc was observed at p1 10 cm on the day of the irrigation event and this value was greater than that of fc during a certain period in f1w3 and f2w3 in sandy loam soil 3 4 relationship between simulated soil water availability and normalized photosynthetic indices fig 8 depicts the simulated changes in soil water availability swa at the 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm soil layers throughout the tomato growing period the fluctuation in swa was determined by irrigation events and was consistent with the changes in swc in particular fluctuations were considerably more difficult to observe in the 40 60 cm soil layer than in the other soil layers furthermore increasing the irrigation frequency with the same irrigation amount can maintain the swa within a smaller range over a long period in 2020 the range of swa was 0 24 0 96 sandy loam 0 19 0 93 loam and 0 17 0 94 silty clay in the 0 20 cm soil layer 0 40 0 89 sandy loam 0 32 0 90 loam and 0 27 0 71 silty clay in the 20 40 cm soil layer and 0 34 0 79 sandy loam 0 26 0 82 loam and 0 12 0 54 silty clay in the 40 60 cm soil layer for all treatments fig 9 shows the parameters of the logistic equation for different soil depths and the four photosynthetic indices the swa was significantly correlated with the normalized values of the photosynthetic indices p 0 01 as shown in fig 9 the coefﬁcients of determination r2 reached 0 8321 0 9678 in the 0 20 cm soil layer but decreased to 0 7130 0 7521 in the 20 40 cm soil layer these values decreased even more dramatically below 40 cm depth 0 1362 0 2351 among the four photosynthetic indices the normalized photosynthetic rate exhibited the highest fitting degree with swa 0 20 cm reaching 0 9678 3 5 comparison of soil water balance components the water balance components of the simulation for all treatments including the irrigation amount i mm root water uptake rwu mm deep drainage d mm evaporation e mm and change in storage s mm are presented in table 3 the amount of irrigation was closely related to environmental factors in the greenhouse fig s4 and significant differences in the amount of irrigation were observed among the three greenhouses moreover compared with irrigation frequency the amount of irrigation can significantly affect these components a slight reduction in rwu was observed with increasing irrigation frequency water loss in the simulation process was represented by negative soil water storage as shown in table 3 a higher amount of stored water was lost in silty clay soil than in the other soil textures in addition increasing irrigation frequency decreased the deep leakage while contributing to higher evaporation for example in sandy soil the deep drainage of f3w3 was 19 7 lower and the evaporation was 25 8 higher than those of f1w3 this phenomenon was also observed in loamy and silty clay soils 3 6 tomato yield and irrigation water use efficiency fig 10 shows the tomato yield and iwue for all treatments in 2019 and 2020 the tomato yield increased with the increase in irrigation amount except for f1w3 in the sandy loam soil in 2020 the highest yield in the three soil textures was 127 6 t hm2 sandy loam f3w3 125 1 t hm2 loam f2w3 and 123 1 t hm2 silty clay f1w3 increasing the irrigation frequency led to a slight reduction in plant yield when medium or low irrigation amounts were used for example in sandy loam soil the yields of f2w1 and f3w1 decreased by 8 3 and 15 1 respectively compared to that of f1w1 the highest iwue values were observed in w2 and f1w2 in 2019 and 2020 respectively compared with the irrigation amounts of w1 and w3 over the two years w2 increased the average iwue by 7 4 and 17 1 in 2019 and 7 2 and 9 6 in 2020 respectively the average iwue in 2019 2020 in the three soil textures was 37 3 kg m3 35 2 kg m3 38 5 kg m3 37 5 kg m3 and 40 3 kg m3 41 6 kg m3 4 discussion 4 1 feasibility of simulating soil water dynamics using the hydrus 2d model irrigation is the only way for supplementing soil water to greenhouse tomatoes liu et al 2019 indicating the necessity to monitor and simulate soil water dynamics in greenhouses in the present study hydrus 2d was used to simulate two dimensional swc dynamics in soils with different textures and under different irrigation scheduling conditions and its accuracy and reliability were evaluated using field data figs 5 and 6 the simulation covered the entire tomato growth period march july 2019 and 2020 three positions were designed to simulate swc based on the planting pattern two drip lines and two rows of tomatoes p1 below the plants p2 between the plants and p3 middle of the bare section the r2 and rmse mbe ia values reached 0 8275 0 9476 and 0 0069 0 0154 cm3 cm 3 0 0051 0 0045 cm3 cm 3 0 7666 0 9941 respectively figs 5 and 6 indicating good agreement between the measured and simulated soil water content a similar study was conducted by nazari et al 2021 their calculated r2 was 0 8024 8425 and the rmse was 0 0141 0 0193 cm3 cm 3 compared with their study our simulation had better precision in predicting the soil water content which may be attributed to the detailed division of soil layers during the simulation and the optimized soil hydraulic parameters li et al 2019 phogat et al 2013 skaggs et al 2004 the calibration and validation results demonstrated that the finalized soil hydraulic parameters table 3 enabled the model to predict the swc changes well at least in sites with similar soil textures in future studies we will focus on optimizing the model parameters to improve the accuracy of the simulation which will help in designing and improving greenhouse tomato irrigation systems kandelous et al 2011 in the simulation relatively large errors were observed at the soil depths of 10 cm and 20 cm fig 6 these uncertainties were common in all three soil textures first the change in swc in the upper soil layer is sensitive because it is close to the dripper gong et al 2020 liu et al 2021 sun et al 2022 moreover clogging aging and uneven arrangement of drip lines can result in the discharge rate of the dripper being lower than the theoretical design value 1 8 l h in the present study camp 1998 zhou et al 2015 resulting in an error in the variable flux second the physical properties of the surface soil can change significantly and its hydraulic characteristics fluctuate easily the errors might be attributable to the simpliﬁcation of the hydraulic parameters in the 0 20 cm soil layer mokari et al 2019 zhou and zhao 2019 third rwu and evaporation activities in the surface soil layer which underlie swc dynamics were more active in the 0 20 cm soil layer than in the other soil layers besharat et al 2010 nazari et al 2021 wang et al 2021 thus the errors that occurred in these processes accumulated in this soil layer resulting in deviations between the simulated and observed values fig 5 although we recorded deviations between the simulated and observed values in some cases the overall accuracy of the simulation was satisfactory figs 5 and 6 thus the hydrus 2d model can be used as an efficient tool for assessing the soil water balance under drip irrigation 4 2 response of tomato growth to soil water balance under three soil textures knowledge of soil water balance and plant responses to soil water dynamics is essential for the development of irrigation managements dabach et al 2013 karandish and šimůnek 2016a the main tomato root region is the 0 40 cm soil layer and 0 25 cm transverse symmetry distance in drip irrigation machado and oliveira 2005 zotarelli et al 2009 so the primary principle of designing irrigation scheduling is to ensure sufficient water supply in the root region chen et al 2020 thidar et al 2020 in the present study the swc data for p1 and p2 revealed that medium and high irrigation levels w2 and w3 respectively met the above principle figs 6 and 7 whereas w1 did not the secondary principle of designing irrigation scheduling is to reduce water storage in the bare section p3 in the present study the response of swc at p3 to the irrigation events in the silty clay soil was weaker than that in the other two soil textures fig 7 this might be because the soil hydraulic characteristics of large fc and low saturated hydraulic conductivity ks tables 1 and 2 do not facilitate lateral water diffusion in addition increasing the irrigation frequency could reduce the flow of water to the bare sections which has been reported in previous studies ertek et al 2004 wan and kang 2006 our results showed that with the same amount of irrigation the high irrigation frequency maintained the topsoil moist resulting in excessive evaporation and less deep drainage table 3 the highest evaporation was observed in f3w3 in the sandy loam soil table 3 which was mainly attributed to the soil texture and irrigation schedules this finding contradicts that of yi et al 2022 who found that during maize growth low fc and high saturated hydraulic conductivity ks resulted in lower evaporation in sandy soil than in loamy soil because the processes of water infiltration and surface drying occurred rapidly in sandy soil the reason for this inconsistency may be that the high irrigation amount and frequency fig 7 as well as different environmental factors fig 3 low vpd and high r n in sandy soil intensified the soil evaporation liu et al 2019 the reduced deep drainage with increasing frequency observed in the present study confirmed the conclusions of previous studies cai et al 2017 mohammadi et al 2019 the highest rwu was found in f1w3 which was affected by higher irrigation and lower evaporation table 3 according to the feddes model feddes et al 1976 tomato rwu is reduced under dry h 300 cm water limited and wet soil conditions h 25 cm aeration limited although a root water deficit h 300 cm was observed at 10 cm depth in f1w3 and f2w3 fig 6 in sandy loam soil the shorter duration did not affect the water accumulation during the entire growth period a logistic function for describing the relationship between swa and photosynthetic indices was established in this study fig 9 which was consistent with previous studies bertolino et al 2019 wopereis et al 1996 the physiological characteristics of plants particularly leaf photosynthetic processes are highly sensitive to water stress therefore these parameters have often been used as signals to predict water stress casadebaig et al 2008 lipiec et al 2013 yan et al 2017a changes in photosynthetic and transpiration rates are attributed to the rapid response of stomata to soil moisture and the external environment the stomata temporarily close when water deficit occurs which prevents the assimilation of co2 and reduces the water consumption of plants challabathula et al 2018 flexas et al 2006 although james et al 2002 found that compared to photosynthetic rate stomatal conductance is often more sensitive to water stress many other factors aba and vpd affect stomatal conductance yan et al 2010 2017b the photosynthetic rate pn is likely to be a better indicator of water stress for all photosynthetic indices which is consistent with the findings of the present study fig 9 moreover as proposed by he et al 2018 the maximum rwu rate occurs in the topsoil layer 0 20 cm in the present study the simulated swa at the depth of 0 20 cm was most closely correlated to the photosynthesis rate pn thus the soil water status in the surface layer 0 20 cm could be used as a signal to assess plant photosynthetic productivity and water management 4 3 evaluation of irrigation schedules and limitations although the same amount of water was applied different soil water wetting patterns and water balance components were observed under various irrigation frequencies in the present study fig 7 and table 3 thereby affecting tomato yield and irrigation water use efficiency fig 10 an obvious yield loss was recorded in plants experiencing water stress such as f1w1 in sandy loam soil similar results have been obtained in previous studies liu et al 2013 pires et al 2011 a quadratic relationship was observed between the tomato yield and rwu with the yield reaching its peak when the rwu was approximately 210 mm fig 11 simultaneously the yield decreased when the rwu exceeded 210 mm this is because high irrigation amount increased luxury transpiration by increasing stomatal aperture du et al 2017 2006 tang et al 2005 the effects of irrigation amount and frequency on tomato yield and irrigation water use efficiency varied depending on climates and soil textures evaporation and deep drainage accounted for a large proportion of water expenditure table 3 resulting in the average iwue of sandy soil being lower than that of loam and silty clay by 1 2 and 3 respectively fig 10 which is similar to the conclusions of previous studies wang et al 2022 wu et al 2011a b our results showed that an increased irrigation frequency had a positive effect on tomato yield in sandy loam soil which was in contrast to the findings observed for silty clay soil fig 10 this is consistent with the findings of ahmadi et al 2014 who proposed that more frequent irrigation could be used in sandy soil than in loamy soil however the present study had certain limitations that should be acknowledged time variable root growth was not considered in the hydrus 2d software which was also proposed in previous research he et al 2018 karandish and šimůnek 2016b furthermore the intricate distribution of roots in greenhouse tomatoes grown under drip irrigation was significantly different from that observed using other irrigation methods which affected the accuracy of the hydrus 2d model consequently it is possible that the current root growth model is inadequate and further research is necessary to address this limitation to comprehensively evaluate and optimize the irrigation schedules in various climates and soils future studies should combine the calibrated hydrus 2d model with plant growth and yield formation models e g wofost and dssat to analyze additional scenarios e g emitter spacing emitter rate and planting density 5 conclusion in the present study we simulated the soil water balance and evaluated the irrigation schedules of greenhouse tomatoes grown under drip irrigation and in soils with three different textures the obtained rmse mbe and ia showed that the hydrus 2d model accurately estimated the swc in various soil layers in the three experimental sites the simulated swa in the 0 20 cm soil layer can be used to evaluate the water management and photosynthetic productivity furthermore the effects of irrigation amount and frequency on tomato yield and iwue varied depending on the climate and soil texture the simulated data in 2020 indicated that compared with its effect on silty clay increased irrigation frequency in sandy loam reduced deep drainage and lateral diffusion and maintained a higher swa of the root zone we evaluated the irrigation schedules by simulating the soil water balance under three soil textures frequent irrigation in small amounts could be applied to sandy loam soil whereas a lower irrigation frequency and larger single irrigation amounts are recommended for silty clay soil in future studies the plant growth and yield formation model should be combined with hydrus 2d to analyze more scenarios and comprehensively

8958,irrigation management has become a critical concern in the face of increasing water scarcity and food demand particularly in the arid and semi arid regions of the world however the effects of climate and soil texture on irrigation schedules remain unclear in the present study a two year trial 2019 2020 was conducted in three greenhouses with different climates and soil textures under drip irrigation the irrigation schedules were based on the cumulative evaporation ce of a 20 cm pan three treatments with different amounts of irrigation i were set in 2019 three irrigation frequencies if in combination with three irrigation amounts were set in 2020 a numerical model hydrus 2d was applied to simulate the soil water balance of greenhouse tomatoes tomato yield and irrigation water use efficiency iwue were measured and the responses of photosynthetic indices to soil water availability swa were quantified the results indicated that the soil water content swc simulated by hydrus 2d was in accordance with the observed data with average root mean square error rmse mean bias error mbe and index agreement ia reaching 0 0127 cm3 cm 3 0 0010 cm3 cm 3 and 0 9275 respectively among the four photosynthetic indices the normalized photosynthetic rate exhibited the highest degree of fit r2 0 9678 with swa 0 20 cm increased irrigation frequency high if reduced the deep drainage by 24 6 10 5 and 3 0 in sandy loam loam and silty clay soils respectively it was concluded that frequent irrigation with low amount can be applied to sandy loamy soil whereas a lower irrigation frequency and larger single irrigation amount are recommended for silty clay soil our study provides theoretical support for irrigation management in semiarid regions with similar climates and soil textures

owing to a shortage of water resources in northwest china yang et al 2017 zheng et al 2013 improving the irrigation management is an effective method to alleviate this problem abbaszadeh et al 2020 yuan et al 2021 drip irrigation is an efficient and water saving irrigation method widely used in greenhouse tomato production shu et al 2020 wu et al 2022 however differences in the environment and soil textures in greenhouses pose many challenges to the design of drip irrigation systems such as the setting of irrigation amount and frequency modeling the water balance in soil plant atmosphere continuum spac systems is helpful for improving irrigation management boanares et al 2020 li and wang 2021 water transport in spac is co regulated by the demand from the atmosphere and the supply from the soil sperry et al 2016 sperry and love 2015 thus directly affecting the soil water balance the reference evapotranspiration et 0 computed by the fao56 penman monteith equation has been used to determine the amount of irrigation required for crop production which is mainly affected by meteorological factors allen et al 1998 pereira et al 2015 wetting patterns in soils with various textures

characteristics such as hydraulic conductivity and soil water retention curves affect the soil water movement and water transport from the soil to the atmosphere cai et al 2021 vereecken et al 2022 considering the influence of soil textures on water saving irrigation scheduling existing evidence demonstrated that higher irrigation frequency and smaller irrigation amount could be applied to soils with sandy textures to reduce deep drainage which is not possible in silty soil du et al 2017 yi et al 2022 because sandy soil has higher hydraulic conductivity and lower field capacity than those of loamy soil however the effects of climate and soil texture on the soil water balance and irrigation schedules are not yet completely understood the development of effective irrigation strategies requires not only an understanding of the soil water balance but also knowledge on the response of plants to soil water availability swa plants undergo a series of physiological changes in response to different swa baker et al 2007 hura et al 2007 yan et al 2016 among plant physiological parameters photosynthetic indices i e net photosynthesis rate transpiration rate stomatal conductance and intercellular co2 concentration are regarded as the essential indicators of plant growth because of their close correlation to yield and water use efficiency huang et al 2020 piao et al 2008 yan et al 2017b analyzed the relationship between the physiological indices of four typical vegetation types and swa on the loess plateau and found that the normalized photosynthetic rate was the optimal index reflecting the physiological status of plants similarly extensive research has been conducted to clarify the feedback mechanisms of photosynthetic characteristics to swa in large scale vegetation systems sadras and milroy 1996 wu et al 2011a b thus quantifying the relationship between swa and plant photosynthetic indices would be useful for determining the right plant water management

has become a mainstream method jamei et al 2022 shiri et al 2020 šimůnek et al 2008 siyal et al 2009 hydrus 2d has been widely applied in drip irrigation since skaggs et al 2004 successfully used this model to compare experimental observations with drip irrigation simulations under different irrigation amounts and durations compared with other models hydrus 2d performed better in simulating the water balance in two dimensional and variably saturated soil owing to its ability to handle soil heterogeneity advanced numerical methods and extensive validation patra et al 2021 šimůnek et al 2016 solat et al 2021 therefore in the present study hydrus 2d was used as a robust tool to simulate the soil water dynamics three typical sites representing the soil characteristics and climate in shaanxi province northwest china were selected for this study detailed information is shown in table s1 the objectives of this study were to ⅰ model the soil water balance process and evaluate the validity of the simulation ⅱ quantify the response of tomato photosynthetic indices to soil water availability and ⅲ evaluate the irrigation schedules of greenhouse tomato under drip irrigation considering the three different soil textures 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental sites the trials were conducted in greenhouses at three sites in shaanxi province northwest china the experimental station of the academy of agricultural sciences in yuling northwest a f university in yangling and the academy of agricultural sciences in hanzhong fig 1 the greenhouses at each experimental site were of the same size measuring 85 m in length 17 m in width and 4 m in height the physical characteristics of the soil used in the experiments are listed in table 1 the pressure plate method ankeny 1992 and retc software van genuchten et al 1991 were used to determine the hydraulic properties of the three test soils soil water retention curves and soil hydraulic conductivity curves fig 2 during the

tomato seedlings solanum lycopersicum l cv jinpeng were transplanted to a greenhouse at the fifth leaf stage to ensure plant survival each plot was irrigated with 20 mm of water after transplantation three replicates were randomly assigned to each treatment in the greenhouses the planting pattern fig 4a for the experiments consisted of two drip lines and two rows of tomatoes each plot size was 6 m 1 2 m with 40 seedlings planted in two rows spaced 50 cm apart the drippers along each drip line were placed 30 cm apart and the discharge rate for each dripper was 1 8 l h the plots were separated to a depth of 60 cm using a plastic film to prevent water movement between them a water meter was placed in each plot to record the amount of irrigation trials were conducted during the spring summer season of 2019 and 2020 march to july and were arranged in the same greenhouse in 2019 three treatments using different irrigation levels were assigned low irrigation w1 0 5 cumulative evaporation ce medium irrigation w2 0 7 ce and high irrigation w3 0 9 ce the occurrence of irrigation events was based on the evaporation amount of a 20 cm pan when the ce reaches 20 2 mm in 2020 three irrigation frequencies were added based on the 2019 experiment the irrigation frequency was determined based on the cumulative pan evaporation the plants were irrigated when the cumulative evaporation reached 20 2 mm f1 low frequency 15 2 mm f2 medium frequency and 10 2 mm f3 high frequency each frequency was associated with three irrigation amounts 0 5 0 7 and 0 9 ce for a total of nine treatments fig 4b referring to previous research on the irrigation schedule of a 20 cm evaporating pan ertek et al 2006 sezen et al 2019 and the water demand characteristics of tomatoes in each growth period allen et al 1998 the actual irrigation amount in different growth stages should be multiplied by a coefficient which is 0 6 1 15 and 0 8 at the initial middle and late stages of tomato growth the irrigation

measure the soil water content swc and were calibrated according to the method described by yi et al 2014 the tdr tubes were placed below the tomato plant p1 between the tomato plant p2 and in the middle of the bare section p3 fig 4c previous studies indicated that most of tomato roots were distributed within 0 40 cm of the top soil layer under drip irrigation machado and oliveira 2005 zotarelli et al 2009 the measurements of swcs at 10 20 40 and 60 cm were taken once every 3 days 2 3 2 fruit yield and irrigation water use efficiency to determine the marketable tomato yield red and

boundary conditions the initial spatial soil water distribution was determined using the swc measured prior to the experiments the domain geometry option was set as vertical plane xz the horizontal width of the flow domain was set to 120 cm which was the width of a single plot fig 4a the vertical size of the flow domain was set to 80 cm twelve observation nodes were defined in hydrus 2d fig 4d as shown in fig 4d the left and right boundaries were set to zero flux because the deep groundwater table was far below the simulation area the bottom boundary was set as free drainage two half circles with a diameter of 1 cm on the top boundary represented the emitter which were set as variable fluxes i e flux1 and flux2 the other areas on the top boundary were set as atmospheric boundaries

7 mm and 2020 377 8 mm with reference to fig 3 the columns in fig s3 show the frequency distribution of environmental data the intervals in the largest frequency distribution and normal distribution curve revealed spatial variations in rn and vpd for example the average rn values in the three test greenhouses decreased in the order of yuling yangling hanzhong the fractions of sand silt and clay determine the soil texture which influences the physical and hydraulic properties of the soil profile table 1 and fig 2 the hydraulic conductivity curves indicated that the water retaining property of silty clay was the best among the three test soils fig 2 moreover the lowest fc value in sandy loam 0 2731 cm3 cm3 caused the surface soil water to evaporate more easily the soil hydraulic parameters listed in table 2 provide detailed information on the water distribution in the soil after irrigation 3 2 calibration and validation of the hydrus 2d model in 2019 fig 5 shows the coefficient of determination r2 between the simulated and measured swc at three positions p1 p2 and p3 good agreement was observed between the simulated and measured values r2 0 8 at all depths as shown in fig 5 the values of r2 for p1 p2 and p3 in the sandy loam loam and silty clay soils were 0 8573 0 8899 0 8275 0 8369 0 9217 0 8775 and 0 9176 0 9476 0 9105 respectively the statistical indicators rmse mbe and ia used to compare the simulated and observed swc values at p1 below the plant for the three soil textures are shown in fig 6 as shown in the figure the rmse mbe ia value at 10 20 40 and 60 cm soil depth ranged between 0 0129 cm3 cm 3 0 0048 cm3 cm 3 0 9405 and 0 0152 cm3 cm 3 0 0045 cm3 cm 3 0 9848 between 0 0118 cm3 cm 3 0 0039 cm3 cm 3 0 8574 and 0 0154 cm3 cm 3 0 0028 cm3 cm 3 0 9704 between

respectively during the entire growing season swc fluctuated depending on the irrigation events which differed depending on soil depth irrigation amount and soil texture after the irrigation events the swc increment in the surface soil 10 and 20 cm was greater than that in the deep soil 40 and 60 cm furthermore the fluctuation range of swc at the same depth was determined by the amount of irrigation and soil texture and a wide fluctuation range was recorded mainly in the w3 treatment and in silt clay soil 3 3 simulation of soil water dynamics in 2020 fig 7 shows the simulated changes in swc in different soil layers during the entire growing period for all treatments at the three positions p1 p2 and p3 differences were observed at the three positions in the top soil layer 10 cm and these differences gradually decreased with increasing depth especially at 60 cm soil depth notably the differences were greater in the silty clay soil than in the other two soil textures at 10 and 20 cm soil depths the swc at the three positions in each treatment increased in the following order p3 p2 p1 under high irrigation levels the swc at p2 40 and 60 cm was slightly higher than that at p1 in addition smaller differences in swc between p3 p1 and p2 were observed when the irrigation frequency increased the peak value of swc was observed at p1 10 cm on the day of the irrigation event and this value was greater than that of fc during a certain period in f1w3 and f2w3 in sandy loam soil 3 4 relationship between simulated soil water availability and normalized photosynthetic indices fig 8 depicts the simulated changes in soil water availability swa at the 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm soil layers throughout the tomato growing period the fluctuation in swa was determined by irrigation events and was consistent with the changes in swc in particular fluctuations were considerably more difficult to observe in the 40 60 cm soil layer than in the other soil layers furthermore increasing the irrigation frequency with the same irrigation amount can maintain the swa within a smaller range over a long period in 2020 the range of swa was 0 24 0 96 sandy loam 0 19 0 93 loam and 0 17 0 94 silty clay in the 0 20 cm soil layer 0 40 0 89 sandy loam 0 32 0 90 loam and 0 27 0 71 silty clay in the 20 40 cm soil layer and 0 34 0 79 sandy loam 0 26 0 82 loam and 0 12 0 54 silty clay in the 40 60 cm soil layer for all treatments fig 9 shows the parameters of the logistic equation for different soil depths and the four photosynthetic indices the swa was significantly correlated with the normalized values of the photosynthetic indices p 0 01 as shown in fig 9 the coefﬁcients of determination r2 reached 0 8321 0 9678 in the 0 20 cm soil layer but decreased to 0 7130 0 7521 in the 20 40 cm soil layer these values decreased even more dramatically below 40 cm depth 0 1362 0 2351 among the four photosynthetic indices the normalized photosynthetic rate exhibited the highest fitting degree with swa 0 20 cm reaching 0 9678 3 5 comparison of soil water balance components the water balance components of the simulation for all treatments including the irrigation amount i mm root water uptake rwu mm deep drainage d mm evaporation e mm and change in storage s mm are presented in table 3 the amount of irrigation was closely related to environmental factors in the greenhouse fig s4 and significant differences in the amount of irrigation were observed among the three greenhouses moreover compared with irrigation frequency the amount of irrigation can significantly affect these components a slight reduction in rwu was observed with increasing irrigation frequency water loss in the simulation process was represented by negative soil water storage as shown in table 3 a higher amount of stored water was lost in silty clay soil than in the other soil textures in addition increasing irrigation frequency decreased the deep leakage while contributing to higher evaporation for example in sandy soil the deep drainage of f3w3 was 19 7 lower and the evaporation was 25 8 higher than those of f1w3 this phenomenon was also observed in loamy and silty clay soils 3 6 tomato yield and irrigation water use efficiency fig 10 shows the tomato yield and iwue for all treatments in 2019 and 2020 the tomato yield increased with the increase in irrigation amount except for f1w3 in the sandy loam soil in 2020 the highest yield in the three soil textures was 127 6 t hm2 sandy loam f3w3 125 1 t hm2 loam f2w3 and 123 1 t hm2 silty clay f1w3 increasing the irrigation frequency led to a slight reduction in plant yield when medium or low irrigation amounts were used for example in sandy loam soil the yields of f2w1 and f3w1 decreased by 8 3 and 15 1 respectively compared to that of f1w1 the highest iwue values were observed in w2 and f1w2 in 2019 and 2020 respectively compared with the irrigation amounts of w1 and w3 over the two years w2 increased the average iwue by 7 4 and 17 1 in 2019 and 7 2 and 9 6 in 2020 respectively the average iwue in 2019 2020 in the three soil textures was 37 3 kg m3 35 2 kg m3 38 5 kg m3 37 5 kg m3 and 40 3 kg m3 41 6 kg m3 4 discussion 4 1 feasibility of simulating soil water dynamics using the hydrus 2d model irrigation is the only way for supplementing soil water to greenhouse tomatoes liu et al 2019 indicating the necessity to monitor and simulate soil water dynamics in greenhouses in the present study hydrus 2d was used to simulate two dimensional swc dynamics in soils with different textures and under different irrigation scheduling conditions and its accuracy and reliability were evaluated using field data figs 5 and 6 the simulation covered the entire tomato growth period march july 2019 and 2020 three positions were designed to simulate swc based on the planting pattern two drip lines and two rows of tomatoes p1 below the plants p2 between the plants and p3 middle of the bare section the r2 and rmse mbe ia values reached 0 8275 0 9476 and 0 0069 0 0154 cm3 cm 3 0 0051 0 0045 cm3 cm 3 0 7666 0 9941 respectively figs 5 and 6 indicating good agreement between the measured and simulated soil water content a similar study was conducted by nazari et al 2021 their calculated r2 was 0 8024 8425 and the rmse was 0 0141 0 0193 cm3 cm 3 compared with their study our simulation had better precision in predicting the soil water content which may be attributed to the detailed division of soil layers during the simulation and the optimized soil hydraulic parameters li et al 2019 phogat et al 2013 skaggs et al 2004 the calibration and validation results demonstrated that the finalized soil hydraulic parameters table 3 enabled the model to predict the swc changes well at least in sites with similar soil textures in future studies we will focus on optimizing the model parameters to improve the accuracy of the simulation which will help in designing and improving greenhouse tomato irrigation systems kandelous et al 2011 in the simulation relatively large errors were observed at the soil depths of 10 cm and 20 cm fig 6 these uncertainties were common in all three soil textures first the change in swc in the upper soil layer is sensitive because it is close to the dripper gong et al 2020 liu et al 2021 sun et al 2022 moreover clogging aging and uneven arrangement of drip lines can result in the discharge rate of the dripper being lower than the theoretical design value 1 8 l h in the present study camp 1998 zhou et al 2015 resulting in an error in the variable flux second the physical properties of the surface soil can change significantly and its hydraulic characteristics fluctuate easily the errors might be attributable to the simpliﬁcation of the hydraulic parameters in the 0 20 cm soil layer mokari et al 2019 zhou and zhao 2019 third rwu and evaporation activities in the surface soil layer which underlie swc dynamics were more active in the 0 20 cm soil layer than in the other soil layers besharat et al 2010 nazari et al 2021 wang et al 2021 thus the errors that occurred in these processes accumulated in this soil layer resulting in deviations between the simulated and observed values fig 5 although we recorded deviations between the simulated and observed values in some cases the overall accuracy of the simulation was satisfactory figs 5 and 6 thus the hydrus 2d model can be used as an efficient tool for assessing the soil water balance under drip irrigation 4 2 response of tomato growth to soil water balance under three soil textures knowledge of soil water balance and plant responses to soil water dynamics is essential for the development of irrigation managements dabach et al 2013 karandish and šimůnek 2016a the main tomato root region is the 0 40 cm soil layer and 0 25 cm transverse symmetry distance in drip irrigation machado and oliveira 2005 zotarelli et al 2009 so the primary principle of designing irrigation scheduling is to ensure sufficient water supply in the root region chen et al 2020 thidar et al 2020 in the present study the swc data for p1 and p2 revealed that medium and high irrigation levels w2 and w3 respectively met the above principle figs 6 and 7 whereas w1 did not the secondary principle of designing irrigation scheduling is to reduce water storage in the bare section p3 in the present study the response of swc at p3 to the irrigation events in the silty clay soil was weaker than that in the other two soil textures fig 7 this might be because the soil hydraulic characteristics of large fc and low saturated hydraulic conductivity ks tables 1 and 2 do not facilitate lateral water diffusion in addition increasing the irrigation frequency could reduce the flow of water to the bare sections which has been reported in previous studies ertek et al 2004 wan and kang 2006 our results showed that with the same amount of irrigation the high irrigation frequency maintained the topsoil moist resulting in excessive evaporation and less deep drainage table 3 the highest evaporation was observed in f3w3 in the sandy loam soil table 3 which was mainly attributed to the soil texture and irrigation schedules this finding contradicts that of yi et al 2022 who found that during maize growth low fc and high saturated hydraulic conductivity ks resulted in lower evaporation in sandy soil than in loamy soil because the processes of water infiltration and surface drying occurred rapidly in sandy soil the reason for this inconsistency may be that the high irrigation amount and frequency fig 7 as well as different environmental factors fig 3 low vpd and high r n in sandy soil intensified the soil evaporation liu et al 2019 the reduced deep drainage with increasing frequency observed in the present study confirmed the conclusions of previous studies cai et al 2017 mohammadi et al 2019 the highest rwu was found in f1w3 which was affected by higher irrigation and lower evaporation table 3 according to the feddes model feddes et al 1976 tomato rwu is reduced under dry h 300 cm water limited and wet soil conditions h 25 cm aeration limited although a root water deficit h 300 cm was observed at 10 cm depth in f1w3 and f2w3 fig 6 in sandy loam soil the shorter duration did not affect the water accumulation during the entire growth period a logistic function for describing the relationship between swa and photosynthetic indices was established in this study fig 9 which was consistent with previous studies bertolino et al 2019 wopereis et al 1996 the physiological characteristics of plants particularly leaf photosynthetic processes are highly sensitive to water stress therefore these parameters have often been used as signals to predict water stress casadebaig et al 2008 lipiec et al 2013 yan et al 2017a changes in photosynthetic and transpiration rates are attributed to the rapid response of stomata to soil moisture and the external environment the stomata temporarily close when water deficit occurs which prevents the assimilation of co2 and reduces the water consumption of plants challabathula et al 2018 flexas et al 2006 although james et al 2002 found that compared to photosynthetic rate stomatal conductance is often more sensitive to water stress many other factors aba and vpd affect stomatal conductance yan et al 2010 2017b the photosynthetic rate pn is likely to be a better indicator of water stress for all photosynthetic indices which is consistent with the findings of the present study fig 9 moreover as proposed by he et al 2018 the maximum rwu rate occurs in the topsoil layer 0 20 cm in the present study the simulated swa at the depth of 0 20 cm was most closely correlated to the photosynthesis rate pn thus the soil water status in the surface layer 0 20 cm could be used as a signal to assess plant photosynthetic productivity and water management 4 3 evaluation of irrigation schedules and limitations although the same amount of water was applied different soil water wetting patterns and water balance components were observed under various irrigation frequencies in the present study fig 7 and table 3 thereby affecting tomato yield and irrigation water use efficiency fig 10 an obvious yield loss was recorded in plants experiencing water stress such as f1w1 in sandy loam soil similar results have been obtained in previous studies liu et al 2013 pires et al 2011 a quadratic relationship was observed between the tomato yield and rwu with the yield reaching its peak when the rwu was approximately 210 mm fig 11 simultaneously the yield decreased when the rwu exceeded 210 mm this is because high irrigation amount increased luxury transpiration by increasing stomatal aperture du et al 2017 2006 tang et al 2005 the effects of irrigation amount and frequency on tomato yield and irrigation water use efficiency varied depending on climates and soil textures evaporation and deep drainage accounted for a large proportion of water expenditure table 3 resulting in the average iwue of sandy soil being lower than that of loam and silty clay by 1 2 and 3 respectively fig 10 which is similar to the conclusions of previous studies wang et al 2022 wu et al 2011a b our results showed that an increased irrigation frequency had a positive effect on tomato yield in sandy loam soil which was in contrast to the findings observed for silty clay soil fig 10 this is consistent with the findings of ahmadi et al 2014 who proposed that more frequent irrigation could be used in sandy soil than in loamy soil however the present study had certain limitations that should be acknowledged time variable root growth was not considered in the hydrus 2d software which was also proposed in previous research he et al 2018 karandish and šimůnek 2016b furthermore the intricate distribution of roots in greenhouse tomatoes grown under drip irrigation was significantly different from that observed using other irrigation methods which affected the accuracy of the hydrus 2d model consequently it is possible that the current root growth model is inadequate and further research is necessary to address this limitation to comprehensively evaluate and optimize the irrigation schedules in various climates and soils future studies should combine the calibrated hydrus 2d model with plant growth and yield formation models e g wofost and dssat to analyze additional scenarios e g emitter spacing emitter rate and planting density 5 conclusion in the present study we simulated the soil water balance and evaluated the irrigation schedules of greenhouse tomatoes grown under drip irrigation and in soils with three different textures the obtained rmse mbe and ia showed that the hydrus 2d model accurately estimated the swc in various soil layers in the three experimental sites the simulated swa in the 0 20 cm soil layer can be used to evaluate the water management and photosynthetic productivity furthermore the effects of irrigation amount and frequency on tomato yield and iwue varied depending on the climate and soil texture the simulated data in 2020 indicated that compared with its effect on silty clay increased irrigation frequency in sandy loam reduced deep drainage and lateral diffusion and maintained a higher swa of the root zone we evaluated the irrigation schedules by simulating the soil water balance under three soil textures frequent irrigation in small amounts could be applied to sandy loam soil whereas a lower irrigation frequency and larger single irrigation amounts are recommended for silty clay soil in future studies the plant growth and yield formation model should be combined with hydrus 2d to analyze more scenarios and comprehensively

8959,acquiring accurate measurements of crop consumptive water use in the form of evapotranspiration et is increasingly important in california cropping systems as demands for water resources shift under a changing climate growers use various methods for estimating et to guide irrigation management some of which are based on satellite remote sensing although this approach has proven reliable operational applications remain hindered by latency in satellite product delivery due in part to computationally expensive atmospheric correction steps this is particularly true in approaches that utilize thermal infrared tir imagery which is sensitive to atmospheric corrections the current study evaluates two approaches to derive a pseudo atmospherically corrected land surface temperature lst in near real time nrt for ingestion into the alexi disalexi et model evaluation is done for selected landsat scenes over california for the year 2022 both approaches take advantage of the landsat collection 2 dataset including availability of atmospheric correction parameters and atmospherically corrected lst the first approach is based on the radiative transfer equation rte and atmospheric correction parameters from previous overpass available in the collection 2 dataset the second is based on a random forest rf regression model using landsat collection 2 atmospheric correction parameters and lst as input for training results indicate the rf approach outperforms the rte approach with an average mean absolute error of 0 6 k compared to 2 0 k for the rte method the rte method produces more spatial and temporal variability in lst due to temporal differences in atmospheric transmissivity when used to estimate et we find little difference between nrt lst based et estimates and et derived using the collection 2 lst product albeit rf based et provides less day to day variation results suggest promise in using such an approach to derive lst and subsequently et in nrt and toward improving daily water management and irrigation efficiency in the vineyard and orchard systems of california data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction california agriculture is particularly susceptible to climate change and associated droughts and heat waves due to its reliance on surface and groundwater for irrigation this reliance and the sustainability of california agriculture is currently being tested as the southwestern united states endures a megadrought williams et al 2022 and regulatory efforts begin to constrain consumptive water use i e sustainable groundwater management act sgma the combination of both has created a situation where growers are required to farm the estimated 24 million operated acres valued at 50 billion dollars with diminishing water resources pushing the need within the grower community for better crop water use information for irrigation management usda nass 2020 census of agriculture historically growers have used varying methods and forms of evapotranspiration et to monitor crop water use for the purpose of scheduling irrigation some methods are ground based and use crop specific coefficients kc and local reference et eto estimates to derive a crop et etc i e fao methodology allen et al 1998 although simple and easy to apply operationally estimates are difficult to upscale to surrounding areas while crop coefficients are difficult to adjust both in space and time to field specific conditions e g stress ting et al 2016 satellite remote sensing and associated surface reflectance sr bands offer an ability to map kc like values through vegetative indices such as the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi providing more spatially explicit etc estimates singh and irmak 2009 kamble et al 2013 french et al 2020 however ndvi and other sr based products can be slow to respond to plant stress making them less useful for irrigation management where the monitoring of rapid changes in crop water use may be required moran 2003 glenn et al 2008 knipper et al 2019a b satellite retrievals of land surface temperature lst from thermal infrared tir imagery have been shown to be more sensitive to changes in crop water status due to sensitivity of soil and canopy temperatures to variable soil moisture availability moran 2003 several lst based actual et eta models have been developed over the past few decades including the mapping evapotranspiration with internalized calibration metric allen et al 2007 model the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998b model the operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop senay et al 2007 model and the paired atmosphere land exchange inverse alexi anderson et al 1997 model and flux disaggregation technique disalexi norman et al 2003 all approaches are being extensively validated in a wide range of cropping systems as part of the openet project melton et al 2021 however the alexi disalexi modeling framework has been specifically evaluated over wine grape vineyards and almond orchards in california as part of the grape remote sensing atmospheric profile and evapotranspiration experiment grapex kustas et al 2018 and tree crop remote sensing of evapotranspiration experiment t rex knipper et al 2023 respectively both projects focus on developing eta toolkits for irrigation management in the associated cropping systems of california the alexi disalexi eta model is based on the two source energy balance tseb norman et al 1995 approach which partitions lst measurements into soil and canopy components and solves the surface energy budget for the soil vegetation canopy and combined systems associated with a mixed pixel such an approach is advantageous in unique canopy systems such as vineyards and almond orchards where distinct crop rows vegetative canopy and interrows substrate soils characteristic of soil or cover crop are present although alexi disalexi derived eta has correlated well with ec flux tower observations in the past anderson et al 2011 2018 knipper et al 2020 semmens et al 2016 xue et al 2021 2022 its basis in tir imagery and by association lst makes operational applications difficult due to 1 latency in satellite data delivery i e time from satellite overpass to data availability and 2 computationally expensive and time consuming atmospheric correction steps required to convert tir imagery to lst in the past tir image processing steps for disalexi included downloading imagery as it becomes available applying an atmospheric correction model e g modtran berk et al 1989 and sharpening to 30 m spatial resolution using a data mining sharpening dms approach developed by gao et al 2012 initial data delivery for landsat 8 at sensor brightness temperature data in collection 1 was on the order of 14 26 days due to need to wait for updated ephemeris data to correct for an instrument failure of the scene selection mirror ssm position decoder adding to this delay the need for the end user to apply computationally expensive atmospheric correction steps the compound latency of the final eta product rendered it functionally obsolete for real time irrigation management decision making to reduce latency of public data delivery among other conditions landsat recently underwent a major reprocessing effort this effort resulted in the collection 2 dataset where advancements in data processing algorithm development and data access and distribution capabilities were made masek et al 2020 landsat collection 2 follows the same structured inventory of data products as collection 1 defined as tiers based on data quality and processing level specifically newly acquired landsat 8 oli tirs l8 data are processed and placed in the real time rt tier available for download 4 6 h after overpass l8 rt data are reprocessed using updated refined tirs parameters and transitioned to level 1 tier 1 or tier 2 and removed from the rt tier transition delay of 3 10 days improvement in per pixel geodetic accuracy and interoperability of l8 for collection 2 level 1 product generation was made according to story et al 2019 another advantage of landsat collection 2 is that level 2 processed data includes atmospherically corrected sr and tir bands providing analysis ready data including lst band designation st upon download allowing users to bypass the expensive atmospheric correction step all atmospherically corrected bands are included in the level 2 tier 1 or tier 2 scenes while the intermediate bands used to calculate lst i e atmospheric correction parameters via the radiative transfer equation rte yu et al 2014 jiménez muñoz et al 2009 are also included atmospheric correction parameters include atmospheric transmittance atran downwelled radiance drad upwelled radiance urad and emissivity of band 10 emis for landsat 8 oli tirs it takes approximately 4 11 days to process to collection 2 level 2 tier 1 or tier 2 landsat 9 oli 2 tirs 2 delivers collection 2 level 2 tier 1 or tier 2 products within 3 days of acquisition fig 1 the current study attempts to take advantage of the newly released collection 2 dataset and recently launched landsat 9 oli 2 tirs 2 imager to produce a near real time nrt lst image for input into the alexi disalexi model to subsequently derive nrt eta we evaluate two approaches each created with simplicity in mind as the goal is to shorten the time between landsat overpass and eta availability the first approach uses l8 and l9 rt tir imagery and applies atmospheric correction and emissivity parameters available from the previous landsat overpass landsat collection 2 level 2 dataset and applies them to the current image using the rte approach the second uses a random forest rf regression model to learn relationships between l8 and l9 rt tir imagery and level 2 collection 2 atmospheric correction parameters and lst products the rf model is trained tested and applied for individual and combined landsat scenes while maintaining separation between trained tested and applied pixels evaluation is done for l8 and l9 scenes during the year 2022 providing a combined 8 day revisit under clear sky conditions scenes encompass the northern coast of california north of san francisco and a majority of the central valley of california derived nrt lst estimates are compared to level 2 collection 2 lst products on concurrent days to determine the applicability of each approach nrt lst from both approaches and level 2 collection 2 lst products are then used to individually inform the alexi disalexi eta model to determine if proposed nrt lst products are capable of producing reliable eta estimates in nrt the goal of this study is to propose and evaluate a reliable and efficient method to derive a reputable lst image with low latency and computational expense for the purpose of deriving eta in nrt to improve irrigation decision support 2 material and methods 2 1 study domain the study domain encompasses a majority of the central valley of california and a portion of the northern coast of california and includes landsat scenes p045r033 p044r033 p043r034 and p042r035 fig 2 these landsat scenes are chosen as they provide coverage for individual wine grape vineyards being monitored as part of the usda ars grape remote sensing atmospheric profile and evapotranspiration experiment grapex kustas et al 2018 and individual almond orchards being monitored as part of the usda ars tree crop remote sensing of evapotranspiration experiment t rex fig 2 individual vineyards and almond orchards are indicated by red markers fig 2 et modeling domains for each are shown as gray blocks fig 2 and are used as boundaries to predict nrt lst and subsequently nrt eta explanation in subsequent sections 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 landsat imagery for lst estimation landsat collection 2 tiers inventory structure for data products are based on data quality and level of processing in the current study we use level 1 rt and tier 1 data products as they pertain to both landsat 8 oli tirs l8 and landsat 9 oli 2 tirs 2 l9 specifically l8 level 1 rt top of atmosphere toa reflectance tir and qa bit mask bands are downloaded as they become available 4 6 h after overpass and before they are reprocessed and transitioned to tier 1 and removed from the rt tier similarly l9 level 1 t1 sr tir and qa bit mask bands are downloaded as they become available 4 6 h after overpass note that l9 skips the rt designation so imagery is not removed from the level 1 tier one major advancement in the landsat collection 2 dataset is the inclusion of atmospherically corrected sr bands and lst band designation of st these atmospherically corrected bands are included in the level 2 tier 1 datasets and also include intermediate bands i e atmospheric correction parameters used to produce lst via the rte approach atmospheric correction parameters include atmospheric transmittance atran downwelled radiance drad upwelled radiance urad and emissivity of band 10 emis for l8 it takes approximately 4 11 days to process to collection 2 level 2 tier 1 l9 delivers collection 2 level 2 tier 1 products within 3 days of acquisition in the current study we use collection 2 level 2 tier 1 atmospheric correction parameters st atran st drad st urad and st emis surface temperature lst band designation st and the pixel quality attribute band qa pixel from both l8 and l9 2 2 2 alexi disalexi eta model input shared between alexi and disalexi include meteorological forcing information i e air temperature wind speed solar radiation vapor pressure and air pressure from the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr data set at 0 25 resolution and hourly to 3 hour time steps dee et al 2013 alexi uses landcover classification from the university of maryland umd global land cover dataset hansen et al 2000 and disalexi uses the national land cover dataset nlcd fry et al 2011 satellite remote sensing inputs to alexi include lst computed from 11 µm brightness temperature observations from goes east and goes west imager instruments brightness temperatures are atmospherically corrected using atmospheric profiles of temperature following the procedure in french et al 2003 leaf area index lai used to partition lst between canopy and soil components is obtained from the modis lai product mcd15a3h aggregated to goes resolution 4 km and interpolated to daily time steps the alexi model is currently run operationally over the continental united states conus producing daily eta estimates at 4 km spatial resolution and a 2 day latency from current date disalexi inputs include l8 and l9 collection 2 sr band imagery as well as harmonized landsat and sentinel 2 sr datasets hls data were acquired during the year 2022 for available cloud free days lai and ndvi at 30 m spatial resolution are created using hls band information following a procedure in gao et al 2020 that has been modified to include ground based lai measurements made at grapex vineyard sites kang et al 2022 and is based on machine learning high resolution lst maps were generated using l8 and l9 collection 2 lst and derived nrt lst approaches described below in section 2 3 sharpened from a native resolution of 100 30 m using a data mining sharpening dms approach developed by gao et al 2012 2 3 nrt lst approaches 2 3 1 previous atmospheric correction parameters approach atm the previous atmospheric correction parameters approach atm combines landsat collection 2 atmospheric correction parameters from the last processed st product with the uncorrected tir signal available in real time t1 for l9 and rt for l8 latency of 4 6 h after overpass for both the atm approach first takes the rt tir signal band 10 and applies eq 1 to obtain the top of atmosphere toa radiance 1 l λ t m l q cal t a l where lλ t is toa spectral radiance watts m 2 srad 1 μm for the rt image t ml is the band specific multiplicative rescaling factor from the metadata al is the band specific additive rescaling factor from the metadata and qcal t is the quantized and calibrated standard product pixel digital numbers dn for the rt image t atmospheric correction parameters urad drad atran and emis from the previous landsat collection 2 dataset overpass t 1 are then used in eq 2 to derive the surface emitted radiance oλ t 2 o λ t l λ t ura d t 1 atra n t 1 1 emi s t 1 dra d t 1 emi s t 1 once oλ t has been calculated we convert to a land surface temperature lst estimate via the planck function inversion given in eq 3 3 ls t atm t k 2 ln k 1 o λ t 1 where k1 and k2 are band specific thermal conversion constants from the metadata and lstatm t is land surface temperature in kelvin for the rt image date a schematic diagram of this process is shown in fig 3 such an approach is simple and computationally efficient adhering to the requirements for running any modeling system in real time however this approach assumes the change in atmospheric correction parameters is minimal between landsat overpasses i e between rt and level 2 collection 2 availability analysis presented here will determine whether temporal and spatial changes over selected landsat scenes in california are great enough to create inaccuracies in nrt lst that will propagate into erroneous et estimates 2 3 2 random forest approach rf the random forest approach rf also takes advantage of available landsat level 2 collection 2 atmospheric correction parameters atmospherically corrected lst and the tir signal available in real time however it attempts to address the possibility of differences in atmospheric conditions between landsat overpasses by developing machine learning relationships between the real time tir signal and level 2 collection 2 atmospheric correction parameters and lst from the previous landsat overpass date using all available data during the year 2022 as a training set as mentioned in section 2 2 1 landsat collection 2 real time rt and t1 for l8 and l9 respectively band 10 and qa bitmask are downloaded prior to being removed and transitioned to tier 1 tier 1 level 2 atmospheric correction parameters atran urad drad emis lst and qa bitmask are then downloaded as they become available the combination of real time 4 6 h latency and level 2 tier 1 4 11 day latency for l8 3 day latency for l9 information on same acquisition dates for the entirety of a year allows us to develop a rf model based on what will be available in real time feature engineering of the proposed rf model includes gathering band 10 images and associated qa bitmasks included in the rt tier for l8 and l9 these images are then converted to toa brightness temperature toa btt and pixels including clouds via qa bitmask are replaced with null next we search for the landsat level 2 collection 2 dataset that corresponds to the overpass prior to the rt overpass denoted as t 1 under clear sky conditions when all landsat scenes are available t 1 will be 8 days atmospheric correction parameters atrant 1 dradt 1 uradt 1 emist 1 lst lstt 1 and qa pixelt 1 are then taken for this previous date pixels including clouds are replaced with null then each excluding qa pixelt 1 is stored with pixels aligning with the already stored toa btt from the rt tier additionally we include the rt toa bt on the overpass prior to the rt overpass toa btt 1 lastly we obtain the level 2 collection 2 lst on the rt overpass lstt and again mask for clouds and store with pixels aligning with the previously stored datasets once all data are compiled pixels defined as null are removed leaving only cloud free pixels for training purposes we additionally remove pixels that fall within a predefined domain used for et modeling within the grapex and t rex projects these domains are shown in fig 1 and will be used later to test the approach as unseen data points after these pixels are removed a random sampling of the dataset 3 outside the domains is taken resulting in a n by 8 dataset n number of pixels 7 features and 1 label as shown in fig 4 that is stored for each rt date and landsat scene note that the random sampling of 3 provides a training set of roughly 1 0 106 to 1 5 106 samples for each individual feature on each landsat overpass date the random sampling percentage was chosen to provide adequate training samples while maintaining computational efficiency after all dates and tiles are compiled we combine all dates from each individual landsat scene creating landsat scene specific training sets e g p045r033 trainingset p044r033 trainingset p043r034 trainingset p042r035 trainingset in addition to these training sets we also create one based on a combination of landsat scenes daily datasets for p045r033 p044r033 and p043r034 are combined and a random sample of 33 to remain consistent with scene specific training sets is taken to create a combined training set combined trainingset this dataset is used to predict lst for p042r035 rip domain under unseen conditions to test potential problems with applying the rf model over regions not included in the training process using these training sets we test the suitability of the rf approach in two ways first we take each training set and randomly select 80 of the dataset for training and 20 for testing following the pareto principle an evaluation of multiple selected training and testing datasets found a similar distribution of values including the range preventing possible poor extrapolation error statistics are produced on the testing dataset for each individual dataset p045r033 trainingset p044r033 trainingset p043r034 trainingset p042r035 trainingset combined trainingset and are denoted as rf t second we mimic a real time application of the rf model by iterating through available landsat rt image dates and apply the rf model using rt tir signals band10 dnt fig 3 with the previous dates landsat collection 2 level 2 atmospheric correction parameters atrant 1 dradt 1 uradt 1 emist 1 and lst lstt 1 following the procedure described above and provided as a schematic in fig 4 once all inputs to the rf model have been collected features we remove cloud pixels via the qa mask and apply the rf model to predict pseudo atmospherically corrected lst for that date lstrf t error statistics are produced by comparing this prediction lstrf t against the landsat level 2 collection 2 lst product aligning with the rt date lstt note that when mimicking a real time application the rf model is only applied for pixels within the defined et modeling domain fig 4 domain which were omitted during the training process 2 4 alexi disalexi et model the alexi anderson et al 1997 anderson et al 2007 and associated disaggregation approach disalexi anderson et al 2004 are based on the two source energy balance tseb model norman et al 1995 tseb works by partitioning lst into soil and canopy components ts and tc respectively using a local vegetation cover fraction fc estimated from retrievals of leaf area index lai according to eq 4 4 lst f c t c 1 f c t s individual temperature components are then used within a temperature gradient resistance system of equations designed to solve the surface energy budget for both soil and canopy components 5 r ns r nc g h s h c λ e s λ e c where rn is the net radiation w m 2 h is the sensible heat flux w m 2 g is the soil heat flux w m 2 and λe is the latent heat flux w m 2 subscripts s and c represent fluxes associated with the soil and canopy components of the pixel respectively λec is first estimated by proxy using a modified priestley taylor formulation priestley and taylor 1972 and λes is estimated as the residual to eq 5 if les is found to be negative unlikely midday the priestley taylor coefficiecnt used to compute lec is iteratively throttled back from its potential value of 1 26 to simulate impacts of canopy stress daily et mm day 1 is estimated by upscaling the summation of λec and λes taken at landsat overpass time to a daily value mj m 2 day 1 by conserving the ratio of latent heat to insolation during daylight hours cammalleri et al 2014a 2014b and then converting to mass flux units the latent heat of vaporization 2 45 mj kg 1 for more information on the alexi disalexi framework and its application in vineyards and almonds the reader is referred to knipper et al 2023 3 results 3 1 rf model evaluation rf t suitability of the rf approach to derive nrt lst was first determined by training and testing on datasets created for each landsat scene p045r033 trainingset p044r033 trainingset p043r034 trainingset p042r035 trainingset combined trainingset we randomly selected 80 for training and 20 for testing for each individual dataset as noted above seven features included atrant 1 dradt 1 uradt 1 emist 1 lstt 1 toa btt 1 and toa btt while the target variable was lstt fig 4 after training each individual rf model was run using the test dataset as input to predict lst lstrf t for those test pixels error statistics were calculated between predicted lstrf t and lstt values in the testing dataset and are shown in table 1 results indicate that the rf models are capable of deriving an atmospherically corrected lst image with good agreement when training and testing using an 80 20 split with an average mean absolute error mae of 0 33 k for the individual landsat scene rf models and 0 52 k for the combined rf model table 1 when transitioning from the northernmost landsat scene p045r033 to the southernmost p042r035 we find mae increases from 0 21 k to 0 43 k respectively also statistical measures are better for the individually trained landsat tiles p045r033 p044r033 p043r034 and p042r035 when compared to the rf model that was trained on the combination of the first three tiles and applied to p042r035 table 1 combined this suggests that geographic location may play a role in developing a rf model based on the features and target suggested here feature importance refers to different techniques used to assign a numerical score 0 1 to input features based on how relevant each is to the target the higher the importance value the more important it is in predicting the target variable and vice versa importance scores are calculated using the gini importance for each rf model and are reported in fig 5 feature importance scores indicate that on average over all rf models toa btt is the most relevant in predicting lstt when compared to other features although minimal by comparison stt 1 appears to be the second most important feature with atmospheric correction parameters indicating 0 01 importance scores for all rf models reported importance score ratings are not surprising given toa btt and lstt are correlated more directly as values are for the same date while remaining features are on the previous date note that the importance should not be interpreted as correlations or strength coefficients as they do not represent a dependency with the target therefore features other than toa btt are not useless when toa btt and stt values are compared directly to one another we find a linear correlation r2 0 67 on average for all scenes including combined however when attempting to predict lstt based on a fitted linear regression model using toa btt as input error statistics worsen with an average mae of 1 34 k between landsat training sets including combined not shown moreover additional feature engineering removing combinations of less important features i e atmospheric correction parameters and subsequently training the rf model results in similar error statistics as the linear model with average mae of 1 29 k over all landsat scene training sets including combined not shown as a result regardless of how the additional features appear to be less useful when building the model we continue to include them as there are likely instances of non linearity and when additional features provide valuable information 3 2 mimicked operational application of nrt lst approaches to best mimic operational applications we iterate through saved l8 and l9 rt tir images t and use the preceding landsat overpass level 2 collection 2 datasets t 1 to derive lst on the rt image date t using both atm and rf approaches such an approach allows us to estimate nrt lst using parameters that would be available in real time error statistics are calculated using level 2 collection 2 lst as the truth observed value and atm or rf derived lst as the predicted value table 2 also included are error statistics between toa btt and level 2 collection 2 lstt column labeled toa bt table 2 which provides an uncorrected estimate and baseline for the degree of correction required for the thermal band for each domain note that pixels used as input for each approach are those that fall within the et modeling domains bar dav slm rip described in section 2 1 and section 2 3 2 and shown in fig 1 domain and not the entire landsat scene this allowed the rf model to be applied without having been previously trained using the same pixel information results suggest that differences between the toa bt uncorrected and level 2 collection 2 lst increase from the northernmost domain bar to the southernmost domain rip with mae increasing from 4 52 k to 6 46 k respectively following results presented in section 3 1 such differences propagate to the atm and rf models with both performing better over bar compared to rip atm and rf both show improvement over uncorrected toa bt with mae decreasing by 62 and 89 respectively on average over all domains comparison between atm and rf approaches shows rf outperforms atm at all sites with rf reporting mae values of 0 57 k for all domains compared to 1 98 k reported for atm a greater than one degree difference rmse shows a similar magnitude difference with 2 05 k reported for atm and 0 68 k reported for rf when averaged over all domains temporal variation in mean bias error mbe and mae can be seen in figs 6 and 7 respectively where a time series of mbe fig 6 and mae fig 7 is plotted for each domain and for each prediction approach atm blue rf red also included are toa bt error statistics toa bt gray and box and whisker plots of the average mbe or mae and associated standard deviation stdev shown as error bars within the domain results indicate good agreement between rf and level 2 collection 2 lst values with consistent mbe values throughout the year small stdev albeit values are slightly negative 0 34 k on average the atm approach produces a slightly less biased lst on average mbe 0 28 k however variability is greater larger stdev causing more uncertainty in day to day estimation making it less viable for real time applications similar patterns are found in mae time series estimates fig 7 where the atm approach generally provides low error estimates of nrt lst but the day to day variation is too great to produce a consistently low error in nrt lst conversely the rf approach provides consistent estimates of nrt lst values with little day to day variation fig 7 the pattern of increased error from the northernmost domain to the southernmost domain fig 7 box and whisker as previously mentioned is well visualized here toa bt mae values increase from north to south similar to mae results for atm fig 7 box and whisker conversely the rf approach shows little to no variation in error when transitioning from north to south remaining consistent throughout large day to day variation in atm based nrt lst estimates can be directly linked via eqs 1 3 to differences between atmospheric correction parameters on the predicted rt date t and the previously available level 2 collection 2 overpass date t 1 fig 8 provides a scatter plot of the average percent change for each atmospheric correction parameter between t and t 1 fig 8 y axis and the average atm based nrt lst mbe fig 8 x axis for all domains and all dates combined the change in urad drad and atran between t and t 1 show linear relationships with reported atm based nrt lst mbe values with no relationship reported for emis little discernible change between t and t 1 linear correlations are greatest for atran r2 0 87 with an increase in atran from t 1 to t leading to an increase in positive nrt lst bias urad and drad are similar to one another r2 0 57 and 0 53 respectively however slopes are more drastic and opposite in sign than atran indicating a decrease in urad and drad lead to an increase in nrt lst positive bias and vice versa fig 8 the high correlation between atran and lst mbe suggests differences in atran between overpasses is likely the strongest influence on atm based nrt lst error in terms of the rf model it is clear it works well when trained on pixels close in proximity to its application figs 6 and 7 however when evaluating the application of the rf model trained on combined landsat scenes and applied to the rip domain training set combined trainingset as mentioned in section 3 1 we find an increased temporal and spatial variability in mae and mbe compared to landsat level 2 collection 2 lst values and results presented above fig 9 fig 9 shows time series and box and whisker plots similar to above for mae fig 9 top and mbe fig 9 bottom for this new rf model application denoted as rip mix results suggest that although the rf approach still produces more reliable nrt lst estimates compared to atm its training and application are reliant on geographical location and is not likely transferable to other regions without creating explicit training sets 3 3 spatial analysis of nrt lst spatial comparisons between atm based nrt lst fig 10 a and rf based nrt lst fig 10 c for selected dates in july and august for domains bar dav slm and rip are presented in fig 10 also included are the differences between predicted nrt lst and level 2 collection 2 lst for the associated date and domain atm fig 10 b rf fig 10 d presented domains go from north top bar to south bottom rip spatial evaluation mirrors previously presented results with atm based nrt lst estimates producing more spatial deviation from landsat level 2 collection 2 lst with remnants of the atmospheric correction parameter grid made visible in the difference maps fig 10 b less spatial deviation from landsat level 2 collection 2 lst is found for rf based nrt lst estimates although pockets of concentrated high errors 2 to 2 k can be found in different parts of the dav and slm domains fig 10 d regardless of approach positive error between predicted and landsat level 2 collection 2 lst correlates with terrain in the bar domain with values between 2 and 4 k aligning with areas of increased slope an evaluation of the distribution of error mbe for each domain and each model for all available dates in 2022 indicates the rf based approach has a consistent and prominent negative bias centered around 0 5 k aligning with previous results fig 11 maximum and minimum error remain between 2 k and 2 k for all domains conversely the atm based approach indicates a distribution of error that presents no consistent pattern with values mostly between 4 k and 4 k similar to previous analysis the atm approach introduces day to day variation causing larger and more sporadic errors when evaluated over the year that can be seen here while the rf approach remains more consistent and reports lower errors albeit slightly negative 3 4 impacts on eta estimation in order to determine the applicability of nrt lst in operational eta modeling efforts we used atm derived lst rf derived lst and landsat level 2 collection 2 lst as input to alexi disalexi to estimate eta lst was the only input parameter that varied between model runs alexi disalexi derived eta using landsat level 2 collection 2 lst as input served as our baseline estimate i e eta using fully processed and the highest quality input data available statistical measures were calculated between this baseline and eta derived from atm based nrt lst or rf based nrt lst similar to fig 7 a time series of atm based blue or rf based red eta mae values are presented in fig 12 also included are associated box and whisker plots for both approaches indicating the average mae and stdev over the modeling domains of bar dav slm and rip fig 12 top to bottom results generally follow patterns presented during the lst evaluation with rf based eta estimates indicating slightly less variation from day to day in comparison with atm based estimates also the largest day to day variation in nrt eta estimation is found at the southernmost rip domain where mae values range from 0 10 to 0 30 mm d 1 regardless of approach although rf based eta compares slightly better to baseline estimates differences to atm based eta estimates are minimal particularly considering the larger discrepancy between rf and atm derived lst estimates presented above fig 7 upon closer inspection we find that utilizing an nrt derived lst estimate regardless of approach results in an error in alexi disalexi derived eta between 0 05 and 0 30 mm d 1 for clear sky landsat dates in 2022 fig 13 fig 13 suggests error in lst is roughly correlated with error in eta with atm based eta reporting larger errors in eta associated with the larger errors in lst rf based eta errors are mostly concentrated at and below 0 2 mm day 1 with three dates all rip domain indicating errors above 0 2 mm day 1 fig 13 y axis histogram past validation efforts for vineyard and almond orchards within these domains resulted in mae values of roughly 1 0 mm day 1 on average knipper et al 2023 suggesting errors here are within alexi disalexi modeled eta uncertainty 4 discussion although the atm based approach is simple efficient and can be applied over any landsat scene the variability of atmospheric correction parameters between landsat overpasses appear large enough to propagate to nrt lst errors of 4 k over the landsat scenes studied here however when atmospheric parameters particularly atran which showed the most influence on nrt lst remain similar between overpasses the atm based approach may be used as a viable option to derive nrt lst from landsat rt tir imagery specifically if we use fig 8 as a metric nrt lst errors can generally be kept at or below 2 k if the percent change in atran urad and drad is below 25 for the landsat scenes studied here this may be sufficient depending on a user s application and required accuracy in lst the rf based approach is more complex and requires a training dataset characteristic of atmospheric correction parameters and lst archetypes found when applying in real time in the current study we used clear sky landsat 8 and landsat 9 imagery for the entirety of 2022 to create such a dataset which was for individual landsat scenes the creation of these initial datasets and the rf model setup including feature engineering requires more effort and computing capability than the atm based approach it also inhibits the ability to easily transfer to additional regions as an additional training set and model would be required see fig 9 however once created the rf based approach shows promising results with nrt lst estimates showing little to no day to day variability and low error mae 0 57 k on average the proposed rf approach and associated domain requirements work for applications where smaller regional analysis is performed i e within a landsat domain however scaling to regional domains e g entire state of california may not be practical without additional research focused on quantifying errors associated with geographical extents on input feature and output label datasets we are currently working on such an analysis under the openet project melton et al 2021 where random forest regression modeling approaches are being tested on landsat imagery over the entirety of the western united states yang et al in prep despite improved lst estimates the rf based approach does not provide statistically significant improvements to eta estimates when used as input to alexi disalexi in comparison to atm based nrt lst with error differences between both approaches small in relation to differences in nrt lst estimates this supports the overall framework of alexi disalexi which was designed to minimize the impact of lst uncertainty on et anderson et al 1997 regardless of the design linearity exists between error in lst estimates and eta suggesting more analysis is required to determine both the sensitivity of lst and how changes in lst drive internal flux differences within the alexi disalexi model more specifically the large number of non linear physically based equations dynamically interacting within alexi disalexi make it challenging to quantify the effect of individual variables including lst on eta we are working on a sensitivity analysis of alexi disalexi using the model agnostic algorithm shapley additive explanations shap to explain how input variables including lst affect eta for the study domains described in the current study fig 2 such work will establish the accuracy required for nrt lst imagery within alexi disalexi for application within irrigation management 5 conclusions timely and accurate eta is imperative for irrigation decision support particularly in drought stricken california the alexi disalexi eta modeling framework has proven reliable in estimating eta over unique canopy structures characteristic of cropping systems grown in california such as wine grape vineyards and almond orchards however operational application of alexi disalexi is inhibited by latency in satellite acquisition and timely post processing efforts including atmospheric correction of tir imagery to lst for which alexi disalexi is highly dependent the current study evaluated two simple approaches to derive lst in a timelier manner by taking advantage of the newly released landsat level 2 collection 2 dataset which provides both atmospherically corrected lst and associated atmospheric correction parameters both approaches were used within the alexi disalexi modeling framework to determine applicability of the approach to derive nrt eta results of the study indicate the atm based approach although simple and easily transferable to other regions does not provide day to day consistency in nrt lst values with a reported mae of 1 98 k when compared to landsat level 2 collection 2 lst for all domains conversely the rf based approach which adds complexity but indirectly addresses differences between landsat overpasses provides a consistent and fairly reliable estimate of nrt lst with an average mae of 0 57 k reported between domains despite consistency the rf based approach produces a persistent negative bias averaged at 0 34 k for all domains results also suggest the rf based approach is likely geographically sensitive evaluation of the rf model trained on combined landsat scenes not included within the rip domain show increased error in comparison to the rf model trained on one landsat scene geographically overlapping with the rip domain when used as input to the alexi disalexi modeling framework the rf based approach does not provide statistically significant improvements to eta estimates in comparison to atm based nrt lst regardless of approach mae of nrt eta is between 0 05 and 0 30 mm day 1 remaining within alexi disalexi uncertainty measured at vineyard and almond orchards within the studied domains 1 mm day 1 it is important to note that these modeled error estimates are also within the same order of magnitude as uncertainty in measured eta at eddy covariance ec tower locations bambach et al 2022 further suggesting that either nrt lst approach could suffice when applying the alexi disalexi model in nrt although further research and evaluation of the proposed methods is required if nrt eta estimates are to be made available on a larger scale presented work offers promise

8959,acquiring accurate measurements of crop consumptive water use in the form of evapotranspiration et is increasingly important in california cropping systems as demands for water resources shift under a changing climate growers use various methods for estimating et to guide irrigation management some of which are based on satellite remote sensing although this approach has proven reliable operational applications remain hindered by latency in satellite product delivery due in part to computationally expensive atmospheric correction steps this is particularly true in approaches that utilize thermal infrared tir imagery which is sensitive to atmospheric corrections the current study evaluates two approaches to derive a pseudo atmospherically corrected land surface temperature lst in near real time nrt for ingestion into the alexi disalexi et model evaluation is done for selected landsat scenes over california for the year 2022 both approaches take advantage of the landsat collection 2 dataset including availability of atmospheric correction parameters and atmospherically corrected lst the first approach is based on the radiative transfer equation rte and atmospheric correction parameters from previous overpass available in the collection 2 dataset the second is based on a random forest rf regression model using landsat collection 2 atmospheric correction parameters and lst as input for training results indicate the rf approach outperforms the rte approach with an average mean absolute error of 0 6 k compared to 2 0 k for the rte method the rte method produces more spatial and temporal variability in lst due to temporal differences in atmospheric transmissivity when used to estimate et we find little difference between nrt lst based et estimates and et derived using the collection 2 lst product albeit rf based et provides less day to day variation results suggest promise in using such an approach to derive lst and subsequently et in nrt and toward improving daily water management and irrigation efficiency in the vineyard and orchard systems of california data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction california agriculture is particularly susceptible to climate change and associated droughts and heat waves due to its reliance on surface and groundwater for irrigation this reliance and the sustainability of california agriculture is currently being tested as the southwestern united states endures a megadrought williams et al 2022 and regulatory efforts begin to constrain consumptive water use i e sustainable groundwater management act sgma the combination of both has created a situation where growers are required to farm the estimated 24 million operated acres valued at 50 billion dollars with diminishing water resources pushing the need within the grower community for better crop water use information for irrigation management usda nass 2020 census of agriculture historically growers have used varying methods and forms of evapotranspiration et to monitor crop water use for the purpose of scheduling irrigation some methods are ground based and use crop specific coefficients kc and local reference et eto estimates to derive a crop et etc i e fao methodology allen et al 1998 although simple and easy to apply operationally estimates are difficult to upscale to surrounding areas while crop coefficients are difficult to adjust both in space and time to field specific conditions e g stress ting et al 2016 satellite remote sensing and associated surface reflectance sr bands offer an ability to map kc like values through vegetative indices such as the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi providing more spatially explicit etc estimates singh and irmak 2009 kamble et al 2013 french et al 2020 however ndvi and other sr based products can be slow to respond to plant stress making them less useful for irrigation management where the monitoring of rapid changes in crop water use may be required moran 2003 glenn et al 2008 knipper et al 2019a b satellite retrievals of land surface temperature lst from thermal infrared tir imagery have been shown to be more sensitive to changes in crop water status due to sensitivity of soil and canopy temperatures to variable soil moisture availability moran 2003 several lst based actual et eta models have been developed over the past few decades including the mapping evapotranspiration with internalized calibration metric allen et al 2007 model the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998b model the operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop senay et al 2007 model and the paired atmosphere land exchange inverse alexi anderson et al 1997 model and flux disaggregation technique disalexi norman et al 2003 all approaches are being extensively validated in a wide range of cropping systems as part of the openet project melton et al 2021 however the alexi disalexi modeling framework has been specifically evaluated over wine grape vineyards and almond orchards in california as part of the grape remote sensing atmospheric profile and evapotranspiration experiment grapex kustas et al 2018 and tree crop remote sensing of evapotranspiration experiment t rex knipper et al 2023 respectively both projects focus on developing eta toolkits for irrigation management in the associated cropping systems of california the alexi disalexi eta model is based on the two source energy balance tseb norman et al 1995 approach which partitions lst measurements into soil and canopy components and solves the surface energy budget for the soil vegetation canopy and combined systems associated with a mixed pixel such an approach is advantageous in unique canopy systems such as vineyards and almond orchards where distinct crop rows vegetative canopy and interrows substrate soils characteristic of soil or cover crop are present although alexi disalexi derived eta has correlated well with ec flux tower observations in the past anderson et al 2011 2018 knipper et al 2020 semmens et al 2016 xue et al 2021 2022 its basis in tir imagery and by association lst makes operational applications difficult due to 1 latency in satellite data delivery i e time from satellite overpass to data availability and 2 computationally expensive and time consuming atmospheric correction steps required to convert tir imagery to lst in the past tir image processing steps for disalexi included downloading imagery as it becomes available applying an atmospheric correction model e g modtran berk et al 1989 and sharpening to 30 m spatial resolution using a data mining sharpening dms approach developed by gao et al 2012 initial data delivery for landsat 8 at sensor brightness temperature data in collection 1 was on the order of 14 26 days due to need to wait for updated ephemeris data to correct for an instrument failure of the scene selection mirror ssm position decoder adding to this delay the need for the end user to apply computationally expensive atmospheric correction steps the compound latency of the final eta product rendered it functionally obsolete for real time irrigation management decision making to reduce latency of public data delivery among other conditions landsat recently underwent a major reprocessing effort this effort resulted in the collection 2 dataset where advancements in data processing algorithm development and data access and distribution capabilities were made masek et al 2020 landsat collection 2 follows the same structured inventory of data products as collection 1 defined as tiers based on data quality and processing level specifically newly acquired landsat 8 oli tirs l8 data are processed and placed in the real time rt tier available for download 4 6 h after overpass l8 rt data are reprocessed using updated refined tirs parameters and transitioned to level 1 tier 1 or tier 2 and removed from the rt tier transition delay of 3 10 days improvement in per pixel geodetic accuracy and interoperability of l8 for collection 2 level 1 product generation was made according to story et al 2019 another advantage of landsat collection 2 is that level 2 processed data includes atmospherically corrected sr and tir bands providing analysis ready data including lst band designation st upon download allowing users to bypass the expensive atmospheric correction step all atmospherically corrected bands are included in the level 2 tier 1 or tier 2 scenes while the intermediate bands used to calculate lst i e atmospheric correction parameters via the radiative transfer equation rte yu et al 2014 jiménez muñoz et al 2009 are also included atmospheric correction parameters include atmospheric transmittance atran downwelled radiance drad upwelled radiance urad and emissivity of band 10 emis for landsat 8 oli tirs it takes approximately 4 11 days to process to collection 2 level 2 tier 1 or tier 2 landsat 9 oli 2 tirs 2 delivers collection 2 level 2 tier 1 or tier 2 products within 3 days of acquisition fig 1 the current study attempts to take advantage of the newly released collection 2 dataset and recently launched landsat 9 oli 2 tirs 2 imager to produce a near real time nrt lst image for input into the alexi disalexi model to subsequently derive nrt eta we evaluate two approaches each created with simplicity in mind as the goal is to shorten the time between landsat overpass and eta availability the first approach uses l8 and l9 rt tir imagery and applies atmospheric correction and emissivity parameters available from the previous landsat overpass landsat collection 2 level 2 dataset and applies them to the current image using the rte approach the second uses a random forest rf regression model to learn relationships between l8 and l9 rt tir imagery and level 2 collection 2 atmospheric correction parameters and lst products the rf model is trained tested and applied for individual and combined landsat scenes while maintaining separation between trained tested and applied pixels evaluation is done for l8 and l9 scenes during the year 2022 providing a combined 8 day revisit under clear sky conditions scenes encompass the northern coast of california north of san francisco and a majority of the central valley of california derived nrt lst estimates are compared to level 2 collection 2 lst products on concurrent days to determine the applicability of each approach nrt lst from both approaches and level 2 collection 2 lst products are then used to individually inform the alexi disalexi eta model to determine if proposed nrt lst products are capable of producing reliable eta estimates in nrt the goal of this study is to propose and evaluate a reliable and efficient method to derive a reputable lst image with low latency and computational expense for the purpose of deriving eta in nrt to improve irrigation decision support 2 material and methods 2 1 study domain the study domain encompasses a majority of the central valley of california and a portion of the northern coast of california and includes landsat scenes p045r033 p044r033 p043r034 and p042r035 fig 2 these landsat scenes are chosen as they provide coverage for individual wine grape vineyards being monitored as part of the usda ars grape remote sensing atmospheric profile and evapotranspiration experiment grapex kustas et al 2018 and individual almond orchards being monitored as part of the usda ars tree crop remote sensing of evapotranspiration experiment t rex fig 2 individual vineyards and almond orchards are indicated by red markers fig 2 et modeling domains for each are shown as gray blocks fig 2 and are used as boundaries to predict nrt lst and subsequently nrt eta explanation in subsequent sections 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 landsat imagery for lst estimation landsat collection 2 tiers inventory structure for data products are based on data quality and level of processing in the current study we use level 1 rt and tier 1 data products as they pertain to both landsat 8 oli tirs l8 and landsat 9 oli 2 tirs 2 l9 specifically l8 level 1 rt top of atmosphere toa reflectance tir and qa bit mask bands are downloaded as they become available 4 6 h after overpass and before they are reprocessed and transitioned to tier 1 and removed from the rt tier similarly l9 level 1 t1 sr tir and qa bit mask bands are downloaded as they become available 4 6 h after overpass note that l9 skips the rt designation so imagery is not removed from the level 1 tier one major advancement in the landsat collection 2 dataset is the inclusion of atmospherically corrected sr bands and lst band designation of st these atmospherically corrected bands are included in the level 2 tier 1 datasets and also include intermediate bands i e atmospheric correction parameters used to produce lst via the rte approach atmospheric correction parameters include atmospheric transmittance atran downwelled radiance drad upwelled radiance urad and emissivity of band 10 emis for l8 it takes approximately 4 11 days to process to collection 2 level 2 tier 1 l9 delivers collection 2 level 2 tier 1 products within 3 days of acquisition in the current study we use collection 2 level 2 tier 1 atmospheric correction parameters st atran st drad st urad and st emis surface temperature lst band designation st and the pixel quality attribute band qa pixel from both l8 and l9 2 2 2 alexi disalexi eta model input shared between alexi and disalexi include meteorological forcing information i e air temperature wind speed solar radiation vapor pressure and air pressure from the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr data set at 0 25 resolution and hourly to 3 hour time steps dee et al 2013 alexi uses landcover classification from the university of maryland umd global land cover dataset hansen et al 2000 and disalexi uses the national land cover dataset nlcd fry et al 2011 satellite remote sensing inputs to alexi include lst computed from 11 µm brightness temperature observations from goes east and goes west imager instruments brightness temperatures are atmospherically corrected using atmospheric profiles of temperature following the procedure in french et al 2003 leaf area index lai used to partition lst between canopy and soil components is obtained from the modis lai product mcd15a3h aggregated to goes resolution 4 km and interpolated to daily time steps the alexi model is currently run operationally over the continental united states conus producing daily eta estimates at 4 km spatial resolution and a 2 day latency from current date disalexi inputs include l8 and l9 collection 2 sr band imagery as well as harmonized landsat and sentinel 2 sr datasets hls data were acquired during the year 2022 for available cloud free days lai and ndvi at 30 m spatial resolution are created using hls band information following a procedure in gao et al 2020 that has been modified to include ground based lai measurements made at grapex vineyard sites kang et al 2022 and is based on machine learning high resolution lst maps were generated using l8 and l9 collection 2 lst and derived nrt lst approaches described below in section 2 3 sharpened from a native resolution of 100 30 m using a data mining sharpening dms approach developed by gao et al 2012 2 3 nrt lst approaches 2 3 1 previous atmospheric correction parameters approach atm the previous atmospheric correction parameters approach atm combines landsat collection 2 atmospheric correction parameters from the last processed st product with the uncorrected tir signal available in real time t1 for l9 and rt for l8 latency of 4 6 h after overpass for both the atm approach first takes the rt tir signal band 10 and applies eq 1 to obtain the top of atmosphere toa radiance 1 l λ t m l q cal t a l where lλ t is toa spectral radiance watts m 2 srad 1 μm for the rt image t ml is the band specific multiplicative rescaling factor from the metadata al is the band specific additive rescaling factor from the metadata and qcal t is the quantized and calibrated standard product pixel digital numbers dn for the rt image t atmospheric correction parameters urad drad atran and emis from the previous landsat collection 2 dataset overpass t 1 are then used in eq 2 to derive the surface emitted radiance oλ t 2 o λ t l λ t ura d t 1 atra n t 1 1 emi s t 1 dra d t 1 emi s t 1 once oλ t has been calculated we convert to a land surface temperature lst estimate via the planck function inversion given in eq 3 3 ls t atm t k 2 ln k 1 o λ t 1 where k1 and k2 are band specific thermal conversion constants from the metadata and lstatm t is land surface temperature in kelvin for the rt image date a schematic diagram of this process is shown in fig 3 such an approach is simple and computationally efficient adhering to the requirements for running any modeling system in real time however this approach assumes the change in atmospheric correction parameters is minimal between landsat overpasses i e between rt and level 2 collection 2 availability analysis presented here will determine whether temporal and spatial changes over selected landsat scenes in california are great enough to create inaccuracies in nrt lst that will propagate into erroneous et estimates 2 3 2 random forest approach rf the random forest approach rf also takes advantage of available landsat level 2 collection 2 atmospheric correction parameters atmospherically corrected lst and the tir signal available in real time however it attempts to address the possibility of differences in atmospheric conditions between landsat overpasses by developing machine learning relationships between the real time tir signal and level 2 collection 2 atmospheric correction parameters and lst from the previous landsat overpass date using all available data during the year 2022 as a training set as mentioned in section 2 2 1 landsat collection 2 real time rt and t1 for l8 and l9 respectively band 10 and qa bitmask are downloaded prior to being removed and transitioned to tier 1 tier 1 level 2 atmospheric correction parameters atran urad drad emis lst and qa bitmask are then downloaded as they become available the combination of real time 4 6 h latency and level 2 tier 1 4 11 day latency for l8 3 day latency for l9 information on same acquisition dates for the entirety of a year allows us to develop a rf model based on what will be available in real time feature engineering of the proposed rf model includes gathering band 10 images and associated qa bitmasks included in the rt tier for l8 and l9 these images are then converted to toa brightness temperature toa btt and pixels including clouds via qa bitmask are replaced with null next we search for the landsat level 2 collection 2 dataset that corresponds to the overpass prior to the rt overpass denoted as t 1 under clear sky conditions when all landsat scenes are available t 1 will be 8 days atmospheric correction parameters atrant 1 dradt 1 uradt 1 emist 1 lst lstt 1 and qa pixelt 1 are then taken for this previous date pixels including clouds are replaced with null then each excluding qa pixelt 1 is stored with pixels aligning with the already stored toa btt from the rt tier additionally we include the rt toa bt on the overpass prior to the rt overpass toa btt 1 lastly we obtain the level 2 collection 2 lst on the rt overpass lstt and again mask for clouds and store with pixels aligning with the previously stored datasets once all data are compiled pixels defined as null are removed leaving only cloud free pixels for training purposes we additionally remove pixels that fall within a predefined domain used for et modeling within the grapex and t rex projects these domains are shown in fig 1 and will be used later to test the approach as unseen data points after these pixels are removed a random sampling of the dataset 3 outside the domains is taken resulting in a n by 8 dataset n number of pixels 7 features and 1 label as shown in fig 4 that is stored for each rt date and landsat scene note that the random sampling of 3 provides a training set of roughly 1 0 106 to 1 5 106 samples for each individual feature on each landsat overpass date the random sampling percentage was chosen to provide adequate training samples while maintaining computational efficiency after all dates and tiles are compiled we combine all dates from each individual landsat scene creating landsat scene specific training sets e g p045r033 trainingset p044r033 trainingset p043r034 trainingset p042r035 trainingset in addition to these training sets we also create one based on a combination of landsat scenes daily datasets for p045r033 p044r033 and p043r034 are combined and a random sample of 33 to remain consistent with scene specific training sets is taken to create a combined training set combined trainingset this dataset is used to predict lst for p042r035 rip domain under unseen conditions to test potential problems with applying the rf model over regions not included in the training process using these training sets we test the suitability of the rf approach in two ways first we take each training set and randomly select 80 of the dataset for training and 20 for testing following the pareto principle an evaluation of multiple selected training and testing datasets found a similar distribution of values including the range preventing possible poor extrapolation error statistics are produced on the testing dataset for each individual dataset p045r033 trainingset p044r033 trainingset p043r034 trainingset p042r035 trainingset combined trainingset and are denoted as rf t second we mimic a real time application of the rf model by iterating through available landsat rt image dates and apply the rf model using rt tir signals band10 dnt fig 3 with the previous dates landsat collection 2 level 2 atmospheric correction parameters atrant 1 dradt 1 uradt 1 emist 1 and lst lstt 1 following the procedure described above and provided as a schematic in fig 4 once all inputs to the rf model have been collected features we remove cloud pixels via the qa mask and apply the rf model to predict pseudo atmospherically corrected lst for that date lstrf t error statistics are produced by comparing this prediction lstrf t against the landsat level 2 collection 2 lst product aligning with the rt date lstt note that when mimicking a real time application the rf model is only applied for pixels within the defined et modeling domain fig 4 domain which were omitted during the training process 2 4 alexi disalexi et model the alexi anderson et al 1997 anderson et al 2007 and associated disaggregation approach disalexi anderson et al 2004 are based on the two source energy balance tseb model norman et al 1995 tseb works by partitioning lst into soil and canopy components ts and tc respectively using a local vegetation cover fraction fc estimated from retrievals of leaf area index lai according to eq 4 4 lst f c t c 1 f c t s individual temperature components are then used within a temperature gradient resistance system of equations designed to solve the surface energy budget for both soil and canopy components 5 r ns r nc g h s h c λ e s λ e c where rn is the net radiation w m 2 h is the sensible heat flux w m 2 g is the soil heat flux w m 2 and λe is the latent heat flux w m 2 subscripts s and c represent fluxes associated with the soil and canopy components of the pixel respectively λec is first estimated by proxy using a modified priestley taylor formulation priestley and taylor 1972 and λes is estimated as the residual to eq 5 if les is found to be negative unlikely midday the priestley taylor coefficiecnt used to compute lec is iteratively throttled back from its potential value of 1 26 to simulate impacts of canopy stress daily et mm day 1 is estimated by upscaling the summation of λec and λes taken at landsat overpass time to a daily value mj m 2 day 1 by conserving the ratio of latent heat to insolation during daylight hours cammalleri et al 2014a 2014b and then converting to mass flux units the latent heat of vaporization 2 45 mj kg 1 for more information on the alexi disalexi framework and its application in vineyards and almonds the reader is referred to knipper et al 2023 3 results 3 1 rf model evaluation rf t suitability of the rf approach to derive nrt lst was first determined by training and testing on datasets created for each landsat scene p045r033 trainingset p044r033 trainingset p043r034 trainingset p042r035 trainingset combined trainingset we randomly selected 80 for training and 20 for testing for each individual dataset as noted above seven features included atrant 1 dradt 1 uradt 1 emist 1 lstt 1 toa btt 1 and toa btt while the target variable was lstt fig 4 after training each individual rf model was run using the test dataset as input to predict lst lstrf t for those test pixels error statistics were calculated between predicted lstrf t and lstt values in the testing dataset and are shown in table 1 results indicate that the rf models are capable of deriving an atmospherically corrected lst image with good agreement when training and testing using an 80 20 split with an average mean absolute error mae of 0 33 k for the individual landsat scene rf models and 0 52 k for the combined rf model table 1 when transitioning from the northernmost landsat scene p045r033 to the southernmost p042r035 we find mae increases from 0 21 k to 0 43 k respectively also statistical measures are better for the individually trained landsat tiles p045r033 p044r033 p043r034 and p042r035 when compared to the rf model that was trained on the combination of the first three tiles and applied to p042r035 table 1 combined this suggests that geographic location may play a role in developing a rf model based on the features and target suggested here feature importance refers to different techniques used to assign a numerical score 0 1 to input features based on how relevant each is to the target the higher the importance value the more important it is in predicting the target variable and vice versa importance scores are calculated using the gini importance for each rf model and are reported in fig 5 feature importance scores indicate that on average over all rf models toa btt is the most relevant in predicting lstt when compared to other features although minimal by comparison stt 1 appears to be the second most important feature with atmospheric correction parameters indicating 0 01 importance scores for all rf models reported importance score ratings are not surprising given toa btt and lstt are correlated more directly as values are for the same date while remaining features are on the previous date note that the importance should not be interpreted as correlations or strength coefficients as they do not represent a dependency with the target therefore features other than toa btt are not useless when toa btt and stt values are compared directly to one another we find a linear correlation r2 0 67 on average for all scenes including combined however when attempting to predict lstt based on a fitted linear regression model using toa btt as input error statistics worsen with an average mae of 1 34 k between landsat training sets including combined not shown moreover additional feature engineering removing combinations of less important features i e atmospheric correction parameters and subsequently training the rf model results in similar error statistics as the linear model with average mae of 1 29 k over all landsat scene training sets including combined not shown as a result regardless of how the additional features appear to be less useful when building the model we continue to include them as there are likely instances of non linearity and when additional features provide valuable information 3 2 mimicked operational application of nrt lst approaches to best mimic operational applications we iterate through saved l8 and l9 rt tir images t and use the preceding landsat overpass level 2 collection 2 datasets t 1 to derive lst on the rt image date t using both atm and rf approaches such an approach allows us to estimate nrt lst using parameters that would be available in real time error statistics are calculated using level 2 collection 2 lst as the truth observed value and atm or rf derived lst as the predicted value table 2 also included are error statistics between toa btt and level 2 collection 2 lstt column labeled toa bt table 2 which provides an uncorrected estimate and baseline for the degree of correction required for the thermal band for each domain note that pixels used as input for each approach are those that fall within the et modeling domains bar dav slm rip described in section 2 1 and section 2 3 2 and shown in fig 1 domain and not the entire landsat scene this allowed the rf model to be applied without having been previously trained using the same pixel information results suggest that differences between the toa bt uncorrected and level 2 collection 2 lst increase from the northernmost domain bar to the southernmost domain rip with mae increasing from 4 52 k to 6 46 k respectively following results presented in section 3 1 such differences propagate to the atm and rf models with both performing better over bar compared to rip atm and rf both show improvement over uncorrected toa bt with mae decreasing by 62 and 89 respectively on average over all domains comparison between atm and rf approaches shows rf outperforms atm at all sites with rf reporting mae values of 0 57 k for all domains compared to 1 98 k reported for atm a greater than one degree difference rmse shows a similar magnitude difference with 2 05 k reported for atm and 0 68 k reported for rf when averaged over all domains temporal variation in mean bias error mbe and mae can be seen in figs 6 and 7 respectively where a time series of mbe fig 6 and mae fig 7 is plotted for each domain and for each prediction approach atm blue rf red also included are toa bt error statistics toa bt gray and box and whisker plots of the average mbe or mae and associated standard deviation stdev shown as error bars within the domain results indicate good agreement between rf and level 2 collection 2 lst values with consistent mbe values throughout the year small stdev albeit values are slightly negative 0 34 k on average the atm approach produces a slightly less biased lst on average mbe 0 28 k however variability is greater larger stdev causing more uncertainty in day to day estimation making it less viable for real time applications similar patterns are found in mae time series estimates fig 7 where the atm approach generally provides low error estimates of nrt lst but the day to day variation is too great to produce a consistently low error in nrt lst conversely the rf approach provides consistent estimates of nrt lst values with little day to day variation fig 7 the pattern of increased error from the northernmost domain to the southernmost domain fig 7 box and whisker as previously mentioned is well visualized here toa bt mae values increase from north to south similar to mae results for atm fig 7 box and whisker conversely the rf approach shows little to no variation in error when transitioning from north to south remaining consistent throughout large day to day variation in atm based nrt lst estimates can be directly linked via eqs 1 3 to differences between atmospheric correction parameters on the predicted rt date t and the previously available level 2 collection 2 overpass date t 1 fig 8 provides a scatter plot of the average percent change for each atmospheric correction parameter between t and t 1 fig 8 y axis and the average atm based nrt lst mbe fig 8 x axis for all domains and all dates combined the change in urad drad and atran between t and t 1 show linear relationships with reported atm based nrt lst mbe values with no relationship reported for emis little discernible change between t and t 1 linear correlations are greatest for atran r2 0 87 with an increase in atran from t 1 to t leading to an increase in positive nrt lst bias urad and drad are similar to one another r2 0 57 and 0 53 respectively however slopes are more drastic and opposite in sign than atran indicating a decrease in urad and drad lead to an increase in nrt lst positive bias and vice versa fig 8 the high correlation between atran and lst mbe suggests differences in atran between overpasses is likely the strongest influence on atm based nrt lst error in terms of the rf model it is clear it works well when trained on pixels close in proximity to its application figs 6 and 7 however when evaluating the application of the rf model trained on combined landsat scenes and applied to the rip domain training set combined trainingset as mentioned in section 3 1 we find an increased temporal and spatial variability in mae and mbe compared to landsat level 2 collection 2 lst values and results presented above fig 9 fig 9 shows time series and box and whisker plots similar to above for mae fig 9 top and mbe fig 9 bottom for this new rf model application denoted as rip mix results suggest that although the rf approach still produces more reliable nrt lst estimates compared to atm its training and application are reliant on geographical location and is not likely transferable to other regions without creating explicit training sets 3 3 spatial analysis of nrt lst spatial comparisons between atm based nrt lst fig 10 a and rf based nrt lst fig 10 c for selected dates in july and august for domains bar dav slm and rip are presented in fig 10 also included are the differences between predicted nrt lst and level 2 collection 2 lst for the associated date and domain atm fig 10 b rf fig 10 d presented domains go from north top bar to south bottom rip spatial evaluation mirrors previously presented results with atm based nrt lst estimates producing more spatial deviation from landsat level 2 collection 2 lst with remnants of the atmospheric correction parameter grid made visible in the difference maps fig 10 b less spatial deviation from landsat level 2 collection 2 lst is found for rf based nrt lst estimates although pockets of concentrated high errors 2 to 2 k can be found in different parts of the dav and slm domains fig 10 d regardless of approach positive error between predicted and landsat level 2 collection 2 lst correlates with terrain in the bar domain with values between 2 and 4 k aligning with areas of increased slope an evaluation of the distribution of error mbe for each domain and each model for all available dates in 2022 indicates the rf based approach has a consistent and prominent negative bias centered around 0 5 k aligning with previous results fig 11 maximum and minimum error remain between 2 k and 2 k for all domains conversely the atm based approach indicates a distribution of error that presents no consistent pattern with values mostly between 4 k and 4 k similar to previous analysis the atm approach introduces day to day variation causing larger and more sporadic errors when evaluated over the year that can be seen here while the rf approach remains more consistent and reports lower errors albeit slightly negative 3 4 impacts on eta estimation in order to determine the applicability of nrt lst in operational eta modeling efforts we used atm derived lst rf derived lst and landsat level 2 collection 2 lst as input to alexi disalexi to estimate eta lst was the only input parameter that varied between model runs alexi disalexi derived eta using landsat level 2 collection 2 lst as input served as our baseline estimate i e eta using fully processed and the highest quality input data available statistical measures were calculated between this baseline and eta derived from atm based nrt lst or rf based nrt lst similar to fig 7 a time series of atm based blue or rf based red eta mae values are presented in fig 12 also included are associated box and whisker plots for both approaches indicating the average mae and stdev over the modeling domains of bar dav slm and rip fig 12 top to bottom results generally follow patterns presented during the lst evaluation with rf based eta estimates indicating slightly less variation from day to day in comparison with atm based estimates also the largest day to day variation in nrt eta estimation is found at the southernmost rip domain where mae values range from 0 10 to 0 30 mm d 1 regardless of approach although rf based eta compares slightly better to baseline estimates differences to atm based eta estimates are minimal particularly considering the larger discrepancy between rf and atm derived lst estimates presented above fig 7 upon closer inspection we find that utilizing an nrt derived lst estimate regardless of approach results in an error in alexi disalexi derived eta between 0 05 and 0 30 mm d 1 for clear sky landsat dates in 2022 fig 13 fig 13 suggests error in lst is roughly correlated with error in eta with atm based eta reporting larger errors in eta associated with the larger errors in lst rf based eta errors are mostly concentrated at and below 0 2 mm day 1 with three dates all rip domain indicating errors above 0 2 mm day 1 fig 13 y axis histogram past validation efforts for vineyard and almond orchards within these domains resulted in mae values of roughly 1 0 mm day 1 on average knipper et al 2023 suggesting errors here are within alexi disalexi modeled eta uncertainty 4 discussion although the atm based approach is simple efficient and can be applied over any landsat scene the variability of atmospheric correction parameters between landsat overpasses appear large enough to propagate to nrt lst errors of 4 k over the landsat scenes studied here however when atmospheric parameters particularly atran which showed the most influence on nrt lst remain similar between overpasses the atm based approach may be used as a viable option to derive nrt lst from landsat rt tir imagery specifically if we use fig 8 as a metric nrt lst errors can generally be kept at or below 2 k if the percent change in atran urad and drad is below 25 for the landsat scenes studied here this may be sufficient depending on a user s application and required accuracy in lst the rf based approach is more complex and requires a training dataset characteristic of atmospheric correction parameters and lst archetypes found when applying in real time in the current study we used clear sky landsat 8 and landsat 9 imagery for the entirety of 2022 to create such a dataset which was for individual landsat scenes the creation of these initial datasets and the rf model setup including feature engineering requires more effort and computing capability than the atm based approach it also inhibits the ability to easily transfer to additional regions as an additional training set and model would be required see fig 9 however once created the rf based approach shows promising results with nrt lst estimates showing little to no day to day variability and low error mae 0 57 k on average the proposed rf approach and associated domain requirements work for applications where smaller regional analysis is performed i e within a landsat domain however scaling to regional domains e g entire state of california may not be practical without additional research focused on quantifying errors associated with geographical extents on input feature and output label datasets we are currently working on such an analysis under the openet project melton et al 2021 where random forest regression modeling approaches are being tested on landsat imagery over the entirety of the western united states yang et al in prep despite improved lst estimates the rf based approach does not provide statistically significant improvements to eta estimates when used as input to alexi disalexi in comparison to atm based nrt lst with error differences between both approaches small in relation to differences in nrt lst estimates this supports the overall framework of alexi disalexi which was designed to minimize the impact of lst uncertainty on et anderson et al 1997 regardless of the design linearity exists between error in lst estimates and eta suggesting more analysis is required to determine both the sensitivity of lst and how changes in lst drive internal flux differences within the alexi disalexi model more specifically the large number of non linear physically based equations dynamically interacting within alexi disalexi make it challenging to quantify the effect of individual variables including lst on eta we are working on a sensitivity analysis of alexi disalexi using the model agnostic algorithm shapley additive explanations shap to explain how input variables including lst affect eta for the study domains described in the current study fig 2 such work will establish the accuracy required for nrt lst imagery within alexi disalexi for application within irrigation management 5 conclusions timely and accurate eta is imperative for irrigation decision support particularly in drought stricken california the alexi disalexi eta modeling framework has proven reliable in estimating eta over unique canopy structures characteristic of cropping systems grown in california such as wine grape vineyards and almond orchards however operational application of alexi disalexi is inhibited by latency in satellite acquisition and timely post processing efforts including atmospheric correction of tir imagery to lst for which alexi disalexi is highly dependent the current study evaluated two simple approaches to derive lst in a timelier manner by taking advantage of the newly released landsat level 2 collection 2 dataset which provides both atmospherically corrected lst and associated atmospheric correction parameters both approaches were used within the alexi disalexi modeling framework to determine applicability of the approach to derive nrt eta results of the study indicate the atm based approach although simple and easily transferable to other regions does not provide day to day consistency in nrt lst values with a reported mae of 1 98 k when compared to landsat level 2 collection 2 lst for all domains conversely the rf based approach which adds complexity but indirectly addresses differences between landsat overpasses provides a consistent and fairly reliable estimate of nrt lst with an average mae of 0 57 k reported between domains despite consistency the rf based approach produces a persistent negative bias averaged at 0 34 k for all domains results also suggest the rf based approach is likely geographically sensitive evaluation of the rf model trained on combined landsat scenes not included within the rip domain show increased error in comparison to the rf model trained on one landsat scene geographically overlapping with the rip domain when used as input to the alexi disalexi modeling framework the rf based approach does not provide statistically significant improvements to eta estimates in comparison to atm based nrt lst regardless of approach mae of nrt eta is between 0 05 and 0 30 mm day 1 remaining within alexi disalexi uncertainty measured at vineyard and almond orchards within the studied domains 1 mm day 1 it is important to note that these modeled error estimates are also within the same order of magnitude as uncertainty in measured eta at eddy covariance ec tower locations bambach et al 2022 further suggesting that either nrt lst approach could suffice when applying the alexi disalexi model in nrt although further research and evaluation of the proposed methods is required if nrt eta estimates are to be made available on a larger scale presented work offers promise
