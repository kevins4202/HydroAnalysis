1765,managing groundwater is challenging because its below ground existence makes the resource difficult to monitor grace is an important tool as it provides the opportunity to monitor the storage of groundwater while grace based groundwater studies have focused on many regions across the globe studies that link scientific research to policymaking and groundwater practices are still limited this paper aims to provide recommendations for the improved use of grace data for the purpose of sustainable groundwater management to gain insight into this a policy delphi survey was conducted to collect opinions from both the academic and non academic communities although opinions are divergent and a mismatch exists between what science researchers currently supplies and what users practitioners demand we found that both communities acknowledged the potential of grace data and grace derived products for groundwater management and would be willing to collaborate to develop projects for practical applications better communication between researchers and practitioners was recommended as key for greater application of grace derived products into practice practitioners noted the need for reliable data for management responsibilities but prefer locally observed data the reliability of grace at local scales was raised by practitioners as a limitation despite advances in downscaling methods within the academic community the survey reveals a shared desire for more comparison between grace derived products with local measurements to determine whether grace products can be useful for informing local decisions using survey outcomes we propose three recommendations to improve the usefulness of grace derived and other remote sensing products for groundwater management and practices improving communication strategies increasing data accuracy transparency and accessibility to build trust and conducting solution oriented research keywords groundwater management remote

introduction 1 1 urgency for promoting groundwater sustainability groundwater resources account for over 90 of all liquid freshwater on earth unesco 2022 making it a critical source of water for agricultural domestic and industrial uses in many parts of the world groundwater sustains over 40 of global irrigation and provides drinking water for more than 2 5 billion people siebert et al 2010 unesco 2015 the sustainability of groundwater systems thus secures water and food supply chains from local to global scales dalin et al 2017 wada et al 2012 there is a growing recognition of the importance of understanding groundwater connections with the earth system and social ecological systems and grounding effective management on the basis of these interactions and functions that groundwater provides gleeson et al 2020a gleeson et al 2020b huggins et al 2023 yet groundwater has received less attention than surface water resources and has historically been unsustainably pumped and managed for human consumption bierkens wada 2019 de graaf et al 2019 groundwater systems worldwide are being threatened by a number of human induced factors and the changing environment many of the world s major aquifers are approaching their physical sustainability tipping points which means that the rates at which groundwater is being withdrawn are far greater than the rates at which it is being replenished either naturally or artificially famiglietti 2014 richey et al 2015 rodell et al 2018 these groundwater storage trends threaten water and food security as shown by a recent study finding that 20 of groundwater wells globally could be at risk of running dry jasechko perrone 2021 a regional study echoes to this finding that groundwater depletion rate in california s central valley and across the southwestern us has accelerated dramatically during the megadrought as heavy agricultural pumping has drawn aquifer levels to new lows with particularly rapid declines occurring since 2019 liu et al 2022 groundwater depletion has become a global crisis especially in the dry regions where groundwater is the primary source of water for agricultural production and people s livings such as the north china plain the northwest sahara region the high plains and central valley in the us northwest india canning basin in western australia and the middle east region famiglietti ferguson 2021 famiglietti 2014 sustainable management of groundwater resources is challenging due largely to the fact that groundwater is difficult to monitor given its below ground existence poor monitoring of groundwater relative to surface water has contributed to the failure of groundwater management and governance in many places evidenced by the extensive groundwater depletion globally the continuous investments in robust satellite hydrology programs in recent decades have enabled scientists to monitor changes in groundwater storage famiglietti et al 2015 despite tremendous growth in remote sensing for groundwater most data products are not well implemented in management and practice alley konikow 2015 the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace missions led by the national aeronautics and space agency nasa and co sponsored by the german space agency provide critical data on groundwater storage anomalies at a large spatial resolution rodell et al 2018 while grace was not designed as a management tool it may provide a transformational opportunity for policymakers to be aware of changes in groundwater storage and consider possible causal drivers when used in combination with social ecological economic or hydro climatic datasets for instance grace based studies have provided informative messages to affect water policy such as providing motivation and emphasizing the dire need for california s sustainable groundwater management act famiglietti et al 2011 in addition grace derived data have the potential to be incorporated with other socioeconomic data to understand interactions between groundwater and social ecological systems from the regional e g wang et al 2020 to global scales huggins et al 2022 1 2 grace and grace fo background and applications grace was a satellite mission that tracked variations in earth s gravity field from 2002 to 2017 the satellite mission operated as a giant scale in the sky relating mass changes in the earth to the measured gravity variations through data processing famiglietti and matthew 2013 the grace mission provided the first observational dataset of the changing mass of the earth and proved pivotal to myriad advances in oceanography glaciology and hydrology tapley et al 2019 rodell reager 2023 the success of grace was affirmed by the launch of its successor mission grace follow on grace fo in may 2018 landerer et al 2020 one additional instrument on the grace fo satellites is a laser ranging interferometer with significantly greater measurement precision than the k band ranging kbr system used by grace which are used to detect the satellite to satellite distance flechtner et al 2016 for simplicity we refer to the combined data record across grace and grace fo satellite missions as grace for the remainder of this paper grace can measure the changes in total water storage tws which is the sum of groundwater soil moisture surface water canopy water ice and snow storages along a vertically integrated profile several research centers around the world provide grace data with center for space research university of texas csr https www2 csr utexas edu grace geoforschungszentrum potsdam gfz https www gfz potsdam de grace and jet propulsion laboratory jpl https grace jpl nasa gov providing the official releases deriving gravity anomalies from grace is a complex process and several parameter and algorithm design choices have to be made to optimize the end goal hence even though all data are generated from the same level 1 information provided by the satellites the data from multiple centers typically show minor differences due to their data processing strategies initially the grace solutions were derived solely using spherical harmonics and while useful these suffered from several limitations including large leakage errors and unrealistic stripes along the north south direction correcting for these stripes would also risk removing some of the signal also effectively using grace data would require familiarity with spherical harmonics and geodesy in recent years mass concentrations or mascon products have been designed which offer locally constrained mass anomalies have reduced leakage errors do not require additional processing and are user friendly and accessible to a wider science community further attempts are being made to increase the resolution of grace data loomis et al 2019 save et al 2016 watkins et al 2015 currently for large scale regional or global applications jpl mascon solutions are considered to be most reliable due to the uncorrelation with neighboring mascons rodell et al 2018 however higher resolution mascon solutions from centers such as nasa goddard space flight center gsfc and csr are valuable for regional studies several studies use multiple tws data and consider their arithmetic mean as monthly tws anomalies e g humphrey et al 2016 still coarse resolution in combination with signal leakage errors across mascons latency lack of vertical resolution which component of tws is the signal coming from uncertainty around removal of non water gravity signals such as the glacial isostatic adjustment gia continue to remain challenges that limit wide spread use of grace data e g chen et al 2022 due to the coarse spatial resolution and limited accuracy the accurate quantification of mass variations using grace data has been challenging chen et al 2022 while the grace fo mission enabled the continuation of an observed data record it largely was not re designed to target limitations in the original grace mission in general the accuracy of grace is 2 cm in equivalent water height tapley et al 2004 and with an effective spatial resolution of about 150 000 to 200 000 km2 longuevergne et al 2010 however different grace derived products may have various accuracies due to different post processing approaches and substantial efforts have been done to quantify the associated uncertainties blazquez et al 2018 boergens et al 2022 landerer swenson 2012 loomis et al 2019 riegger et al 2012 these observations of anomalies in terrestrial water storage enabled global observations of water redistribution at regional to global scales rodell et al 2018 scanlon et al 2018 eicker et al 2016 while being sensitive to the spatial and temporal resolutions the grace data in addition to the terrestrial water storage research has obtained multiple implementations in hydrological studies for different purposes including groundwater monitoring evaluations of social ecological vulnerability e g huggins et al 2022 rodell et al 2007 yeh et al 2006 flood and drought detection e g reager et al 2014 houborg et al 2012 long et al 2014 thomas et al 2014 glacier ice mass change and many others tapley et al 2019 based on metadata retrieved from nasa s jet propulsion laboratory web of science and scopus grace based groundwater studies to date have been widely adopted by the hydrological research community and conducted on all continents except antarctica fig 1 a it is not surprising that most studies were conducted at the national and global scales fig 1b given effective spatial resolution of grace africa has received the most attention at the continental scale while china the us and india are three countries that have been most studied extensive grace based research has been conducted and a text mining of frequent terms that appeared in the abstract of these studies 903 as of july 2022 shows that existing groundwater studies were centered on a few central research questions the research interest in storage change has received the most attention fig 1c these studies use hydrological models and different sets of data in combination with grace data to estimate variations of groundwater storage over land underrepresented in this text mining are studies that focus on bridging the link between grace derived scientific output with management and or policymaking making this link could be an area of growth within the grace research community with more practical outcomes for sustainability transition of groundwater resources as can be seen in fig 1c cross disciplinary terms such as management policy and decision making have very few mentions in these studies less than 10 occurrences this indicates that the interface between science and policy is very weak in grace based studies and that the potential for grace to be incorporated in management and policymaking processes is currently underutilized 2 research questions and objectives it is imperative for research scientists and practitioners to collaborate and take action to protect groundwater resources at multiple levels famiglietti ferguson 2021 understanding the opinions of both scientists and practitioners on the potential of remote sensing products is the first step in seeking common interests for collective action therefore we conducted a survey of academic and non academic communities guided under an overarching question how can grace data and grace derived products be used to communicate with policymakers and stakeholders to aid in sustainable groundwater management following this question we asked three sub questions 1 what are the opinions of academic and non academic communities on the usefulness of grace for groundwater practices and management gwpm 2 why is grace not well applied to gwpm and 3 how could grace derived products be better operated for gwpm with these questions in mind this paper sets out to explore effective ways for the continued use of grace as the targeted product for inter and transdisciplinary communication for improved sustainable groundwater management this study is believed to be the first of its kind to provide insights into the link between grace research and groundwater practices 3 methods to solicit opinions from different perspectives we conducted two rounds of solicited online surveys we applied a policy delphi technique to the survey and used content analysis along with standard statistics to analyze responses 3 1 policy delphi approach the policy delphi method is a systematic policymaking method that allows a group of individuals to collectively work on a given problem turoff 1970 it was proposed as a tool to generate the strongest possible opposing opinions within a group of experts while remaining flexible for its users to make adjustments to meet their purposes through structured questions de loë et al 2016 turoff 1970 it is a time and cost efficient way to gather and evaluate expert or interest based knowledge through two to three rounds of communications and surveys manley 2013 turoff 1970 this method is particularly helpful for surveys that require inputs from different groups of individuals as it can help to reveal options identify points of agreement and disagreement and uncover the strength of evidence associated with diverse viewpoints de loë et al 2016 rayens hahn 2000 in this survey we followed a common procedure composed of three phases as shown in fig 2 we modified some of the components to suit our research purposes which are further explained in the following contexts 3 1 1 phase 1 preparation the first phase is the preparation which was aimed at clarifying the purpose of the survey building up a survey team and identifying potential participants the preparation phase involved several steps including the definition of research questions and statements that explain the background information building up a survey team identification of the panel e g sample size criteria and representations recruitment of participants and panel finalization the suggested number of participants to form a survey panel in the original policy delphi study was 10 to 50 turoff 1970 the small panel size is especially applicable to studies which have a specific focus or the topic requires the participation of highly specialized experts de loë et al 2016 to recruit appropriate participants we developed criteria and used a targeted search in combination with snowball sampling techniques specifically we targeted academic researchers with sophisticated knowledge and experience in the field of grace based groundwater research over three years of experience in grace with at least two publications were set as the criteria to identify appropriate researchers for non academic practitioners we targeted those who have at least three years of experience in gwpm and who are familiar with grace in the context of groundwater we recruited some participants through the networks of the survey team and then used the snowball sampling technique to identify hidden participants that are not within our own networks as snowball sampling can introduce biased samples we diversified to an extent the geophysical and professional representations of individuals through the chain of referrals to improve the representativeness of samples as a result a total of 48 candidates 21 researchers and 27 practitioners were identified and invited to participate in the survey through email contact only those who agreed in advance to participate in both rounds were sent the questionnaires in phase 2 the anonymity principle was applied to the survey which means that the identity of participants is only visible to the survey team while participants are not aware of each other s identity allowing for free expression of individual opinion 3 1 2 phase 2 convergence the convergence phase aims to use questions to solicit opinions from participants within two rounds of surveys which were run online both surveys were tested internally and refined prior to being sent to the panel steps in phase 2 involve designing and sending the questionnaire to selected participants analyzing responses and feedback to participants for further comments the first round survey aimed to identify opinions about the subject matter i e grace for gwpm the second round was designed according to the results of the first round to question solicited opinions to further compile agreed and disagreed points of view all responses were analyzed and feedback on the collected opinions of respondents was sent back to all participants during this phase survey questions were set around three research questions raised in this study in the first round survey questionnaires were designed around two types of questions open ended questions and rating questions open ended questions were designed to collect broad opinions on how grace observations can be better employed to aid in sustainable groundwater management seven open ended questions were designed to capture opinions of academic researchers while nine were designed for non academic practitioners we asked non academic practitioners two extra questions with the aim to affirm their familiarity with grace and to understand existing or preference tools they are applying to their gwpm these questions helped to understand the potential contribution of grace to the practice for rating questions participants were provided a list of candidate opinions about strategies for better utilizing the grace derived data and products in gwpm and asked to rate for relative agreement and priority with a range from 1 to 5 1 for mostly disagree and 5 for mostly agree in the second round survey questionnaires were organized into 15 multiple choice questions that were formulated to identify the most important considerations for improving the usefulness of grace products for gwpm questions were designed based on the results from the responses in the first round specifically questions in the first round were analyzed and sorted into seven themes based on text analysis of word similarity the applicability of grace for groundwater practices applicability needs of gwpm practice needs factors and features relevant to practitioners trust in grace derived messages trust opinions on collaborations collaboration communication for grace derived messages communication challenges for the application of grace derived products barriers and features relevant to data accuracy data accuracy opinions collected from respondents in the first round were unpacked into these themes to form choices for questions in the second survey the participants were given four options in each question and were asked to choose the one that best reflects their perspectives on the question extra comment space was provided for each question in case that participants had different opinions this round of survey was to identify points of agreement and disagreement and uncover the strength associated with diverse viewpoints from open ended questions in the first round survey 3 1 3 phase 3 summarization the final phase is to evaluate participants responses and summarize opinions unlike the traditional delphi method the policy delphi in this phase identifies a range of agreement and points of disagreement in order to explore all perspectives on a topic as a result we analyzed responses from both rounds of the survey and ranked critical opinions that have obtained the most agreement from both groups we also differentiated opinions from individual groups to examine the divergence of opinions between the two groups to analyze responses we applied content analysis see section 2 2 basic descriptive statistics e g percentage frequency count were also used to summarize the responses the final statement for the survey was compiled and distributed to all participants in this phase 3 2 content analysis of responses in this study we employed a basic content analysis krippendorff 2018 that uses quantitative and narrative techniques to unpack the responses of individuals and compile key opinions of both groups of participants in quantitative content analysis we used word and phrase counts to identify frequent views determining the relative importance of specific content in the whole collection of narrative descriptions from participants we then clustered these frequent contents into seven themes i e applicability practice needs trust collaboration communication barriers and data accuracy the text analysis was performed using the text2vec r package combined with nvivo 12 edhlund mcdougall 2019 selivanov et al 2016 specifically all participants responses to the open ended questions were first text mined using the text2vec r package the unpacked texts were then summarized and clustered into several groups by nvivo 12 based on word similarity of extracted terms and phrases results were also manually checked this quantitative content analysis helped to organize unstructured narratives into a structured format for better compiling and generalizing prominent opinions toward our research concern the narrative interpretative analysis was performed to interpret texts opinions that were clustered into each theme and to identify the extent to which agreement and disagreement have been reached within each group and between two groups this analysis helped to generalize opinions from each group of participants and to specify the divergence of views between the two groups 4 results 4 1 participants composition a total of 48 candidates 21 researchers and 27 practitioners were identified and invited to participate in the survey among all invited participants a total of 25 individuals participated in the first round survey with 14 academic researchers from 9 countries and 11 practitioners from 4 countries which are well representative of the population fig 3 in the second round survey questionnaires were redesigned and sent to the same individuals with a response rate of 76 among respondents to the second round survey 58 and 42 were academic researchers and practitioners respectively the academic researchers that participated in the surveys are mostly from universities with the rest from government funded research institutions e g national aeronautics and space administration nasa the chinese academy of science and natural resources canada the non academic practitioners are practitioners such as groundwater managers consultants members of funding agencies and groundwater advocates although we aimed to retain all participants between survey rounds not all were able to complete the survey in the second round however the ratio between academic researchers and non academic practitioners remained similar for both rounds of the survey 4 2 first round survey questions in the first round survey were raised in different ways based on academic and non academic standpoints using appropriate wording that aligns with the language familiar to different groups of participants for instance we asked about the needs of transdisciplinary projects in grace based groundwater studies without using the term transdisciplinary but work together to co develop projects in the questionnaire for non academic practitioners based on the text analysis 21 opinions were grouped from the unstructured answers of participants the grouped opinions were manually sorted to the defined themes i e applicability practice needs trust collaboration communication barriers and data accuracy and color coded into a heat map showing the frequency of occurrence of grouped opinions toward each theme fig 4 as can be seen in fig 4 a high level of agreement is reached on some points regarding applicability practice needs collaboration and communication the agreed opinions on applicability include two aspects 1 the potential of grace for groundwater practices is to use large scale observations on trends and patterns of groundwater storage change to prioritize regions for capacity building for improved management and 2 using local data to validate and or scale comparison that help to generalize patterns between large scale observation and small scale monitoring in terms of needs for practice both academic and non academic practitioners acknowledge the importance of downscaling and the development of easy to understand and easy to use tools they agree that communication and visualization is key for them to understand the possibilities of using grace for their practice as it can improve mutual understanding and create the trust that would nurture long term collaborations the spatial scale of grace is a major factor that reduces practitioners trust in grace products both groups express their willingness to collaborate with each other through co developing projects but some participants are not sure about effective approaches to improve these collaborations several reasons are identified as barriers for the application of grace derived products to practices in addition to the limitation of spatial resolution communication and interpretation skills are highlighted as other key barriers the lack of efficient communication and proper interpretation of grace derived messages has critically affected stakeholders trust in the data in some areas the large scale grace observations do not match local monitoring which diminishes local practitioners confidence in using grace derived information to guide their management and practices for rating questions fig 5 all academic researchers agree that co developing projects is the most effective way to make grace more applicable to decision makers and stakeholders and 92 of academic researchers agree that tailoring cohesive messages from grace can be efficient way for the communication between scientists and local practitioners another highly agreed upon opinion 77 suggests that diversifying communication channels for grace derived groundwater messages can be helpful to improve the usefulness of grace for practices on the other hand very few academic researchers 15 believe that connecting grace with global initiatives and agendas is necessary to improve its usefulness for practices from practitioners perspectives the top priority suggested is to develop easy to understand and easy to use tools or products for practical purposes 100 agreement other highly agreed upon viewpoints include transdisciplinary collaboration 90 diversifying communication channels 80 downscaling grace data 80 and connecting grace for national and global initiatives 80 interestingly the high disagreement found between academic and non academic groups is the need to link grace research to national and global initiatives 15 of academic vs 80 of non academic in comparing answers of both groups the top 3 agreed upon opinions are the need for tailoring cohesive messages for better communication co developing research projects and diversifying communication channels to raise public awareness of groundwater protection the opinions in academic group are more consistent with more common opinions for most cases than that of the non academic group on the other hand opinions in non academic group are more diverse than those in academic group with a similar percentage of agreement and disagreement on some aspects including citizen science user driven science and interdisciplinary value 4 3 second round survey an acceptable agreement threshold percentage varies in the literature ranging from 50 to 75 hasson et al 2000 in some studies over 70 was recommended to be the best representation of agreement green et al 1999 however other studies suggested that consensus should be equated with at least 51 agreement amongst respondents the lower percentage is especially suitable for those surveys with relatively small sample size and have less than three rounds of surveys loughlin moore 1979 hasson et al 2000 given that opinions between scientists and practitioners are divergent a cutoff of 51 was used to determine agreements on opinions combining the responses of the two groups fig 6 five opinions reached an agreement regarding some aspects in communication q12 collaboration q9 trust q8 barriers q5 and applicability q2 among these agreed upon opinions effective strategy to nurture trust through long term connections between academic and non academic communities obtained the most agreement in the response 79 of participants agreed that establishing national groundwater sustainability initiatives with long term 5 10 year funding especially if it can be in hotspot regions can be the most effective strategy to create stable connections for building trust between scientists and practitioners in terms of collaboration the most effective collaborative manner was suggested 63 to be co developing grace based groundwater projects as showcases to establish and expand collaborations some 58 agreement was reached on two opinions regarding overcoming barriers and the improvement of grace applicability to practices in the first round survey practitioners pointed out their limited capacity due to political and technical reasons to make policy changes as a key barrier for grace application to overcome such a barrier more than half of the participants recommended that the academic community communicate with and educate policy makers at all levels when participants were asked about the greatest potential of grace for small scale gwpm 58 of participants chose the integration of grace with hydrological models or other remote sensing products greater than other options including downscaling products 16 linking with local observation data 26 and index development for target management 0 however it should be noted that there are variabilities in other aspects within the themes with some cases showing diversified opinions e g q6 in barriers and other cases revealing two dominant opinions e g q13 in communication q4 in applicability in addition consensus has not been reached in terms of practice needs q15 and data accuracy q14 according to the survey opinions toward the seven themes are divergent between the two groups with less agreement obtained on a few themes the most agreed upon opinions within practitioners group are around themes of data accuracy 75 trust 75 practice needs 63 and communication 63 on the other hand the agreed upon opinions within the academic group are relatively fewer than practitioners with the most agreed upon opinions centered on trust 82 communication 73 collaboration and applicability both 64 fig 7 further shows the discrepancy of opinions between the two groups of participants for instance in a question about contents that grace can provide for better communications with decision makers to improve its usefulness for practice 73 of academic researchers agreed that linking anomalies to practice at smaller scales to help identify major contributors is effective however only 25 of non academic practitioners agreed with this opinion but 50 agreed that detailed and non technical interpretations of grace derived products and data are more important which was not selected by any academic researchers additionally the accuracy of grace derived data to represent local groundwater issues is a key concern of practitioners in the first round when asked about the best way to improve data accuracy and reduce the uncertainties of grace derived products in the second round survey the answer of practitioners was relatively consistent with 75 of agreement on using local observation data for validation however researchers gave diverse options suggesting not only using local observation data for validation but also integrating with locally calibrated hydrological models high resolution remote sensing products and generalizing patterns through comparisons between trends in large scale and local observations similarly higher agreement was reached within the non academic group than academic group on the highest priority for advancing the practical application of grace and grace derived products for gwpm fig 7 academic researchers suggested that advancing the practical application of grace should be done through communicating results through easy to understand knowledge products tailored to user needs 18 developing transdisciplinary collaboration and co developed projects 36 improving the resolution downscaling and accuracy of grace derived products 18 and integrating grace data with other data sources and methods 27 from the practitioners perspective however improving the resolution downscaling and accuracy of grace derived products was not given priority while highlighting the importance of the integration of grace data with other data sources and methods to summarize we combined results from two rounds of surveys to identify the highly agreed upon opinions from participants as can be seen in table 1 opinions on the needs of practices have not been reached to an agreement during both rounds of survey although some opinions are agreed upon within individual group of participants less agreement has been reached between the two groups for instance downscaling grace derived products and the development of easy to understand and use tools are highly agreed upon among practitioners as ways to improve applicability of grace for practice but they have not been widely agreed upon by academic researchers both groups agreed that the integration with hydrological models and other remote sensing products is an effective way to improve the applicability of grace data in practice in terms of collaboration both groups of participants expressed willingness to collaborate and suggested co developing transdisciplinary projects as the start although three ways i e diversifying communication linking with practices to help identify contributors of groundwater issues and tailoring communication were agreed by the academic group to be the key for more effective communication of grace derived messages with decision makers and stakeholders but they were not agreed upon within non academic group data accuracy is an important concern of practitioners when trying to apply grace in practice although participants pointed out many barriers such as resolution limitation and political capacity both groups agreed that communicating with policy makers at all levels is the breakthrough to overcome barriers for the grace application although different ways were suggested to create trust between academic and non academic communities given different perspectives of the participants there is consensus that mutual trust can be achieved through establishing national groundwater sustainability initiatives 5 discussion multiple sentiments reflected in our survey echo previous statements that grace is not a ready for use management tool and grace derived products need to be improved for practice purposes particularly at scales smaller than the resolution of grace famiglietti and matthew 2013 döll et al 2014 lall et al 2020 apart from commonly known limitations i e resolution and uncertainties due to data processing we have observed two other major barriers between science and policy divergent opinions between academic and non academic communities towards how grace derived information could be implemented for gwpm and the mismatch between what grace based science can provide and users demands for practical applications we discuss below possible reasons for these barriers that affect the application of grace to practices first inherent limitations in the spatial resolution of grace data and potential errors in retrieval algorithms reduce the potential of grace for gwpm grace and grace fo data are useful but their spatial resolution is limited by their orbits and the lack of complementary satellite missions wiese et al 2022 this is commonly acknowledged by the scientific community as the most significant barrier for grace to provide operational data on groundwater changes for management authorities and stakeholders famiglietti and matthew 2013 alley konikow 2015 sheffield et al 2018 gleeson et al 2021 practitioners in our survey also point to this as the dominant factor affecting their trust in grace derived messages applicable to solve local groundwater issues moreover grace data are somewhat restricted in their applications in long term hydrological changes due to data gaps sun et al 2020 li et al 2021 and time latency e g hachborn et al 2017 it is possible to use modeling to downscale the products to finer resolutions for better applications e g iqbal et al 2017 miro famiglietti 2018 vishwakarma et al 2021 as of recently there is no universal downscaling method that is applicable to all places and scenarios as many of these methods were developed for a specific purpose which requires calibration when applied to other case studies additionally the challenges in using grace data arise from various uncertainties including errors related to atmospheric oceanic and glacial isostatic effects signal degradation due to gravity measurement noise and systemic errors correlated to spatial and spectral domains landerer swenson 2012 wiese landerer watkins 2016 filtering methods khaki et al 2018 vishwakarma et al 2016 and correction schemes used to store the signal damage due to filtering vishwakarma et al 2018 second divergent opinions held by academic and non academic communities affect mutual understanding hampering the application of grace derived products some of the opinions held by academic and non academic communities toward the usefulness of grace for gwpm are divergent fig 7 the divergence of opinions may stem from two reasons 1 the difference in background experience and training between scientists and practitioners and the way the grace derived data and products are produced and delivered 2 discrepancies in results between grace observations and local measurements or official governance data on groundwater storage in some regions grace derived data and products contain large amount of technical and scientific content which is more readily understood by the academic community but may be challenging for many practitioners to extract information from and make informed decisions on the basis of on the other hand discrepancies in results have been identified between estimates of grace derived groundwater storage changes and the official groundwater budgets castellazzi et al 2018 such discrepancies also pointed out by many practitioners in our surveys make local observations of wells data the preferable resources for local practitioners third mismatch between scientific supply and practitioner demand indicates ineffective communication between these groups with the impact of reducing the potential of grace derived products by grace are viewed by practitioners to be less informative to directly affect practical decision making because the resolution is unable to resolve changes in groundwater storage at scales at which their management activities usually take place although grace fo improved the measurement precision which can results in more accurate water storage measurements flechtner et al 2016 but the main limitations of coarse spatial and temporal resolution in the grace data record are yet unaddressed current plans for a future mass change mission an improvement upon grace and grace fo in spatial resolution are in the works and may be more applicable to a wider range of water resource characterization and management activities globally nasem 2018 in addition the mismatched opinions are indicative of the lack of communications that help to improve understanding of each other s capacities and duties creating common interests in the survey academic opinions seem to be more science driven while practitioners opinions tend to be more solution oriented for example a large proportion of practitioners believe that using local observation data to validate grace derived data is the best way to improve its accuracy while academic researchers tend to choose to integrate with other remote sensing products although both are equally important furthermore grace based studies are largely driven by natural scientists who usually have less willingness to engage with practitioners than do social scientists in our survey some academic researchers stated that there is no need for scientific community to know practitioners needs because practitioners know what their needs are the limited public engagement would have limited the production of use inspired science and impeded the mobilization of grace knowledge to practitioners and the public 6 recommendations for sustainable groundwater management using grace efforts have been widely made to overcome the limitation of grace for applications and much of the attention has been drawn in many previous grace studies that emphasized the practicality of grace data maximizing its practical potentials see chen et al 2022 however a written piece that incorporates perspectives of both grace products producers and users to improving such potential practicality is a lack according to collected opinions and discussed barriers we propose three recommendations that broadly aim to facilitate the communication and mobilization of grace based knowledge for the improved utilization of grace derived products for gwpm these recommendations may be applicable for other remote sensing products and thus can serve as a broader resource for other remote sensing applications for sustainable management of natural resources 6 1 improving communication strategies active iterative and inclusive communication between scientists and policymakers as well as the public is crucial to mobilize knowledge for actions cash et al 2003 white et al 2010 however not all researchers are willing to communicate their research with non academic groups part of the reason for this is that some researchers do not know what to communicate have undertrained communication skills and in some cases the content communicated is not well targeted for the audience resulting in ineffective knowledge mobilization improving communication effectiveness to facilitate the mobilization of grace and other remote sensing knowledge could be achieved through close engagement and collaboration tailoring products that can be used for education and collaboration purposes and diversifying communicating channels and increasing frequency 6 1 1 creating proactive two way engagement and close collaboration engagement and collaboration are effective ways to improve mutual understanding and create trust which further helps overcome barriers between academic researchers and non academic practitioners engagement should be in a format that is open for bidirectional dialogues for example grace scientific researchers communicate their work with practitioners e g water managers decision makers and industrial stakeholders and at the same time proactively ask for their feedback on whether the research has answered questions they have this two way communication process helps create salience of knowledge i e studies that reflect decision needs and legitimacy i e inclusiveness of perceptions from all parties which increase communication effectiveness cash et al 2003 patt 2000 it does so as it not only educates practitioners about grace and its technical capacity allowing them to express their perceptions but also enables researchers to know the needs of practitioners and dilemmas faced by decision makers in such a way researchers can adjust their research questions to solve the mismatch between science supply and practice demand additionally engagement should start from the beginning to the end of any collaborative projects and be conducted in multiple formats such as meetings workshops and seminars on a regular basis it has been observed that mobilizing knowledge for actions can be reduced if the communication takes place only at the early stages of any projects cash et al 2003 hence the constant involvement of both parties in the projects allows grace researchers to understand local groundwater issues and to compare the observations between grace and in situ measurements e g identifying mismatch and solutions this process increases credibility of grace derived products by using local data and knowledge provided by practitioners in the meantime local practitioners can gradually obtain grace knowledge and build up their trust in the products 6 1 2 tailoring easy to understand messages and tools that can be used for education and collaboration purposes contents used for communication are critical as they affect to what extent the grace derived messages are meaningful for practitioners a smooth communication can benefit from mutual understanding built on the language that is understandable between communicators and receivers for example consistent terminologies can be co developed beforehand such as avoiding technical terms such as spherical harmonics common in the grace literature in our surveys both communities expressed willingness to collaborate in the first round use friendly tools and easy to understand messages were named to be the top needs by practitioners to produce such meaningful products promoting the co development of projects is highly agreed by both communities as it can help to produce knowledge and solution base that meets the local users needs co developing grace based groundwater transdisciplinary projects can be initiated in typical regions where grace data have been shown to guide decision making in different contexts these projects can be viewed as showcases which can be used as key communicating contents to establish and expand collaborations as further suggested by the survey participants the definition of showcase problems should include significant economic and social impact and solutions that can be achieved in a 5 10 year window the actual implementation of such showcase solutions will provide the driver for future funding and ensure the long term continuity that will be required to deal with many of these big problems a quote from participants narratives creating groundwater sustainability initiatives that are supported by secured funding for research and development r d was also seen by most of our participants to be an effective way to build common interests and trust and keep both communities collaborating in the long run for example initiatives could be made to collectively identify pathways forward groundwater protection in hotspot regions such as the north china plain and northern india 6 1 3 diversifying communicating channels and increasing frequency of communication diversifying communication can be achieved by using communication mediations such as boundary organizations cash et al 2003 these boundary organizations concentrate their efforts on bridging the linkage between knowledge producers academic researchers and users non academic practitioners aiming at mobilizing scientific knowledge into practices through communication and mediating conflicts guston 1999 the boundary organization has been well documented as the effective bridge in water sciences such as the decision center for a desert city at arizona state university white et al 2008 white et al 2010 crona parker 2011 in the groundwater field the international groundwater resources assessment centre igrac is a successful boundary organization which facilitates and promotes international sharing of information and knowledge required for sustainable groundwater resources development and management worldwide however a groundwater targeted regional boundary organization that is built upon real time observations has not been well established it opens up the opportunity for grace community and local practitioners to co create such organizations for better communication and education purposes 6 2 increasing data accuracy transparency and accessibility grace is not a designed management tool but can be used as a guiding communication and monitoring tool especially in regions with limited data enhancing the potential usefulness of grace for gwpm would benefit from an increase in the accuracy transparency and accessibility of the retrieved data 6 2 1 increasing data accuracy the accuracy of grace data is highly constrained by its spatial resolution grace derived information is powerful at large scales but it often needs to be used together with and validated by in situ observations for better local applications grace observations alone show strongly decreasing water storage trends or depletion rates which are larger than the local variability in many places castellazzi et al 2018 there is a need to improve land surface and hydrological models to match these independent observations various techniques using modal data fusion approach have been employed to overcome the spatial and temporal resolution issues e g lópez valencia et al 2020 stampoulis et al 2019 su et al 2022 and data assimilation methods have been used to better utilize the potential of grace data bahrami et al 2021 girotto et al 2017 li et al 2019 tangdamrongsub et al 2015 the development of key technology in gravity satellite sensors is the basis for enhancing the accuracy and spatial resolution of grace monitored gravity field until any technological advancements in the future i e the future mass change mission nasem 2018 further research can be focused on improving the retrieval algorithms by minimizing the noise and error in atmosphere and ocean models during data pre processing furthermore research on filtering methods and correction schemes should be continued to mitigate the amplitude damping caused by smoothing to increase the reliability of grace data although the spatial resolution of grace data can be improved through dynamical and or statistical downscaling approaches e g miro famiglietti 2018 tangdamrongsub et al 2015 vishwakarma et al 2021 these approaches are not without disadvantages for example dynamical downscaling is computationally expensive and limited by uncertainties in input data model parameters and structures while statistical downscaling is subjective to the selection of input variables and the scale of model construction with the continuous advancement of machine learning techniques a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of physically based modelling and the flexibility of data driven statistical models can provide great potential to bridge the deficiencies of each approach sun et al 2019 and reduce the error between downscaled grace estimates and in situ observations on the other hand and as mentioned by survey participant s grace would yield more informative messages if the derived products can provide insights into future projections on freshwater availability over regions to this end grace observations of long term trends should be incorporated into studies that also provide future projections innovative research on reconstructing grace data e g li et al 2021 sun et al 2020 may be a promising way to fill the missing months and extend prior to the grace period thus providing the foundation for monitoring freshwater availability under different future climate scenarios 6 2 2 increasing data transparency and accessibility one major reason that has hindered the utility of grace derived messages and products for practices is the lack of practitioners understanding of and accessibility to the information about how the data are processed developing an open access and user friendly data platform with spatially and temporally harmonized data products would ease the technical barriers to wider use of grace derived data furthermore provision of information about how exactly groundwater storage estimates are derived and how modeled parameters are estimated would be helpful for users to integrate with their practices 6 3 conducting solution oriented research the grace scientific community can find significant research opportunities by focusing their work on sustainability transformations for groundwater systems here we pose two questions as the starting point to discuss ways to produce solution oriented research that helps to nurture studies that address the science policy interface and support sustainable management of groundwater resources 6 3 1 what useful information will be produced by the study for real world solutions researchers should conduct studies that are able to produce actionable information to match the needs of decision making in doing so multi stage engagement between researchers and potential implementers such as policy and decision makers should be conducted to make a research implementation protocol that covers identification of issues and expectations e g actions that help alleviate depletion of aquifers and long term trends and variability in groundwater storage development of solution options e g increasing artificial recharge and incentivizing programs to reduce groundwater use appraisal and adjustment of solution options e g modeling comparative study and scenario analysis based on grace derived data implementing and monitoring of solutions e g identifying impacts and success or failure and post implementation evaluation and generalization e g assessment of solutions and their transferability to other regions such as indicators and index for management monitoring 6 3 2 who will be the end user s studies should have a clear idea about the potential users of their actionable knowledge different spatial scales will involve different levels of practitioners and stakeholders as primary end users potential end users of grace derived groundwater products are those who intensively use manage and regulate groundwater resources at multiple levels such as national and international advocacy groups non governmental organizations ngos irrigation districts farmers industrial water managers and government agencies however numerous studies across multiple scales have argued that multi level institutions that coordinate different parties and agencies are required for successful solution implementation tengö andersson 2022 cassman et al 2002 the social ecological systems community has developed a general framework that guides the dissection of coupled human and natural systems ostrom 2009 and thus providing a lens for grace and groundwater communities to identify key actors and the way how they can better coordinate 7 conclusions in this study we have conducted two rounds of surveys of academic researchers and non academic practitioners the survey results reported differing opinions of both groups of participants toward the potential usefulness of and possible barriers for grace applied to gwpm the spatial resolution and data uncertainties are identified as the most significant barrier limiting the application of grace into practice different backgrounds and expertise result in the lack of mutual understanding and trust between the two groups of participants and contribute to divergent opinions the mismatch between what grace science provides and what practitioners need is the consequence inherent limitations of grace derived products and a lack of mutual understanding between academics and practitioners there are promising ways to enhance the usefulness of grace for gwpm which rely on effective communication and mobilization of grace derived information into action a clear message from the survey is that both communities should actively communicate and engage with each other on a regular basis this two way interaction would help co create solution oriented research that produces more actionable products additionally groundwater focused regional scale boundary organizations that are informed by grace and other real time observations should be developed to facilitate the mobilization of remote sensing products to groundwater management multiple pathways exist for data accuracy improvements which will subsequently result in heightened users confidence in the data these improvement pathways including developments on data processing or filtering methods detailed uncertainty and error quantification geophysical background modeling validation by local observations and integration with land surface and hydrological models and other remote sensing datasets in summary global groundwater sustainability is facing multidimensional threats from climate change and human activity progress towards sustainable groundwater management is a common pursuit between academics and practitioners it is however still daunting for both communities to monitor and manage groundwater resources because of the difficulty in tracking changes in its status with satellite based big data developed for the earth sciences over the last decades and the growing enhancement of local measurements it is becoming possible to overcome this challenge if these available resources are better integrated grace does not provide policymaking answers but can be a crucial vehicle to mobilize scientific knowledge to the public helping with the identification of priorities for gwpm in particular in regions with limited data that lack big picture understanding it is therefore an important and crucial time for research scientists and practitioners to collaborate and take action to protect groundwater resources at multiple levels which can be facilitated by greater application of grace data credit authorship contribution statement li xu conceptualization methodology

1765,managing groundwater is challenging because its below ground existence makes the resource difficult to monitor grace is an important tool as it provides the opportunity to monitor the storage of groundwater while grace based groundwater studies have focused on many regions across the globe studies that link scientific research to policymaking and groundwater practices are still limited this paper aims to provide recommendations for the improved use of grace data for the purpose of sustainable groundwater management to gain insight into this a policy delphi survey was conducted to collect opinions from both the academic and non academic communities although opinions are divergent and a mismatch exists between what science researchers currently supplies and what users practitioners demand we found that both communities acknowledged the potential of grace data and grace derived products for groundwater management and would be willing to collaborate to develop projects for practical applications better communication between researchers and practitioners was recommended as key for greater application of grace derived products into practice practitioners noted the need for reliable data for management responsibilities but prefer locally observed data the reliability of grace at local scales was raised by practitioners as a limitation despite advances in downscaling methods within the academic community the survey reveals a shared desire for more comparison between grace derived products with local measurements to determine whether grace products can be useful for informing local decisions using survey outcomes we propose three recommendations to improve the usefulness of grace derived and other remote sensing products for groundwater management and practices improving communication strategies increasing data accuracy transparency and accessibility to build trust and conducting solution oriented research keywords groundwater management remote sensing water policy knowledge mobilization transdisciplinary grace abbreviations grace the gravity recovery and climate experiment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction 1 1 urgency for promoting groundwater sustainability groundwater resources account for over 90 of all liquid freshwater on earth unesco 2022 making it a critical source of water for agricultural domestic and industrial uses in many parts of the world groundwater sustains over 40 of global irrigation and provides drinking water for more than 2 5 billion people siebert et al 2010 unesco 2015 the sustainability of groundwater systems thus secures water and food supply chains from local to global scales dalin et al 2017 wada et al 2012 there is a growing recognition of the importance of understanding groundwater connections with the earth system and social ecological systems and grounding effective management on the basis of these interactions and functions that groundwater provides gleeson et al 2020a gleeson et al 2020b huggins et al 2023 yet groundwater has received less attention than surface water resources and has historically been unsustainably pumped and managed for human consumption bierkens wada 2019 de graaf et al 2019 groundwater systems worldwide are being threatened by a number of human induced factors and the changing environment many of the world s major aquifers are approaching their physical sustainability tipping points which means that the rates at which groundwater is being withdrawn are far greater than the rates at which it is being replenished either naturally or artificially famiglietti 2014 richey et al 2015 rodell et al 2018 these groundwater storage trends threaten water and food security as shown by a recent study finding that 20 of groundwater wells globally could be at risk of running dry jasechko perrone 2021 a regional study echoes to this finding that groundwater depletion rate in california s central valley and across the southwestern us has accelerated dramatically during the megadrought as heavy agricultural pumping has drawn aquifer levels to new lows with particularly rapid declines occurring since 2019 liu et al 2022 groundwater depletion has become a global crisis especially in the dry regions where groundwater is the primary source of water for agricultural production and people s livings such as the north china plain the northwest sahara region the high plains and central valley in the us northwest india canning basin in western australia and the middle east region famiglietti ferguson 2021 famiglietti 2014 sustainable management of groundwater resources is challenging due largely to the fact that groundwater is difficult to monitor given its below ground existence poor monitoring of groundwater relative to surface water has contributed to the failure of groundwater management and governance in many places evidenced by the extensive groundwater depletion globally the continuous investments in robust satellite hydrology programs in recent decades have enabled scientists to monitor changes in groundwater storage famiglietti et al 2015 despite tremendous growth in remote sensing for groundwater most data products are not well implemented in management and practice alley konikow 2015 the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace missions led by the national aeronautics and space agency nasa and co sponsored by the german space agency provide critical data on groundwater storage anomalies at a large spatial resolution rodell et al 2018 while grace was not designed as a management tool it may provide a transformational opportunity for policymakers to be aware of changes in groundwater storage and consider possible causal drivers when used in combination with social ecological economic or hydro climatic datasets for instance grace based studies have provided informative messages to affect water policy such as providing motivation and emphasizing the dire need for california s sustainable groundwater management act famiglietti et al 2011 in addition grace derived data have the potential to be incorporated with other socioeconomic data to understand interactions between groundwater and social ecological systems from the regional e g wang et al 2020 to global scales huggins et al 2022 1 2 grace and grace fo background and applications grace was a satellite mission that tracked variations in earth s gravity field from 2002 to 2017 the satellite mission operated as a giant scale in the sky relating mass changes in the earth to the measured gravity variations through data processing famiglietti and matthew 2013 the grace mission provided the first observational dataset of the changing mass of the earth and proved pivotal to myriad advances in oceanography glaciology and hydrology tapley et al 2019 rodell reager 2023 the success of grace was affirmed by the launch of its successor mission grace follow on grace fo in may 2018 landerer et al 2020 one additional instrument on the grace fo satellites is a laser ranging interferometer with significantly greater measurement precision than the k band ranging kbr system used by grace which are used to detect the satellite to satellite distance flechtner et al 2016 for simplicity we refer to the combined data record across grace and grace fo satellite missions as grace for the remainder of this paper grace can measure the changes in total water storage tws which is the sum of groundwater soil moisture surface water canopy water ice and snow storages along a vertically integrated profile several research centers around the world provide grace data with center for space research university of texas csr https www2 csr utexas edu grace geoforschungszentrum potsdam gfz https www gfz potsdam de grace and jet propulsion laboratory jpl https grace jpl nasa gov providing the official releases deriving gravity anomalies from grace is a complex process and several parameter and algorithm design choices have to be made to optimize the end goal hence even though all data are generated from the same level 1 information provided by the satellites the data from multiple centers typically show minor differences due to their data processing strategies initially the grace solutions were derived solely using spherical harmonics and while useful these suffered from several limitations including large leakage errors and unrealistic stripes along the north south direction correcting for these stripes would also risk removing some of the signal also effectively using grace data would require familiarity with spherical harmonics and geodesy in recent years mass concentrations or mascon products have been designed which offer locally constrained mass anomalies have reduced leakage errors do not require additional processing and are user friendly and accessible to a wider science community further attempts are being made to increase the resolution of grace data loomis et al 2019 save et al 2016 watkins et al 2015 currently for large scale regional or global applications jpl mascon solutions are considered to be most reliable due to the uncorrelation with neighboring mascons rodell et al 2018 however higher resolution mascon solutions from centers such as nasa goddard space flight center gsfc and csr are valuable for regional studies several studies use multiple tws data and consider their arithmetic mean as monthly tws anomalies e g humphrey et al 2016 still coarse resolution in combination with signal leakage errors across mascons latency lack of vertical resolution which component of tws is the signal coming from uncertainty around removal of non water gravity signals such as the glacial isostatic adjustment gia continue to remain challenges that limit wide spread use of grace data e g chen et al 2022 due to the coarse spatial resolution and limited accuracy the accurate quantification of mass variations using grace data has been challenging chen et al 2022 while the grace fo mission enabled the continuation of an observed data record it largely was not re designed to target limitations in the original grace mission in general the accuracy of grace is 2 cm in equivalent water height tapley et al 2004 and with an effective spatial resolution of about 150 000 to 200 000 km2 longuevergne et al 2010 however different grace derived products may have various accuracies due to different post processing approaches and substantial efforts have been done to quantify the associated uncertainties blazquez et al 2018 boergens et al 2022 landerer swenson 2012 loomis et al 2019 riegger et al 2012 these observations of anomalies in terrestrial water storage enabled global observations of water redistribution at regional to global scales rodell et al 2018 scanlon et al 2018 eicker et al 2016 while being sensitive to the spatial and temporal resolutions the grace data in addition to the terrestrial water storage research has obtained multiple implementations in hydrological studies for different purposes including groundwater monitoring evaluations of social ecological vulnerability

tapley et al 2019 based on metadata retrieved from nasa s jet propulsion laboratory web of science and scopus grace based groundwater studies to date have been widely adopted by the hydrological research community and conducted on all continents except antarctica fig 1 a it is not surprising that most studies were conducted at the national and global scales fig 1b given effective spatial resolution of grace africa has received the most attention at the continental scale while china the us and india are three countries that have been most studied extensive grace based research has been conducted and a text mining of frequent terms that appeared in the abstract of these studies 903 as of july 2022 shows that existing groundwater studies were centered on a few central research questions the research interest in storage change has received the most attention fig 1c these studies use hydrological models and different sets of data in combination with grace data to estimate variations of groundwater storage over land underrepresented in this text mining are studies that focus on bridging the link between grace derived scientific output with management and or policymaking making this link could be an area of growth within the grace research community with more practical outcomes for sustainability transition of groundwater resources as can be seen in fig 1c cross disciplinary terms such as management policy and decision making have very few mentions in these studies less than 10 occurrences this indicates that the interface between science and policy is very weak in grace based studies and that the potential for grace to be incorporated in management and policymaking processes is currently underutilized 2 research questions and objectives it is imperative for research scientists and practitioners to collaborate and take action to protect groundwater resources at multiple levels famiglietti ferguson 2021 understanding the opinions of both scientists and practitioners on the potential of remote sensing products is the first step in seeking common interests for collective action therefore we conducted a survey of academic and non academic communities guided under an overarching question how can grace data and grace derived products be used to communicate with policymakers and stakeholders to aid in sustainable groundwater management following this question we asked three sub questions 1 what are the opinions of academic and non academic communities on the usefulness of grace for groundwater practices and management gwpm 2 why is grace not well applied to gwpm and 3 how could grace derived products be better operated for gwpm with these questions in mind this paper sets out to explore effective ways for the continued use of grace as the targeted product for inter and transdisciplinary communication for improved sustainable groundwater management this study is believed to be the first of its kind to provide insights into the link between grace research and groundwater practices 3 methods to solicit opinions from different perspectives we conducted two rounds of solicited online surveys we applied a policy delphi technique to the survey and used content analysis along with standard statistics to analyze responses 3 1 policy delphi approach the policy delphi method is a systematic policymaking method that allows a group of individuals to collectively work on a given problem turoff 1970 it was proposed as a tool to generate the strongest possible opposing opinions within a group of experts while remaining flexible for its users to make adjustments to meet their purposes through structured questions de loë et al 2016 turoff 1970 it is a time and cost efficient way to gather and evaluate expert or interest based knowledge through two to three rounds of communications and surveys manley 2013 turoff 1970 this method is particularly helpful for surveys that require inputs from different groups of individuals as it can help to reveal options identify points of agreement and disagreement and uncover the strength of evidence associated with diverse viewpoints de loë et al 2016 rayens hahn 2000 in this survey we followed a common procedure composed of three phases as shown in fig 2 we modified some of the components to suit our research purposes which are further explained in the following contexts 3 1 1 phase 1 preparation the first phase is the preparation which was aimed at clarifying the purpose of the survey building up a survey team and identifying potential participants the preparation phase involved several steps including the definition of research questions and statements that explain the background information building up a survey team identification of the panel e g sample size criteria and representations recruitment of participants and panel finalization the suggested number of participants to form a survey panel in the original policy delphi study was 10 to 50 turoff 1970 the small panel size is especially applicable to studies which have a specific focus or the topic requires the participation of highly specialized experts de loë et al 2016 to recruit appropriate participants we developed criteria and used a targeted search in combination with snowball sampling techniques specifically we targeted academic researchers with sophisticated knowledge and experience in the field of grace based groundwater research over three years of experience in grace with at least two publications were set as the criteria to identify appropriate researchers for non academic practitioners we targeted those who have at least three years of experience in gwpm and who are familiar with grace in the context of groundwater we recruited some participants through the networks of the survey team and then used the snowball sampling technique to identify hidden participants that are not within our own networks as snowball sampling can introduce biased samples we diversified to an extent the geophysical and professional representations of individuals through the chain of referrals to improve the representativeness of samples as a result a total of 48 candidates 21 researchers and 27 practitioners were identified and invited to participate in the survey through email contact only those who agreed in advance to participate in both rounds were sent the questionnaires in phase 2 the anonymity principle was applied to the survey which means that the identity of participants is only visible to the survey team while participants are not aware of each other s identity allowing for free expression of individual opinion 3 1 2 phase 2 convergence the convergence phase aims to use questions to solicit opinions from participants within two rounds of surveys which were run online both surveys were tested internally and refined prior to being sent to the panel steps in phase 2 involve designing and sending the questionnaire to selected participants analyzing responses and feedback to participants for further comments the first round survey aimed to identify opinions about the subject matter i e grace for gwpm the second round was designed according to the results of the first round to question solicited opinions to further compile agreed and disagreed points of view all responses were analyzed and feedback on the collected opinions of respondents was sent back to all participants during this phase survey questions were set around three research questions raised in this study in the first round survey questionnaires were designed around two types of questions open ended questions and rating questions open ended questions were designed to collect broad opinions on how grace observations can be better employed to aid in sustainable groundwater management seven open ended questions were designed to capture opinions of academic researchers while nine were designed for non academic practitioners we asked non academic practitioners two extra questions with the aim to affirm their familiarity with grace and to understand existing or preference tools they are applying to their gwpm these questions helped to understand the potential contribution of grace to the practice for rating questions participants were provided a list of candidate opinions about strategies for better utilizing the grace derived data and products in gwpm and asked to rate for relative agreement and priority with a range from 1 to 5 1 for mostly disagree and 5 for mostly agree in the second round survey questionnaires were organized into 15 multiple choice questions that were formulated to identify the most important considerations for improving the usefulness of grace products for gwpm questions were designed based on the results from the responses in the first round specifically questions in the first round were analyzed and sorted into seven themes based on text analysis of word similarity the applicability of grace for groundwater practices applicability needs of gwpm practice needs factors and features relevant to practitioners trust in grace derived messages trust opinions on collaborations collaboration communication for grace derived messages communication challenges for the application of grace derived products barriers and features relevant to data accuracy data accuracy opinions collected from respondents in the first round were unpacked into these themes to form choices for questions in the second survey the participants were given four options in each question and were asked to choose the one that best reflects their perspectives on the question extra comment space was provided for each question in case that participants had different opinions this round of survey was to identify points of agreement and disagreement and uncover the strength associated with diverse viewpoints from open ended questions in the first round survey 3 1 3 phase 3 summarization the final phase is to evaluate participants responses and summarize opinions unlike the traditional delphi method the policy delphi in this phase identifies a range of agreement and points of disagreement in order to explore all perspectives on a topic as a result we analyzed responses from both rounds of the survey and ranked critical opinions that have obtained the most agreement from both groups we also differentiated opinions from individual groups to examine the divergence of opinions between the two groups to analyze responses we applied content analysis see section 2 2 basic descriptive statistics e g percentage frequency count were also used to summarize the responses the final statement for the survey was compiled and distributed to all participants in this phase 3 2 content analysis of responses in this study we employed a basic content analysis krippendorff 2018 that uses quantitative and narrative techniques to unpack the responses of individuals and compile key opinions of both groups of participants in quantitative content analysis we used word and phrase counts to identify frequent views determining the relative importance of specific content in the whole collection of narrative descriptions from participants we then clustered these frequent contents into seven themes i e applicability practice needs trust collaboration communication barriers and data accuracy the text analysis was performed using the text2vec r package combined with nvivo 12 edhlund mcdougall 2019 selivanov et al 2016 specifically all participants responses to the open ended questions were first text mined using the text2vec r package the unpacked texts were then summarized and clustered into several groups by nvivo 12 based on word similarity of extracted terms and phrases results were also manually checked this quantitative content analysis helped to organize unstructured narratives into a structured format for better compiling and generalizing prominent opinions toward our research concern the narrative interpretative analysis was performed to interpret texts opinions that were clustered into each theme and to identify the extent to which agreement and disagreement have been reached within each group and between two groups this analysis helped to generalize opinions from each group of participants and to specify the divergence of views between the two groups 4 results 4 1 participants composition a total of 48 candidates 21 researchers and 27 practitioners were identified and invited to participate in the survey among all invited participants a total of 25 individuals participated in the first round survey with 14 academic researchers from 9 countries and 11 practitioners from 4 countries which are well representative of the population fig 3 in the second round survey questionnaires were redesigned and sent to the same individuals with a response rate of 76 among respondents to the second round survey 58 and 42 were academic researchers and practitioners respectively the academic researchers that participated in the surveys are mostly from universities with the rest from government funded research institutions e g national aeronautics and space administration nasa the chinese academy of science and natural resources canada the non academic practitioners are practitioners such as groundwater managers consultants members of funding agencies and groundwater advocates although we aimed to retain all participants between survey rounds not all were able to complete the survey in the second round however the ratio between academic researchers and non academic practitioners remained similar for both rounds of the survey 4 2 first round survey questions in the first round survey were raised in different ways based on academic and non academic standpoints using appropriate wording that aligns with the language familiar to different groups of participants for instance we asked about the needs of transdisciplinary projects in grace based groundwater studies without using the term transdisciplinary but work together to co develop projects in the questionnaire for non academic practitioners based on the text analysis 21 opinions were grouped from the unstructured answers of participants the grouped opinions were manually sorted to the defined themes i e applicability practice needs trust collaboration communication barriers and data accuracy and color coded into a heat map showing the frequency of occurrence of grouped opinions toward each theme fig 4 as can be seen in fig 4 a high level of agreement is reached on some points regarding applicability practice needs collaboration and communication the agreed opinions on applicability include two aspects 1 the potential of grace for groundwater practices is to use large scale observations on trends and patterns of groundwater storage change to prioritize regions for capacity building for improved management and 2 using local data to validate and or scale comparison that help to generalize patterns between large scale observation and small scale monitoring in terms of needs for practice both academic and non academic practitioners acknowledge the importance of downscaling and the development of easy to understand and easy to use tools they agree that communication and visualization is key for them to understand the possibilities of using grace for their practice as it can improve mutual understanding and create the trust that would nurture long term collaborations the spatial scale of grace is a major factor that reduces practitioners trust in grace products both groups express their willingness to collaborate with each other through co developing projects but some participants are not sure about effective approaches to improve these collaborations several reasons are identified as barriers for the application of grace derived products to practices in addition to the limitation of spatial resolution communication and interpretation skills are highlighted as other key barriers the lack of efficient communication and proper interpretation of grace derived messages has critically affected stakeholders trust in the data in some areas the large scale grace observations do not match local monitoring which diminishes local practitioners confidence in using grace derived information to guide their management and practices for rating questions fig 5 all academic researchers agree that co developing projects is the most effective way to make grace more applicable to decision makers and stakeholders and 92 of academic researchers agree that tailoring cohesive messages from grace can be efficient way for the communication between scientists and local practitioners another highly agreed upon opinion 77 suggests that diversifying communication channels for grace derived groundwater messages can be helpful to improve the usefulness of grace for practices on the other hand very few academic researchers 15 believe that connecting grace with global initiatives and agendas is necessary to improve its usefulness for practices from practitioners perspectives the top priority suggested is to develop easy to understand and easy to use tools or products for practical purposes 100 agreement other highly agreed upon viewpoints include transdisciplinary collaboration 90 diversifying communication channels 80 downscaling grace data 80 and connecting grace for national and global initiatives 80 interestingly the high disagreement found between academic and non academic groups is the need to link grace research to national and global initiatives 15 of academic vs 80 of non academic in comparing answers of both groups the top 3 agreed upon opinions are the need for tailoring cohesive messages for better communication co developing research projects and diversifying communication channels to raise public awareness of groundwater protection the opinions in academic group are more consistent with more common opinions for most cases than that of the non academic group on the other hand opinions in non academic group are more diverse than those in academic group with a similar percentage of agreement and disagreement on some aspects including citizen science user driven science and interdisciplinary value 4 3 second round survey an acceptable agreement threshold percentage varies in the literature ranging from 50 to 75 hasson et al 2000 in some studies over 70 was recommended to be the best representation of agreement green et al 1999 however other studies suggested that consensus should be equated with at least 51 agreement amongst respondents the lower percentage is especially suitable for those surveys with relatively small sample size and have less than three rounds of surveys loughlin moore 1979 hasson et al 2000 given that opinions between scientists and practitioners are divergent a cutoff of 51 was used to determine agreements on opinions combining the responses of the two groups fig 6 five opinions reached an agreement regarding some aspects in communication q12 collaboration q9 trust q8 barriers q5 and applicability q2 among these agreed upon opinions effective strategy to nurture trust through long term connections between academic and non academic communities obtained the most agreement in the response 79 of participants agreed that establishing national groundwater sustainability initiatives with long term 5 10 year funding especially if it can be in hotspot regions can be the most effective strategy to create stable connections for building trust between scientists and practitioners in terms of collaboration the most effective collaborative manner was suggested 63 to be co developing grace based groundwater projects as showcases to establish and expand collaborations some 58 agreement was reached on two opinions regarding overcoming barriers and the improvement of grace applicability to practices in the first round survey practitioners pointed out their limited capacity due to political and technical reasons to make policy changes as a key barrier for grace application to overcome such a barrier more than half of the participants recommended that the academic community communicate with and educate policy makers at all levels when participants were asked about the greatest potential of grace for small scale gwpm 58 of participants chose the integration of grace with hydrological models or other remote sensing products greater than other options including downscaling products 16 linking with local observation data 26 and index development for target management 0 however it should be noted that there are variabilities in other aspects within the themes with some cases showing diversified opinions e g q6 in barriers and other cases revealing two dominant opinions e g q13 in communication q4 in applicability in addition consensus has not been reached in terms of practice needs q15 and data accuracy q14 according to the survey opinions toward the seven themes are divergent between the two groups with less agreement obtained on a few themes the most agreed upon opinions within practitioners group are around themes of data accuracy 75 trust 75 practice needs 63 and communication 63 on the other hand the agreed upon opinions within the academic group are relatively fewer than practitioners with the most agreed upon opinions centered on trust 82 communication 73 collaboration and applicability both 64 fig 7 further shows the discrepancy of opinions between the two groups of participants for instance in a question about contents that grace can provide for better communications with decision makers to improve its usefulness for practice 73 of academic researchers agreed that linking anomalies to practice at smaller scales to help identify major contributors is effective however only 25 of non academic practitioners agreed with this opinion but 50 agreed that detailed and non technical interpretations of grace derived products and data are more important which was not selected by any academic researchers additionally the accuracy of grace derived data to represent local groundwater issues is a key concern of practitioners in the first round when asked about the best way to improve data accuracy and reduce the uncertainties of grace derived products in the second round survey the answer of practitioners was relatively consistent with 75 of agreement on using local observation data for validation however researchers gave diverse options suggesting not only using local observation data for validation but also integrating with locally calibrated hydrological models high resolution remote sensing products and generalizing patterns through comparisons between trends in large scale and local observations similarly higher agreement was reached within the non academic group than academic group on the highest priority for advancing the practical application of grace and grace derived products for gwpm fig 7 academic researchers suggested that advancing the practical application of grace should be done through communicating results through easy to understand knowledge products tailored to user needs 18 developing transdisciplinary collaboration and co developed projects 36 improving the resolution downscaling and accuracy of grace derived products 18 and integrating grace data with other data sources and methods 27 from the practitioners perspective however improving the resolution downscaling and accuracy of grace derived products was not given priority while highlighting the importance of the integration of grace data with other data sources and methods to summarize we combined results from two rounds of surveys to identify the highly agreed upon opinions from participants as can be seen in table 1 opinions on the needs of practices have not been reached to an agreement during both rounds of survey although some opinions are agreed upon within individual group of participants less agreement has been reached between the two groups for instance downscaling grace derived products and the development of easy to understand and use tools are highly agreed upon among practitioners as ways to improve applicability of grace for practice but they have not been widely agreed upon by academic researchers both groups agreed that the integration with hydrological models and other remote sensing products is an effective way to improve the applicability of grace data in practice in terms of collaboration both groups of participants expressed willingness to collaborate and suggested co developing transdisciplinary projects as the start although three ways i e diversifying communication linking with practices to help identify contributors of groundwater issues and tailoring communication were agreed by the academic group to be the key for more effective communication of grace derived messages with decision makers and stakeholders but they were not agreed upon within non academic group data accuracy is an important concern of practitioners when trying to apply grace in practice although participants pointed out many barriers such as resolution limitation and political capacity both groups agreed that communicating with policy makers at all levels is the breakthrough to overcome barriers for the grace application although different ways were suggested to create trust between academic and non academic communities given different perspectives of the participants there is consensus that mutual trust can be achieved through establishing national groundwater sustainability initiatives 5 discussion multiple sentiments reflected in our survey echo previous statements that grace is not a ready for use management tool and grace derived products need to be improved for practice purposes particularly at scales smaller than the resolution of grace famiglietti and matthew 2013 döll et al 2014 lall et al 2020 apart from commonly known limitations i e resolution and uncertainties due to data processing we have observed two other major barriers between science and policy divergent opinions between academic and non academic communities towards how grace derived information could be implemented for gwpm and the mismatch between what grace based science can provide and users demands for practical applications we discuss below possible reasons for these barriers that affect the application of grace to practices first inherent limitations in the spatial resolution of grace data and potential errors in retrieval algorithms reduce the potential of grace for gwpm grace and grace fo data are useful but their spatial resolution is limited by their orbits and the lack of complementary satellite missions wiese et al 2022 this is commonly acknowledged by the scientific community as the most significant barrier for grace to provide operational data on groundwater changes for management authorities and stakeholders famiglietti and matthew 2013 alley konikow 2015 sheffield et al 2018 gleeson et al 2021 practitioners in our survey also point to this as the dominant factor affecting their trust in grace derived messages applicable to solve local groundwater issues moreover grace data are somewhat restricted in their applications in long term hydrological changes due to data gaps sun et al 2020 li et al 2021 and time latency e g hachborn et al 2017 it is possible to use modeling to downscale the products to finer resolutions for better applications e g iqbal et al 2017 miro famiglietti 2018 vishwakarma et al 2021 as of recently there is no universal downscaling method that is applicable to all places and scenarios as many of these methods were developed for a specific purpose which requires calibration when applied to other case studies additionally the challenges in using grace data arise from various uncertainties including errors related to atmospheric oceanic and glacial isostatic effects signal degradation due to gravity measurement noise and systemic errors correlated to spatial and spectral domains landerer swenson 2012 wiese landerer watkins 2016 filtering methods khaki et al 2018 vishwakarma et al 2016 and correction schemes used to store the signal damage due to filtering vishwakarma et al 2018 second divergent opinions held by academic and non academic communities affect mutual understanding hampering the application of grace derived products some of the opinions held by academic and non academic communities toward the usefulness of grace for gwpm are divergent fig 7 the divergence of opinions may stem from two reasons 1 the difference in background experience and training between scientists and practitioners and the way the grace derived data and products are produced and delivered 2 discrepancies in results between grace observations and local measurements or official governance data on groundwater storage in some regions grace derived data and products contain large amount of technical and scientific content which is more readily understood by the academic community but may be challenging for many practitioners to extract information from and make informed decisions on the basis of on the other hand discrepancies in results have been identified between estimates of grace derived groundwater storage changes and the official groundwater budgets castellazzi et al 2018 such discrepancies also pointed out by many practitioners in our surveys make local observations of wells data the preferable resources for local practitioners third mismatch between scientific supply and practitioner demand indicates ineffective communication between these groups with the impact of reducing the potential of grace derived products by grace are viewed by practitioners to be less informative to directly affect practical decision making because the resolution is unable to resolve changes in groundwater storage at scales at which their management activities usually take place although grace fo improved the measurement precision which can results in more accurate water storage measurements flechtner et al 2016 but the main limitations of coarse spatial and temporal resolution in the grace data record are yet unaddressed current plans for a future mass change mission an improvement upon grace and grace fo in spatial resolution are in the works and may be more applicable to a wider range of water resource characterization and management activities globally nasem 2018 in addition the mismatched opinions are indicative of the lack of communications that help to improve understanding of each other s capacities and duties creating common interests in the survey academic opinions seem to be more science driven while practitioners opinions tend to be more solution oriented for example a large proportion of practitioners believe that using local observation data to validate grace derived data is the best way to improve its accuracy while academic researchers tend to choose to integrate with other remote sensing products although both are equally important furthermore grace based studies are largely driven by natural scientists who usually have less willingness to engage with practitioners than do social scientists in our survey some academic researchers stated that there is no need for scientific community to know practitioners needs because practitioners know what their needs are the limited public engagement would have limited the production of use inspired science and impeded the mobilization of grace knowledge to practitioners and the public 6 recommendations for sustainable groundwater management using grace efforts have been widely made to overcome the limitation of grace for applications and much of the attention has been drawn in many previous grace studies that emphasized the practicality of grace data maximizing its practical potentials see chen et al 2022 however a written piece that incorporates perspectives of both grace products producers and users to improving such potential practicality is a lack according to collected opinions and discussed barriers we propose three recommendations that broadly aim to facilitate the communication and mobilization of grace based knowledge for the improved utilization of grace derived products for gwpm these recommendations may be applicable for other remote sensing products and thus can serve as a broader resource for other remote sensing applications for sustainable management of natural resources 6 1 improving communication strategies active iterative and inclusive communication between scientists and policymakers as well as the public is crucial to mobilize knowledge for actions cash et al 2003 white et al 2010 however not all researchers are willing to communicate their research with non academic groups part of the reason for this is that some researchers do not know what to communicate have undertrained communication skills and in some cases the content communicated is not well targeted for the audience resulting in ineffective knowledge mobilization improving communication effectiveness to facilitate the mobilization of grace and other remote sensing knowledge could be achieved through close engagement and collaboration tailoring products that can be used for education and collaboration purposes and diversifying communicating channels and increasing frequency 6 1 1 creating proactive two way engagement and close collaboration engagement and collaboration are effective ways to improve mutual understanding and create trust which further helps overcome barriers between academic researchers and non academic practitioners engagement should be in a format that is open for bidirectional dialogues for example grace scientific researchers communicate their work with practitioners e g water managers decision makers and industrial stakeholders and at the same time proactively ask for their feedback on whether the research has answered questions they have this two way communication process helps create salience of knowledge i e studies that reflect decision needs and legitimacy i e inclusiveness of perceptions from all parties which increase communication effectiveness cash et al 2003 patt 2000 it does so as it not only educates practitioners about grace and its technical capacity allowing them to express their perceptions but also enables researchers to know the needs of practitioners and dilemmas faced by decision makers in such a way researchers can adjust their research questions to solve the mismatch between science supply and practice demand additionally engagement should start from the beginning to the end of any collaborative projects and be conducted in multiple formats such as meetings workshops and seminars on a regular basis it has been observed that mobilizing knowledge for actions can be reduced if the communication takes place only at the early stages of any projects cash et al 2003 hence the constant involvement of both parties in the projects allows grace researchers to understand local groundwater issues and to compare the observations between grace and in situ measurements e g identifying mismatch and solutions this process increases credibility of grace derived products by using local data and knowledge provided by practitioners in the meantime local practitioners can gradually obtain grace knowledge and build up their trust in the products 6 1 2 tailoring easy to understand messages and tools that can be used for education and collaboration purposes contents used for communication are critical as they affect to what extent the grace derived messages are meaningful for practitioners a smooth communication can benefit from mutual understanding built on the language that is understandable between communicators and receivers for example consistent terminologies can be co developed beforehand such as avoiding technical terms such as spherical harmonics common in the grace literature in our surveys both communities expressed willingness to collaborate in the first round use friendly tools and easy to understand messages were named to be the top needs by practitioners to produce such meaningful products promoting the co development of projects is highly agreed by both communities as it can help to produce knowledge and solution base that meets the local users needs co developing grace based groundwater transdisciplinary projects can be initiated in typical regions where grace data have been shown to guide decision making in different contexts these projects can be viewed as showcases which can be used as key communicating contents to establish and expand collaborations as further suggested by the survey participants the definition of showcase problems should include significant economic and social impact and solutions that can be achieved in a 5 10 year window the actual implementation of such showcase solutions will provide the driver for future funding and ensure the long term continuity that will be required to deal with many of these big problems a quote from participants narratives creating groundwater sustainability initiatives that are supported by secured funding for research and development r d was also seen by most of our participants to be an effective way to build common interests and trust and keep both communities collaborating in the long run for example initiatives could be made to collectively identify pathways forward groundwater protection in hotspot regions such as the north china plain and northern india 6 1 3 diversifying communicating channels and increasing frequency of communication diversifying communication can be achieved by using communication mediations such as boundary organizations cash et al 2003 these boundary organizations concentrate their efforts on bridging the linkage between knowledge producers academic researchers and users non academic practitioners aiming at mobilizing scientific knowledge into practices through communication and mediating conflicts guston 1999 the boundary organization has been well documented as the effective bridge in water sciences such as the decision center for a desert city at arizona state university white et al 2008 white et al 2010 crona parker 2011 in the groundwater field the international groundwater resources assessment centre igrac is a successful boundary organization which facilitates and promotes international sharing of information and knowledge required for sustainable groundwater resources development and management worldwide however a groundwater targeted regional boundary organization that is built upon real time observations has not been well established it opens up the opportunity for grace community and local practitioners to co create such organizations for better communication and education purposes 6 2 increasing data accuracy transparency and accessibility grace is not a designed management tool but can be used as a guiding communication and monitoring tool especially in regions with limited data enhancing the potential usefulness of grace for gwpm would benefit from an increase in the accuracy transparency and accessibility of the retrieved data 6 2 1 increasing data accuracy the accuracy of grace data is highly constrained by its spatial resolution grace derived information is powerful at large scales but it often needs to be used together with and validated by in situ observations for better local applications grace observations alone show strongly decreasing water storage trends or depletion rates which are larger than the local variability in many places castellazzi et al 2018 there is a need to improve land surface and hydrological models to match these independent observations various techniques using modal data fusion approach have been employed to overcome the spatial and temporal resolution issues e g lópez valencia et al 2020 stampoulis et al 2019 su et al 2022 and data assimilation methods have been used to better utilize the potential of grace data bahrami et al 2021 girotto et al 2017 li et al 2019 tangdamrongsub et al 2015 the development of key technology in gravity satellite sensors is the basis for enhancing the accuracy and spatial resolution of grace monitored gravity field until any technological advancements in the future i e the future mass change mission nasem 2018 further research can be focused on improving the retrieval algorithms by minimizing the noise and error in atmosphere and ocean models during data pre processing furthermore research on filtering methods and correction schemes should be continued to mitigate the amplitude damping caused by smoothing to increase the reliability of grace data although the spatial resolution of grace data can be improved through dynamical and or statistical downscaling approaches e g miro famiglietti 2018 tangdamrongsub et al 2015 vishwakarma et al 2021 these approaches are not without disadvantages for example dynamical downscaling is computationally expensive and limited by uncertainties in input data model parameters and structures while statistical downscaling is subjective to the selection of input variables and the scale of model construction with the continuous advancement of machine learning techniques a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of physically based modelling and the flexibility of data driven statistical models can provide great potential to bridge the deficiencies of each approach sun et al 2019 and reduce the error between downscaled grace estimates and in situ observations on the other hand and as mentioned by survey participant s grace would yield more informative messages if the derived products can provide insights into future projections on freshwater availability over regions to this end grace observations of long term trends should be incorporated into studies that also provide future projections innovative research on reconstructing grace data e g li et al 2021 sun et al 2020 may be a promising way to fill the missing months and extend prior to the grace period thus providing the foundation for monitoring freshwater availability under different future climate scenarios 6 2 2 increasing data transparency and accessibility one major reason that has hindered the utility of grace derived messages and products for practices is the lack of practitioners understanding of and accessibility to the information about how the data are processed developing an open access and user friendly data platform with spatially and temporally harmonized data products would ease the technical barriers to wider use of grace derived data furthermore provision of information about how exactly groundwater storage estimates are derived and how modeled parameters are estimated would be helpful for users to integrate with their practices 6 3 conducting solution oriented research the grace scientific community can find significant research opportunities by focusing their work on sustainability transformations for groundwater systems here we pose two questions as the starting point to discuss ways to produce solution oriented research that helps to nurture studies that address the science policy interface and support sustainable management of groundwater resources 6 3 1 what useful information will be produced by the study for real world solutions researchers should conduct studies that are able to produce actionable information to match the needs of decision making in doing so multi stage engagement between researchers and potential implementers such as policy and decision makers should be conducted to make a research implementation protocol that covers identification of issues and expectations e g actions that help alleviate depletion of aquifers and long term trends and variability in groundwater storage development of solution options e g increasing artificial recharge and incentivizing programs to reduce groundwater use appraisal and adjustment of solution options e g modeling comparative study and scenario analysis based on grace derived data implementing and monitoring of solutions e g identifying impacts and success or failure and post implementation evaluation and generalization e g assessment of solutions and their transferability to other regions such as indicators and index for management monitoring 6 3 2 who will be the end user s studies should have a clear idea about the potential users of their actionable knowledge different spatial scales will involve different levels of practitioners and stakeholders as primary end users potential end users of grace derived groundwater products are those who intensively use manage and regulate groundwater resources at multiple levels such as national and international advocacy groups non governmental organizations ngos irrigation districts farmers industrial water managers and government agencies however numerous studies across multiple scales have argued that multi level institutions that coordinate different parties and agencies are required for successful solution implementation tengö andersson 2022 cassman et al 2002 the social ecological systems community has developed a general framework that guides the dissection of coupled human and natural systems ostrom 2009 and thus providing a lens for grace and groundwater communities to identify key actors and the way how they can better coordinate 7 conclusions in this study we have conducted two rounds of surveys of academic researchers and non academic practitioners the survey results reported differing opinions of both groups of participants toward the potential usefulness of and possible barriers for grace applied to gwpm the spatial resolution and data uncertainties are identified as the most significant barrier limiting the application of grace into practice different backgrounds and expertise result in the lack of mutual understanding and trust between the two groups of participants and contribute to divergent opinions the mismatch between what grace science provides and what practitioners need is the consequence inherent limitations of grace derived products and a lack of mutual understanding between academics and practitioners there are promising ways to enhance the usefulness of grace for gwpm which rely on effective communication and mobilization of grace derived information into action a clear message from the survey is that both communities should actively communicate and engage with each other on a regular basis this two way interaction would help co create solution oriented research that produces more actionable products additionally groundwater focused regional scale boundary organizations that are informed by grace and other real time observations should be developed to facilitate the mobilization of remote sensing products to groundwater management multiple pathways exist for data accuracy improvements which will subsequently result in heightened users confidence in the data these improvement pathways including developments on data processing or filtering methods detailed uncertainty and error quantification geophysical background modeling validation by local observations and integration with land surface and hydrological models and other remote sensing datasets in summary global groundwater sustainability is facing multidimensional threats from climate change and human activity progress towards sustainable groundwater management is a common pursuit between academics and practitioners it is however still daunting for both communities to monitor and manage groundwater resources because of the difficulty in tracking changes in its status with satellite based big data developed for the earth sciences over the last decades and the growing enhancement of local measurements it is becoming possible to overcome this challenge if these available resources are better integrated grace does not provide policymaking answers but can be a crucial vehicle to mobilize scientific knowledge to the public helping with the identification of priorities for gwpm in particular in regions with limited data that lack big picture understanding it is therefore an important and crucial time for research scientists and practitioners to collaborate and take action to protect groundwater resources at multiple levels which can be facilitated by greater application of grace data credit authorship contribution statement li xu conceptualization methodology

1766,identifying the characteristics and risks of short duration rainstorms and reducing the disaster caused by extreme rainstorms are important for urban sustainable development in this study the total rainfall tr and peak rainfall pr are generated randomly by constructing a stochastic simulation model with their dependence and their encounter characteristics and return periods are analyzed by using the copula function then a case study is conducted in zhengzhou city china the results show that 1 the stochastic simulation model considering the contemporaneous and short term dependencies cstd is better than that considering only the contemporaneous dependence moreover the simulated sequences which consider the cstd can better maintain the characteristics of original sequences 2 the joint probability distribution and encounter characteristics of rich r poor p are similar between original and simulated sequences the joint probability of tr and pr is densely distributed in the probability interval of 0 1 0 7 the probability of synchronous r p is greater than that of asynchronous r p and the probability of synchronous r p in simulated sequences is even larger which is 73 14 3 the conditional probability of simulated sequences in scenario 2 is larger and the conditional return period of rainfall events crpre is smaller moreover the reference intervals of the conditional probability and crpre in simulated sequences are longer overall the risk of extreme combination rainstorms in simulated sequences is higher than that in original sequences and the scope of consideration and involvement is wider these findings can provide scientific reference for the characteristics analysis and prediction of urban short duration rainstorms keywords total rainfall peak rainfall dependence relationship stochastic simulation encounter probability data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the city is an important political and economic center in the region and its healthy development plays an important role in national economic prosperity in recent years with the rapid development of cities and the impact of global climate change large and medium sized cities around the world are prone to extreme short duration rainstorms and waterlogging disasters guan et al 2016 chen et al 2018 sun et al 2021 qian et al 2022 the rainstorm and waterlogging have also become one of the most prominent problems in many cities which have a serious impact on the infrastructure the normal life of residents and the rapid and stable development of the city quan 2014 du et al 2022 the short duration rainstorm means that the rainfall duration is within 3 h and its tr meets the rainstorm level of meteorological departments liu et al 2020 at present due to the limitations of historical rainstorm data the characteristics of short duration rainstorms cannot be accurately revealed which affects the prediction accuracy and increases the risk of urban waterlogging de lannoy et al 2005 jun et al 2020 li et al 2022 therefore it is of great significance to grasp the characteristics of urban short duration rainstorms and realize their accurate prediction for improving water security and stabilizing sustainable development as the main elements of short duration rainstorms the tr and pr can better measure the occurrence process and evolution characteristics of short duration rainstorms staley et al 2013 the tr represents the accumulated rainfall in a rainfall event the pr is the highest value of rainfall in a rainfall event previous studies have shown that there is a good correlation between tr and pr wang 2020 haacke and paton 2021 at present there are many studies on the characteristics and correlation of tr and pr however previous studies mostly rely on the existing measured rainstorm data li et al 2017 raymond et al 2020 but historical rainstorm events cannot be repeated and often face problems such as lack of data and low accuracy which may make the results unrepresentative or inaccurate qi et al 2022 in the field of hydrology and meteorology considering these defects and challenges stochastic simulation methods have emerged and developed sidiropoulos et al 2015 lee et al 2020 it is often used to simulate hydrometeorological variables such as rainfall runoff and flow and then analyze and study long time series wang and guo 2018 kumar et al 2019 roy and gupta 2021 however considering the relationship between urban short duration rainstorm elements there are few studies on the generation of rainstorm elements using stochastic simulation methods actually the tr and pr have two kinds of dependence relationships within and between time series short term dependence relationship and contemporaneous dependence relationship yi and liao 2010 for univariate series there is a certain relationship between the previous state and the current state of the series in time which is called the short term dependence relationship mensah et al 2019 the spatial correlation between tr and pr is called the contemporaneous dependence relationship sharma and mujumdar 2019 gao et al 2021 they respectively reflect the influence of the previous state on the current state in time series and the correlation between time series therefore when constructing a stochastic simulation model it is necessary to consider the two kinds of dependence relationships at the same time to obtain more accurate simulation results however the short term dependence relationship is often ignored in previous studies wu et al 2021 guo et al 2022 which affects the simulation accuracy the copula function is widely used in the correlation analysis of variables because of its strong flexibility and applicability abdollahi et al 2019 its appearance makes the description of the dependence between variables more perfect moreover the markov model can be used to analyze the state transition of variables roshan and nastos 2018 gao et al 2020 therefore the innovation of this study is to construct a new stochastic simulation model of rainstorm elements by combining the copula function markov model and monte carlo method it can not only maintain the probability distribution characteristics of original sequences but also conform to the above two kinds of dependence relationships to scientifically predict tr and pr and then carry out different encounters analysis the objective of this study is to randomly generate the tr and pr by considering the cstd and to reveal their joint encounters under different combinations at the same time the occurrence risk of extreme rainstorms is determined according to the specific conditional probability and crpre 1 firstly the copula function is used to analyze the two kinds of dependence relationships between tr and pr 2 secondly a stochastic simulation model considering the cstd is constructed by combining the markov model and monte carlo method and the joint distribution characteristics of simulated sequences are analyzed 3 moreover the joint probability of tr and pr the joint return period of rainfall events jrpre and the probability characteristics of synchronous and asynchronous r p are determined in original and simulated sequences 4 finally for the short duration rainstorm scenario with higher risk the conditional probability and crpre of tr and pr are analyzed to reveal the occurrence risk of extreme rainstorms this study provides a new method to generate urban short duration rainstorm elements which has theoretical and practical significance for the study of urban short duration rainstorms and the design of rainfall patterns 2 data and methods 2 1 data sources zhengzhou city is located at 112 42 114 14 e 34 16 34 58 n with a total area of 7567 km2 and an average annual rainfall of 632 4 mm the rainfall in zhengzhou city is mainly concentrated in summer while prone to extraordinary rainstorms wu et al 2020 on july 20 2021 the rainfall in 1 h exceeded the mainland record which was 201 9 mm chen et al 2022 the rainfall data in this study are the minute rainfall data of 13 rainfall stations in its five administrative districts from 2011 to 2018 the locations of the study area and rainfall stations are shown in fig 1 in the statistical period from 2011 to 2018 the rainstorm with 1 h rainfall duration accounts for 44 55 of the short duration rainstorm within 3 h therefore in this study 50 rainstorms with 1 h rainfall duration are mainly used the statistical tr and pr in the selected 50 rainstorms are shown in fig 2 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 copula method the copula method vinnarasi and dhanya 2019 is a function that describes the dependence relationship between multi dimensional random variables for continuous multivariate distribution functions the copula function can be independent of the marginal distribution of random variables when describing the correlation of variables the univariate marginal distribution function and multivariate correlation structure can be separated and their correlation structure can be revealed by the copula function yazdi and khazaei 2019 according to the sklar theorem if h is an n dimensional distribution function and f 1 f 2 f n are the marginal distribution function of each variable then there is an n dimensional copula function c 1 h x 1 x 2 x n c f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n if f 1 f 2 f n are continuous then c can be uniquely determined the function h defined in equation 1 is an n dimensional joint distribution function with marginal distribution functions copula functions mainly include archimedean copula elliptic copula and quadratic copula in the field of hydrometeorology clayton copula frank copula and gumbel copula in archimedean type and gaussian copula in elliptic type are widely used liu et al 2018 therefore the above four copula functions are mainly considered in the study of short duration rainstorm elements assuming that the tr is x and the pr is y the expressions are as follows clayton copula 2 c u w u 03 b 8 w 03 b 8 1 1 03 b 8 frank copula 3 c u w 1 θ 1 e 03 b 8 u 1 e 03 b 8 w 1 e 03 b 8 1 gumbel copula 4 c u w exp ln u 03 b 8 ln w 03 b 8 1 03 b 8 gaussian copula 5 c u w σ φ 1 u φ 1 w 1 2 π σ 1 2 exp 1 2 q t σ 1 q d q where u f 1 x and w f 2 y are the marginal distributions of x and y respectively φ 1 represents the inverse function of the standard normal distribution σ 1 ρ 12 ρ 21 1 ρ ij 1 i j ρ ji i j 1 ρ ij 1 q is the integral variable vector q q 1 q 2 t the correlation index method is used to estimate the parameter θ of the archimedean copula function and the maximum likelihood method is used to estimate the parameter ρ of the gaussian copula meanwhile the nonparametric kolmogorov smirnov test is used to fit the joint distribution function the goodness of fit of the copula function is evaluated by the ordinary least squares ols and akaike information criterion aic dodangeh et al 2019 when the copula function is optimized the jrpre and encounter probability can be revealed where the unit of jrpre is frequency freq 2 2 2 markov model the markov process is a memoryless stochastic process with certain spatial and temporal characteristics kuma et al 2021 the transition of each state only depends on the previous n states and this process is called the n order markov model when n 1 it is a first order markov model the value at the time t only depends on the value at the time t 1 and the one dimensional variable expression is 6 p x t x t x t 1 x t 1 x t 2 x t 2 x 1 x 1 p x t x t x t 1 x t 1 k x t x t 1 where k x t x t 1 is the state transition kernel it represents the probability distribution of the one dimensional variable at the time t under the condition that the state is x t 1 at time t 1 the state transition kernel can be obtained by calculating the conditional transition density 7 k x t x t 1 0 x t f z x t 1 d z where f x t x t 1 is the state transition density function the statistical properties of the markov model can be determined by its initial state and state transition kernel the state transition density function can be expressed in the form of joint probability arya and zhang 2017 its formula is 8 f x t x t 1 2 h x t x t 1 x t x t 1 f x x t 1 x t 1 according to the sklar theorem a copula function c u t 1 u t exists such that the state transition kernel and the state transition density function are expressed as 9 k x t x t 1 c u t 1 u t u t 1 10 f x t x t 1 c u t 1 u t f x t where f x t is the density function of f x therefore the first order markov model can be determined by calculating the copula function and the marginal distribution function of variables at adjacent times similarly for two dimensional variables x and y the expression is 11 p x t x t x t 1 x t 1 x t 2 x t 2 x 1 x 1 y t y t y t 1 y t 1 y t 2 y t 2 y 1 y 1 p x t x t x t 1 x t 1 y t y t y t 1 y t 1 k x t x t 1 y t y t 1 according to the copula function the binary state transition kernel can be expressed as 12 k x t x t 1 y t y t 1 c f x f y where f x f y are conditional distribution functions of variables x y the binary state transition density function is 13 f x t y t x t 1 y t 1 c f x f y c x f x x t f x x t 1 f x t 1 c y f y y t f y y t 1 f y t 1 where c x c y are the short term dependent probability distribution functions of x y at adjacent times 2 2 3 stochastic simulation considering the cstd based on the copula function and markov model the tr and pr are simulated by the monte carlo method hamidi et al 2018 considering the cstd of short duration rainstorm elements the simulation process is divided into two steps the first step considering the contemporaneous dependence of x and y a random vector c u x t u y t satisfying the two dimensional copula function is generated firstly two random variables z x z y obeying 0 1 independent distribution are generated then the recursive algorithm is used to generate a random vector c u x u y satisfying the two dimensional copula function c and the random vector c u x t u y t is generated by repeating t times where c c z x u y z x u y c 1 z y the second step considering the short term dependence of variables the state transition kernel is constructed to generate markov time series of tr and pr taking into account the cstd firstly set the new sequence v x t and take u x 1 as its initial value when t 1 when t 2 3 t v x t is obtained by iterating formula v x t c x 1 u x t v x t 1 secondly the formula x t f x 1 v x t is used for inverse transformation v x t to obtain the markov time series of tr similarly the markov time series of pr y t can be obtained 2 3 research framework the stochastic simulation model of urban short duration rainstorm elements is established by maintaining the two kinds of dependence relationships when the tr and pr are generated the copula function is used to analyze the jrpre and synchronous and asynchronous encounter probabilities under different combination states for original and simulated sequences respectively moreover based on the risk of urban short duration rainstorms the conditional probability and crpre of tr and pr are analyzed to determine the risk of extreme rainstorms the framework of this study is shown in fig 3 3 results 3 1 dependence relationships of tr and pr 3 1 1 contemporaneous dependence relationship the generalized extreme value gev distribution weibull web distribution and normal norm distribution are used to fit the marginal distribution of tr and pr in 50 rainstorms and the k s test is used to determine their optimal marginal distribution the results are shown in table 1 when n 50 the critical value of d value in k s test is 0 1884 at 5 significance level table 1 shows that except for the normal distribution of tr other distributions pass the k s test in addition according to the p value the optimal marginal distributions of tr and pr are gev distributions then kendall rank correlation coefficient τ spearman rank correlation coefficient ρ and pearson rank correlation coefficient γ are used to evaluate the correlation between tr and pr in original sequences the different correlation coefficients are τ 0 6401 ρ 0 8052 γ 0 8940 indicating that their correlation is good the marginal distributions of tr and pr are 14 f 1 x e x p 1 0 7130 5 7697 x 19 6044 1 0 7130 15 f 2 y e x p 1 0 2845 3 2283 y 8 4193 1 0 2845 the parameters of archimedean and gaussian copula functions are calculated respectively the parameters and test values of different copula functions are shown in table 2 as can be seen in table 2 the d values of the four copula functions are all less than the critical value of 5 significance level 0 1884 by the k s test therefore the four copula functions can construct the joint distribution model of tr and pr according to the evaluation value the ols and aic values of the joint distribution model constructed by the clayton copula function are the smallest therefore the clayton copula function is selected as the optimal joint probability distribution model the fitting scatter plot of empirical and theoretical copula values corresponding to the joint distribution model is shown in fig 4 as shown in fig 4 the empirical and theoretical copula values of tr and pr are highly correlated meanwhile their joint probability distribution model constructed by the clayton copula function has the highest goodness of fit of 0 9859 therefore it is reasonable to choose the clayton copula function as the joint probability distribution model of tr and pr the contemporaneous dependence model of tr and pr for 1 h rainfall duration is expressed by the clayton copula function as follows 16 c f 1 x f 2 y f 1 x 3 5571 f 2 y 3 5571 1 1 3 5571 where c f 1 x f 2 y is the two dimensional joint distribution function of tr and pr 3 1 2 short term dependence relationship the data of tr and pr in 49 adjacent rainstorms are selected the marginal distribution functions of tr are μ 1 and μ 2 and the marginal distribution functions of pr are w 1 and w 2 similarly the gev distribution web distribution and norm distribution are used to fit the marginal distribution of tr and pr and the k s test is used to determine their optimal marginal distribution functions as shown in table 3 as shown in table 3 the marginal distribution of tr and pr in the short term dependence is similar to the distribution in the contemporaneous dependence model and they all conform to the gev distribution meanwhile in the short term dependence the different correlations of tr are τ 0 0425 ρ 0 1700 γ 0 2349 respectively the correlations of pr are τ 0 0308 ρ 0 1438 and γ 0 2165 respectively similarly the parameters and test values of different copula functions in the short term dependence model are shown in table 4 when the significance level α 5 and n 49 the corresponding critical value d0 is 0 1903 whether it is tr or pr the d value of the copula function is less than the critical value therefore the four copula functions can construct the joint distribution model between the adjacent sequences of tr and pr it can be seen from table 4 that for tr and pr the ols and aic values of the joint distribution model constructed by the clayton copula function are the smallest thus the clayton copula function is selected as the joint probability distribution model of tr or pr in the short term dependence it can be seen from fig 5 that in the optimal copula function the correlation coefficient of tr is 0 9759 and the correlation coefficient of pr is 0 9710 both of which have large goodness of fit it shows that the clayton copula function model can reflect the short term dependence of tr or pr finally the short term dependence models of tr and pr are as follows 17 c u 1 x u 2 x u 1 x 0 0888 u 2 x 0 0888 1 1 0 0888 18 c w 1 y w 2 y w 1 y 0 0636 w 2 y 0 0636 1 1 0 0636 3 2 stochastic simulation of rainstorm elements considering the cstd 3 2 1 stochastic simulation of tr and pr with contemporaneous dependence according to the structure of the stochastic simulation model the tr and pr data of 500 rainfall events are generated by the monte carlo method considering only the contemporaneous dependence the simulated data are shown in fig 6 as can be seen from fig 6 the simulated tr is basically synchronized with the simulated pr considering the contemporaneous dependence however in some rainfall events the simulated data are prone to local maxima which has a negative impact on their correlation table 5 shows that the mean value and standard deviation of the simulation data are relatively large especially the standard deviation of the tr is quite different from the original sequence therefore the simulated data are not reliable when only considering the characteristics of their contemporaneous dependence the main reason is that the tr and pr have short term dependence in time between different rainfall events thus in the stochastic simulation the internal short term dependence of rainstorm elements should be considered the simulation accuracy of tr and pr can be improved by taking into account the cstd 3 2 2 stochastic simulation of tr and pr considering the cstd according to the constructed stochastic simulation model considering the characteristics of cstd the tr and pr time series of 500 rainfall events are generated the simulated data is shown in fig 7 it can be seen from fig 7 that considering the cstd the simulated tr and pr have a good correlation and conform to the synchronization moreover the phenomenon of their local extra large value is effectively improved the k s test shows that the simulated data have the same distribution as the historical data in table 6 the statistical characteristics of the simulated data are basically consistent with the historical data and their mean value and standard deviation are similar it shows that the simulation taking into account the cstd can avoid the impact on the simulation accuracy due to the local extreme value of the simulated data therefore the simulated sequences can maintain the basic statistical characteristics of original sequences and the simulation results are reliable and reasonable in addition in the simulated data the cstd of tr and pr are tested respectively 1 contemporaneous dependence of simulated data according to the clayton copula joint probability fitting test of simulated data the joint probability scatter of empirical and theoretical copula functions is distributed near the diagonal and the correlation coefficient is 0 9833 see fig 8 it indicates that the fitting effect is good and the simulated data and historical data have the same probability distribution at the same time it shows that there is a contemporaneous dependence relationship between the simulated tr and pr which can better maintain the contemporaneous dependence of original sequences 2 short term dependence of simulated data the autocorrelation function curve reflects the dependence relationship between variables at one moment and the next moment the autocorrelation function curve of simulated data and historical data of tr and pr is shown in fig 9 according to fig 9 within a certain delay range the simulated data can better maintain the autocorrelation characteristics of historical data indicating that simulated sequences of tr and pr have short term dependence therefore using the constructed stochastic simulation model the simulated sequences not only maintain the basic probability distribution characteristics of the historical data but also maintain the cstd of tr and pr therefore the constructed stochastic simulation model is reliable for the generation of rainstorm elements and can be used for the expansion of 1 h short duration rainstorm data in zhengzhou city and the analysis and research of short duration rainstorm characteristics 3 2 3 selection of joint distribution model of simulated sequences similarly the k s test is used to test the marginal distribution fitting of simulated sequences the results show that the optimal marginal distributions of tr and pr are also gev distributions which are the same as original sequences the different correlation coefficients between tr and pr are τ 0 6764 ρ 0 8543 γ 0 5419 it shows that simulated sequences can maintain the correlation of original sequences and their correlation is good the marginal distributions are as follows 19 f 1 x e x p 1 0 7564 5 7923 x 19 5443 1 0 7564 20 f 2 y e x p 1 0 2218 3 0490 y 8 3143 1 0 2218 the parameters and test values of different copula functions in simulated sequences are estimated and the results are shown in table 7 the k s test shows that the d values of the four copula functions are less than the critical value 0 0729 therefore the four copula functions can construct the joint distribution model of tr and pr according to the parameters in table 7 the ols and aic values of the joint distribution model constructed using the clayton copula function are the smallest therefore the clayton copula function is selected as the optimal joint probability distribution model in simulated sequences the fitting scatter plots of empirical and theoretical copula values of different joint distribution models are shown in fig 10 in the fitting scatter plot fig 10 the empirical and theoretical copula values of simulated sequences are highly correlated in addition compared with frank gumbel and gaussian copula functions the joint probability distribution model established by the clayton copula function has the highest goodness of fit therefore it is reasonable to choose the clayton copula function as the joint probability distribution model of tr and pr in simulated sequences the joint probability distribution model of simulated tr and pr can be expressed as follows 21 c f 1 x f 2 y f 1 x 4 1805 f 2 y 4 1805 1 1 4 1805 3 3 encounter analysis of tr and pr in original and simulated sequences 3 3 1 analysis of joint probability and contour distribution of tr and pr using the joint probability distribution model of tr and pr the joint probability distribution and contour map of original and simulated sequences are obtained as shown in figs 11 and 12 as shown in figs 11 and 12 the joint probability increases with the increase of tr and pr in original and simulated sequences moreover the simulated sequences will consider combined encounter scenarios with greater and more extreme rainfall magnitudes than the original sequences according to the contour map the variation characteristics of simulated sequences are similar to those of original sequences the joint probability of tr and pr is densely distributed in the probability interval of 0 1 0 7 and loosely distributed in the probability interval of 0 7 0 9 it shows that when the tr is the same and the pr changes less their joint probability is more likely to change greatly in the probability interval of 0 1 0 7 compared with original sequences the simulated sequences consider more extreme rainstorm scenarios the corresponding joint probability is greater and the extreme combination rainstorm is more likely to occur in addition the risk rate of simulated sequences is higher than that of original sequences and the scope of consideration is wider which makes up for the limitation and lack of existing data 3 3 2 calculation of jrpre of tr and pr according to the joint probability the jrpre of tr and pr in original and simulated sequences is obtained as shown in fig 13 as shown in fig 13 the denser the contour is the more sensitive the change of jrpre is therefore it is more sensitive when the jrpre in original sequences is between 20 and 30freq and that in simulated sequences is between 15 and 30freq when the tr is the same and the pr increases less the jrpre increases more similarly the jrpres in original and simulated sequences have opposite characteristics in other intervals their jrpres increase with the increase of tr and pr moreover according to the return period the risk of these combined events exceeding the given standard can be calculated and then the risk interval and the extreme value of tr and pr under the corresponding safety index can be determined when the tr is 140 mm and the pr is 30 mm the jrpre in original sequences is 30freq while it is smaller in simulated sequences about 25freq in addition the rainstorm magnitude of simulated sequences is larger and more extreme rainstorm scenarios are considered this manifests that the risk rate of simulated sequences is higher than that of original sequences and the extreme rainstorm is more likely to occur 3 3 3 encounter probability analysis of tr and pr the hydrological frequency method is used to divide the tr and pr into three states rich r normal n and poor p the division standard of rich and poor frequency is pf 37 5 pk 62 5 using the constructed copula model the characteristics of their r p encounters are analyzed there are 9 kinds of different r p encounters including synchronous and asynchronous r p encounters different combinations of r p encounters are shown in table 8 the threshold values of tr and pr in original and simulated sequences can be obtained from the frequency distribution curve as shown in table 9 the encounter probabilities of tr and pr in original and simulated sequences are shown in table 10 in original and simulated sequences table 10 the probability of the synchronous r p of tr and pr is greater while the probability of simulated sequences is the largest in simulated sequences the probabilities of synchronous and asynchronous r p of tr and pr are 73 14 and 26 86 respectively thus there is a good positive correlation between tr and pr in the probability of synchronous r p of tr and pr their probability of p p in original and simulated sequences is the largest and the probability of n n is the smallest in the probability of asynchronous r p of tr and pr their probability of the opposite combination state is equal in original and simulated sequences among them the encounter probability of the combination state of r p and p r is the lowest which is 1 28 and 0 86 respectively meanwhile the encounter probability of the combination state of r n and n r is the largest which is 8 33 and 7 76 respectively the probability corresponding to the extreme asynchronous combination state of r p and p r is the smallest it shows that the synchronization between tr and pr is good moreover the probability of synchronous r p in different combinations of simulated sequences is larger than that of original sequences at the same time the encounter probability of simulated sequences in different asynchronous combination states is smaller this indicates that their correlation in simulated sequences is higher however the characteristics of the r p encounter of simulated sequences are consistent with original sequences indicating that the simulated sequences are realistic and reliable 3 3 4 determination of conditional probability and crpre of tr and pr for urban short duration rainstorms more attention should be paid to the situation of large tr or pr at this time extreme rainstorms and waterlogging are more likely to occur therefore considering that the tr pr is in different states the conditional probability and crpre of pr tr greater than a certain value are calculated accordingly the risk of urban extreme rainstorms under different conditions is analyzed there are two scenarios as follows 1 scenario 1 when the state of tr is r n and p that is x x pf x pk x x pf x x pk the calculation formulas of the conditional probability and crpre of pr exceeding a certain value are shown in 22 and 23 respectively 22 f y i x r x y i p y i y x x pf 1 f y y f x x pf f x pf y 1 f x x pf f y i x n x y i p y i y x pk x x pf f x x pf f x x pk f x pk y f x pf y f x x pf f x x pk f y i x p x y i p y i y x x pk f x x pk f x pk y f x x pk 23 t y i x r x y i 1 f y i x r x y i t y i x n x y i 1 f y i x n x y i t y i x p x y i 1 f y i x p x y i 2 scenario 2 when the state of pr is r n and p that is y y pf y pk y y pf y y pk the formulas of the conditional probability and crpre of tr exceeding a certain value are shown in 24 and 25 respectively 24 f x i y r x i y p x i x y y pf 1 f y y pf f x x f x y pf 1 f y y pf f x i y n x i y p x i x y pk y y pf f y y pf f y y pk f x y pf f x y pk f y y pf f y y pk f x i y p x i y p x i x y y pk f y y pk f x y pk f y y pk 25 t x i y r x i y 1 f x i y r x i y t x i y n x i y 1 f x i y n x i y t x i y p x i y 1 f x i y p x i y 1 scenario 1 in fig 14 when the tr is in different states the conditional probability of pr decreases with its increase in addition when the tr is in the p state the conditional probability of pr is the minimum and the corresponding crpre is the maximum when the tr is in the r state the conditional probability of pr is the largest furthermore whether it is the original sequence or the simulated sequence when the pr is greater than 20 mm and the tr is in the p state the conditional probability of pr is close to 0 and the crpre is much greater than 100freq it indicates that the less the tr the smaller the conditional probability compared with original sequences the conditional probability of pr exceeding a certain value in simulated sequences is smaller and the crpre is larger moreover in simulated sequences the reference interval of conditional probability and crpre of pr is longer it indicates that when the pr is greater than a certain value the risk of extreme combination rainstorms in simulated sequences is higher than that in original sequences and the range of consideration and involvement is wider according to scenario 1 the probability and return period that the pr is greater than the intensity of the disaster causing rainfall can be estimated when the tr is in r n and p state respectively and then the occurrence risk of extreme rainstorms can be analyzed 2 scenario 2 according to fig 15 the conditional probability of tr in original and simulated sequences decreases with its increase while the crpre increases with its increase when the tr is greater than 60 mm the pr is in the r and n state respectively in original sequences the conditional probabilities of tr are 0 17 and 0 03 while the crpres are 5 88freq and 33 33freq respectively meanwhile in simulated sequences the conditional probabilities are 0 20 and 0 035 and the crpres are 5freq and 28 57freq respectively however when the pr is in the p state their conditional probabilities are close to 0 and the crpres are much longer than 100freq therefore the conditional probability of simulated sequences is large and the crpre is small at the same time the reference range of the conditional probability and the crpre of simulated sequences is longer and the range of tr is much larger than that of original sequences therefore the simulated sequences have a wider consideration and reference than original sequences and the risk of considering extreme combination rainstorms is higher moreover when the pr is in the r state the conditional probability of tr is the largest while the crpre is the smallest this indicates that it is more prone to disaster causing rainstorms with large tr and pr thus it can be estimated that when the pr is in r n and p state the probability and return period that the tr is greater than the disaster causing rainstorms which can provide a detailed reference for the study of extreme rainstorm risk and critical rainfall 4 discussion 4 1 comprehensive analysis of urban short duration rainstorms with the climate warming and rapid urbanization urban short duration rainstorm is becoming more and more frequent which has attracted the attention of different urban management departments chen et al 2021 it is of great significance for the healthy development of cities to master the characteristics of the short duration rainstorm and forecast them reasonably in this study a new rainstorm stochastic simulation model is proposed for the expansion and characteristic identification of urban short duration rainstorm data compared with previous studies singer and michaelides 2017 amponsah et al 2022 this study not only constructs a stochastic simulation model considering the cstd of tr and pr but also comprehensively reveals the changes of their encounter probability and return period in original and simulated sequences and determines the rainstorm characteristics with the high relative risk rate the results show that the constructed stochastic simulation model considering the cstd can better generate the tr and pr at random the optimal marginal distributions of simulated and original sequences obey the gev distribution and the optimal joint distributions are clayton copula in addition the simulated sequences can not only maintain the two kinds of dependence relationships of original sequences but also keep the statistical characteristics of the tr and pr basically unchanged it shows that simulated data can overcome the shortcomings of short and insufficient historical data it has good representativeness and applicability and can be used to study the characteristics of urban short duration rainstorms according to the encounter analysis of tr and pr the simulated sequences can involve more different combination encounter scenarios using the joint probability the tr and pr under different combinations of encounter risks can be designed so as to determine the characteristics of short duration rainstorm patterns it is worth noting that compared to the original sequences the simulated sequences have a larger range of values for joint probability conditional probability and return period the main reason for this is that the original sequences have less data while the simulated sequences are longer with a total of 500 sets of data therefore using the constructed stochastic simulation model to simulate the tr and pr will generate some extreme values with the maximum tr reaching about 200 mm when fitting the copula function the various values corresponding to the joint distribution model of simulation sequences are wider and the reference interval is larger in addition the simulated sequences involve the different extreme combination rainstorm situations where the tr and pr are both large at the same time which can better reflect the advantages of stochastic simulation and the simulated data can be used for reference and analysis in reality and the future at the same time compared with original sequences the change of pr is smaller than that of tr in simulated sequences on the one hand mainly due to the large value of tr itself the simulation amplification effect of the stochastic simulation model will be larger when it is randomly generated and some extreme values are more likely to be generated on the other hand it can also be seen from the statistical characteristics of tr and pr in table 6 that the simulation effect of this stochastic simulation model on pr is indeed relatively better and its mean value and standard deviation are basically close to the reality overall the stochastic simulation model can reasonably simulate tr and pr and the research results based on simulated data will be more sufficient and reliable 4 2 limitations and future work however there are several limitations in this study which need to be studied in the next step firstly limited by the short duration rainstorm data the rainstorm type is the single peak rainstorm and only the rainstorm with 1 h rainfall duration is studied secondly the selected rainstorm data has a great impact on the distribution of the model extreme rainstorm frequency and return period different time lengths based on historical data correspond to different rainfall events leading to different models thus there are some uncertainties in the frequency return period and conditional probability of the extreme rainstorm finally only tr and pr of typical elements in urban short duration rainstorms are considered and their dependence relationships and encounter characteristics are analyzed other short duration rainstorm elements are not involved in this study in future studies the double peak rainstorms and various rainfall durations can be comprehensively considered to deepen the research on the dependence relationships and encounter characteristics besides to better predict the occurrence process of short duration rainstorms and support urban sustainable development other short duration rainstorm elements should be explored on this basis such as peak coefficient rainfall intensity and post peak rainfall however this study is also reliable it will be more reasonable to consider the relevant limitations the integrated framework established in this study provides an effective way for the analysis and prediction of urban short duration rainstorms and has reference significance for other cities 5 conclusions in this study a stochastic simulation model of short duration rainstorms based on the copula function and markov model is proposed by considering the cstd of tr and pr meanwhile their encounter risks of original and simulated sequences are analyzed the main conclusions are as follows 1 the simulated sequences considering the cstd can better maintain the probability distribution and relationship characteristics of original sequences and the simulated results are accurate and reliable it is sensitive when the jepre of original sequences is between 20 and 30freq and that of simulated sequences is between 15 and 30freq as well as their joint probability is between 0 1 and 0 7 the risk of simulated sequences is higher its joint probability is greater and the jepre is relatively small so extreme rainstorms are more likely to occur moreover the scope of simulated sequences is wider and extreme rainstorms with larger magnitudes than original sequences will be considered which makes up for the deficiencies of existing data 2 in original and simulated sequences the probability of synchronous r p of tr and pr is greater than their probability of asynchronous r p and the probability of synchronous r p of simulated sequences is larger which is 73 14 the tr is highly synchronous and consistent with the pr and their probability of synchronous r p is high in the probability of synchronous r p the probability corresponding to the extreme combination state of r p and p r is the lowest 3 considering the two scenarios of large tr or pr in short duration rainstorms the conditional probability of simulated sequences with different states in scenario 2 is larger than that of original sequences while its crpre is smaller meanwhile the conditional probability of different scenarios is large in the r state and the corresponding crpre is small which is more likely to cause extreme rainstorms with large tr and pr as a whole the reference intervals of the conditional probability and the crpre of simulated sequences are longer the risk of extreme combination rainstorms in simulated sequences is higher than that in original sequences and the range of consideration and involvement is wider credit

1766,identifying the characteristics and risks of short duration rainstorms and reducing the disaster caused by extreme rainstorms are important for urban sustainable development in this study the total rainfall tr and peak rainfall pr are generated randomly by constructing a stochastic simulation model with their dependence and their encounter characteristics and return periods are analyzed by using the copula function then a case study is conducted in zhengzhou city china the results show that 1 the stochastic simulation model considering the contemporaneous and short term dependencies cstd is better than that considering only the contemporaneous dependence moreover the simulated sequences which consider the cstd can better maintain the characteristics of original sequences 2 the joint probability distribution and encounter characteristics of rich r poor p are similar between original and simulated sequences the joint probability of tr and pr is densely distributed in the probability interval of 0 1 0 7 the probability of synchronous r p is greater than that of asynchronous r p and the probability of synchronous r p in simulated sequences is even larger which is 73 14 3 the conditional probability of simulated sequences in scenario 2 is larger and the conditional return period of rainfall events crpre is smaller moreover the reference intervals of the conditional probability and crpre in simulated sequences are longer overall the risk of extreme combination rainstorms in simulated sequences is higher than that in original sequences and the scope of consideration and involvement is wider these findings can provide scientific reference for the characteristics analysis and prediction of urban short duration rainstorms keywords total rainfall peak rainfall dependence relationship stochastic simulation encounter probability data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the city is an important political and economic center in the region and its healthy development plays an important role in national economic prosperity in recent years with the rapid development of cities and the impact of global climate change large and medium sized cities around the world are prone to extreme short duration rainstorms and waterlogging disasters guan et al 2016 chen et al 2018 sun et al 2021 qian et al 2022 the rainstorm and waterlogging have also become one of the most prominent problems in many cities which have a serious impact on the infrastructure the normal life of residents and the rapid and stable development of the city quan 2014 du et al 2022 the short duration rainstorm means that the rainfall duration is within 3 h and its tr meets the rainstorm level of meteorological departments liu et al 2020 at present due to the limitations of historical rainstorm data the characteristics of short duration rainstorms cannot be accurately revealed which affects the prediction accuracy and increases the risk of urban waterlogging de lannoy et al 2005 jun et al 2020 li et al 2022 therefore it is of great significance to grasp the characteristics of urban short duration rainstorms and realize their accurate prediction for improving water security and stabilizing sustainable development as the main elements of short duration rainstorms the tr and pr can better measure the occurrence process and evolution characteristics of short duration rainstorms staley et al 2013 the tr represents the accumulated rainfall in a rainfall event the pr is the highest value of rainfall in a rainfall event previous studies have shown that there is a good correlation between tr and pr wang 2020 haacke and paton 2021 at present there are many studies on the characteristics and correlation of tr and pr however previous studies mostly rely on the existing measured rainstorm data li et al 2017 raymond et al 2020 but historical rainstorm events cannot be repeated and often face problems such as lack of data and low accuracy which may make the results unrepresentative or inaccurate qi et al 2022 in the field of hydrology and meteorology considering these defects and challenges stochastic simulation methods have emerged and developed sidiropoulos et al 2015 lee et al 2020 it is often used to simulate hydrometeorological variables such as rainfall runoff and flow and then analyze and study long time series wang and guo 2018 kumar et al 2019 roy and gupta 2021 however considering the relationship between urban short duration rainstorm elements there are few studies on the generation of rainstorm elements using stochastic simulation methods actually the tr and pr have two kinds of dependence relationships within and between time series short term dependence relationship and contemporaneous dependence relationship yi and liao 2010 for univariate series there is a certain relationship between the previous state and the current state of the series in time which is called the short term dependence relationship mensah et al 2019 the spatial correlation between tr and pr is called the contemporaneous dependence relationship sharma and mujumdar 2019 gao et al 2021 they respectively reflect the influence of the previous state on the current state in time series and the correlation between time series therefore when constructing a stochastic simulation model it is necessary to consider the two kinds of dependence relationships at the same time to obtain more accurate simulation results however the short term dependence relationship is often ignored in previous studies wu et al 2021 guo et al 2022 which affects the simulation accuracy the copula function is widely used in the correlation analysis of variables because of its strong flexibility and applicability abdollahi et al 2019 its appearance makes the description of the dependence between variables more perfect moreover the markov model can be used to analyze the state transition of variables roshan and nastos 2018 gao et al 2020 therefore the innovation of this study is to construct a new stochastic simulation model of rainstorm elements by combining the copula function markov model and monte carlo method it can not only maintain the probability distribution characteristics of original sequences but also conform to the above two kinds of dependence relationships to scientifically predict tr and pr and then carry out different encounters analysis the objective of this study is to randomly generate the tr and pr by considering the cstd and to reveal their joint encounters under different combinations at the same time the occurrence risk of extreme rainstorms is determined according to the specific conditional probability and crpre 1 firstly the copula function is used to analyze the two kinds of dependence relationships between tr and pr 2 secondly a stochastic simulation model considering the cstd is constructed by combining the markov model and monte carlo method and the joint distribution characteristics of simulated sequences are analyzed 3 moreover the joint probability of tr and pr the joint return period of rainfall events jrpre and the probability characteristics of synchronous and asynchronous r p are determined in original and simulated sequences 4 finally for the short duration rainstorm scenario with higher risk the conditional probability and crpre of tr and pr are analyzed to reveal the occurrence risk of extreme rainstorms this study provides a new method to generate urban short duration rainstorm elements which has theoretical and practical significance for the study of urban short duration rainstorms and the design of rainfall patterns 2 data and methods 2 1 data sources zhengzhou city is located at 112 42 114 14 e 34 16 34 58 n with a total area of 7567 km2 and an average annual rainfall of 632 4 mm the rainfall in zhengzhou city is mainly concentrated in summer while prone to extraordinary rainstorms wu et al 2020 on july 20 2021 the rainfall in 1 h exceeded the mainland record which was 201 9 mm chen et al 2022 the rainfall data in this study are the minute rainfall data of 13 rainfall stations in its five administrative districts from 2011 to 2018 the locations of the study area and rainfall stations are shown in fig 1 in the statistical period from 2011 to 2018 the rainstorm with 1 h rainfall duration accounts for 44 55 of the short duration rainstorm within 3 h therefore in this study 50 rainstorms with 1 h rainfall duration are mainly used the statistical tr and pr in the selected 50 rainstorms are shown in fig 2 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 copula method the copula method vinnarasi and dhanya 2019 is a function that describes the dependence relationship between multi dimensional random variables for continuous multivariate distribution functions the copula function can be independent of the marginal distribution of random variables when describing the correlation of variables the univariate marginal distribution function and multivariate correlation structure can be separated and their correlation structure can be revealed by the copula function yazdi and khazaei 2019 according to the sklar theorem if h is an n dimensional distribution function and f 1 f 2 f n are the marginal distribution function of each variable then there is an n dimensional copula function c 1 h x 1 x 2 x n c f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n if f 1 f 2 f n are continuous then c can be uniquely determined the function h defined in equation 1 is an n dimensional joint distribution function with marginal distribution functions copula functions mainly include archimedean copula elliptic copula and quadratic copula in the field of hydrometeorology clayton copula frank copula and gumbel copula in archimedean type and gaussian copula in elliptic type are widely used liu et al 2018 therefore the above four copula functions are mainly considered in the study of short duration rainstorm elements assuming that the tr is x and the pr is y the expressions are as follows clayton copula 2 c u w u 03 b 8 w 03 b 8 1 1 03 b 8 frank copula 3 c u w 1 θ 1 e 03 b 8 u 1 e 03 b 8 w 1 e 03 b 8 1 gumbel copula 4 c u w exp ln u 03 b 8 ln w 03 b 8 1 03 b 8 gaussian copula 5 c u w σ φ 1 u φ 1 w 1 2 π σ 1 2 exp 1 2 q t σ 1 q d q where u f 1 x and w f 2 y are the marginal distributions of x and y respectively φ 1 represents the inverse function of the standard normal distribution σ 1 ρ 12 ρ 21 1 ρ ij 1 i j ρ ji i j 1 ρ ij 1 q is the integral variable vector q q 1 q 2 t the correlation index method is used to estimate the parameter θ of the archimedean copula function and the maximum likelihood method is used to estimate the parameter ρ of the gaussian copula meanwhile the nonparametric kolmogorov smirnov test is used to fit the joint distribution function the goodness of fit of the copula function is evaluated by the ordinary least squares ols and akaike information criterion aic dodangeh et al 2019 when the copula function is optimized the jrpre and encounter probability can be revealed where the unit of jrpre is frequency freq 2 2 2 markov model the markov process is a memoryless stochastic process with certain spatial and temporal characteristics kuma et al 2021 the transition of each state only depends on the previous n states and this process is called the n order markov model when n 1 it is a first order markov model the value at the time t only depends on the value at the time t 1 and the one dimensional variable expression is 6 p x t x t x t 1 x t 1 x t 2 x t 2 x 1 x 1 p x t x t x t 1 x t 1 k x t x t 1 where k x t x t 1 is the state transition kernel it represents the probability distribution of the one dimensional variable at the time t under the condition that the state is x t 1 at time t 1 the state transition kernel can be obtained by calculating the conditional transition density 7 k x t x t 1 0 x t f z x t 1 d z where f x t x t 1 is the state transition density function the statistical properties of the markov model can be determined by its initial state and state transition kernel the state transition density function can be expressed in the form of joint probability arya and zhang 2017 its formula is 8 f x t x t 1 2 h x t x t 1 x t x t 1 f x x t 1 x t 1 according to the sklar theorem a copula function c u t 1 u t exists such that the state transition kernel and the state transition density function are expressed as 9 k x t x t 1 c u t 1 u t u t 1 10 f x t x t 1 c u t 1 u t f x t where f x t is the density function of f x therefore the first order markov model can be determined by calculating the copula function and the marginal distribution function of variables at adjacent times similarly for two dimensional variables x and y the expression is 11 p x t x t x t 1 x t 1 x t 2 x t 2 x 1 x 1 y t y t y t 1 y t 1 y t 2 y t 2 y 1 y 1 p x t x t x t 1 x t 1 y t y t y t 1 y t 1 k x t x t 1 y t y t 1 according to the copula function the binary state transition kernel can be expressed as 12 k x t x t 1 y t y t 1 c f x f y where f x f y are conditional distribution functions of variables x y the binary state transition density function is 13 f x t y t x t 1 y t 1 c f x f y c x f x x t f x x t 1 f x t 1 c y f y y t f y y t 1 f y t 1 where c x c y are the short term dependent probability distribution functions of x y at adjacent times 2 2 3 stochastic simulation considering the cstd based on the copula function and markov model the tr and pr are simulated by the monte carlo method hamidi et al 2018 considering the cstd of short duration rainstorm elements the simulation process is divided into two steps the first step considering the contemporaneous dependence of x and y a random vector c u x t u y t satisfying the two dimensional copula function is generated firstly two random variables z x z y obeying 0 1 independent distribution are generated then the recursive algorithm is used to generate a random vector c u x u y satisfying the two dimensional copula function c and the random vector c u x t u y t is generated by repeating t times where c c z x u y z x u y c 1 z y the second step considering the short term dependence of variables the state transition kernel is constructed to generate markov time series of tr and pr taking into account the cstd firstly set the new sequence v x t and take u x 1 as its initial value when t 1 when t 2 3 t v x t is obtained by iterating formula v x t c x 1 u x t v x t 1 secondly the formula x t f x 1 v x t is used for inverse transformation v x t to obtain the markov time series of tr similarly the markov time series of pr y t can be obtained 2 3 research framework the stochastic simulation model of urban short duration rainstorm elements is established by maintaining the two kinds of dependence relationships when the tr and pr are generated the copula function is used to analyze the jrpre and synchronous and asynchronous encounter probabilities under different combination states for original and simulated sequences respectively moreover based on the risk of urban short duration rainstorms the conditional probability and crpre of tr and pr are analyzed to determine the risk of extreme rainstorms the framework of this study is shown in fig 3 3 results 3 1 dependence relationships of tr and pr 3 1 1 contemporaneous dependence relationship the generalized extreme value gev distribution weibull web distribution and normal norm distribution are used to fit the marginal distribution of tr and pr in 50 rainstorms and the k s test is used to determine their optimal marginal distribution the results are shown in table 1 when n 50 the critical value of d value in k s test is 0 1884 at 5 significance level table 1 shows that except for the normal distribution of tr other distributions pass the k s test in addition according to the p value the optimal marginal distributions of tr and pr are gev distributions then kendall rank correlation coefficient τ spearman rank correlation coefficient ρ and pearson rank correlation coefficient γ are used to evaluate the correlation between tr and pr in original sequences the different correlation coefficients are τ 0 6401 ρ 0 8052 γ 0 8940 indicating that their correlation is good the marginal distributions of tr and pr are 14 f 1 x e x p 1 0 7130 5 7697 x 19 6044 1 0 7130 15 f 2 y e x p 1 0 2845 3 2283 y 8 4193 1 0 2845 the parameters of archimedean and gaussian copula functions are calculated respectively the parameters and test values of different copula functions are shown in table 2 as can be seen in table 2 the d values of the four copula functions are all less than the critical value of 5 significance level 0 1884 by the k s test therefore the four copula functions can construct the joint distribution model of tr and pr according to the evaluation value the ols and aic values of the joint distribution model constructed by the clayton copula function are the smallest therefore the clayton copula function is selected as the optimal joint probability distribution model the fitting scatter plot of empirical and theoretical copula values corresponding to the joint distribution model is shown in fig 4 as shown in fig 4 the empirical and theoretical copula values of tr and pr are highly correlated meanwhile their joint probability distribution model constructed by the clayton copula function has the highest goodness of fit of 0 9859 therefore it is reasonable to choose the clayton copula function as the joint probability distribution model of tr and pr the contemporaneous dependence model of tr and pr for 1 h rainfall duration is expressed by the clayton copula function as follows 16 c f 1 x f 2 y f 1 x 3 5571 f 2 y 3 5571 1 1 3 5571 where c f 1 x f 2 y is the two dimensional joint distribution function of tr and pr 3 1 2 short term dependence relationship the data of tr and pr in 49 adjacent rainstorms are selected the marginal distribution functions of tr are μ 1 and μ 2 and the marginal distribution functions of pr are w 1 and w 2 similarly the gev distribution web distribution and norm distribution are used to fit the marginal distribution of tr and pr and the k s test is used to determine their optimal marginal distribution functions as shown in table 3 as shown in table 3 the marginal distribution of tr and pr in the short term dependence is similar to the distribution in the contemporaneous dependence model and they all conform to the gev distribution meanwhile in the short term dependence the different correlations of tr are τ 0 0425 ρ 0 1700 γ 0 2349 respectively the correlations of pr are τ 0 0308 ρ 0 1438 and γ 0 2165 respectively similarly the parameters and test values of different copula functions in the short term dependence model are shown in table 4 when the significance level α 5 and n 49 the corresponding critical value d0 is 0 1903 whether it is tr or pr the d value of the copula function is less than the critical value therefore the four copula functions can construct the joint distribution model between the adjacent sequences of tr and pr it can be seen from table 4 that for tr and pr the ols and aic values of the joint distribution model constructed by the clayton copula function are the smallest thus the clayton copula function is selected as the joint probability distribution model of tr or pr in the short term dependence it can be seen from fig 5 that in the optimal copula function the correlation coefficient of tr is 0 9759 and the correlation coefficient of pr is 0 9710 both of which have large goodness of fit it shows that the clayton copula function model can reflect the short term dependence of tr or pr finally the short term dependence models of tr and pr are as follows 17 c u 1 x u 2 x u 1 x 0 0888 u 2 x 0 0888 1 1 0 0888 18 c w 1 y w 2 y w 1 y 0 0636 w 2 y 0 0636 1 1 0 0636 3 2 stochastic simulation of rainstorm elements considering the cstd 3 2 1 stochastic simulation of tr and pr with contemporaneous dependence according to the structure of the stochastic simulation model the tr and pr data of 500 rainfall events are generated by the monte carlo method considering only the contemporaneous dependence the simulated data are shown in fig 6 as can be seen from fig 6 the simulated tr is basically synchronized with the simulated pr considering the contemporaneous dependence however in some rainfall events the simulated data are prone to local maxima which has a negative impact on their correlation table 5 shows that the mean value and standard deviation of the simulation data are relatively large especially the standard deviation of the tr is quite different from the original sequence therefore the simulated data are not reliable when only considering the characteristics of their contemporaneous dependence the main reason is that the tr and pr have short term dependence in time between different rainfall events thus in the stochastic simulation the internal short term dependence of rainstorm elements should be considered the simulation accuracy of tr and pr can be improved by taking into account the cstd 3 2 2 stochastic simulation of tr and pr considering the cstd according to the constructed stochastic simulation model considering the characteristics of cstd the tr and pr time series of 500 rainfall events are generated the simulated data is shown in fig 7 it can be seen from fig 7 that considering the cstd the simulated tr and pr have a good correlation and conform to the synchronization moreover the phenomenon of their local extra large value is effectively improved the k s test shows that the simulated data have the same distribution as the historical data in table 6 the statistical characteristics of the simulated data are basically consistent with the historical data and their mean value and standard deviation are similar it shows that the simulation taking into account the cstd can avoid the impact on the simulation accuracy due to the local extreme value of the simulated data therefore the simulated sequences can maintain the basic statistical characteristics of original sequences and the simulation results are reliable and reasonable in addition in the simulated data the cstd of tr and pr are tested respectively 1 contemporaneous dependence of simulated data according to the clayton copula joint probability fitting test of simulated data the joint probability scatter of empirical and theoretical copula functions is distributed near the diagonal and the correlation coefficient is 0 9833 see fig 8 it indicates that the fitting effect is good and the simulated data and historical data have the same probability distribution at the same time it shows that there is a contemporaneous dependence relationship between the simulated tr and pr which can better maintain the contemporaneous dependence of original sequences 2 short term dependence of simulated data the autocorrelation function curve reflects the dependence relationship between variables at one moment and the next moment the autocorrelation function curve of simulated data and historical data of tr and pr is shown in fig 9 according to fig 9 within a certain delay range the simulated data can better maintain the autocorrelation characteristics of historical data indicating that simulated sequences of tr and pr have short term dependence therefore using the constructed stochastic simulation model the simulated sequences not only maintain the basic probability distribution characteristics of the historical data but also maintain the cstd of tr and pr therefore the constructed stochastic simulation model is reliable for the generation of rainstorm elements and can be used for the expansion of 1 h short duration rainstorm data in zhengzhou city and the analysis and research of short duration rainstorm characteristics 3 2 3 selection of joint distribution model of simulated sequences similarly the k s test is used to test the marginal distribution fitting of simulated sequences the results show that the optimal marginal distributions of tr and pr are also gev distributions which are the same as original sequences the different correlation coefficients between tr and pr are τ 0 6764 ρ 0 8543 γ 0 5419 it shows that simulated sequences can maintain the correlation of original sequences and their correlation is good the marginal distributions are as follows 19 f 1 x e x p 1 0 7564 5 7923 x 19 5443 1 0 7564 20 f 2 y e x p 1 0 2218 3 0490 y 8 3143 1 0 2218 the parameters and test values of different copula functions in simulated sequences are estimated and the results are shown in table 7 the k s test shows that the d values of the four copula functions are less than the critical value 0 0729 therefore the four copula functions can construct the joint distribution model of tr and pr according to the parameters in table 7 the ols and aic values of the joint distribution model constructed using the clayton copula function are the smallest therefore the clayton copula function is selected as the optimal joint probability distribution model in simulated sequences the fitting scatter plots of empirical and theoretical copula values of different joint distribution models are shown in fig 10 in the fitting scatter plot fig 10 the empirical and theoretical copula values of simulated sequences are highly correlated in addition compared with frank gumbel and gaussian copula functions the joint probability distribution model established by the clayton copula function has the highest goodness of fit therefore it is reasonable to choose the clayton copula function as the joint probability distribution model of tr and pr in simulated sequences the joint probability distribution model of simulated tr and pr can be expressed as follows 21 c f 1 x f 2 y f 1 x 4 1805 f 2 y 4 1805 1 1 4 1805 3 3 encounter analysis of tr and pr in original and simulated sequences 3 3 1 analysis of joint probability and contour distribution of tr and pr using the joint probability distribution model of tr and pr the joint probability distribution and contour map of original and simulated sequences are obtained as shown in figs 11 and 12 as shown in figs 11 and 12 the joint probability increases with the increase of tr and pr in original and simulated sequences moreover the simulated sequences will consider combined encounter scenarios with greater and more extreme rainfall magnitudes than the original sequences according to the contour map the variation characteristics of simulated sequences are similar to those of original sequences the joint probability of tr and pr is densely distributed in the probability interval of 0 1 0 7 and loosely distributed in the probability interval of 0 7 0 9 it shows that when the tr is the same and the pr changes less their joint probability is more likely to change greatly in the probability interval of 0 1 0 7 compared with original sequences the simulated sequences consider more extreme rainstorm scenarios the corresponding joint probability is greater and the extreme combination rainstorm is more likely to occur in addition the risk rate of simulated sequences is higher than that of original sequences and the scope of consideration is wider which makes up for the limitation and lack of existing data 3 3 2 calculation of jrpre of tr and pr according to the joint probability the jrpre of tr and pr in original and simulated sequences is obtained as shown in fig 13 as shown in fig 13 the denser the contour is the more sensitive the change of jrpre is therefore it is more sensitive when the jrpre in original sequences is between 20 and 30freq and that in simulated sequences is between 15 and 30freq when the tr is the same and the pr increases less the jrpre increases more similarly the jrpres in original and simulated sequences have opposite characteristics in other intervals their jrpres increase with the increase of tr and pr moreover according to the return period the risk of these combined events exceeding the given standard can be calculated and then the risk interval and the extreme value of tr and pr under the corresponding safety index can be determined when the tr is 140 mm and the pr is 30 mm the jrpre in original sequences is 30freq while it is smaller in simulated sequences about 25freq in addition the rainstorm magnitude of simulated sequences is larger and more extreme rainstorm scenarios are considered this manifests that the risk rate of simulated sequences is higher than that of original sequences and the extreme rainstorm is more likely to occur 3 3 3 encounter probability analysis of tr and pr the hydrological frequency method is used to divide the tr and pr into three states rich r normal n and poor p the division standard of rich and poor frequency is pf 37 5 pk 62 5 using the constructed copula model the characteristics of their r p encounters are analyzed there are 9 kinds of different r p encounters including synchronous and asynchronous r p encounters different combinations of r p encounters are shown in table 8 the threshold values of tr and pr in original and simulated sequences can be obtained from the frequency distribution curve as shown in table 9 the encounter probabilities of tr and pr in original and simulated sequences are shown in table 10 in original and simulated sequences table 10 the probability of the synchronous r p of tr and pr is greater while the probability of simulated sequences is the largest in simulated sequences the probabilities of synchronous and asynchronous r p of tr and pr are 73 14 and 26 86 respectively thus there is a good positive correlation between tr and pr in the probability of synchronous r p of tr and pr their probability of p p in original and simulated sequences is the largest and the probability of n n is the smallest in the probability of asynchronous r p of tr and pr their probability of the opposite combination state is equal in original and simulated sequences among them the encounter probability of the combination state of r p and p r is the lowest which is 1 28 and 0 86 respectively meanwhile the encounter probability of the combination state of r n and n r is the largest which is 8 33 and 7 76 respectively the probability corresponding to the extreme asynchronous combination state of r p and p r is the smallest it shows that the synchronization between tr and pr is good moreover the probability of synchronous r p in different combinations of simulated sequences is larger than that of original sequences at the same time the encounter probability of simulated sequences in different asynchronous combination states is smaller this indicates that their correlation in simulated sequences is higher however the characteristics of the r p encounter of simulated sequences are consistent with original sequences indicating that the simulated sequences are realistic and reliable 3 3 4 determination of conditional probability and crpre of tr and pr for urban short duration rainstorms more attention should be paid to the situation of large tr or pr at this time extreme rainstorms and waterlogging are more likely to occur therefore considering that the tr pr is in different states the conditional probability and crpre of pr tr greater than a certain value are calculated accordingly the risk of urban extreme rainstorms under different conditions is analyzed there are two scenarios as follows 1 scenario 1 when the state of tr is r n and p that is x x pf x pk x x pf x x pk the calculation formulas of the conditional probability and crpre of pr exceeding a certain value are shown in 22 and 23 respectively 22 f y i x r x y i p y i y x x pf 1 f y y f x x pf f x pf y 1 f x x pf f y i x n x y i p y i y x pk x x pf f x x pf f x x pk f x pk y f x pf y f x x pf f x x pk f y i x p x y i p y i y x x pk f x x pk f x pk y f x x pk 23 t y i x r x y i 1 f y i x r x y i t y i x n x y i 1 f y i x n x y i t y i x p x y i 1 f y i x p x y i 2 scenario 2 when the state of pr is r n and p that is y y pf y pk y y pf y y pk the formulas of the conditional probability and crpre of tr exceeding a certain value are shown in 24 and 25 respectively 24 f x i y r x i y p x i x y y pf 1 f y y pf f x x f x y pf 1 f y y pf f x i y n x i y p x i x y pk y y pf f y y pf f y y pk f x y pf f x y pk f y y pf f y y pk f x i y p x i y p x i x y y pk f y y pk f x y pk f y y pk 25 t x i y r x i y 1 f x i y r x i y t x i y n x i y 1 f x i y n x i y t x i y p x i y 1 f x i y p x i y 1 scenario 1 in fig 14 when the tr is in different states the conditional probability of pr decreases with its increase in addition when the tr is in the p state the conditional probability of pr is the minimum and the corresponding crpre is the maximum when the tr is in the r state the conditional probability of pr is the largest furthermore whether it is the original sequence or the simulated sequence when the pr is greater than 20 mm and the tr is in the p state the conditional probability of pr is close to 0 and the crpre is much greater than 100freq it indicates that the less the tr the smaller the conditional probability compared with original sequences the conditional probability of pr exceeding a certain value in simulated sequences is smaller and the crpre is larger moreover in simulated sequences the reference interval of conditional probability and crpre of pr is longer it indicates that when the pr is greater than a certain value the risk of extreme combination rainstorms in simulated sequences is higher than that in original sequences and the range of consideration and involvement is wider according to scenario 1 the probability and return period that the pr is greater than the intensity of the disaster causing rainfall can be estimated when the tr is in r n and p state respectively and then the occurrence risk of extreme rainstorms can be analyzed 2 scenario 2 according to fig 15 the conditional probability of tr in original and simulated sequences decreases with its increase while the crpre increases with its increase when the tr is greater than 60 mm the pr is in the r and n state respectively in original sequences the conditional probabilities of tr are 0 17 and 0 03 while the crpres are 5 88freq and 33 33freq respectively meanwhile in simulated sequences the conditional probabilities are 0 20 and 0 035 and the crpres are 5freq and 28 57freq respectively however when the pr is in the p state their conditional probabilities are close to 0 and the crpres are much longer than 100freq therefore the conditional probability of simulated sequences is large and the crpre is small at the same time the reference range of the conditional probability and the crpre of simulated sequences is longer and the range of tr is much larger than that of original sequences therefore the simulated sequences have a wider consideration and reference than original sequences and the risk of considering extreme combination rainstorms is higher moreover when the pr is in the r state the conditional probability of tr is the largest while the crpre is the smallest this indicates that it is more prone to disaster causing rainstorms with large tr and pr thus it can be estimated that when the pr is in r n and p state the probability and return period that the tr is greater than the disaster causing rainstorms which can provide a detailed reference for the study of extreme rainstorm risk and critical rainfall 4 discussion 4 1 comprehensive analysis of urban short duration rainstorms with the climate warming and rapid urbanization urban short duration rainstorm is becoming more and more frequent which has attracted the attention of different urban management departments chen et al 2021 it is of great significance for the healthy development of cities to master the characteristics of the short duration rainstorm and forecast them reasonably in this study a new rainstorm stochastic simulation model is proposed for the expansion and characteristic identification of urban short duration rainstorm data compared with previous studies singer and michaelides 2017 amponsah et al 2022 this study not only constructs a stochastic simulation model considering the cstd of tr and pr but also comprehensively reveals the changes of their encounter probability and return period in original and simulated sequences and determines the rainstorm characteristics with the high relative risk rate the results show that the constructed stochastic simulation model considering the cstd can better generate the tr and pr at random the optimal marginal distributions of simulated and original sequences obey the gev distribution and the optimal joint distributions are clayton copula in addition the simulated sequences can not only maintain the two kinds of dependence relationships of original sequences but also keep the statistical characteristics of the tr and pr basically unchanged it shows that simulated data can overcome the shortcomings of short and insufficient historical data it has good representativeness and applicability and can be used to study the characteristics of urban short duration rainstorms according to the encounter analysis of tr and pr the simulated sequences can involve more different combination encounter scenarios using the joint probability the tr and pr under different combinations of encounter risks can be designed so as to determine the characteristics of short duration rainstorm patterns it is worth noting that compared to the original sequences the simulated sequences have a larger range of values for joint probability conditional probability and return period the main reason for this is that the original sequences have less data while the simulated sequences are longer with a total of 500 sets of data therefore using the constructed stochastic simulation model to simulate the tr and pr will generate some extreme values with the maximum tr reaching about 200 mm when fitting the copula function the various values corresponding to the joint distribution model of simulation sequences are wider and the reference interval is larger in addition the simulated sequences involve the different extreme combination rainstorm situations where the tr and pr are both large at the same time which can better reflect the advantages of stochastic simulation and the simulated data can be used for reference and analysis in reality and the future at the same time compared with original sequences the change of pr is smaller than that of tr in simulated sequences on the one hand mainly due to the large value of tr itself the simulation amplification effect of the stochastic simulation model will be larger when it is randomly generated and some extreme values are more likely to be generated on the other hand it can also be seen from the statistical characteristics of tr and pr in table 6 that the simulation effect of this stochastic simulation model on pr is indeed relatively better and its mean value and standard deviation are basically close to the reality overall the stochastic simulation model can reasonably simulate tr and pr and the research results based on simulated data will be more sufficient and reliable 4 2 limitations and future work however there are several limitations in this study which need to be studied in the next step firstly limited by the short duration rainstorm data the rainstorm type is the single peak rainstorm and only the rainstorm with 1 h rainfall duration is studied secondly the selected rainstorm data has a great impact on the distribution of the model extreme rainstorm frequency and return period different time lengths based on historical data correspond to different rainfall events leading to different models thus there are some uncertainties in the frequency return period and conditional probability of the extreme rainstorm finally only tr and pr of typical elements in urban short duration rainstorms are considered and their dependence relationships and encounter characteristics are analyzed other short duration rainstorm elements are not involved in this study in future studies the double peak rainstorms and various rainfall durations can be comprehensively considered to deepen the research on the dependence relationships and encounter characteristics besides to better predict the occurrence process of short duration rainstorms and support urban sustainable development other short duration rainstorm elements should be explored on this basis such as peak coefficient rainfall intensity and post peak rainfall however this study is also reliable it will be more reasonable to consider the relevant limitations the integrated framework established in this study provides an effective way for the analysis and prediction of urban short duration rainstorms and has reference significance for other cities 5 conclusions in this study a stochastic simulation model of short duration rainstorms based on the copula function and markov model is proposed by considering the cstd of tr and pr meanwhile their encounter risks of original and simulated sequences are analyzed the main conclusions are as follows 1 the simulated sequences considering the cstd can better maintain the probability distribution and relationship characteristics of original sequences and the simulated results are accurate and reliable it is sensitive when the jepre of original sequences is between 20 and 30freq and that of simulated sequences is between 15 and 30freq as well as their joint probability is between 0 1 and 0 7 the risk of simulated sequences is higher its joint probability is greater and the jepre is relatively small so extreme rainstorms are more likely to occur moreover the scope of simulated sequences is wider and extreme rainstorms with larger magnitudes than original sequences will be considered which makes up for the deficiencies of existing data 2 in original and simulated sequences the probability of synchronous r p of tr and pr is greater than their probability of asynchronous r p and the probability of synchronous r p of simulated sequences is larger which is 73 14 the tr is highly synchronous and consistent with the pr and their probability of synchronous r p is high in the probability of synchronous r p the probability corresponding to the extreme combination state of r p and p r is the lowest 3 considering the two scenarios of large tr or pr in short duration rainstorms the conditional probability of simulated sequences with different states in scenario 2 is larger than that of original sequences while its crpre is smaller meanwhile the conditional probability of different scenarios is large in the r state and the corresponding crpre is small which is more likely to cause extreme rainstorms with large tr and pr as a whole the reference intervals of the conditional probability and the crpre of simulated sequences are longer the risk of extreme combination rainstorms in simulated sequences is higher than that in original sequences and the range of consideration and involvement is wider credit

1767,lithology dissolution degree and other geological factors are essential factors affecting karst environments however the complex effects of multiple geologic factors on runoff characteristics have not been well quantified in karst catchments thus 30 catchments and four runoff characteristics runoff coefficient runoff modulus annual runoff extremes ratio and annual runoff variation coefficient were selected in this study to evaluate the influence of geological factors on runoff characteristics in karst catchments the linear mixed effect model was used to quantitatively evaluate the contribution rate of each factor to the runoff characteristics and the structural equation model was used to analyze the quantitative relationship between each factor and the runoff characteristics the results show that among the three aspects of geological factors hydrogeological factors have the greatest influence on runoff characteristic values in turn the density of sinkhole is the most influential factor among the hydrogeological factors geological structure factors had both direct and indirect effects on runoff characteristics path coefficient is 0 27 among them the density of faults is the most influential factor geochemical factors affected runoff characteristics more by influencing hydrogeological factors path coefficient 0 51 or geological structure factors path coefficient 0 43 in conclusion data from several watersheds directly confirm that in karst watersheds these geological factors such as hydrogeology geochemistry and geological structure have a very fundamental influence on karst watershed runoff characteristics our results can help us further understand karst hydrological processes and improve the accuracy of karst hydrological modeling keywords geological factors runoff characteristics linear mixed effect model structural equation model karst data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction runoffs are typically described by a series of runoff characteristics including the runoff coefficient rc and coefficient of variation cv among others runoff characteristics are mainly affected by climate factors and watershed characteristics including watershed form soil vegetation topography and geology merz bloschl 2009 zhang et al 2014 you et al 2021 zheng et al 2018 among these geological factors have a very important impact on runoff characteristics this is because geological factors directly and indirectly affect the characteristic value of runoff by influencing the soil vegetation topography and other factors hou et al 2020 mcguire et al 2005 sang et al 2022 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 therefore studying the influence of watershed characteristics on runoff characteristics is crucial in exploring the law of hydrological phenomena and water resources management the geological factors that affect the characteristics of runoff usually include lithology and geological structures the differences in lithology affect the characteristics of groundwater storage and infiltration and thus affect the characteristic value of runoff hattanji and onda 2004 christensen et al 2020 among various geological structural factors strike dip direction and dip angle affect the runoff characteristics mainly by regulating the infiltration and confluence processes bogaart troch 2006 huang et al 2013 inaoka et al 2020 in addition folds and faults also have significant effects on groundwater processes and thus on runoff sibson 1981 howald et al 2015 krainer et al 2021 compared with non karst catchments karst catchments have obvious differences in geological conditions these differences are mainly manifested in two aspects on the one hand karst watersheds are mainly composed of dissolvable carbonate rocks and the bedrock is usually dissolved by running water to form a system of vertical downward pipes and underground rivers through which running water flows into underground rivers jukić and denić jukić 2015 martin et al 2016 peng et al 2022 zhou et al 2022 this feature makes the process of rock water storage and confluence in karst catchments significantly different from that in non karst catchments merz et al 2011 tarasova et al 2018 mo et al 2021 krainer et al 2021 yan et al 2022 zhong et al 2022 on the other hand the bedrock in some karst catchments is formed by the alternate superposition of carbonate and noncarbonate strata known as interbedded in geology and the water flows both in the form of pipe flow and lateral flow which complicates the influence of occurrence fold and other structural factors on the runoff characteristics chen et al 2011 wang et al 2019 li et al 2023 in addition because of differences in lithology and hydrogeological conditions karst catchments usually show thin soil layers discontinuous soil and poor vegetation growth compared with non karst areas zhang et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 and these factors affect runoff characteristics therefore the influence of geological factors on runoff characteristics in karst watersheds may be different from that in non karst watersheds several studies have been conducted to analyze the influence of individual geological factors on runoff characteristics in karst catchments hou and gao 2019 huang niemann 2008 jiang et al 2014 wen et al 2019 for example li et al 2011 showed that the existence of rock cracks is crucial to promoting the permeability of limestone karst landforms and that the rc decreases with the increasing number of cracks meanwhile zhang et al 2014 showed that the rc decreased as the proportion of the carbonate area increased however although the above research helps us understand the influence of single factors on runoff characteristics geological factors are inherently complex and single factors such as the degree of fracture development and the proportion of carbonate area cannot fully explain the influence of geological factors on runoff characteristics given the limitations of individual geologic factors several studies have also analyzed the effects of multiple geologic factors on runoff characteristics for example liu et al 2020 analyzed the effects of karst area limestone area and dolomite area on runoff characteristics zhang et al 2014 analyzed the effect of different rock type combinations on runoff characteristics however most studies analyzed a few geological factors and did not quantitatively assess the effects of multiple geological factors on runoff characteristics in fact geological structures hydrogeology and other factors may have significant effects on hydrological characteristics and there may be complex interactions among these factors without considering as many geological factors as possible it is difficult to explain clearly the complex quantitative relationships of the influence of geological factors on runoff characteristics especially in such a complex natural environment as karst this can make it difficult to perform accurate hydrologic modeling and hydrologic process analysis this study aims to evaluate the quantitative relationships between multiple geological factors and runoff characteristics in karst catchments and to analyze how these geological factors interact with each other to influence runoff characteristics in this study 30 catchments in karst areas of southwest china were selected as representative catchments first geological factors were selected from the three aspects of geochemistry geological structure and hydrogeology and nongeological factors were selected from the four aspects of land use soil topography and climate four representative runoff characteristics runoff coefficient rc runoff modulus rm annual runoff extremes ratio rep and coefficient of variation of runoff cv were selected on this basis the linear mixed effect model was used to quantitatively evaluate the contribution rate of each factor to the characteristic value of runoff and the relationship between each factor and its influence on the characteristic of runoff were analyzed using a structural equation model 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in southwest china s guizhou province 24 37 to 29 13 n 103 36 to 109 35 e fig 1 the terrain slopes from the west to the north east and south with an elevation between 137 and 2900 6 m the study area is one of the most representative areas in the world with extensive distribution of carbonate rocks and complex and diverse karst landforms the catchments selected in this study are mostly mountainous rivers with large slopes rapid water flow strong undercutting erosion and exposed bedrock in the valley floor river landforms are mainly distributed in v shaped valleys canyons and wide valleys and rivers usually develop along geological structures the study area has a typical subtropical wet monsoon climate with an average annual temperature of 16 1 c and an average annual precipitation of 1137 8 mm most of which is concentrated between may and october a total of 30 watersheds were selected for analysis in this study and the catchment area of each watershed ranged from 275 to 5531 km2 with an average area of 1606 km2 fig 1 table s1 2 2 selection of influencing factors as shown in table 1 this study selected a total of 20 indicators of seven types of factors affecting runoff characteristics among them land use topographic factors soil physical and chemical properties and climate factors have been confirmed by existing relevant studies to have a greater impact on runoff characteristic values in karst watersheds li et al 2020 liu et al 2018 saroli et al 2022 sweeting 1977 on this basis this study adds three kinds of geological factors geochemistry hydrogeology and geological structure the scientific implications of these geological indicators are illustrated in table 2 2 3 data source and processing 2 3 1 runoff characteristic data according to the statistical data of hydrological characteristics in guizhou province over the years compiled by guizhou hydrological station 1984 we directly obtained the annual runoff of 30 hydrological stations from 1964 to 1978 and the catchment area data of the watershed controlled by the hydrological stations notably after the 1980 s the study area experienced large scale vegetation destruction and has led to widespread karst rocky desertification after 2000 due to the large scale ecological restoration projects implemented in china the study area experienced large scale vegetation restoration zhang et al 2016 guo et al 2023 the destruction and restoration of vegetation during this period made the relationship between rainfall and runoff unstable therefore an earlier period of hydrological data was selected in this study in addition although there are more than 100 hydrological stations in the statistical data of hydrological characteristics in guizhou province most of the stations are actually new stations with only a few years of data therefore we only selected 30 watersheds with a long observation period rc for each hydrological station was also available directly from this document rc rm rep and cv were calculated using the following formula 1 rc r d p where rc is the runoff coefficient rd is the runoff depth mm and p is the precipitation mm 2 m q a where m is the rm l s km2 q is the annual discharge l s and a is the catchment area km2 3 rep q max q min where q max is the maximum annual flow l s and q min is the minimum annual flow l s during the study period 4 cv i 1 n k i 1 2 n 1 where n is the number of years during the study period ki is the annual runoff variation in year i that is the ratio of runoff in year i to average runoff during the study period ki greater than 1 indicates that the runoff in year i is greater than the average ki 1 denotes the opposite 2 3 2 geochemical data the data for the three geochemical indicators cao mgo and sio2 selected in this study were obtained from the regional geochemistry national reconnaissance program rgnr in china the rgnr takes samples of stream sediment and these samples are mixtures of upstream soils and have elemental concentration values near the average xie et al 2009 the sampling density was 1 2 samples km2 and samples within grids of 2 2 km2 were mixed for analysis a total of 233 810 samples were sampled throughout guizhou province with an average sampling density of 1 22 samples km2 this program was conducted under the regulation of specification for regional geochemistry exploration dz t0167 2006 to ensure data quality the collected samples in the study area were from 1978 to 1998 before the economic boom in china in recent decades as these were more suitable for the study of soil background because they contain less information from human pollution xia et al 2022 a geochemical atlas has been published on the basis of this dataset feng 2008 the data used in this study were obtained by digitizing these maps 2 3 3 hydrogeological data spring density data and sinkhole density were obtained from the 1 200 000 hydrogeological map provided by the geoscientific data discovery publishing system mu et al 2021 the 1 200 000 hydrogeological map contained information about the spatial location of springs and sinkholes by calculating the number of springs and sinkholes in each catchment per catchment area we get the density of springs and sinkholes the density and depth of the depressions were obtained by topographic analysis using aster gdem data with 30 m spatial resolution using the hydrologic analysis module in arcmap10 7 the digital elevation model dem was analyzed using a 3 3 grid resolution then the difference between the elevation value of the same grid that has not been filled in and the elevation value that has been filled in was calculated the grid whose difference value was not 0 was the depression the difference was the depression depth finally the density of the depression can be obtained by calculating the ratio of the total area of all depressions to the area of the catchment 2 3 4 geological structure data geological structure data were obtained from the 1 200 000 geological map provided by the geoscientific data discovery publishing system li et al 2019 the 1 200 000 geological map contained fault information li et al 2019 fig s1 in the supporting information the fault density was obtained by calculating the proportion of faults in each watershed the dip angle was marked on the 1 200 000 geological map and the average dip angle of all the points marked in each watershed was obtained using point by point statistics on the basis of the river information contained in the 1 200 000 geological map we judged the dominant flow direction of the river and the dominant trend of the strata to obtain the angle between the flow direction of the river and the trend of the strata carbonate and clastic interbedding data were obtained from the 1 2 5 million national geological map from the geological sciences data press https geodb cgs gov cn ye et al 2017 2 3 5 other data land use data were from the data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences https www resdc cn the spatial resolution of the data was 30 m the time range of runoff characteristic data used in this study was 1964 1978 whereas the land use data used in this study were from 1980 the two data did not match in time the reason why earlier land use data were not used in this study was that the remote sensing satellite technology was not developed before the 1980 s thus it was difficult to obtain land use data with high accuracy however before 1980 china s social and economic development was very slow during which the land use change was not obvious so the data from 1980 can also represent the situation from 1964 to 1978 elevation data were obtained directly from aster gdem with a 30 m resolution slope and topographic relief were calculated using dem data in the spatial analysis module of the arcmap10 7 software soil organic carbon content and soil gravel content were obtained from the basic attribute dataset of china s high resolution national soil information grid with a spatial resolution of 90 m liu et al 2021 the data were downloaded from the national earth system science data center soil sub center https soil geodata cn monthly mean temperature and rainfall data with a 1 km resolution for the whole study area from 1964 to 1978 were obtained from the national tibetan plateau data center peng et al 2019 on this basis the annual mean rainfall and temperature data of 30 catchments were extracted 2 4 methods 2 4 1 partial least squares regression in this study partial least squares regression plsr was used to verify whether there were indicators affecting runoff characteristics among the selected indicators carrascal et al 2009 onderka et al 2012 shi et al 2014 this is the premise for constructing the linear mixed effect model and structural equation model detailed information on plsr modeling can be found in previous studies abdi 2010 li et al 2017 the model were cross validated to avoid overfitting and the root mean square error rmsecv of the cross validation provided additional information about the plsr model calibration and development to determine the appropriate number of fits required for the model components to achieve the best balance between the interpreted response variation r 2 and the goodness of model prediction q 2 q2 and resecvs were calculated using the following formulas 5 q 2 1 0 p r e s s s s 6 r m s e c v p r e s s n where press is the prediction error sum of squares ss is the sum squared residual and n is the number of samples in this study n is the number of selected watersheds to avoid overfitting the models were cross validated the root mean square error of cross validation rmsecv provides additional information about the calibration and development of the plsr model to determine the appropriate number of fits to the model components needed to obtain the best balance between the explained response variation r 2 and the model predictive superiority q 2 when r 2 and q 2 are greater than 0 5 the plsr model provides good prediction effect and good prediction ability respectively and is also the standard for measuring the relationship between the selected driving indicators and runoff characteristics trap et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 in this study simca 14 1 software was used to run plsr 2 4 2 linear mixed effects model in the linear mixed effects model lmem constructed using various natural factors variance partitioning analysis vpa is used to quantify the contribution of various natural factors especially geochemistry geological structure and hydrogeological factors to the characteristic value of runoffs in this study after vpa is applied to all geological factors the contribution rates of specific individual geological factors and their interactions with runoff characteristics can be obtained the contribution rates of factors v2 were calculated using the following formulas 7 v 2 σ 2 i 1 k p i μ i μ 2 σ 2 k 1 i 1 where k is the number of watersheds i is the number of factors pi ni n ni is the number of observations of factors i n is the total number of observations μi is the mean of factors i μ is the mean of the overall and σ2 is the error variance of the factors genizi 1993 the linmod and lmer functions in the relaimpo package grömping 2007 were used to build the lmem in the r language environment the varpart function of the vegan package was used for vpa analysis and the origin2020 software was used to visualize the results 2 4 3 partial least squares structural equation model in this study the partial least squares structural equation model pls sem was used to quantify the influence of natural factors on runoff characteristics and the relationships among these factors pls sem is structured to provide causal explanations hair et al 2017 venturini mehmetoglu 2019 wold 1982 hair et al 2019 sarstedt et al 2017 six indexes are used to measure the fitness of the ple sem model among them the first goodness of fit gof and second r 2 indicators measure the relationship between latent variables whereas the other four indicators measure the relationship between observed variables the third is the comparative fit index cfi the fourth is the goodness of fit index gfi the fifth is the root mean square error of approximation rmsea the sixth index is the model degree of freedom df hair et al 2019 a typical pls sem model consists of two parts the structural model and the measurement model the structural model shows the relationship between latent variables natural factors and the corresponding path coefficient is used to mark the relationship between latent variables meanwhile the measurement model provides the relationship between the underlying variables and the observations they define in this study pls sem model was designed using the lavaan package rosseel 2014 in r studio 4 2 1 and the plspm function in the cran package the sempaths function in the semplot package was used to visualize the running results of the model 3 results 3 1 general situation of runoff characteristics the 30 catchments selected in this study were all located in the same province and the runoff characteristics showed great differences among different catchments fig 2 and table s2 for example the maximum rep was almost 10 times the minimum value the maximum cv was almost 4 5 times the minimum value and the average coefficient of variation was 31 4 the maximum rm was 4 3 times the minimum and the average was 21 0 l s km2 the maximum rc was about 1 8 times the minimum and the average rc was 0 562 in contrast the rainfall and temperature varied much less across catchments in each catchment the maximum annual precipitation was 2 3 times the minimum value and the maximum annual temperature was 2 6 times the minimum value this indicates that watershed characteristic factors including geological factors play an important role in regulating runoff characteristics 3 2 prediction ability of indicators to runoff characteristics fig 3 shows that in plsr when the first prediction fits all the driving factors can meet the measurement criteria to explain the runoff characteristics r 2 0 5 however its prediction goodness q 2 does not exceed 0 5 in the second and third fittings r 2 in the four figures all increased and their q 2 was greater than 0 5 meanwhile the rmsecv of the cross validation was the smallest however the continued increase in fitting times did not improve the variance of interpretation fig 3 the results show that the plsr provides a good prediction effect and good prediction ability for the third fitting which indicates that driving factors affect the runoff characteristics in the selected natural factors 3 3 contribution rate of natural factors to runoff characteristics the contribution rate of natural factors to runoff characteristics reached more than 70 whereas the contribution rate of geological factors to runoff characteristics ranged from 27 to 56 fig 4 however the contribution rate of selected natural factors to runoff characteristics in the study area was very different hydrogeological topographic and geochemical factors contributed more to runoff characteristics with hydrogeological factors having the most obvious influence however the contribution rate of geological structures climate factors soil properties and land use was small the contribution rate of soil properties to rep and cv was only 3 among the geological factors the contribution rate of rc rep and cv ranged from 15 to 30 whereas the contribution rate of hydrogeological factors to rm was less 11 as regards the geochemical hydrogeological and geological structural factors the contribution rate of each indicator to the runoff characteristics was also different first among the indicators of geochemical factors cao and sio2 contents had greater contributions to runoff characteristics whereas mgo content had the least contribution from the perspective of different runoff characteristics except for the small difference in rep affected by each indicator the degree of influence of each indicator of geochemical factors on the other three runoff characteristics varied greatly fig 5 a second among the hydrogeological factors the sinkhole density the depth of depressions and the spring density had greater contributions to the runoff characteristics whereas the depression density had the least contribution the contribution rates of the hydrogeological factors to rm were significantly different the contribution rates of sinkhole density and depression depth were 46 and 35 respectively whereas the contribution rates of spring density and depression density were only 9 fig 5c third the contribution rate of each indicator to the characteristic value of different runoff varied greatly among the geological structure factors the contribution rate of fault density to rc and rm was larger that of the dip angle to cv was larger and that of the fault density and dip angle to rep was larger rc and rm were mainly affected by fault density fig 5b 3 4 influence of geological factors on runoff characteristics although lmem can obtain the contribution rate of each natural factor to the runoff characteristics it cannot explain the interaction of each natural factor and its influence on the runoff characteristics in this study pls sem was used to further illustrate this problem fig 6 shows that pls sem can explain the interaction of the selected potential variables and the influence of the variables themselves on the runoff characteristics gof 0 67 r 2 0 88 fig 6 shows that the path coefficients of hydrogeological factors on runoff characteristics are relatively large 0 60 whereas the path coefficients of the geochemical geological structure and topographic factors on hydrological characteristic values were relatively small 0 34 0 27 and 0 41 respectively meanwhile the path coefficients of soil land use and climate were smaller geochemical factors affected hydrogeological factors both directly path coefficient is 0 51 and indirectly by influencing geological structure factors path coefficient is 0 43 the geochemical factors were themselves influenced by climatic factors path coefficient is 0 39 however geological structure factors indirectly affected runoff characteristics mainly by influencing hydrogeological factors path coefficient is 0 57 in addition to the direct influence on runoff characteristics hydrogeological factors also exerted an indirect influence by influencing topographic factors path coefficient is 0 38 fig 7 a shows that the fault density depression depth sinkhole density and mgo content had a large path coefficient on rc the path coefficient of the depression depth to rc was the largest 0 33 in addition the fault density and depression depth had negative effects on rc whereas the sinkhole density and mgo content had positive effects on rc in terms of rm the path coefficients of cao mgo and sio2 contents on rm were relatively large at 0 48 0 68 and 0 35 respectively fig 7b the indicators with large path coefficients for rep and cv were similar and the path coefficients 0 44 to 0 7 for the cao content sinkhole density mgo content and fault density were all large fig 7c and fig 7d cao content and sinkhole density had positive effects on both whereas mgo content and fault density had negative effects on both however the path coefficients of the two indicators were relatively small 0 16 4 discussion 4 1 influence mechanism of geological factors on runoff characteristics this study shows that geological factors are important factors affecting the hydrological characteristics of karst watersheds hydrogeological factors have a direct and important influence on runoff characteristics although the direct influence of geochemical and geological structure factors was slightly small they also indirectly affected the characteristic value of runoff through hydrogeological factors fig 6 and fig 7 among the hydrogeological factors in this study the sinkhole density greatly influenced the runoff characteristics the sinkhole density represented the degree of groundwater system development in karst catchments adams et al 2016 the greater the sinkhole density the more intense the development of groundwater channels such as dissolution fissures karst caves and underground rivers jukić and denić jukić 2015 martin et al 2016 thus forming hydrogeological environments of above ground and subsurface dual structure unique to karst environments liang yang 1995 the strong development of groundwater channels results in rapid infiltration of surface water and less water loss through evaporation transpiration and other forms resulting in higher rc zhang et al 2014 huang and niemann 2008 some studies have found that surface runoff discharge and velocity in karst areas decrease with the increase in drainage capacity which depends on the size and shape of sinkholes fischer et al 2022 mo et al 2019 these studies also further confirmed that sinkhole density has an obvious effect on runoff characteristics like sinkholes depressions are also common negative terrains in karst areas but this study shows that the depression depth has a negative path coefficient for rc fig 7a karst depressions are mainly composed of clay because of the low water conductivity and high water retention capacity of clay it is not conducive to water infiltration xu et al 2020 fig s2 thus more water is consumed in evapotranspiration and the rc decreases fig 8 the influence of geochemical factors on runoff characteristics is mainly realized indirectly as they influence hydrogeological factors or geological structure factors fig 6 the influence on hydrogeological factors is reflected in that the calcium and magnesium contents characterize rock solubility calcium usually exists in nature in the form of calcium carbonate the higher the amount of calcium carbonate in a rock the more easily it is dissolved by water ford williams 2007 in addition the solubility of bedrock affects hydrogeological indexes such as the sinkhole density the depression density and the depression depth xiao et al 2016 gökkaya et al 2021 which in turn affect the characteristic value of runoff the influence of geochemical factors on geological structures is reflected in that the calcium magnesium and silica contents in rocks affect the interbedding ratio between carbonate rocks and clastic rocks rauch white 1970 stephenson pryor 1979 pure carbonate rocks contain a higher proportion of calcium and magnesium for karst environments a high silica content usually represents an interbedded structure of carbonate and clastic rocks wang et al 2004 the clastic rocks sandwiched in carbonate rocks in karst environments are looser than carbonate rocks formed by chemical deposition due to the recementation of particles thus they are more prone to plastic deformation under tectonic stress and less prone to fracture resulting in lower fault density novak egenhoff 2019 in fig 7 the path coefficient between the interbedded ratio of carbonate and clastic rocks and the fault density is negative which proves the negative correlation between the two meanwhile clastic rocks are not dissolved by water and are thus good medium for water storage and can effectively prevent the rapid infiltration of water the above indicates that geochemical factors affect runoff characteristics by affecting the fault density rock water resistance and water storage capacity the direct influence of geological structure factors is reflected in the formation of faults by tectonic stresses which are accompanied by extensive rock fissures rock fissures and faults depending on their molecular and capillary forces form good storage spaces chang makkeasorn 2010 rock strata with developed fractures have high water storage capacities jones graham 1993 peng et al 2019 and conducive to extending the response time of rainfall to runoff reducing the peak water level in the wet season and increasing the water level in the dry season chen et al 2022 krainer et al 2021 therefore fault density has an obvious negative path coefficient for rc trp and cv fig 7 a series of studies on the water storage capacity of weathered rocks in the vadose zone in recent years have also confirmed that cracks in rocks are important water storage spaces gabrielli and mcdonnell 2018 hale and mcdonnell 2016 illien et al 2021 for areas with shallow soil layers such as karst mountains water storage spaces formed by rock fractures are more important liu et al 2021 geological structure factors also had an indirect influence on runoff characteristics because water infiltration and dissolution usually preferentially occur in rock cracks estrada medina et al 2013 larger cracks are preferentially dissolved thus forming channels that allow the easy flow of water to groundwater such as sinkholes ozdemir 2015 soriano et al 1994 this is also proven by the positive path coefficient between the fault density and sinkhole density in fig 7 however this contradicts the idea that higher fault densities slow down water infiltration rates as we mentioned earlier therefore the relationship between geological structure factors especially fault and runoff characteristics is complex which may also be closely related to the degree of rock fissure opening 4 2 uncertainty the structural equation model can identify the degree of the mutual influence of each factor and the degree of influence on runoff characteristics however it is not possible to give a more detailed functional relationship between the factors and the runoff characteristic values such as the changes in the runoff characteristics corresponding to different strata dip angles this more detailed functional relationship is usually analyzed through controlled experiments however the spatial heterogeneity of environmental factors in karst catchments is great ford williams 2007 veress 2020 resulting in the failure to collect representative samples for indoor control experiments moreover karst hydrological critical zones are extremely deep yuan 2015 making it difficult to conduct control experiments in such a deep range fig 4 shows that there are still 14 28 runoff characteristics that are not explained by the factors considered in this study the main reason is that so many factors affect runoff characteristics in different catchments that including all of them is difficult in addition data availability is also an important reason why we did not consider all factors for example the thickness of the epikarst zone and soil directly affect water storage conditions however these factors were not considered due to the unavailability of high precision data in addition although some indicators were considered there were still some uncertainties in the data accuracy for example the fault density data came from a 1 200 000 geological map the fault information was determined mainly through a manual field survey combined with aerial photographs this can lead to more faults in areas that investigators focus on but not for some areas with fewer faults however because the geological survey process of the 1 200 000 geological map is very detailed it is one of the most commonly used geological data in china therefore we still believe that these maps can reflect the characteristics of overall geological elements such as faults sinkholes and springs in general uncertainty can be reduced in three ways selecting more representative watersheds introducing more key indicators and improving the precision of data are directions to reduce the uncertainty of results first more representative watersheds should be selected if possible the study can be extended to the whole karst region of southwest china so that more watersheds can be selected second more key indicators are taken into account such as surface karst zones and soil thickness in addition the basic data can be validated by supplementing field surveys or the accuracy of the data can be improved by remote sensing surveys 4 3 main findings and possible applications the results of this study show that geochemical geological structure and hydrogeological factors contribute greatly to runoff characteristic values in karst areas in addition to climate topography soil land use and other factors fig 4 the differences in geochemistry geological structure and hydrogeology between karst and non karst areas are the essential differences between karst and non karst catchments hydrogeological factors such as the sinkhole density and depression depth are not considered in the study of the influence of geological factors on runoff in non karst areas because there is almost no carbonate karst dissolution in non karst areas merz and blöschl 2009 you et al 2021 zheng et al 2018 however the influence of geochemical factors such as calcium and magnesium contents on hydrological characteristics can be almost negligible because of the relatively small proportion of non karst areas this study comprehensively analyzed the influence of geological factors on hydrological characteristics and considered the interaction of these factors however previous studies on karst catchments did not consider geological factors or only analyzed the influence of one or two geological factors on runoff characteristic values krainer et al 2021 liu et al 2020 mo et al 2021 the results of this study can help us further understand the influence of geological elements on the runoff formation process and runoff characteristic values in karst watersheds however hydrological modeling in karst catchments has always been a great challenge hartmann et al 2014 jeannin et al 2021 primarily because we still do not have a clear understanding of the influencing factors and mechanisms of karst hydrological processes the factors identified in this study that have an important impact on the characteristic value of runoff can be used in the hydrological modeling of karst watersheds and the interaction between these factors that we recognized can also be included in hydrological modeling this can not only improve the precision of hydrological simulations but also simulate the hydrological processes of karst catchments in more detail 5 conclusion geochemical hydrogeological and geological structure factors all have key influences on runoff characteristics among which hydrogeological factors had the greatest influence each geological factor not only directly affected the runoff characteristics but also indirectly affected runoff characteristic values by influencing other geological factors among them geochemical factors affected runoff characteristics mainly by influencing hydrogeological factors or geological structures then hydrogeological factors and finally runoff characteristics among the studied hydrogeological factors the sinkhole density had a great influence on runoff characteristics whereas the depression depth had a negative influence on rc meanwhile geological structure factors had both direct and indirect effects on runoff characteristics fault density was an indicator of geological structure factors with obvious influence but the influence of this indicator on runoff characteristics was complex and there were positive or negative influences the results of this study help us understand karst hydrological processes more deeply and improve the accuracy of karst hydrological simulation results and the details of such processes declaration of competing interest the authors

1767,lithology dissolution degree and other geological factors are essential factors affecting karst environments however the complex effects of multiple geologic factors on runoff characteristics have not been well quantified in karst catchments thus 30 catchments and four runoff characteristics runoff coefficient runoff modulus annual runoff extremes ratio and annual runoff variation coefficient were selected in this study to evaluate the influence of geological factors on runoff characteristics in karst catchments the linear mixed effect model was used to quantitatively evaluate the contribution rate of each factor to the runoff characteristics and the structural equation model was used to analyze the quantitative relationship between each factor and the runoff characteristics the results show that among the three aspects of geological factors hydrogeological factors have the greatest influence on runoff characteristic values in turn the density of sinkhole is the most influential factor among the hydrogeological factors geological structure factors had both direct and indirect effects on runoff characteristics path coefficient is 0 27 among them the density of faults is the most influential factor geochemical factors affected runoff characteristics more by influencing hydrogeological factors path coefficient 0 51 or geological structure factors path coefficient 0 43 in conclusion data from several watersheds directly confirm that in karst watersheds these geological factors such as hydrogeology geochemistry and geological structure have a very fundamental influence on karst watershed runoff characteristics our results can help us further understand karst hydrological processes and improve the accuracy of karst hydrological modeling keywords geological factors runoff characteristics linear mixed effect model structural equation model karst data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction runoffs are typically described by a series of runoff characteristics including the runoff coefficient rc and coefficient of variation cv among others runoff characteristics are mainly affected by climate factors and watershed characteristics including watershed form soil vegetation topography and geology merz bloschl 2009 zhang et al 2014 you et al 2021 zheng et al 2018 among these geological factors have a very important impact on runoff characteristics this is because geological factors directly and indirectly affect the characteristic value of runoff by influencing the soil vegetation topography and other factors hou et al 2020 mcguire et al 2005 sang et al 2022 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 therefore studying the influence of watershed characteristics on runoff characteristics is crucial in exploring the law of hydrological phenomena and water resources management the geological factors that affect the characteristics of runoff usually include lithology and geological structures the differences in lithology affect the characteristics of groundwater storage and infiltration and thus affect the characteristic value of runoff hattanji and onda 2004 christensen et al 2020 among various geological structural factors strike dip direction and dip angle affect the runoff characteristics mainly by regulating the infiltration and confluence processes bogaart troch 2006 huang et al 2013 inaoka et al 2020 in addition folds and faults also have significant effects on groundwater processes and thus on runoff sibson 1981 howald et al 2015 krainer et al 2021 compared with non karst catchments karst catchments have obvious differences in geological conditions these differences are mainly manifested in two aspects on the one hand karst watersheds are mainly composed of dissolvable carbonate rocks and the bedrock is usually dissolved by running water to form a system of vertical downward pipes and underground rivers through which running water flows into underground rivers jukić and denić jukić 2015 martin et al 2016 peng et al 2022 zhou et al 2022 this feature makes the process of rock water storage and confluence in karst catchments significantly different from that in non karst catchments merz et al 2011 tarasova et al 2018 mo et al 2021 krainer et al 2021 yan et al 2022 zhong et al 2022 on the other hand the bedrock in some karst catchments is formed by the alternate superposition of carbonate and noncarbonate strata known as interbedded in geology and the water flows both in the form of pipe flow and lateral flow which complicates the influence of occurrence fold and other structural factors on the runoff characteristics chen et al 2011 wang et al 2019 li et al 2023 in addition because of differences in lithology and hydrogeological conditions karst catchments usually show thin soil layers discontinuous soil and poor vegetation growth compared with non karst areas zhang et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 and these factors affect runoff characteristics therefore the influence of geological factors on runoff characteristics in karst watersheds may be different from that in non karst watersheds several studies have been conducted to analyze the influence of individual geological factors on runoff characteristics in karst catchments hou and gao 2019 huang niemann 2008 jiang et al 2014 wen et al 2019 for example li et al 2011 showed that the existence of rock cracks is crucial to promoting the permeability of limestone karst landforms and that the rc decreases with the increasing number of cracks meanwhile zhang et al 2014 showed that the rc decreased as the proportion of the carbonate area increased however although the above research helps us understand the influence of single factors on runoff characteristics geological factors are inherently complex and single factors such as the degree of fracture development and the proportion of carbonate area cannot fully explain the influence of geological factors on runoff characteristics given the limitations of individual geologic factors several studies have also analyzed the effects of multiple geologic factors on runoff characteristics for example liu et al 2020 analyzed the effects of karst area limestone area and dolomite area on runoff characteristics zhang et al 2014 analyzed the effect of different rock type combinations on runoff characteristics however most studies analyzed a few geological factors and did not quantitatively assess the effects of multiple geological factors on runoff characteristics in fact geological structures hydrogeology and other factors may have significant effects on hydrological characteristics and there may be complex interactions among these factors without considering as many geological factors as possible it is difficult to explain clearly the complex quantitative relationships of the influence of geological factors on runoff characteristics especially in such a complex natural environment as karst this can make it difficult to perform accurate hydrologic modeling and hydrologic process analysis this study aims to evaluate the quantitative relationships between multiple geological factors and runoff characteristics in karst catchments and to analyze how these geological factors interact with each other to influence runoff characteristics in this study 30 catchments in karst areas of southwest china were selected as representative catchments first geological factors were selected from the three aspects of geochemistry geological structure and hydrogeology and nongeological factors were selected from the four aspects of land use soil topography and climate four representative runoff characteristics runoff coefficient rc runoff modulus rm annual runoff extremes ratio rep and coefficient of variation of runoff cv were selected on this basis the linear mixed effect model was used to quantitatively evaluate the contribution rate of each factor to the characteristic value of runoff and the relationship between each factor and its influence on the characteristic of runoff were analyzed using a structural equation model 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in southwest china s guizhou province 24 37 to 29 13 n 103 36 to 109 35 e fig 1 the terrain slopes from the west to the north east and south with an elevation between 137 and 2900 6 m the study area is one of the most representative areas in the world with extensive distribution of carbonate rocks and complex and diverse karst landforms the catchments selected in this study are mostly mountainous rivers with large slopes rapid water flow strong undercutting erosion and exposed bedrock in the valley floor river landforms are mainly distributed in v shaped valleys canyons and wide valleys and rivers usually develop along geological structures the study area has a typical subtropical wet monsoon climate with an average annual temperature of 16 1 c and an average annual precipitation of 1137 8 mm most of which is concentrated between may and october a total of 30 watersheds were selected for analysis in this study and the catchment area of each watershed ranged from 275 to 5531 km2 with an average area of 1606 km2 fig 1 table s1 2 2 selection of influencing factors as shown in table 1 this study selected a total of 20 indicators of seven types of factors affecting runoff characteristics among them land use topographic factors soil physical and chemical properties and climate factors have been confirmed by existing relevant studies to have a greater impact on runoff characteristic values in karst watersheds li et al 2020 liu et al 2018 saroli et al 2022 sweeting 1977 on this basis this study adds three kinds of geological factors geochemistry hydrogeology and geological structure the scientific implications of these geological indicators are illustrated in table 2 2 3 data source and processing 2 3 1 runoff characteristic data according to the statistical data of hydrological characteristics in guizhou province over the years compiled by guizhou hydrological station 1984 we directly obtained the annual runoff of 30 hydrological stations from 1964 to 1978 and the catchment area data of the watershed controlled by the hydrological stations notably after the 1980 s the study area experienced large scale vegetation destruction and has led to widespread karst rocky desertification after 2000 due to the large scale ecological restoration projects implemented in china the study area experienced large scale vegetation restoration zhang et al 2016 guo et al 2023 the destruction and restoration of vegetation during this period made the relationship between rainfall and runoff unstable therefore an earlier period of hydrological data was selected in this study in addition although there are more than 100 hydrological stations in the statistical data of hydrological characteristics in guizhou province most of the stations are actually new stations with only a few years of data therefore we only selected 30 watersheds with a long observation period rc for each hydrological station was also available directly from this document rc rm rep and cv were calculated using the following formula 1 rc r d p where rc is the runoff coefficient rd is the runoff depth mm and p is the precipitation mm 2 m q a where m is the rm l s km2 q is the annual discharge l s and a is the catchment area km2 3 rep q max q min where q max is the maximum annual flow l s and q min is the minimum annual flow l s during the study period 4 cv i 1 n k i 1 2 n 1 where n is the number of years during the study period ki is the annual runoff variation in year i that is the ratio of runoff in year i to average runoff during the study period ki greater than 1 indicates that the runoff in year i is greater than the average ki 1 denotes the opposite 2 3 2 geochemical data the data for the three geochemical indicators cao mgo and sio2 selected in this study were obtained from the regional geochemistry national reconnaissance program rgnr in china the rgnr takes samples of stream sediment and these samples are mixtures of upstream soils and have elemental concentration values near the average xie et al 2009 the sampling density was 1 2 samples km2 and samples within grids of 2 2 km2 were mixed for analysis a total of 233 810 samples were sampled throughout guizhou province with an average sampling density of 1 22 samples km2 this program was conducted under the regulation of specification for regional geochemistry exploration dz t0167 2006 to ensure data quality the collected samples in the study area were from 1978 to 1998 before the economic boom in china in recent decades as these were more suitable for the study of soil background because they contain less information from human pollution xia et al 2022 a geochemical atlas has been published on the basis of this dataset feng 2008 the data used in this study were obtained by digitizing these maps 2 3 3 hydrogeological data spring density data and sinkhole density were obtained from the 1 200 000 hydrogeological map provided by the geoscientific data discovery publishing system mu et al 2021 the 1 200 000 hydrogeological map contained information about the spatial location of springs and sinkholes by calculating the number of springs and sinkholes in each catchment per catchment area we get the density of springs and sinkholes the density and depth of the depressions were obtained by topographic analysis using aster gdem data with 30 m spatial resolution using the hydrologic analysis module in arcmap10 7 the digital elevation model dem was analyzed using a 3 3 grid resolution then the difference between the elevation value of the same grid that has not been filled in and the elevation value that has been filled in was calculated the grid whose difference value was not 0 was the depression the difference was the depression depth finally the density of the depression can be obtained by calculating the ratio of the total area of all depressions to the area of the catchment 2 3 4 geological structure data geological structure data were obtained from the 1 200 000 geological map provided by the geoscientific data discovery publishing system li et al 2019 the 1 200 000 geological map contained fault information li et al 2019 fig s1 in the supporting information the fault density was obtained by calculating the proportion of faults in each watershed the dip angle was marked on the 1 200 000 geological map and the average dip angle of all the points marked in each watershed was obtained using point by point statistics on the basis of the river information contained in the 1 200 000 geological map we judged the dominant flow direction of the river and the dominant trend of the strata to obtain the angle between the flow direction of the river and the trend of the strata carbonate and clastic interbedding data were obtained from the 1 2 5 million national geological map from the geological sciences data press https geodb cgs gov cn ye et al 2017 2 3 5 other data land use data were from the data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences https www resdc cn the spatial resolution of the data was 30 m the time range of runoff characteristic data used in this study was 1964 1978 whereas the land use data used in this study were from 1980 the two data did not match in time the reason why earlier land use data were not used in this study was that the remote sensing satellite technology was not developed before the 1980 s thus it was difficult to obtain land use data with high accuracy however before 1980 china s social and economic development was very slow during which the land use change was not obvious so the data from 1980 can also represent the situation from 1964 to 1978 elevation data were obtained directly from aster gdem with a 30 m resolution slope and topographic relief were calculated using dem data in the spatial analysis module of the arcmap10 7 software soil organic carbon content and soil gravel content were obtained from the basic attribute dataset of china s high resolution national soil information grid with a spatial resolution of 90 m liu et al 2021 the data were downloaded from the national earth system science data center soil sub center https soil geodata cn monthly mean temperature and rainfall data with a 1 km resolution for the whole study area from 1964 to 1978 were obtained from the national tibetan plateau data center peng et al 2019 on this basis the annual mean rainfall and temperature data of 30 catchments were extracted 2 4 methods 2 4 1 partial least squares regression in this study partial least squares regression plsr was used to verify whether there were indicators affecting runoff characteristics among the selected indicators carrascal et al 2009 onderka et al 2012 shi et al 2014 this is the premise for constructing the linear mixed effect model and structural equation model detailed information on plsr modeling can be found in previous studies abdi 2010 li et al 2017 the model were cross validated to avoid overfitting and the root mean square error rmsecv of the cross validation provided additional information about the plsr model calibration and development to determine the appropriate number of fits required for the model components to achieve the best balance between the interpreted response variation r 2 and the goodness of model prediction q 2 q2 and resecvs were calculated using the following formulas 5 q 2 1 0 p r e s s s s 6 r m s e c v p r e s s n where press is the prediction error sum of squares ss is the sum squared residual and n is the number of samples in this study n is the number of selected watersheds to avoid overfitting the models were cross validated the root mean square error of cross validation rmsecv provides additional information about the calibration and development of the plsr model to determine the appropriate number of fits to the model components needed to obtain the best balance between the explained response variation r 2 and the model predictive superiority q 2 when r 2 and q 2 are greater than 0 5 the plsr model provides good prediction effect and good prediction ability respectively and is also the standard for measuring the relationship between the selected driving indicators and runoff characteristics trap et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 in this study simca 14 1 software was used to run plsr 2 4 2 linear mixed effects model in the linear mixed effects model lmem constructed using various natural factors variance partitioning analysis vpa is used to quantify the contribution of various natural factors especially geochemistry geological structure and hydrogeological factors to the characteristic value of runoffs in this study after vpa is applied to all geological factors the contribution rates of specific individual geological factors and their interactions with runoff characteristics can be obtained the contribution rates of factors v2 were calculated using the following formulas 7 v 2 σ 2 i 1 k p i μ i μ 2 σ 2 k 1 i 1 where k is the number of watersheds i is the number of factors pi ni n ni is the number of observations of factors i n is the total number of observations μi is the mean of factors i μ is the mean of the overall and σ2 is the error variance of the factors genizi 1993 the linmod and lmer functions in the relaimpo package grömping 2007 were used to build the lmem in the r language environment the varpart function of the vegan package was used for vpa analysis and the origin2020 software was used to visualize the results 2 4 3 partial least squares structural equation model in this study the partial least squares structural equation model pls sem was used to quantify the influence of natural factors on runoff characteristics and the relationships among these factors pls sem is structured to provide causal explanations hair et al 2017 venturini mehmetoglu 2019 wold 1982 hair et al 2019 sarstedt et al 2017 six indexes are used to measure the fitness of the ple sem model among them the first goodness of fit gof and second r 2 indicators measure the relationship between latent variables whereas the other four indicators measure the relationship between observed variables the third is the comparative fit index cfi the fourth is the goodness of fit index gfi the fifth is the root mean square error of approximation rmsea the sixth index is the model degree of freedom df hair et al 2019 a typical pls sem model consists of two parts the structural model and the measurement model the structural model shows the relationship between latent variables natural factors and the corresponding path coefficient is used to mark the relationship between latent variables meanwhile the measurement model provides the relationship between the underlying variables and the observations they define in this study pls sem model was designed using the lavaan package rosseel 2014 in r studio 4 2 1 and the plspm function in the cran package the sempaths function in the semplot package was used to visualize the running results of the model 3 results 3 1 general situation of runoff characteristics the 30 catchments selected in this study were all located in the same province and the runoff characteristics showed great differences among different catchments fig 2 and table s2 for example the maximum rep was almost 10 times the minimum value the maximum cv was almost 4 5 times the minimum value and the average coefficient of variation was 31 4 the maximum rm was 4 3 times the minimum and the average was 21 0 l s km2 the maximum rc was about 1 8 times the minimum and the average rc was 0 562 in contrast the rainfall and temperature varied much less across catchments in each catchment the maximum annual precipitation was 2 3 times the minimum value and the maximum annual temperature was 2 6 times the minimum value this indicates that watershed characteristic factors including geological factors play an important role in regulating runoff characteristics 3 2 prediction ability of indicators to runoff characteristics fig 3 shows that in plsr when the first prediction fits all the driving factors can meet the measurement criteria to explain the runoff characteristics r 2 0 5 however its prediction goodness q 2 does not exceed 0 5 in the second and third fittings r 2 in the four figures all increased and their q 2 was greater than 0 5 meanwhile the rmsecv of the cross validation was the smallest however the continued increase in fitting times did not improve the variance of interpretation fig 3 the results show that the plsr provides a good prediction effect and good prediction ability for the third fitting which indicates that driving factors affect the runoff characteristics in the selected natural factors 3 3 contribution rate of natural factors to runoff characteristics the contribution rate of natural factors to runoff characteristics reached more than 70 whereas the contribution rate of geological factors to runoff characteristics ranged from 27 to 56 fig 4 however the contribution rate of selected natural factors to runoff characteristics in the study area was very different hydrogeological topographic and geochemical factors contributed more to runoff characteristics with hydrogeological factors having the most obvious influence however the contribution rate of geological structures climate factors soil properties and land use was small the contribution rate of soil properties to rep and cv was only 3 among the geological factors the contribution rate of rc rep and cv ranged from 15 to 30 whereas the contribution rate of hydrogeological factors to rm was less 11 as regards the geochemical hydrogeological and geological structural factors the contribution rate of each indicator to the runoff characteristics was also different first among the indicators of geochemical factors cao and sio2 contents had greater contributions to runoff characteristics whereas mgo content had the least contribution from the perspective of different runoff characteristics except for the small difference in rep affected by each indicator the degree of influence of each indicator of geochemical factors on the other three runoff characteristics varied greatly fig 5 a second among the hydrogeological factors the sinkhole density the depth of depressions and the spring density had greater contributions to the runoff characteristics whereas the depression density had the least contribution the contribution rates of the hydrogeological factors to rm were significantly different the contribution rates of sinkhole density and depression depth were 46 and 35 respectively whereas the contribution rates of spring density and depression density were only 9 fig 5c third the contribution rate of each indicator to the characteristic value of different runoff varied greatly among the geological structure factors the contribution rate of fault density to rc and rm was larger that of the dip angle to cv was larger and that of the fault density and dip angle to rep was larger rc and rm were mainly affected by fault density fig 5b 3 4 influence of geological factors on runoff characteristics although lmem can obtain the contribution rate of each natural factor to the runoff characteristics it cannot explain the interaction of each natural factor and its influence on the runoff characteristics in this study pls sem was used to further illustrate this problem fig 6 shows that pls sem can explain the interaction of the selected potential variables and the influence of the variables themselves on the runoff characteristics gof 0 67 r 2 0 88 fig 6 shows that the path coefficients of hydrogeological factors on runoff characteristics are relatively large 0 60 whereas the path coefficients of the geochemical geological structure and topographic factors on hydrological characteristic values were relatively small 0 34 0 27 and 0 41 respectively meanwhile the path coefficients of soil land use and climate were smaller geochemical factors affected hydrogeological factors both directly path coefficient is 0 51 and indirectly by influencing geological structure factors path coefficient is 0 43 the geochemical factors were themselves influenced by climatic factors path coefficient is 0 39 however geological structure factors indirectly affected runoff characteristics mainly by influencing hydrogeological factors path coefficient is 0 57 in addition to the direct influence on runoff characteristics hydrogeological factors also exerted an indirect influence by influencing topographic factors path coefficient is 0 38 fig 7 a shows that the fault density depression depth sinkhole density and mgo content had a large path coefficient on rc the path coefficient of the depression depth to rc was the largest 0 33 in addition the fault density and depression depth had negative effects on rc whereas the sinkhole density and mgo content had positive effects on rc in terms of rm the path coefficients of cao mgo and sio2 contents on rm were relatively large at 0 48 0 68 and 0 35 respectively fig 7b the indicators with large path coefficients for rep and cv were similar and the path coefficients 0 44 to 0 7 for the cao content sinkhole density mgo content and fault density were all large fig 7c and fig 7d cao content and sinkhole density had positive effects on both whereas mgo content and fault density had negative effects on both however the path coefficients of the two indicators were relatively small 0 16 4 discussion 4 1 influence mechanism of geological factors on runoff characteristics this study shows that geological factors are important factors affecting the hydrological characteristics of karst watersheds hydrogeological factors have a direct and important influence on runoff characteristics although the direct influence of geochemical and geological structure factors was slightly small they also indirectly affected the characteristic value of runoff through hydrogeological factors fig 6 and fig 7 among the hydrogeological factors in this study the sinkhole density greatly influenced the runoff characteristics the sinkhole density represented the degree of groundwater system development in karst catchments adams et al 2016 the greater the sinkhole density the more intense the development of groundwater channels such as dissolution fissures karst caves and underground rivers jukić and denić jukić 2015 martin et al 2016 thus forming hydrogeological environments of above ground and subsurface dual structure unique to karst environments liang yang 1995 the strong development of groundwater channels results in rapid infiltration of surface water and less water loss through evaporation transpiration and other forms resulting in higher rc zhang et al 2014 huang and niemann 2008 some studies have found that surface runoff discharge and velocity in karst areas decrease with the increase in drainage capacity which depends on the size and shape of sinkholes fischer et al 2022 mo et al 2019 these studies also further confirmed that sinkhole density has an obvious effect on runoff characteristics like sinkholes depressions are also common negative terrains in karst areas but this study shows that the depression depth has a negative path coefficient for rc fig 7a karst depressions are mainly composed of clay because of the low water conductivity and high water retention capacity of clay it is not conducive to water infiltration xu et al 2020 fig s2 thus more water is consumed in evapotranspiration and the rc decreases fig 8 the influence of geochemical factors on runoff characteristics is mainly realized indirectly as they influence hydrogeological factors or geological structure factors fig 6 the influence on hydrogeological factors is reflected in that the calcium and magnesium contents characterize rock solubility calcium usually exists in nature in the form of calcium carbonate the higher the amount of calcium carbonate in a rock the more easily it is dissolved by water ford williams 2007 in addition the solubility of bedrock affects hydrogeological indexes such as the sinkhole density the depression density and the depression depth xiao et al 2016 gökkaya et al 2021 which in turn affect the characteristic value of runoff the influence of geochemical factors on geological structures is reflected in that the calcium magnesium and silica contents in rocks affect the interbedding ratio between carbonate rocks and clastic rocks rauch white 1970 stephenson pryor 1979 pure carbonate rocks contain a higher proportion of calcium and magnesium for karst environments a high silica content usually represents an interbedded structure of carbonate and clastic rocks wang et al 2004 the clastic rocks sandwiched in carbonate rocks in karst environments are looser than carbonate rocks formed by chemical deposition due to the recementation of particles thus they are more prone to plastic deformation under tectonic stress and less prone to fracture resulting in lower fault density novak egenhoff 2019 in fig 7 the path coefficient between the interbedded ratio of carbonate and clastic rocks and the fault density is negative which proves the negative correlation between the two meanwhile clastic rocks are not dissolved by water and are thus good medium for water storage and can effectively prevent the rapid infiltration of water the above indicates that geochemical factors affect runoff characteristics by affecting the fault density rock water resistance and water storage capacity the direct influence of geological structure factors is reflected in the formation of faults by tectonic stresses which are accompanied by extensive rock fissures rock fissures and faults depending on their molecular and capillary forces form good storage spaces chang makkeasorn 2010 rock strata with developed fractures have high water storage capacities jones graham 1993 peng et al 2019 and conducive to extending the response time of rainfall to runoff reducing the peak water level in the wet season and increasing the water level in the dry season chen et al 2022 krainer et al 2021 therefore fault density has an obvious negative path coefficient for rc trp and cv fig 7 a series of studies on the water storage capacity of weathered rocks in the vadose zone in recent years have also confirmed that cracks in rocks are important water storage spaces gabrielli and mcdonnell 2018 hale and mcdonnell 2016 illien et al 2021 for areas with shallow soil layers such as karst mountains water storage spaces formed by rock fractures are more important liu et al 2021 geological structure factors also had an indirect influence on runoff characteristics because water infiltration and dissolution usually preferentially occur in rock cracks estrada medina et al 2013 larger cracks are preferentially dissolved thus forming channels that allow the easy flow of water to groundwater such as sinkholes ozdemir 2015 soriano et al 1994 this is also proven by the positive path coefficient between the fault density and sinkhole density in fig 7 however this contradicts the idea that higher fault densities slow down water infiltration rates as we mentioned earlier therefore the relationship between geological structure factors especially fault and runoff characteristics is complex which may also be closely related to the degree of rock fissure opening 4 2 uncertainty the structural equation model can identify the degree of the mutual influence of each factor and the degree of influence on runoff characteristics however it is not possible to give a more detailed functional relationship between the factors and the runoff characteristic values such as the changes in the runoff characteristics corresponding to different strata dip angles this more detailed functional relationship is usually analyzed through controlled experiments however the spatial heterogeneity of environmental factors in karst catchments is great ford williams 2007 veress 2020 resulting in the failure to collect representative samples for indoor control experiments moreover karst hydrological critical zones are extremely deep yuan 2015 making it difficult to conduct control experiments in such a deep range fig 4 shows that there are still 14 28 runoff characteristics that are not explained by the factors considered in this study the main reason is that so many factors affect runoff characteristics in different catchments that including all of them is difficult in addition data availability is also an important reason why we did not consider all factors for example the thickness of the epikarst zone and soil directly affect water storage conditions however these factors were not considered due to the unavailability of high precision data in addition although some indicators were considered there were still some uncertainties in the data accuracy for example the fault density data came from a 1 200 000 geological map the fault information was determined mainly through a manual field survey combined with aerial photographs this can lead to more faults in areas that investigators focus on but not for some areas with fewer faults however because the geological survey process of the 1 200 000 geological map is very detailed it is one of the most commonly used geological data in china therefore we still believe that these maps can reflect the characteristics of overall geological elements such as faults sinkholes and springs in general uncertainty can be reduced in three ways selecting more representative watersheds introducing more key indicators and improving the precision of data are directions to reduce the uncertainty of results first more representative watersheds should be selected if possible the study can be extended to the whole karst region of southwest china so that more watersheds can be selected second more key indicators are taken into account such as surface karst zones and soil thickness in addition the basic data can be validated by supplementing field surveys or the accuracy of the data can be improved by remote sensing surveys 4 3 main findings and possible applications the results of this study show that geochemical geological structure and hydrogeological factors contribute greatly to runoff characteristic values in karst areas in addition to climate topography soil land use and other factors fig 4 the differences in geochemistry geological structure and hydrogeology between karst and non karst areas are the essential differences between karst and non karst catchments hydrogeological factors such as the sinkhole density and depression depth are not considered in the study of the influence of geological factors on runoff in non karst areas because there is almost no carbonate karst dissolution in non karst areas merz and blöschl 2009 you et al 2021 zheng et al 2018 however the influence of geochemical factors such as calcium and magnesium contents on hydrological characteristics can be almost negligible because of the relatively small proportion of non karst areas this study comprehensively analyzed the influence of geological factors on hydrological characteristics and considered the interaction of these factors however previous studies on karst catchments did not consider geological factors or only analyzed the influence of one or two geological factors on runoff characteristic values krainer et al 2021 liu et al 2020 mo et al 2021 the results of this study can help us further understand the influence of geological elements on the runoff formation process and runoff characteristic values in karst watersheds however hydrological modeling in karst catchments has always been a great challenge hartmann et al 2014 jeannin et al 2021 primarily because we still do not have a clear understanding of the influencing factors and mechanisms of karst hydrological processes the factors identified in this study that have an important impact on the characteristic value of runoff can be used in the hydrological modeling of karst watersheds and the interaction between these factors that we recognized can also be included in hydrological modeling this can not only improve the precision of hydrological simulations but also simulate the hydrological processes of karst catchments in more detail 5 conclusion geochemical hydrogeological and geological structure factors all have key influences on runoff characteristics among which hydrogeological factors had the greatest influence each geological factor not only directly affected the runoff characteristics but also indirectly affected runoff characteristic values by influencing other geological factors among them geochemical factors affected runoff characteristics mainly by influencing hydrogeological factors or geological structures then hydrogeological factors and finally runoff characteristics among the studied hydrogeological factors the sinkhole density had a great influence on runoff characteristics whereas the depression depth had a negative influence on rc meanwhile geological structure factors had both direct and indirect effects on runoff characteristics fault density was an indicator of geological structure factors with obvious influence but the influence of this indicator on runoff characteristics was complex and there were positive or negative influences the results of this study help us understand karst hydrological processes more deeply and improve the accuracy of karst hydrological simulation results and the details of such processes declaration of competing interest the authors

1768,quantifying how land use and land cover change lulcc drives extreme events is a priority to inform adaptation planning in a changing environment previous studies mainly focus on the effects of local lulcc on runoff generation processes however few on the effects of the climate feedbacks of lulcc here we couple the variable infiltration capacity model with climate forcing from the land use model intercomparison project part of the new state of the art coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 to synthetically detect global lulcc induced impacts on hydrological extremes in one of the fastest developing areas in china and the world i e the yangtze river delta yrd results suggest that global lulcc increased extreme rainfall by 1 41 3 90 with spatial heterogeneity over yrd especially during the rapid urbanization period regions with increasing extreme rainfall during the rapid urbanization stage match well with the city belt distribution indicating the precipitation enhancement effects of the urban land surface the combined impacts with both lulcc and its climate feedbacks lead to a 3 01 7 18 increase in extreme runoff much higher than the effects of lulcc only 0 05 0 14 the consistent signs of changes in extreme rainfall and runoff indicate the dominant role of lulcc induced climate feedback in the changes in extreme runoff over the yrd region in addition flash droughts increased when considering the climate feedbacks of global lulcc particularly during the rapid urbanization stage lulcc tends to increase average flows high flows and low flows particularly in an urban dominated basin when considering the climate feedback effects from global lulcc the lulcc would lead to a larger increase in high flows and average flows thus floods we highlight a need to consider land atmosphere interactions in addition to land surface processes in projecting changes in hydrological extremes keywords hydrological extremes flash droughts lulcc climate feedbacks the yangtze river delta region data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction extreme hydrological events caused by abnormal weather conditions often lead to sudden losses of lives and properties unfortunately these events have been observed to occur more frequently both regionally and globally with growing damage in a changing environment chou et al 2013 yin et al 2018 land use and land cover change lulcc such as urbanization forest management and agricultural practices have been proven to have a remarkable influence on hydrological cycles through their effects on runoff generation and routing characteristics and thus alter these extreme events associated with floods and droughts rogger et al 2017 wang et al 2020 zhou et al 2013 therefore investigating the role of lulcc in modifying floods and droughts is a vital topic in hydrological research which could provide a scientific basis for understanding flood control disaster reduction and drought adaptation under a changing environment in addition lulcc also impacts regional and global climate through land atmosphere interactions niyogi et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 for instance deforestation beyond a certain tipping point would heavily decrease energy and water released into the atmosphere and thus reduce convection and precipitation cai et al 2019 davidson et al 2012 urbanization one of the most important forms of lulcc under the current changing environment would also influence regional climate such as temperature and rainfall through changing surface roughness yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 changes in regional climate would further play a role in hydrological extremes such as rainfall winter et al 2020 yang et al 2019 floods wang et al 2020 yin et al 2018 and droughts omer et al 2020 as they are the most important input loveland and mahmood 2014 ukkola et al 2020 here we term the influence of local lulcc on the allocation role of the underlying surface for rainfall as a direct effect and the climate feedbacks of global lulcc as an indirect effect the relative importance of the two effects on extreme hydrological events is important for understanding flood control disaster reduction and drought adaptation under a changing environment which has never been evaluated in previous studies extreme rainfall is one of the principal drivers of floods recently changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events have been observed at regional and global scales chou et al 2013 these changes could have increased the risk of regional disasters such as flash floods and debris flows accordingly the variations and their driving factors from climate change of extreme rainfall have been heavily investigated in a changing environment however relative contributions of anthropogenic changes to extreme rainfall have rarely been investigated and are still fraught with difficulties recently lulcc induced impacts especially from urbanization have been found to affect the rainfall anomalies jiang et al 2020 yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 but their impacts on floods and droughts need to be better understood furthermore the magnitude frequency relationship of flood events might be influenced by climate change meißl et al 2017 and human activities zhou et al 2013 climate change influences the hydrological system by affecting the occurrence probabilities of critical conditions and the event precipitation characteristics garg and mishra 2019 while human activities impacts are mainly manifested by changing the underlying surface characteristics and thus the distribution of rainfall for instance increasing impervious surface caused by urban expansion is found to decrease infiltration and increase runoff wang et al 2018a wang et al 2018b drought which can be classified into meteorological hydrological and agricultural droughts is one of the most complex natural disasters wang et al 2018a wang et al 2018b there are several indices for monitoring and assessing droughts such as the standardized precipitation index spi palmer drought severity index pdsi standardized runoff index sri standardized soil moisture index ssi however these traditional drought indices consider the slowly evolving phenomenon caused by long term months or longer changes in hydrologic cycle elements such as precipitation evapotranspiration and soil moisture without including the case that extreme atmospheric anomalies persist only for a short duration days or weeks zhang et al 2017 recently flash drought proposed to describe the rapidly evolving droughts has been reported to be more frequent and widespread mo and lettenmaier 2015 2016 li et al 2020 yuan et al 2019 previous studies have investigated the variations of flash droughts however the contribution of anthropogenic activities is still difficult to quantify which is important to understand the mechanism of drought changes omer et al 2020 mechanisms behind the changes in extreme events including rainstorms floods and flash droughts still need to be clarified due to the complexities of the earth system zhou et al 2017 previous studies mainly focused on individual or combined effects of climate change and lulcc zhang et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 however few on the detection of lulcc induced climate change moreover it is common for impact assessments to be performed for separate conditions without accounting for the interactive influence between variations in land use and climate which potentially can be substantial wang et al 2020 this is especially important in regions experiencing rapid urbanization such as the yangtze river delta yrd region fig 1 one of the biggest urban agglomerations with the fastest developing speed in china and the world over the last century especially over the past 30 years the region has experienced rapid urbanization and has become one of china s most populous and prosperous regions the yrd region has experienced dynamic changes in land use especially for urban land fig 1d according to the temporal variation of urban land we find that there has a superposition of two s curves following two periods of rapid economic development processes the lulcc in the yrd has experienced three stages over the past 160 years i e an earlier urbanization period 1851 1900 a slow development period 1901 1980 and a rapid urbanization period 1981 2014 the impacts of land surface changes might have a profound effect on the atmosphere such as urban heat and rain island effects lu et al 2019 wang et al 2016 these effects will then affect regional hydrological extreme events but few studies have evaluated the interaction between lulcc and climate change and its impacts on hydrological extremes therefore in order to evaluate the interaction between lulcc and climate change and quantify the contribution of lulcc on extremes we here couple a land surface model lsm with climate change scenarios derived from earth system models esms or general circulation models gcms this takes advantage of the recently available land use model intercomparison project lumip part of the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 to detect the effects of land use on climate lawrence et al 2016 the lumip experiments were designed to quantify the global and regional effects of lulcc on climate and biogeochemical cycling past future by using model outputs from multi esms the impact assessments account for the relatively large uncertainties in projected climate change reshmidevi et al 2018 however due to the coarse resolution of esm outputs downscaling or bias correction methods should be used in regional studies to bridge the spatial resolution gaps between what esms can provide and what impact assessors require wilby et al 2002 besides matching the spatial resolutions consistency between land use data used in esms and lsm is also important for a reasonable assessment of hydrological impacts we here applied a spatial density function to downscale the coarse resolution historical land use datasets to keep the consistency between the driving land use data in esms and lsm in summary this paper aims to quantify the changes in hydrological extremes caused by lulcc using the coupled framework of the new state of the art cmip6 climate model experiments and lsm we focus on extreme rainfall floods and droughts over yrd here we divided the hydrological effects of lulcc into two parts i e the effects on climate variables such as rainfall from global lulcc and the effects on runoff yield processes from local lulcc the study includes three objectives 1 to quantify the effects of global lulcc on regional extreme rainfall 2 to synthetically evaluate the effects of lulcc and its climate feedbacks on floods and 3 to examine the effects of interaction between lulcc and climate change on flash droughts under different urbanization stages the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we introduce data and methods used in the paper followed by results and discussion in section 3 finally a summary and conclusions are presented in section 4 2 data and methods 2 1 datasets in situ meteorological observations are obtained from 112 weather stations see fig 1a for locations maintained by the national climate center china meteorological administration the observations include precipitation maximum and minimum temperature and mean wind speed at 2 m on a daily scale during the period 1975 2014 these observations are mainly used to provide meteorological forcing for hydrological simulations as well as serve as a ground truth reference in downscaling key meteorological variables from esms in lumip we obtain daily discharge observations during the period 2008 2018 for the qinhuai river basin and xitiaoxi river basin see fig 1 for locations the streamflow records are provided by the hydrological bureaus of jiangsu province and zhejiang province four widely used esms are used in this study the four models are the medium resolution beijing climate center climate system model version 2 bcc csm2 mr the community earth system model cesm2 version 2 the institut pierre simon laplace ipsl climate model ipsl cm6a lr version 6 and the u k earth system models ukesm1 0 ll previous studies show these models are capable of reproducing climate variables such as temperature precipitation wind speed etc boucher et al 2020 danabasoglu et al 2020 sellar et al 2019 wu et al 2019 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2016 these four models all participated in the lumip experiments of cmip6 thus the output climate variables from these esms were chosen to represent the modified climate conditions caused by global land use activities in the lumip experiments of each esm there have two specific experiments i e land hist and land nolu the land hist scenario represents the climate variables that are generated under the conditions of historical land cover land use and land management while the land nolu is the same as land hist except for no land use change lawrence et al 2016 the land model used in lumip captures a variety of ecological and hydrological sub grid characteristics and the land units are glacier lake urban vegetated and crop the urban land unit is divided into density classes representing the tall building district high density and medium density urban areas lawrence et al 2016 thus all these esms participate the lumip experiments e g bcc csm2 mr cesm2 ipsl cm6a lr and ukesm1 0 ll can be used to investigate the hydroclimate responses caused by global lulcc including urbanization hydrogeographic datasets used in this study are as follows historical land use and land cover datasets with a resolution of 0 25 during the period 1851 2014 are developed from the land use harmonization 2 project luh2 https luh umd edu the luh2 project aims to prepare a harmonized set of land use scenarios that smoothly connects historical reconstructions of land use with future projections in the format required for the earth system models hurtt et al 2020 land use and land cover data with a spatial resolution of 1 km during the period 1990 2015 i e with an interval of 5 years are provided by the resources and environmental sciences data center resdc chinese academy of sciences https www resdc cn the digital elevation model with a spatial resolution of 30 m is obtained from the aster gdem maintained by the computer network information center chinese academy of sciences https www gscloud cn soil properties including agrotype soil bulk density soil texture and so on with a spatial resolution of 1 km are obtained from the harmonized world soil database hwsd version 1 2 provided by food and agriculture organization https www fao org soils portal soil survey soil maps and databases harmonized world soil database v12 fischer et al 2008 2 2 methods in this study an integrated method with multi esms and a hydrological model was used to detect individual and combined impacts from changes in regional climate and runoff generation processes caused by lulcc on hydrological extremes the general methodological framework is illustrated in fig 2 we first bias correct and downscale key meteorological variables from the four earth system models the luh2 land use and land cover dataset with coarse resolution is also downscaled to a finer spatial scale consistent with the resdc land use dataset 1 km the downscaled climate forcing together with the fine scale land use and land cover dataset is used to drive a gridded hydrological model over the entire yrd region we then set up different scenarios to simulate hydrological extremes extreme rainfall extreme runoff and flash droughts during the period 1851 2014 and quantify the impacts of lulcc on their spatio temporal variabilities a bias correction of climate simulations for preserving the internal variability of each esm and keeping the comparability of different scenarios we apply the bias correction approach to minimize the differences of daily meteorological variables in mean and variability between in situ observations and earth system model simulations hawkins et al 2013 ho et al 2012 li et al 2020 the bias correction method is conducted under the relationship between gridded variables from esms and single site variables from observed stations variables the observation network is composed of 112 weather stations which are evenly distributed in the study region fig 1a the following equation is adopted for each individual meteorological station 1 s bc t o ref σ o r e f σ s r e f s raw t s ref where s bc t and s raw t denote bias corrected and raw variables of earth system model outputs i e historical and hist nolu of lumip experiments respectively σ o r e f and σ s r e f represent the standard deviation of observations and the daily model outputs during the reference period respectively o ref and s ref are the temporal mean values of observations and daily model outputs during the reference period respectively we conducted the bias correction method for the key meteorological variables including precipitation maximum and minimum temperature and wind speed of four earth system models to all weather stations the bias corrected variables are then interpolated to each grid using the thiessen polygon algorithm the thiessen polygon method is a commonly used methodology for computing the mean areal climate features for a catchment from gauge observations thiessen 1911 which is well suited to the uneven spatial distribution of the stations and widely applied in hydrological applications fiedler 2003 zhang et al 2017 the time series of observed meteorological data is divided into reference 1975 1994 and testing 1995 2014 periods respectively the absolute percent bias pbias calculated by the difference of observation and bias corrected variables divided by observation during testing periods is used to assess the performance of bias correction method then the entire time series 1975 2014 all available data are used in the processes subsequently we assess the performance of downscaled variables for each earth system model compared against in situ observations the bias corrected daily maximum and minimum temperatures are spatially consistent with observations figure not shown there are some differences between the changed and observed daily precipitation but they are quite consistent in magnitudes the same is true for 2 m wind speed overall the pbias for each earth system model is lower than 15 we thus apply the bias correction method to the entire period i e 1851 2014 for each of the four earth system models b downscaling of land use and land cover dataset the luh2 dataset is a standard format required by esms and provides an estimation of the fractional land use patterns annually at a resolution of 0 25 hurtt et al 2011 lawrence et al 2016 however due to the gap in scales between climate models and hydrological models the luh2 dataset also needs to be downscaled to a finer spatial scale for driving hydrological models here we apply a spatial downscaling method based on a density function of current actual land use patterns for luh2 datasets the land use data with a 1 km resolution for the year 2015 served as the current actual land use patterns we reclassified and unified the land use and land cover types of the resdc and luh2 datasets and got the following five types forest land grassland cropland urban land and water area these are the main land use and land cover types in the yangtze river delta in the study region urban land expansion is the main pattern of land use change spreading out from the center to the periphery moreover other land use cover such as forest and agricultural land also are beginning to change the most from the peripheral regions thus we assume that land use types spread out from the center of the grid to its periphery we assign a higher weight for center grid and then allocate land use and cover types from the center to the periphery according to the weight matrix fig 3 a for each luh2 grid t the relative density of each resdc cell j for each land use type i can be defined as 2 p i j k n i k 2 r 1 2 where p i j k is the density of cell j for land use type i and it is calculated as the fraction of total area of land use i over the window k the window k is a square centered at cell j r is the radius of the window k and 2 r 1 represents the width of square for the moving window here the grid 0 25 represents each unit of luh2 datasets and cell 1 km denotes each unit of resdc land use maps we apply the downscale method for obtaining fine scale land use and land cover map from luh2 for the years 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 we estimated the overall accuracy coefficient between the downscaled land use maps against the resdc land use maps which is calculated by summing the number of correctly classified values compared to resdc land use maps in downscaled land use maps and then divided by the total number of values the spatial distributions of each land use land cover type are very consistent and the values of overall accuracy exceed 0 70 indicating the good performance of the downscaling method fig 3b we thus apply the downscaling method to obtain reconstructed land use and land cover with a 1 km resolution during the entire period i e 1851 2014 c set up of hydrological simulations in this study we carry out hydrological simulations based on the variable infiltration capacity vic model liang et al 1994 vic is a physically based hydrologic model that solves full water and energy balances its characteristics mainly include representations of vegetation heterogeneity multiple soil layers with variable infiltration and non linear base flow which differ from other hydrological models shah and mishra 2020 for runoff generation processes vic model applies variable infiltration capacity curves to partition precipitation into runoff and infiltration for each cell the model has been successfully and widely adopted in previous studies for runoff simulations liston et al 1994 wang et al 2012 and drought monitoring mo and lettenmaier 2015 zhang et al 2017 vegetation parameters soil parameters and meteorological forcing including precipitation maximum and minimum temperature and wind speed are the main model inputs urban land is added as the vegetation class impervious area to the parameterization in the vic model hurkmans et al 2008 hurkmans et al 2009 by assigning such a vegetation class i e impervious area we can define specific settings of vegetation parameters for urban areas the specific soil properties are allocated according to hwsd datasets with a spatial resolution of 1 km and thus we could also consider spatial heterogeneity of soil types over urban area cropland mainly consists of paddy fields in the yrd area and it is handled according to the different land cover parameters here we only focus on the effects of changes in land use and cover types not on land management and irrigation thus the paddy fields are handled as irrigated crops with land cover parameters and runoff is generated according to variable infiltration capacity curves vic is conducted for the entire yrd region to simulate land surface hydrological processes and then the routing model developed by lohmann et al 1996 lohmann et al 1998 is applied to generate and explore the streamflow responses in two representative watersheds i e qinhuai river basin and xitiaoxi river basin we developed vegetation and soil parameters based on the downscaled luh2 datasets and the harmonized world soil database fischer et al 2008 respectively the monthly leaf area index lai dataset with a resolution of 1 km during 2008 2018 is derived from copernicus global land service camacho et al 2013 the lai parameters for each land use and cover type are calculated according to the average mean of the lai datasets hydrological simulations based on the vic model are set up at a daily scale with a spatial resolution of 0 01 over the entire yrd region we manually calibrate and validate the model against streamflow observations at the qinhuai river basin and xitiaoxi river basin the qinhuai river basin is a typical urbanized basin over the yrd region with a drainage area of 2587 km2 while the xitiaoxi river basin with a drainage area of 1191 km2 is dominated by forest with very limited urban coverage 5 for the year of 2015 fig 1 soil parameters are obtained according to the spatial distribution of soil types from hwsd datasets several parameters including infilt variable infiltration curve parameter dsmax maximum velocity of baseflow ds fraction of dsmax where non linear baseflow begins and ws fraction of maximum soil moisture where non linear baseflow occurs are calibrated and validated at two representative basins i e the qinhuai river basin and xitiaoxi river basin and they are set consistent both in the calibrated watersheds and entire yrd region the coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and pbias are used to assess the goodness of fit of the simulations arnold et al 1998 nash and sutcliffe 1970 fig 4 shows comparisons between simulated and observed monthly streamflow over the two basins the values of r2 and nse for both the calibration period 2008 2012 and the validation period 2013 2018 exceed 0 80 with the pbias 15 indicating that the model well captures hydrological regimes over the yrd region moriasi et al 2007 we further evaluate the performance of the vic model in capturing extreme flows i e the annual maximum daily streamflow over the two basins the r2 values between the simulated and observed annual maximum daily flow for the two basins are 0 87 and 0 76 statistically significant p 0 001 figure not shown respectively we thus simulate hydrological extremes over the entire yrd region based on the calibrated vic model with downscaled climate forcings during the entire period d numerical experiments we set up three numerical experiments hydro experiments in this study see table 1 for details the historical and hist nolu represent climate forcings from two lumip experiments with and without considering the impacts of land use land cover change on climate respectively the ensemble mean of the four earth system models is used as the climate forcing the three numerical experiments hydro experiments are as follows ctrl represents the hydrological simulation scenario without changing land use and land cover and is driven by hist nolu climate forcing i e no climate feedbacks lu represents the hydrological simulation scenario considering the impacts of land use land cover change on hydrologic response but no climate feedbacks lu clm represents the scenario that considers both the impacts of land use land cover change and climate feedbacks on hydrologic response all three numerical experiments are carried out at a daily time step for the land use and cover setting we used the average land surface conditions to represent the land use cover condition of certain time periods as shown in fig 1d we can find that the lulcc in the yrd has experienced three stages over the past 160 years i e an earlier urbanization period 1851 1900 a slow development period 1901 1980 and a rapid urbanization period 1981 2014 land use and cover changes during each stage are relatively stable thus we used the average land use and cover conditions to drive the vic model in lu and lu clm simulations here we separated the hydrological effects of lulcc on hydrological extremes into two parts i e the effects on climate variables such as rainfall temperature and so on from global lulcc and the effects on runoff yield processes from local lulcc as shown in fig 2 the effects of lulcc on regional climate are estimated by lumip experiments historical hist nolu we determine the individual impacts of lulcc on hydrological extremes based on the factor separation analysis from three numerical experiments stein and alpert 1993 1 the effects on runoff yield processes from regional lulcc lu ctrl 2 the effects on climate variables such as rainfall temperature and so on from global lulcc lu clm lu and 3 both lu clm ctrl it should be noted that the effects of lulcc on climate variables are evaluated from a global scale due to the settings of lumip experiments that are driven by global land use and land cover datasets the effects of lulcc on runoff yield processes are estimated from regional perspectives due to hydrological processes always occurring at the watershed or regional scale we characterize extreme rainfall based on annual maximum daily precipitation p1day and floods based on annual maximum daily runoff r1day over each hydrological model grid flash droughts including heatwave flash droughts and precipitation deficit flash droughts are used to characterize the rapid drought characteristics mo and lettenmaier 2015 2016 pentads five day means during the growing season april to october are used to account for flash drought events 42 pentads per year the datasets cover the base period from 1851 to 2014 the spatial resolution is 0 01 we apply two cases for flash drought 1 heatwave flash drought t air anomaly 1 std et anomaly 0 and sm 40 2 precipitation deficit flash drought t air anomaly 1 std et anomaly 0 and p 40 t air et sm and p represent air temperature evapotranspiration soil moisture and precipitation respectively see also mo and lettenmaier 2015 2016 for details anomalies are defined as departures from the climatology during the base period std denotes the standard deviation of t air sm is expressed as percentile relative to the long term record of sm here the soil moisture for the first layer 0 10 cm depth is used while these indices including p1day r1day and flash droughts are evaluated at grid scale over the yrd region we additionally evaluate differences in flow duration curves fdc over the qinhuai river and xitiaoxi river basins to further shed light on contrasting hydrologic responses among different scenarios at the basin scale 3 results and discussion 3 1 extreme rainfall fig 5 shows the boxplots of p1day over the entire yrd region during three development stages as can be seen from the figure changes in land use land cover led to increases in p1day over all three development stages for instance the mean p1day is 88 59 mm during the period 1851 1900 in the hist nolu scenario while it is 89 84 mm in the historical scenario that considers the impact of land use land cover change on climate the relative increase for p1day associated with land use change is 1 41 3 9 and 2 16 during the three development stages respectively table 2 the relative increase in mean p1day is 2 76 during the entire period despite the overall increases in mean p1day averaged over the entire yrd region changes in mean p1day demonstrate considerable spatial differences fig 6 global lulcc increased p1day in most areas except for the southeastern part of the yrd region during 1851 2014 fig 6a we see increased p1day in western yrd during 1851 1900 and in most areas during 1901 1980 fig 6b 6c during the most rapid urbanization period i e 1981 2014 the spatial contrast of p1day changes induced by global lulcc is even sharp with positive anomalies observed in the northern and southeastern yrd and negative anomalies for the rest regions fig 6d the relative increase is the largest during the earlier urbanization period table 2 and this is possibly associated with the consistent increasing trend over the yrd during this period while the much more spatial difference during the other two stages fig 6 the areas with increasing extreme rainfall mainly occur in the urbanized and coastal regions while the southern mountainous areas with limited lulcc have an adverse rainfall change an interesting finding is that the region with positive p1day anomalies matches quite well with the spatial distribution of the city belt over the yrd region see fig 1a this echoes previous studies that detectable impacts of urbanization on extreme rainfall over the yrd region through land atmosphere interactions jiang et al 2020 yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 it should be noted that climate feedback defined in this study is associated with land use land cover change around the globe and cannot be simply tied to urbanization over the regional scale i e the yrd region this is because the lumip experiments are driven by global datasets thus the climate feedback in these experiments represents the effects of lulcc from a global perspective not only from the yrd region the effects of lulcc such as urbanization and deforestation on climate usually occur at the mesoscale and macroscale maidment 1993 thus it is necessary to examine the impact of land use change on climate from a larger scale previous studies show that the impacts of urbanization on extreme rainfall are most frequently observed either over the urban cores or the downwind regions i e approximately 20 50 km away from the urban center reported by liu and niyogi 2019 future studies need to design numerical experiments that specifically focus on land use land cover changes at regional scale such as the yrd region and their climate feedbacks this would help to further understand whether the climate feedback is attributed to local lulcc or the lulcc elsewhere however with respect to the land surface hydrological processes such as the runoff generation they occur mainly at a regional scale i e a watershed scale thus the following contents related to the effects of lulcc on runoff generation processes are conducted at the regional scale i e the yrd region 3 2 extreme runoff changes in runoff extremes are associated with both land use land cover changes e g deforestation and urbanization and climate feedbacks associated with them wang et al 2018a wang et al 2018b woltemade et al 2020 yang et al 2019 fig 7 shows the boxplots of r1day during three development stages over the yrd region for the three simulation scenarios compared to the ctrl scenario both lu and lu clm scenarios observe increases in median and mean r1day over the yrd region the increase is more evident in the lu clm experiment that considers both lulcc impacts and climate feedbacks we provide a quantitative evaluation of the impacts of lulcc and the impacts that combined both lulcc and climate feedbacks on extreme runoff with the statistics provided in table 3 the lulcc alone increases mean r1day by 0 05 0 14 across three different stages while the combined impacts with both lulcc and its climate feedbacks lead to a 3 01 7 18 increase in mean r1day the small increase in r1day over the yrd region induced by lulcc is due to the contradicting impacts of different types of land use land cover change on runoff generation the combined impacts on runoff increases are almost 33 times that of the lulcc impact alone during the rapid urbanization period this indicates that climate feedbacks associated with lulcc play a dominant role in increasing the probability of extreme runoff over the yrd region fig 8 shows the spatial difference in mean r1day between ctrl and lu clm scenarios over the yrd region during the entire period 1851 2014 lulcc increases r1day in almost the entire yrd region by about 4 mm and decreases r1day in the southwestern yrd fig 8a with respect to the first development stage 1851 1900 r1day increased in the western yrd region and decreased in the south fig 8b during the slow development period lulcc increases r1day over almost the entire yrd region fig 8c consistent with the spatial pattern of p1day increases fig 6d the combined effects of lulcc and its climate feedbacks lead to an increase of r1day in the southwestern and northern areas during the rapid urbanization period fig 8d we find that the spatial distribution of changes in extreme runoff is very consistent with that in p1day fig 6 and fig 8 the spatial regions with consistent signs of change i e both increases or decreases account for 90 of the yrd region this indicates that climate feedbacks induced by lulcc dominate changes in extreme runoff over the yrd region despite the significant urbanization trend in the past decades over the yrd region 3 3 flash droughts fig 9 shows the boxplots of flash drought frequency over the yrd region over different development stages with the statistics shown in table 3 flash droughts occur about 2 4 pentads per year over the yrd region the low frequency of drought is closely tied to the location of yrd in a humid climate region and its closeness to the pacific ocean the distributions of flash drought frequency are consistent under three experiments during 1851 1900 possibly due to the little lulcc in the earlier urbanization period fig 9a however we see more frequent flash drought in the lu clm experiment during the slow development and rapid urbanization periods than in the other two experiments fig 9b and 9c the frequency of flash drought is comparable between the ctrl and lu scenarios across all three development stages indicating that lulcc alone does not play a deterministic role in changing the regimes of flash drought over the yrd region the change rate in the frequency of flash drought induced by land use land cover change is 3 92 5 44 and 5 71 during the three stages respectively table 3 however the change rate induced by the combined effects that consider both lulcc and its climate feedbacks is 0 43 11 06 and 34 12 this is consistent with the changes in extreme runoff see section 3 2 which further emphasize the importance of climate feedbacks associated with lulcc in changing hydrological extremes over the yrd region we further show the spatial differences in the mean frequency of flash drought between the ctrl and lu clm scenarios over the yrd region fig 10 lulcc increased flash droughts slightly in most areas over the yrd during the entire period fig 10a we find more frequent flash droughts in the western yrd during 1851 1900 but a wider coverage during 1901 1980 fig 10b 10c with respect to the rapid urbanization period lulcc increases the frequency of flash droughts in almost the entire region of yrd with a relatively greater spatial difference fig 10d we show that lulcc changes flash drought frequency more significantly during the rapid urbanization stage i e 1981 2014 fig 11 shows the spatial distribution of changes in heatwave flash droughts and precipitation deficit flash droughts induced by lulcc during the rapid urbanization period both heatwave flash drought and precipitation deficit flash drought have been increased during 1981 2014 with the latter demonstrating a more pronounced increase than the former the heatwave flash droughts mainly increase in urban regions which can mainly attribute to the lulcc induced abnormally persistent high temperature in the growing season that would decrease surface evapotranspiration and the soil moisture content chen et al 2022 mazrooei et al 2021 in addition precipitation deficit flash drought spans across the entire yrd region and this is perhaps because the lulcc decreases the rainfall amount in consecutive rainless days and thus reduces the water supply of soil moisture both the heatwave and precipitation deficit conditions induced by the combined effects of lulcc and climate feedbacks affect flash droughts over the yrd region it should be note that these changes in flash droughts mainly reflect the impacts of lulcc and lulcc induced climate feedbacks not the changes in specific irrigation practices the results should be further verified in areas with different lulcc processes and the effects of lulcc associated irrigation also deserve further examined 3 4 flow duration curves we further evaluate contrasting hydrologic responses among three numerical experiments from the perspective of fdc over the qinhuai and xitiaoxi basins table 4 and fig 12 we examined the lulcc induced impacts on average flows high flows and low flows on the two typical basin scales high flows are represented by the flows below the frequency of 1 and 5 i e q1 and q5 respectively and low flows are represented by the flows above the frequency of 95 and 99 i e q95 and q99 respectively during the entire period the fdc over the two basins are basically identical however if we zoom into the high and low ends of the curves representing the conditions of high flows and low flows the differences are much clearer fig 12 we can find that average flows would increase by 9 15 and 5 61 in lu clm scenarios for qinhuai and xitiaoxi basins respectively while by 2 84 and 0 08 in lu scenarios table 4 this indicates that lulcc would have a larger impact on average flows when considering its impact from climate feedbacks both high flows and low flows are increased in the lu clm scenario for the qinhuai river basin compared to the ctrl and lu scenario the increased rates are 10 32 and 10 4 for high flows i e q1 and q5 respectively and 12 32 and 14 46 for low flows i e q95 and q99 respectively table 4 both high and low flows are increased in the lu scenario compared to the ctrl scenario but with relatively smaller magnitudes 1 48 and 1 66 for high flows and 4 84 and 5 72 for low flows respectively table 4 however the differences among the three experiments are quite small for the xitiaoxi basin this is due to limited land use land cover change over this forest dominated basin fig 13 when considering the climate feedback effects i e the lu clm scenario the change rate is 3 19 and 4 48 for high flows and 1 16 and 0 57 for low flows respectively compared to the ctrl scenario over this basin table 4 recent studies also found that the effects of climate change on floods are more significant than those of lulcc yang et al 2021 when encountering the extreme rainfall events the impacts of changes on floods in the land surface are limited due to the control role of maximum soil water storage capacity our results indicate that the combined effects of lulcc and climate feedbacks lead to a larger increase in high flows and thus floods compared with scenarios that only considering the effects on runoff yield processes from local lulcc moreover these lulcc induced effects are more significant in low flows than high flows and then average flows similarly the increase in high flows as observed in the qinhuai basin induced by lulcc is also reported in previous studies for instance bian et al 2017 found that urbanization has increased average annual runoff due to the expansion of impervious coverage gao et al 2020 projected that lulcc in 2028 would increase flood peak magnitudes by 4 7 to 8 1 in the qinhuai basin when urban land use increased by 30 to 60 however these studies did not consider the impacts of climate feedbacks induced by lulcc on hydrologic response 3 5 limitations and uncertainties previous studies have also investigated the impacts of lulcc on runoff generation processes or the climate feedbacks of lulcc however the understanding of the combined effects of lulcc on hydrological processes at both aspects is still unclear due to the difficulties in coupling the processes of land surface and atmospheric processes in this study we quantified the hydrological effects of lulcc from both the land surface and atmospheric processes using a coupled framework associated with hydrological models and lumip experiments from cmip6 our results shed light on the importance of considering land atmosphere interactions in addition to land surface processes in projecting changes in hydrological extremes lulcc tends to increase floods and flash droughts especially when considering the climate feedback effects from global lulcc the impact of lulcc on hydrological processes demonstrates itself not only through its direct influence on runoff generation mechanisms i e infiltration processes but also through its indirect impact on regional climate through land atmosphere interactions these results would facilitate better understanding of lulcc induced impacts on hydrologic extreme events and thus provide a scientific basis for better implementing flood control disaster reduction and drought adaptation in rapid developing region however there is a limitation that we could not separate the climate feedbacks induced by the lulcc within or outside of the study region because the lumip experiments are driven by global land use and cover datasets thus the climate modification represents the effects of lulcc from a global perspective not only in the yrd region regional climate models such as the weather research and forecasting wrf model coupled with hydrological models is encouraged to further detect the effects of lulcc on hydrological variables at a local or global scale moreover another limitation of this study is hydrological modeling using constant parameters in hydrological models including vic is a common practice in detecting hydrologic responses under different lulcc scenarios adjusting parameters such as the infiltration curve with different land surface scenarios is ideal in theory however it is difficult in practice due to model structure and limited observation datasets the constant parameters would generate systematic bias in the results however this might also influence the runoff generation processes and then affect the assessment of the responses of hydrological extremes under lulcc scenarios in addition cropland and urban land are considered as one land use type in vic it could not be divided within a cell into finer portions due to the limited datasets we did not consider changes in land management such as tillage practices specific irrigation practices and timing of crop planting the uncertainties inherent related to the combination of esms and hydrological models can be attributed to esms the downscaling methods as well as hydrological models as noted by many studies e g marchane et al 2017 minville et al 2008 wang et al 2020 in the present work multi esms are used and an ensemble of simulations was considered to reduce the uncertainties caused by different esms moreover the downscaling methods for climate simulations may also introduce uncertainties we compared the differences by using different downscaling methods i e bias correction approach and quantile delta mapping and the results show there is little difference between different methods figure not shown furthermore for keeping the trends of climate variables in different time periods we used bias correction methods in this study we evaluated the impact of lulcc on climate variables in different periods and the comparisons are conducted between different periods within a model rather than between different models therefore different downscaling methods have limited influence on the conclusion moreover spatial interpolation methods would also introduce uncertainties to the hydrological simulations we did not separately evaluate the performance of spatial data interpolation but rather the performance of hydrological modeling our results indicate that our model can simulate the hydrological processes well for long term streamflow and extreme flows we hypothesize that some sources of uncertainty such as input datasets spatial interpolation methods model parameters can be partially reduced by calibrating and evaluating the performance of hydrological model over the basin scale however it is worth trying to improve the accuracy of hydrological models using different spatial interpolation methods hwang et al 2012 kurtzman et al 2009 land use and cover datasets represent the land surface heterogeneity and influence the hydrologic processes in this study we reconstructed the land use and cover maps over the yangtze river delta region according to the luh2 dataset the luh2 historical land use datasets estimate the fractional land use patterns annually at 0 25 0 25 resolution we applied a spatial downscaling algorithm to bridge the gap between the luh2 dataset and its regional application in hydrological modeling our results indicate that the downscaled land use maps match well with the satellite based datasets both in spatial and statistical fig 3 overall accuracy higher than 0 7 however we still found that luh2 underestimated the fraction of urban land over the study areas fig 3 potentially affecting the examination of hydrological responses caused by past lulcc this may cause the underestimation of extremely high streamflow when considering the climate feedback associated with lulcc we provide a coupled framework to separate and quantify the hydrological effects of lulcc which come from changes in climate and runoff generation processes nevertheless there may be some differences in conclusions when applied in regions with different climate background or different lulcc processes and more comparative analysis is needed 4 summary and conclusions in this study we comprehensively evaluate the impacts of land use land cover change and its climate feedbacks on hydrological extremes over the yrd region during the period 1851 2014 the evaluation is based on distributed hydrological simulations with different land use land cover datasets and contrasting climate forcings from the lumip experiments the main conclusions are as follows 1 land use land cover change increased annual maximum daily rainfall p1day over the yrd region from 1851 to 2014 the relative increase for p1day associated with global lulcc ranges from 1 41 to 3 9 during the three development stages with an average value of 2 76 lulcc induced changes in p1day are spatially heterogeneous but with positive rainfall anomalies mainly distributed over the city belt consistent with previous studies that show the precipitation enhancement benefits of the yrd urban agglomerations 2 local lulcc increases mean r1day by 0 05 0 14 across three different stages while the combined impacts of local lulcc and its global climate feedbacks lead to an increase of 3 01 7 18 the combined impact is almost 33 times that of the lulcc impact alone this is due to the concurrent distribution of positive rainfall anomalies with impervious regions that altogether augment the probability of extreme runoff over the yrd region 3 the frequency of flash droughts is increased due to the combined effects of lulcc and climate feedbacks while local lulcc alone does not play an important role in changing the regimes of flash drought especially the impacts of lulcc and its climate feedbacks increased flash droughts by up to 34 12 during the rapid urbanization stage mainly attributed to its associated effects on heatwaves and extreme precipitation deficit events 4 lulcc tends to increase average flows high flows and low flows in particular the flows in the urban dominated basin the combined effects of lulcc and climate feedbacks lead to a larger increase in average and high flows and thus floods compared to the scenarios that only considering the effects on runoff yield processes from local lulcc our results highlight the importance of online hydrological simulations that consider land atmosphere interactions in addition to land surface processes in projecting changes in hydrological extremes the impact of land use land cover change on hydrological processes demonstrates itself not only through its direct influence on runoff generation mechanisms i e infiltration processes but also through its indirect impact on regional climate through land atmosphere interactions the indirect impacts are often ignored in offline hydrological simulations the modeling framework that couples hydrological and atmospheric components such as the weather research and forecasting model wrf hydrological modeling system skamarock et al 2005 should be applied to detect the synthetic effects of lulcc on hydrological extremes especially in the region with dramatic land use change i e urbanization afforestation deforestation etc although multi models are used in this study to decrease the uncertainty of the results more models should be considered to increase the robustness when detecting the responses of land atmosphere interactions credit authorship contribution statement qiang wang conceptualization methodology software writing

1768,quantifying how land use and land cover change lulcc drives extreme events is a priority to inform adaptation planning in a changing environment previous studies mainly focus on the effects of local lulcc on runoff generation processes however few on the effects of the climate feedbacks of lulcc here we couple the variable infiltration capacity model with climate forcing from the land use model intercomparison project part of the new state of the art coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 to synthetically detect global lulcc induced impacts on hydrological extremes in one of the fastest developing areas in china and the world i e the yangtze river delta yrd results suggest that global lulcc increased extreme rainfall by 1 41 3 90 with spatial heterogeneity over yrd especially during the rapid urbanization period regions with increasing extreme rainfall during the rapid urbanization stage match well with the city belt distribution indicating the precipitation enhancement effects of the urban land surface the combined impacts with both lulcc and its climate feedbacks lead to a 3 01 7 18 increase in extreme runoff much higher than the effects of lulcc only 0 05 0 14 the consistent signs of changes in extreme rainfall and runoff indicate the dominant role of lulcc induced climate feedback in the changes in extreme runoff over the yrd region in addition flash droughts increased when considering the climate feedbacks of global lulcc particularly during the rapid urbanization stage lulcc tends to increase average flows high flows and low flows particularly in an urban dominated basin when considering the climate feedback effects from global lulcc the lulcc would lead to a larger increase in high flows and average flows thus floods we highlight a need to consider land atmosphere interactions in addition to land surface processes in projecting changes in hydrological extremes keywords hydrological extremes flash droughts lulcc climate feedbacks the yangtze river delta region data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction extreme hydrological events caused by abnormal weather conditions often lead to sudden losses of lives and properties unfortunately these events have been observed to occur more frequently both regionally and globally with growing damage in a changing environment chou et al 2013 yin et al 2018 land use and land cover change lulcc such as urbanization forest management and agricultural practices have been proven to have a remarkable influence on hydrological cycles through their effects on runoff generation and routing characteristics and thus alter these extreme events associated with floods and droughts rogger et al 2017 wang et al 2020 zhou et al 2013 therefore investigating the role of lulcc in modifying floods and droughts is a vital topic in hydrological research which could provide a scientific basis for understanding flood control disaster reduction and drought adaptation under a changing environment in addition lulcc also impacts regional and global climate through land atmosphere interactions niyogi et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 for instance deforestation beyond a certain tipping point would heavily decrease energy and water released into the atmosphere and thus reduce convection and precipitation cai et al 2019 davidson et al 2012 urbanization one of the most important forms of lulcc under the current changing environment would also influence regional climate such as temperature and rainfall through changing surface roughness yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 changes in regional climate would further play a role in hydrological extremes such as rainfall winter et al 2020 yang et al 2019 floods wang et al 2020 yin et al 2018 and droughts omer et al 2020 as they are the most important input loveland and mahmood 2014 ukkola et al 2020 here we term the influence of local lulcc on the allocation role of the underlying surface for rainfall as a direct effect and the climate feedbacks of global lulcc as an indirect effect the relative importance of the two effects on extreme hydrological events is important for understanding flood control disaster reduction and drought adaptation under a changing environment which has never been evaluated in previous studies extreme rainfall is one of the principal drivers of floods recently changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events have been observed at regional and global scales chou et al 2013 these changes could have increased the risk of regional disasters such as flash floods and debris flows accordingly the variations and their driving factors from climate change of extreme rainfall have been heavily investigated in a changing environment however relative contributions of anthropogenic changes to extreme rainfall have rarely been investigated and are still fraught with difficulties recently lulcc induced impacts especially from urbanization have been found to affect the rainfall anomalies jiang et al 2020 yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 but their impacts on floods and droughts need to be better understood furthermore the magnitude frequency relationship of flood events might be influenced by climate change meißl et al 2017 and human activities zhou et al 2013 climate change influences the hydrological system by affecting the occurrence probabilities of critical conditions and the event precipitation characteristics garg and mishra 2019 while human activities impacts are mainly manifested by changing the underlying surface characteristics and thus the distribution of rainfall for instance increasing impervious surface caused by urban expansion is found to decrease infiltration and increase runoff wang et al 2018a wang et al 2018b drought which can be classified into meteorological hydrological and agricultural droughts is one of the most complex natural disasters wang et al 2018a wang et al 2018b there are several indices for monitoring and assessing droughts such as the standardized precipitation index spi palmer drought severity index pdsi standardized runoff index sri standardized soil moisture index ssi however these traditional drought indices consider the slowly evolving phenomenon caused by long term months or longer changes in hydrologic cycle elements such as precipitation evapotranspiration and soil moisture without including the case that extreme atmospheric anomalies persist only for a short duration days or weeks zhang et al 2017 recently flash drought proposed to describe the rapidly evolving droughts has been reported to be more frequent and widespread mo and lettenmaier 2015 2016 li et al 2020 yuan et al 2019 previous studies have investigated the variations of flash droughts however the contribution of anthropogenic activities is still difficult to quantify which is important to understand the mechanism of drought changes omer et al 2020 mechanisms behind the changes in extreme events including rainstorms floods and flash droughts still need to be clarified due to the complexities of the earth system zhou et al 2017 previous studies mainly focused on individual or combined effects of climate change and lulcc zhang et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 however few on the detection of lulcc induced climate change moreover it is common for impact assessments to be performed for separate conditions without accounting for the interactive influence between variations in land use and climate which potentially can be substantial wang et al 2020 this is especially important in regions experiencing rapid urbanization such as the yangtze river delta yrd region fig 1 one of the biggest urban agglomerations with the fastest developing speed in china and the world over the last century especially over the past 30 years the region has experienced rapid urbanization and has become one of china s most populous and prosperous regions the yrd region has experienced dynamic changes in land use especially for urban land fig 1d according to the temporal variation of urban land we find that there has a superposition of two s curves following two periods of rapid economic development processes the lulcc in the yrd has experienced three stages over the past 160 years i e an earlier urbanization period 1851 1900 a slow development period 1901 1980 and a rapid urbanization period 1981 2014 the impacts of land surface changes might have a profound effect on the atmosphere such as urban heat and rain island effects lu et al 2019 wang et al 2016 these effects will then affect regional hydrological extreme events but few studies have evaluated the interaction between lulcc and climate change and its impacts on hydrological extremes therefore in order to evaluate the interaction between lulcc and climate change and quantify the contribution of lulcc on extremes we here couple a land surface model lsm with climate change scenarios derived from earth system models esms or general circulation models gcms this takes advantage of the recently available land use model intercomparison project lumip part of the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 to detect the effects of land use on climate lawrence et al 2016 the lumip experiments were designed to quantify the global and regional effects of lulcc on climate and biogeochemical cycling past future by using model outputs from multi esms the impact assessments account for the relatively large uncertainties in projected climate change reshmidevi et al 2018 however due to the coarse resolution of esm outputs downscaling or bias correction methods should be used in regional studies to bridge the spatial resolution gaps between what esms can provide and what impact assessors require wilby et al 2002 besides matching the spatial resolutions consistency between land use data used in esms and lsm is also important for a reasonable assessment of hydrological impacts we here applied a spatial density function to downscale the coarse resolution historical land use datasets to keep the consistency between the driving land use data in esms and lsm in summary this paper aims to quantify the changes in hydrological extremes caused by lulcc using the coupled framework of the new state of the art cmip6 climate model experiments and lsm we focus on extreme rainfall floods and droughts over yrd here we divided the hydrological effects of lulcc into two parts i e the effects on climate variables such as rainfall from global lulcc and the effects on runoff yield processes from local lulcc the study includes three objectives 1 to quantify the effects of global lulcc on regional extreme rainfall 2 to synthetically evaluate the effects of lulcc and its climate feedbacks on floods and 3 to examine the effects of interaction between lulcc and climate change on flash droughts under different urbanization stages the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we introduce data and methods used in the paper followed by results and discussion in section 3 finally a summary and conclusions are presented in section 4 2 data and methods 2 1 datasets in situ meteorological observations are obtained from 112 weather stations see fig 1a for locations maintained by the national climate center china meteorological administration the observations include precipitation maximum and minimum temperature and mean wind speed at 2 m on a daily scale during the period 1975 2014 these observations are mainly used to provide meteorological forcing for hydrological simulations as well as serve as a ground truth reference in downscaling key meteorological variables from esms in lumip we obtain daily discharge observations during the period 2008 2018 for the qinhuai river basin and xitiaoxi river basin see fig 1 for locations the streamflow records are provided by the hydrological bureaus of jiangsu province and zhejiang province four widely used esms are used in this study the four models are the medium resolution beijing climate center climate system model version 2 bcc csm2 mr the community earth system model cesm2 version 2 the institut pierre simon laplace ipsl climate model ipsl cm6a lr version 6 and the u k earth system models ukesm1 0 ll previous studies show these models are capable of reproducing climate variables such as temperature precipitation wind speed etc boucher et al 2020 danabasoglu et al 2020 sellar et al 2019 wu et al 2019 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2016 these four models all participated in the lumip experiments of cmip6 thus the output climate variables from these esms were chosen to represent the modified climate conditions caused by global land use activities in the lumip experiments of each esm there have two specific experiments i e land hist and land nolu the land hist scenario represents the climate variables that are generated under the conditions of historical land cover land use and land management while the land nolu is the same as land hist except for no land use change lawrence et al 2016 the land model used in lumip captures a variety of ecological and hydrological sub grid characteristics and the land units are glacier lake urban vegetated and crop the urban land unit is divided into density classes representing the tall building district high density and medium density urban areas lawrence et al 2016 thus all these esms participate the lumip experiments e g bcc csm2 mr cesm2 ipsl cm6a lr and ukesm1 0 ll can be used to investigate the hydroclimate responses caused by global lulcc including urbanization hydrogeographic datasets used in this study are as follows historical land use and land cover datasets with a resolution of 0 25 during the period 1851 2014 are developed from the land use harmonization 2 project luh2 https luh umd edu the luh2 project aims to prepare a harmonized set of land use scenarios that smoothly connects historical reconstructions of land use with future projections in the format required for the earth system models hurtt et al 2020 land use and land cover data with a spatial resolution of 1 km during the period

was used to detect individual and combined impacts from changes in regional climate and runoff generation processes caused by lulcc on hydrological extremes the general methodological framework is illustrated in fig 2 we first bias correct and downscale key meteorological variables from the four earth system models the luh2 land use and land cover dataset with coarse resolution is also downscaled to a finer spatial scale consistent with the resdc land use dataset 1 km the downscaled climate forcing together with the fine scale land use and land cover dataset is used to drive a gridded hydrological model over the entire yrd region we then set up different scenarios to simulate hydrological extremes extreme rainfall extreme runoff and flash droughts during the period 1851 2014 and quantify the impacts of lulcc on their spatio temporal variabilities a bias correction of climate simulations for preserving the internal variability of each esm and keeping the comparability of different scenarios we apply the bias correction approach to minimize the differences of daily meteorological variables in mean and variability between in situ observations and earth system model simulations hawkins et al 2013 ho et al 2012 li et al 2020 the bias correction method is conducted under the relationship between gridded variables from esms and single site variables from observed stations variables the observation network is composed of 112 weather stations which are evenly distributed in the study region fig 1a the following equation is adopted for each individual meteorological station 1 s bc t o ref σ o r e f σ s r e f s raw t s ref where s bc t and s raw t denote bias corrected and raw variables of earth system model outputs i e historical and hist nolu of lumip experiments respectively σ o r e f and σ s r e f represent the standard deviation of observations and the daily model outputs during the reference period respectively o ref and s ref are the temporal mean values of observations and daily model outputs during the reference period respectively we conducted the bias correction method for the key meteorological variables including precipitation maximum and minimum temperature and wind speed of four earth system models to all weather stations the bias corrected variables are then interpolated to each grid using the thiessen polygon algorithm the thiessen polygon method is a commonly used methodology for computing the mean areal climate features for a catchment from gauge observations thiessen 1911 which is well suited to the uneven spatial distribution of the stations and widely applied in hydrological applications fiedler 2003 zhang et al 2017 the time series of observed meteorological data is divided into reference 1975 1994 and testing 1995 2014 periods respectively the absolute percent bias pbias calculated by the difference of observation and bias corrected variables divided by observation during testing periods is used to assess the performance of bias correction method then the entire time series 1975 2014 all available data are used in the processes subsequently we assess the performance of downscaled variables for each earth system model compared against in situ observations the bias corrected daily maximum and minimum temperatures are spatially consistent with observations figure not shown there are some differences between the changed and observed daily precipitation but they are quite consistent in magnitudes the same is true for 2 m wind speed overall the pbias for each earth system model is lower than 15 we thus apply the bias correction method to the entire period i e 1851 2014 for each of the four earth system models b downscaling of land use and land cover dataset the luh2 dataset is a standard format required by esms and provides an estimation of the fractional land use patterns annually at a resolution of 0 25 hurtt et al 2011 lawrence et al 2016 however due to the gap in scales between climate models and hydrological models the luh2 dataset also needs to be downscaled to a finer spatial scale for driving hydrological models here we apply a spatial downscaling method based on a density function of current actual land use patterns for luh2 datasets the land use data with a 1 km resolution for the year 2015 served as the current actual land use patterns we reclassified and unified the land use and land cover types of the resdc and luh2 datasets and got the following five types forest land grassland cropland urban land and water area these are the main land use and land cover types in the yangtze river delta in the study region urban land expansion is the main pattern of land use change spreading out from the center to the periphery moreover other land use cover such as forest and agricultural land also are beginning to change the most from the peripheral regions thus we assume that land use types spread out from the center of the grid to its periphery we assign a higher weight for center grid and then allocate land use and cover types from the center to the periphery according to the weight matrix fig 3 a for each luh2 grid t the relative density of each resdc cell j for each land use type i can be defined as 2 p i j k n i k 2 r 1 2 where p i j k is the density of cell j for land use type i and it is calculated as the fraction of total area of land use i over the window k the window k is a square centered at cell j r is the radius of the window k and 2 r 1 represents the width of square for the moving window here the grid 0 25 represents each unit of luh2 datasets and cell 1 km denotes each unit of resdc land use maps we apply the downscale method for obtaining fine scale land use and land cover map from luh2 for the years 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 we estimated the overall accuracy coefficient between the downscaled land use maps against the resdc land use maps which is calculated by summing the number of correctly classified values compared to resdc land use maps in downscaled land use maps and then divided by the total number of values the spatial distributions of each land use land cover type are very consistent and the values of overall accuracy exceed 0 70 indicating the good performance of the downscaling method fig 3b we thus apply the downscaling method to obtain reconstructed land use and land cover with a 1 km resolution during the entire period i e 1851 2014 c set up of hydrological simulations in this study we carry out hydrological simulations based on the variable infiltration capacity vic model liang et al 1994 vic is a physically based hydrologic model that solves full water and energy balances its characteristics mainly include representations of vegetation heterogeneity multiple soil layers with variable infiltration and non linear base flow which differ from other hydrological models shah and mishra 2020 for runoff generation processes vic model applies variable infiltration capacity curves to partition precipitation into runoff and infiltration for each cell the model has been successfully and widely adopted in previous studies for runoff simulations liston et al 1994 wang et al 2012 and drought monitoring mo and lettenmaier 2015 zhang et al 2017 vegetation parameters soil parameters and meteorological forcing including precipitation maximum and minimum temperature and wind speed are the main model inputs urban land is added as the vegetation class impervious area to the parameterization in the vic model hurkmans et al 2008 hurkmans et al 2009 by assigning such a vegetation class i e impervious area we can define specific settings of vegetation parameters for urban areas the specific soil properties are allocated according to hwsd datasets with a spatial resolution of 1 km and thus we could also consider spatial heterogeneity of soil types over urban area cropland mainly consists of paddy fields in the yrd area and it is handled according to the different land cover parameters here we only focus on the effects of changes in land use and cover types not on land management and irrigation thus the paddy fields are handled as irrigated crops with land cover parameters and runoff is generated according to variable infiltration capacity curves vic is conducted for the entire yrd region to simulate land surface hydrological processes and then the routing model developed by lohmann et al 1996 lohmann et al 1998 is applied to generate and explore the streamflow responses in two representative watersheds i e qinhuai river basin and xitiaoxi river basin we developed vegetation and soil parameters based on the downscaled luh2 datasets and the harmonized world soil database fischer et al 2008 respectively the monthly leaf area index lai dataset with a resolution of 1 km during 2008 2018 is derived from copernicus global land service camacho et al 2013 the lai parameters for each land use and cover type are calculated according to the average mean of the lai datasets hydrological simulations based on the vic model are set up at a daily scale with a spatial resolution of 0 01 over the entire yrd region we manually calibrate and validate the model against streamflow observations at the qinhuai river basin and xitiaoxi river basin the qinhuai river basin is a typical urbanized basin over the yrd region with a drainage area of 2587 km2 while the xitiaoxi river basin with a drainage area of 1191 km2 is dominated by forest with very limited urban coverage 5 for the year of 2015 fig 1 soil parameters are obtained according to the spatial distribution of soil types from hwsd datasets several parameters including infilt variable infiltration curve parameter dsmax maximum velocity of baseflow ds fraction of dsmax where non linear baseflow begins and ws fraction of maximum soil moisture where non linear baseflow occurs are calibrated and validated at two representative basins i e the qinhuai river basin and xitiaoxi river basin and they are set consistent both in the calibrated watersheds and entire yrd region the coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and pbias are used to assess the goodness of fit of the simulations arnold et al 1998 nash and sutcliffe 1970 fig 4 shows comparisons between simulated and observed monthly streamflow over the two basins the values of r2 and nse for both the calibration period 2008 2012 and the validation period 2013 2018 exceed 0 80 with the pbias 15 indicating that the model well captures hydrological regimes over the yrd region moriasi et al 2007 we further evaluate the performance of the vic model in capturing extreme flows i e the annual maximum daily streamflow over the two basins the r2 values between the simulated and observed annual maximum daily flow for the two basins are 0 87 and 0 76 statistically significant p 0 001 figure not shown respectively we thus simulate hydrological extremes over the entire yrd region based on the calibrated vic model with downscaled climate forcings during the entire period d numerical experiments we set up three numerical experiments hydro experiments in this study see table 1 for details the historical and hist nolu represent climate forcings from two lumip experiments with and without considering the impacts of land use land cover change on climate respectively the ensemble mean of the four earth system models is used as the climate forcing the three numerical experiments hydro experiments are as follows ctrl represents the hydrological simulation scenario without changing land use and land cover and is driven by hist nolu climate forcing i e no climate feedbacks lu represents the hydrological simulation scenario considering the impacts of land use land cover change on hydrologic response but no climate feedbacks lu clm represents the scenario that considers both the impacts of land use land cover change and climate feedbacks on hydrologic response all three numerical experiments are carried out at a daily time step for the land use and cover setting we used the average land surface conditions to represent the land use cover condition of certain time periods as shown in fig 1d we can find that the lulcc in the yrd has experienced three stages over the past 160 years i e an earlier urbanization period 1851 1900 a slow development period 1901 1980 and a rapid urbanization period 1981 2014 land use and cover changes during each stage are relatively stable thus we used the average land use and cover conditions to drive the vic model in lu and lu clm simulations here we separated the hydrological effects of lulcc on hydrological extremes into two parts i e the effects on climate variables such as rainfall temperature and so on from global lulcc and the effects on runoff yield processes from local lulcc as shown in fig 2 the effects of lulcc on regional climate are estimated by lumip experiments historical hist nolu we determine the individual impacts of lulcc on hydrological extremes based on the factor separation analysis from three numerical experiments stein and alpert 1993 1 the effects on runoff yield processes from regional lulcc lu ctrl 2 the effects on climate variables such as rainfall temperature and so on from global lulcc lu clm lu and 3 both lu clm ctrl it should be noted that the effects of lulcc on climate variables are evaluated from a global scale due to the settings of lumip experiments that are driven by global land use and land cover datasets the effects of lulcc on runoff yield processes are estimated from regional perspectives due to hydrological processes always occurring at the watershed or regional scale we characterize extreme rainfall based on annual maximum daily precipitation p1day and floods based on annual maximum daily runoff r1day over each hydrological model grid flash droughts including heatwave flash droughts and precipitation deficit flash droughts are used to characterize the rapid drought characteristics mo and lettenmaier 2015 2016 pentads five day means during the growing season april to october are used to account for flash drought events 42 pentads per year the datasets cover the base period from 1851 to 2014 the spatial resolution is 0 01 we apply two cases for flash drought 1 heatwave flash drought t air anomaly 1 std et anomaly 0 and sm 40 2 precipitation deficit flash drought t air anomaly 1 std et anomaly 0 and p 40 t air et sm and p represent air temperature evapotranspiration soil moisture and precipitation respectively see also mo and lettenmaier 2015 2016 for details anomalies are defined as departures from the climatology during the base period std denotes the standard deviation of t air sm is expressed as percentile relative to the long term record of sm here the soil moisture for the first layer 0 10 cm depth is used while these indices including p1day r1day and flash droughts are evaluated at grid scale over the yrd region we additionally evaluate differences in flow duration curves fdc over the qinhuai river and xitiaoxi river basins to further shed light on contrasting hydrologic responses among different scenarios at the basin scale 3 results and discussion 3 1 extreme rainfall fig 5 shows the boxplots of p1day over the entire yrd region during three development stages as can be seen from the figure changes in land use land cover led to increases in p1day over all three development stages for instance the mean p1day is 88 59 mm during the period 1851 1900 in the hist nolu scenario while it is 89 84 mm in the historical scenario that considers the impact of land use land cover change on climate the relative increase for p1day associated with land use change is 1 41 3 9 and 2 16 during the three development stages respectively table 2 the relative increase in mean p1day is 2 76 during the entire period despite the overall increases in mean p1day averaged over the entire yrd region changes in mean p1day demonstrate considerable spatial differences fig 6 global lulcc increased p1day in most areas except for the southeastern part of the yrd region during 1851 2014 fig 6a we see increased p1day in western yrd during 1851 1900 and in most areas during 1901 1980 fig 6b 6c during the most rapid urbanization period i e 1981 2014 the spatial contrast of p1day changes induced by global lulcc is even sharp with positive anomalies observed in the northern and southeastern yrd and negative anomalies for the rest regions fig 6d the relative increase is the largest during the earlier urbanization period table 2 and this is possibly associated with the consistent increasing trend over the yrd during this period while the much more spatial difference during the other two stages fig 6 the areas with increasing extreme rainfall mainly occur in the urbanized and coastal regions while the southern mountainous areas with limited lulcc have an adverse rainfall change an interesting finding is that the region with positive p1day anomalies matches quite well with the spatial distribution of the city belt over the yrd region see fig 1a this echoes previous studies that detectable impacts of urbanization on extreme rainfall over the yrd region through land atmosphere interactions jiang et al 2020 yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 it should be noted that climate feedback defined in this study is associated with land use land cover change around the globe and cannot be simply tied to urbanization over the regional scale i e the yrd region this is because the lumip experiments are driven by global datasets thus the climate feedback in these experiments represents the effects of lulcc from a global perspective not only from the yrd region the effects of lulcc such as urbanization and deforestation on climate usually occur at the mesoscale and macroscale maidment 1993 thus it is necessary to examine the impact of land use change on climate from a larger scale previous studies show that the impacts of urbanization on extreme rainfall are most frequently observed either over the urban cores or the downwind regions i e approximately 20 50 km away from the urban center reported by liu and niyogi 2019 future studies need to design numerical experiments that specifically focus on land use land cover changes at regional scale such as the yrd region and their climate feedbacks this would help to further understand whether the climate feedback is attributed to local lulcc or the lulcc elsewhere however with respect to the land surface hydrological processes such as the runoff generation they occur mainly at a regional scale i e a watershed scale thus the following contents related to the effects of lulcc on runoff generation processes are conducted at the regional scale i e the yrd region 3 2 extreme runoff changes in runoff extremes are associated with both land use land cover changes e g deforestation and urbanization and climate feedbacks associated with them wang et al 2018a wang et al 2018b woltemade et al 2020 yang et al 2019 fig 7 shows the boxplots of r1day during three development stages over the yrd region for the three simulation scenarios compared to the ctrl scenario both lu and lu clm scenarios observe increases in median and mean r1day over the yrd region the increase is more evident in the lu clm experiment that considers both lulcc impacts and climate feedbacks we provide a quantitative evaluation of the impacts of lulcc and the impacts that combined both lulcc and climate feedbacks on extreme runoff with the statistics provided in table 3 the lulcc alone increases mean r1day by 0 05 0 14 across three different stages while the combined impacts with both lulcc and its climate feedbacks lead to a 3 01 7 18 increase in mean r1day the small increase in r1day over the yrd region induced by lulcc is due to the contradicting impacts of different types of land use land cover change on runoff generation the combined impacts on runoff increases are almost 33 times that of the lulcc impact alone during the rapid urbanization period this indicates that climate feedbacks associated with lulcc play a dominant role in increasing the probability of extreme runoff over the yrd region fig 8 shows the spatial difference in mean r1day between ctrl and lu clm scenarios over the yrd region during the entire period 1851 2014 lulcc increases r1day in almost the entire yrd region by about 4 mm and decreases r1day in the southwestern yrd fig 8a with respect to the first development stage 1851 1900 r1day increased in the western yrd region and decreased in the south fig 8b during the slow development period lulcc increases r1day over almost the entire yrd region fig 8c consistent with the spatial pattern of p1day increases fig 6d the combined effects of lulcc and its climate feedbacks lead to an increase of r1day in the southwestern and northern areas during the rapid urbanization period fig 8d we find that the spatial distribution of changes in extreme runoff is very consistent with that in p1day fig 6 and fig 8 the spatial regions with consistent signs of change i e both increases or decreases account for 90 of the yrd region this indicates that climate feedbacks induced by lulcc dominate changes in extreme runoff over the yrd region despite the significant urbanization trend in the past decades over the yrd region 3 3 flash droughts fig 9 shows the boxplots of flash drought frequency over the yrd region over different development stages with the statistics shown in table 3 flash droughts occur about 2 4 pentads per year over the yrd region the low frequency of drought is closely tied to the location of yrd in a humid climate region and its closeness to the pacific ocean the distributions of flash drought frequency are consistent under three experiments during 1851 1900 possibly due to the little lulcc in the earlier urbanization period fig 9a however we see more frequent flash drought in the lu clm experiment during the slow development and rapid urbanization periods than in the other two experiments fig 9b and 9c the frequency of flash drought is comparable between the ctrl and lu scenarios across all three development stages indicating that lulcc alone does not play a deterministic role in changing the regimes of flash drought over the yrd region the change rate in the frequency of flash drought induced by land use land cover change is 3 92 5 44 and 5 71 during the three stages respectively table 3 however the change rate induced by the combined effects that consider both lulcc and its climate feedbacks is 0 43 11 06 and 34 12 this is consistent with the changes in extreme runoff see section 3 2 which further emphasize the importance of climate feedbacks associated with lulcc in changing hydrological extremes over the yrd region we further show the spatial differences in the mean frequency of flash drought between the ctrl and lu clm scenarios over the yrd region fig 10 lulcc increased flash droughts slightly in most areas over the yrd during the entire period fig 10a we find more frequent flash droughts in the western yrd during 1851 1900 but a wider coverage during 1901 1980 fig 10b 10c with respect to the rapid urbanization period lulcc increases the frequency of flash droughts in almost the entire region of yrd with a relatively greater spatial difference fig 10d we show that lulcc changes flash drought frequency more significantly during the rapid urbanization stage i e 1981 2014 fig 11 shows the spatial distribution of changes in heatwave flash droughts and precipitation deficit flash droughts induced by lulcc during the rapid urbanization period both heatwave flash drought and precipitation deficit flash drought have been increased during 1981 2014 with the latter demonstrating a more pronounced increase than the former the heatwave flash droughts mainly increase in urban regions which can mainly attribute to the lulcc induced abnormally persistent high temperature in the growing season that would decrease surface evapotranspiration and the soil moisture content chen et al 2022 mazrooei et al 2021 in addition precipitation deficit flash drought spans across the entire yrd region and this is perhaps because the lulcc decreases the rainfall amount in consecutive rainless days and thus reduces the water supply of soil moisture both the heatwave and precipitation deficit conditions induced by the combined effects of lulcc and climate feedbacks affect flash droughts over the yrd region it should be note that these changes in flash droughts mainly reflect the impacts of lulcc and lulcc induced climate feedbacks not the changes in specific irrigation practices the results should be further verified in areas with different lulcc processes and the effects of lulcc associated irrigation also deserve further examined 3 4 flow duration curves we further evaluate contrasting hydrologic responses among three numerical experiments from the perspective of fdc over the qinhuai and xitiaoxi basins table 4 and fig 12 we examined the lulcc induced impacts on average flows high flows and low flows on the two typical basin scales high flows are represented by the flows below the frequency of 1 and 5 i e q1 and q5 respectively and low flows are represented by the flows above the frequency of 95 and 99 i e q95 and q99 respectively during the entire period the fdc over the two basins are basically identical however if we zoom into the high and low ends of the curves representing the conditions of high flows and low flows the differences are much clearer fig 12 we can find that average flows would increase by 9 15 and 5 61 in lu clm scenarios for qinhuai and xitiaoxi basins respectively while by 2 84 and 0 08 in lu scenarios table 4 this indicates that lulcc would have a larger impact on average flows when considering its impact from climate feedbacks both high flows and low flows are increased in the lu clm scenario for the qinhuai river basin compared to the ctrl and lu scenario the increased rates are 10 32 and 10 4 for high flows i e q1 and q5 respectively and 12 32 and 14 46 for low flows i e q95 and q99 respectively table 4 both high and low flows are increased in the lu scenario compared to the ctrl scenario but with relatively smaller magnitudes 1 48 and 1 66 for high flows and 4 84 and 5 72 for low flows respectively table 4 however the differences among the three experiments are quite small for the xitiaoxi basin this is due to limited land use land cover change over this forest dominated basin fig 13 when considering the climate feedback effects i e the lu clm scenario the change rate is 3 19 and 4 48 for high flows and 1 16 and 0 57 for low flows respectively compared to the ctrl scenario over this basin table 4 recent studies also found that the effects of climate change on floods are more significant than those of lulcc yang et al 2021 when encountering the extreme rainfall events the impacts of changes on floods in the land surface are limited due to the control role of maximum soil water storage capacity our results indicate that the combined effects of lulcc and climate feedbacks lead to a larger increase in high flows and thus floods compared with scenarios that only considering the effects on runoff yield processes from local lulcc moreover these lulcc induced effects are more significant in low flows than high flows and then average flows similarly the increase in high flows as observed in the qinhuai basin induced by lulcc is also reported in previous studies for instance bian et al 2017 found that urbanization has increased average annual runoff due to the expansion of impervious coverage gao et al 2020 projected that lulcc in 2028 would increase flood peak magnitudes by 4 7 to 8 1 in the qinhuai basin when urban land use increased by 30 to 60 however these studies did not consider the impacts of climate feedbacks induced by lulcc on hydrologic response 3 5 limitations and uncertainties previous studies have also investigated the impacts of lulcc on runoff generation processes or the climate feedbacks of lulcc however the understanding of the combined effects of lulcc on hydrological processes at both aspects is still unclear due to the difficulties in coupling the processes of land surface and atmospheric processes in this study we quantified the hydrological effects of lulcc from both the land surface and atmospheric processes using a coupled framework associated with hydrological models and lumip experiments from cmip6 our results shed light on the importance of considering land atmosphere interactions in addition to land surface processes in projecting changes in hydrological extremes lulcc tends to increase floods and flash droughts especially when considering the climate feedback effects from global lulcc the impact of lulcc on hydrological processes demonstrates itself not only through its direct influence on runoff generation mechanisms i e infiltration processes but also through its indirect impact on regional climate through land atmosphere interactions these results would facilitate better understanding of lulcc induced impacts on hydrologic extreme events and thus provide a scientific basis for better implementing flood control disaster reduction and drought adaptation in rapid developing region however there is a limitation that we could not separate the climate feedbacks induced by the lulcc within or outside of the study region because the lumip experiments are driven by global land use and cover datasets thus the climate modification represents the effects of lulcc from a global perspective not only in the yrd region regional climate models such as the weather research and forecasting wrf model coupled with hydrological models is encouraged to further detect the effects of lulcc on hydrological variables at a local or global scale moreover another limitation of this study is hydrological modeling using constant parameters in hydrological models including vic is a common practice in detecting hydrologic responses under different lulcc scenarios adjusting parameters such as the infiltration curve with different land surface scenarios is ideal in theory however it is difficult in practice due to model structure and limited observation datasets the constant parameters would generate systematic bias in the results however this might also influence the runoff generation processes and then affect the assessment of the responses of hydrological extremes under lulcc scenarios in addition cropland and urban land are considered as one land use type in vic it could not be divided within a cell into finer portions due to the limited datasets we did not consider changes in land management such as tillage practices specific irrigation practices and timing of crop planting the uncertainties inherent related to the combination of esms and hydrological models can be attributed to esms the downscaling methods as well as hydrological models as noted by many studies e g marchane et al 2017 minville et al 2008 wang et al 2020 in the present work multi esms are used and an ensemble of simulations was considered to reduce the uncertainties caused by different esms moreover the downscaling methods for climate simulations may also introduce uncertainties we compared the differences by using different downscaling methods i e bias correction approach and quantile delta mapping and the results show there is little difference between different methods figure not shown furthermore for keeping the trends of climate variables in different time periods we used bias correction methods in this study we evaluated the impact of lulcc on climate variables in different periods and the comparisons are conducted between different periods within a model rather than between different models therefore different downscaling methods have limited influence on the conclusion moreover spatial interpolation methods would also introduce uncertainties to the hydrological simulations we did not separately evaluate the performance of spatial data interpolation but rather the performance of hydrological modeling our results indicate that our model can simulate the hydrological processes well for long term streamflow and extreme flows we hypothesize that some sources of uncertainty such as input datasets spatial interpolation methods model parameters can be partially reduced by calibrating and evaluating the performance of hydrological model over the basin scale however it is worth trying to improve the accuracy of hydrological models using different spatial interpolation methods hwang et al 2012 kurtzman et al 2009 land use and cover datasets represent the land surface heterogeneity and influence the hydrologic processes in this study we reconstructed the land use and cover maps over the yangtze river delta region according to the luh2 dataset the luh2 historical land use datasets estimate the fractional land use patterns annually at 0 25 0 25 resolution we applied a spatial downscaling algorithm to bridge the gap between the luh2 dataset and its regional application in hydrological modeling our results indicate that the downscaled land use maps match well with the satellite based datasets both in spatial and statistical fig 3 overall accuracy higher than 0 7 however we still found that luh2 underestimated the fraction of urban land over the study areas fig 3 potentially affecting the examination of hydrological responses caused by past lulcc this may cause the underestimation of extremely high streamflow when considering the climate feedback associated with lulcc we provide a coupled framework to separate and quantify the hydrological effects of lulcc which come from changes in climate and runoff generation processes nevertheless there may be some differences in conclusions when applied in regions with different climate background or different lulcc processes and more comparative analysis is needed 4 summary and conclusions in this study we comprehensively evaluate the impacts of land use land cover change and its climate feedbacks on hydrological extremes over the yrd region during the period 1851 2014 the evaluation is based on distributed hydrological simulations with different land use land cover datasets and contrasting climate forcings from the lumip experiments the main conclusions are as follows 1 land use land cover change increased annual maximum daily rainfall p1day over the yrd region from 1851 to 2014 the relative increase for p1day associated with global lulcc ranges from 1 41 to 3 9 during the three development stages with an average value of 2 76 lulcc induced changes in p1day are spatially heterogeneous but with positive rainfall anomalies mainly distributed over the city belt consistent with previous studies that show the precipitation enhancement benefits of the yrd urban agglomerations 2 local lulcc increases mean r1day by 0 05 0 14 across three different stages while the combined impacts of local lulcc and its global climate feedbacks lead to an increase of 3 01 7 18 the combined impact is almost 33 times that of the lulcc impact alone this is due to the concurrent distribution of positive rainfall anomalies with impervious regions that altogether augment the probability of extreme runoff over the yrd region 3 the frequency of flash droughts is increased due to the combined effects of lulcc and climate feedbacks while local lulcc alone does not play an important role in changing the regimes of flash drought especially the impacts of lulcc and its climate feedbacks increased flash droughts by up to 34 12 during the rapid urbanization stage mainly attributed to its associated effects on heatwaves and extreme precipitation deficit events 4 lulcc tends to increase average flows high flows and low flows in particular the flows in the urban dominated basin the combined effects of lulcc and climate feedbacks lead to a larger increase in average and high flows and thus floods compared to the scenarios that only considering the effects on runoff yield processes from local lulcc our results highlight the importance of online hydrological simulations that consider land atmosphere interactions in addition to land surface processes in projecting changes in hydrological extremes the impact of land use land cover change on hydrological processes demonstrates itself not only through its direct influence on runoff generation mechanisms i e infiltration processes but also through its indirect impact on regional climate through land atmosphere interactions the indirect impacts are often ignored in offline hydrological simulations the modeling framework that couples hydrological and atmospheric components such as the weather research and forecasting model wrf hydrological modeling system skamarock et al 2005 should be applied to detect the synthetic effects of lulcc on hydrological extremes especially in the region with dramatic land use change i e urbanization afforestation deforestation etc although multi models are used in this study to decrease the uncertainty of the results more models should be considered to increase the robustness when detecting the responses of land atmosphere interactions credit authorship contribution statement qiang wang conceptualization methodology software writing

1769,the complex subsurface conditions and spatial anisotropy of water bearing media in karst basins result in much more variable runoff generation and confluence processes and water circulation than those in nonkarst basins therefore accurate flood forecasting is more difficult in karst areas and it is challenging to accurately quantify the water exchange relationship between surface rivers and karst aquifers to provide key technical support for accurate flood forecasts in karst basins this study improved a distributed physical hydrologic model the karst liuxihe model by improving the runoff generation and confluence algorithms and the parameter optimization algorithm to simulate surface floods in three different karst watersheds in southern china additionally in the model calculations this study focused on the influence of water exchange on surface flood simulations in changing watersheds the results showed that for the largest basin xijiang basin 353 100 km2 considering or not considering the water exchange between the surface river and karst aquifer had little effect on the surface flood simulation results however this water exchange had a great effect on the surface simulations for the smallest basin the beijiang basin 1 700 km2 for instance the simulated average peak flow showed a 29 difference and the total amount of flooding showed a 25 difference between dry years and normal years therefore when forecasting surface floods in small karst areas the water exchange relationship between surface rivers and karst aquifers must be considered the results showed that the impact of groundwater on surface rivers can be disregarded when forecasting surface floods in the large xijiang karst basin and can be treated directly as surface flood forecasting in nonkarst areas the application of this strategy will greatly simplify the cost of hydrologic modelling in the xijiang basin by improving the karst liuxihe model the accuracy of its flood simulation and general applicability in karst basins were greatly enhanced the improvement in the karst hydrological model in this study provides a good tool for flood simulation and forecasting in the karst regions of southwest china keywords flood simulation and forecasting water exchange karst liuxihe model karst basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction karst areas are widely distributed across southwest china li et al 2019 especially in the xijiang river basin the study area selected in this paper where subsurface karst fissures and conduit systems are strongly developed the main water supply source in the underground river system is rainfall infiltration water and the discharge process of the underground river outlet is very responsive to rainfall in recent years the frequent occurrence of extreme rainfall events worldwide has resulted in many karst areas experiencing severe floods causing extensive losses of lives and property vesper 2013 darras et al 2015 mesnil et al 2021 therefore it is important to develop simulation tools that can predict flooding in karst areas ambroise et al 1996 janža 2010 iacobellis et al 2015 renard and bertrand 2017 hydrologic models may provide critical technical support for regional flood management and damage assessment ravbar and kovacic 2009 hosseini et al 2014 bitri et al 2014 apollonio et al 2018 in general hydrological forecasting in karst basins is much more difficult than that in nonkarst basins knöll et al 2020 the subsurface conditions runoff generation and confluence processes in karst areas are more complex and spatially variable darras et al 2015 sadat and bazvand 2021 for instance the spatial structure of aquifers in karst areas is usually anisotropic ford and williams 2007 lamoreaux and lamoreaux 2007 in particular the structure of water bearing media fissures and conduit systems in karst basins is very different from that in nonkarst basins resulting in great spatiotemporal differences in the hydrological characteristics between karst and nonkarst areas žugaj and ranko 1996 wu et al 2017 wang et al 2019 many scholars have carried out targeted studies accordingly and have assessed the exact factors that influence runoff generation and confluence processes in karst basins castellarin et al 2001 assessed the impact of measurement and modelling methods on flood frequency analysis the results showed that similarity measures based on seasonality indexes were effective for estimating extreme flow quantiles however this study focused mainly on evaluating the impact of the time scale change on the runoff forecast and lacked an evaluation of the spatial change impact ebrahimian et al 2017 discussed the impacts of climate and human activities on regional flood forecasting in malaysia and quantitatively estimated the possible hydrological consequences of potential land use and climate changes on the hydrological regime the conclusions of this study only apply to the local fixed study area and do not explore the impact of catchment scale changes on hydrological processes lian et al 2020 adopted three independent quantitative methods to distinguish the relative contributions of climate change and human activity in a mesoscale karst basin and identified the spatial variability in the hydrological response to climate change and ecological restoration however the analytical results of this study are only applicable to mesoscale karst basins and not large karst basins such as the xijiang river the above studies focus mainly on the impact of climate or land use changes on hydrological processes in the region but quantitative assessments of hydrological processes and the water cycle in karst areas and their impacts on spatial scale changes in the watershed are lacking considering that the subsurface conditions and hydrogeological characteristics of karst areas are complex and variable it is unclear how the hydrological processes in karst areas especially subsurface hydrological processes respond quantitatively to spatial scale differences among basins therefore this study focuses on the impact of the water exchange between surface rivers and karst aquifers on the surface flood simulation results obtained by using a distributed hydrologic model in basins at various scales this water exchange is a very common phenomenon in karst basins and can change dramatically with the seasons in general during the flood season the surface river water mainly replenishes the karst aquifer while during the dry season the opposite is true as the water conserved in the karst aquifer in turn replenishes the water shortage in the surface river this water exchange is very important for flood forecasting in the region and if this part of the water cycle is neglected in the model calculation it may lead to water imbalance in the model and bring great uncertainty to the forecast results thus this study quantitatively simulates and evaluates the impact of this water exchange on flood forecasting one of the objectives of this study to quantitatively simulate and forecast karst floods accurately in practice it is crucial to select a suitable hydrologic model liu et al 2005 darras et al 2015 current hydrologic models especially distributed hydrologic models have been widely used in karst areas and have achieved good results kraller et al 2014 renard and bertrand 2017 however the commonly used distributed groundwater models have multiple complex structures and various parameters which require a massive amount of hydrogeological data for modelling in karst areas li et al 2020 for instance the modflow cfp model requires detailed distribution information on karst underground conduits martha et al 2021 and borehole pumping tests may also be necessary to fully understand groundwater dynamics to address the challenge of the large demand for modelling data in karst basins the karst liuxihe model developed based on the liuxihe model chen 2009 2018 was employed to simulate surface floods in this study the storage mode was used in the karst liuxihe model to describe the runoff generation of subsurface karst groundwater considering that there are some exposed karst landforms in the study area a certain excess surface runoff remaining after infiltration may be generated on these geomorphic units and this runoff is also an important part of flood water therefore this study improved the runoff generation and confluence algorithms in the karst liuxihe model and the module of excess infiltration runoff was added to the model to calculate the excess infiltration surface runoff on the exposed karst landforms by improving the structure and algorithm of the karst liuxihe model this study aims to improve the accuracy of the model reduce the data demand for modelling in karst areas and make it generally applicable to hydrological forecasting of karst areas in southwest china the second objective of this study there are great differences in karst development in different basins which may affect the evaluation of the water exchange between surface aquifers and aquifers in surface flood simulations at the watershed scale to avoid this problem the three research areas selected in this study have a subordinate relationship and they all belong to the same xijiang karst basin including the xijiang basin itself and its first level tributary the liujiang karst basin and the first level tributary of the liujiang basin the beijiang karst basin the flood simulation effects at the outlets of the three basins were compared to evaluate the impact of catchment scale changes on flood forecasting the main purpose here is to explore whether the water exchange between the surface aquifer and karst aquifer at different watershed scales has a serious impact on the simulation results if the impact is not serious the improved karst liuxihe model can ignore this water exchange interaction when simulating and forecasting surface floods in karst watersheds which can greatly simplify the cost of modelling in karst basins in addition the theoretical improvement of the hydrologic model and the application of flood simulations in this study provide a feasible scheme for hydrological predictions in karst regions 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the study area is the xijiang karst watershed in southern china which is located at 102 14 114 50 e and 21 31 26 49 n the xijiang river is the main stream of the pearl river basin with a total length of 2 075 km an average annual runoff depth of 651 37 mm and an average gradient of 0 58 luo et al 2010 it is the longest river in the pearl river system and the third largest river in china behind only the yangtze and yellow rivers in length the catchment area of the xijiang watershed is 353 100 km2 which accounts for 75 6 of the entire pearl river basin the xijiang river originates from maxiong mountain in qujing city of yunnan province and flows through yunnan guizhou guangxi and guangdong provinces from west to east the main tributaries of the xijiang river are the nanpanjiang beipan jiang hongshui river liujiang yujiang hegui river and qianxun river the research areas in this study were the entire xijiang karst watershed the liujiang the tributary of xijiang karst watershed and the beijiang the tributary of liujiang karst watershed fig 1 shows the drainage maps of these three watersheds 2 2 hydrometeorology and geology the climate of the xijiang basin is a tropical and subtropical monsoon climate influenced by both the low latitude easterly wind belt and the middle and high latitude westerly belt the annual average temperature is 14 to 22 c and the multiyear average precipitation is 1629 mm chen et al 2020 in summer the southeast and southwest monsoons prevail with high temperature and humidity and frequent typhoon invasion resulting in frequent and strong rainstorms the rainfall season in the basin is long but the distribution of rainfall within the year is extremely uneven precipitation is concentrated mainly in the flood season from april to september which generally accounts for approximately 70 to 80 of the annual precipitation the dry season october to march has less precipitation approximately 300 to 350 mm accounting for only 20 to 30 of the annual precipitation wang et al 2009 the liujiang river is the second largest tributary of the xijiang river system with a total length of 1121 km and a basin area of 58 270 km2 the topography of the basin is high in the north and northwest and low in the south and southeast the middle and upper reaches of the basin are mostly alpine canyons accounting for approximately 47 of the basin area the beijiang river is a tributary of the liujiang river with a length of 130 km and a watershed area of 1773 km2 the geographical characteristics of the beijiang river basin are mainly mountainous hills with an average elevation of 603 m and a maximum elevation of 2 081 m the beijiang river basin is the famous rainstorm centre area in the xijiang river basin where the annual average rainfall is more than 1800 mm the maximum 12 hour rainfall is 644 19 mm the maximum 24 hour rainfall is 779 1 mm and the maximum 3 day rainfall is 1335 15 mm luo et al 2010 the river network in the basin is dense and the river slope is very large thus the river level at the basin outlet rises and falls violently and responds very quickly to rainfall the three basins in this study have a subordinate relationship the beijiang river is a tributary of the liujiang river where its flood is the main source of the liujiang river flood and the liujiang river is a tributary of the xijiang river and is an important component of the xijiang river floods therefore the flooding process in the three basins has a sequential order i e a flooding process first converges with the liujiang basin through the outlet of the beijiang basin then converges with the main stream of the xijiang river through the outlet of the liujiang basin and finally converges with the wuzhou river gauge fig 1b through the outlet of the xijiang basin the topography of the xijiang basin is generally high in the north low in the south high in the west and low in the east there are three types of landforms in the basin mountains hills and plains which mainly consist of three macroscopic units the yunnan guizhou plateau the guangxi basin and the pearl river delta plain among them the guangxi basin is the main geomorphic unit of the basin the main stream of the xijiang river and its larger tributaries began to develop after the yanshan movement in the cretaceous period approximately 100 million years ago and the himalayan movement in the tertiary period 30 million years ago forced the uplift of the yunnan guizhou plateau resulting in large topographic relief in the upper reaches of the xijiang river in the north and south pan rivers the hongshui river and the liujiang river basin and consequently many typical canyons and landscapes rapidly formed fig 2 shows the three dimensional topographic distribution of the xijiang river basin the xijiang karst basin is the main distribution area of karst in south china the general geomorphology of the basin is mainly karst geomorphology peak forest plain and peak cluster depression the xijiang river is in a karst valley basin which is covered by quaternary loose deposits controlled by the sweeping action of the xijiang river and the karst geological background the surface is dominated by the quaternary river alluvial layer and karst dissolution residual accumulation with a thickness of approximately 10 to 20 m continuous carbonate rocks sandstone shale and carbonate interclastic rocks are widely distributed in the basin where the area of carbonate rocks is 18 36 104 km2 accounting for 55 7 of the total area which is mainly distributed on the southwest side of the basin fig 1a the distribution area of clastic rocks combined with carbonate rocks is 52 965 km2 accounting for 15 of the total area the outcrops in the basin mainly include upper devonian limestone d3 lower carboniferous datang formation limestone c1d c1d3 middle carboniferous limestone c2d and upper carboniferous limestone c3 upper permian carbonate rocks with clastic rocks p2d p2h lower triassic clastic rocks with carbonate rocks t1 lower cretaceous clastic rocks intermingled with carbonate rocks and quaternary pleistocene q qp and holocene qh loose rocks the north is dominated by the sandstone shale rock group carbonate rock group and carbonate rock with clastic rock group the western part is mainly carbonate rock formation and the lithology is mainly limestone the northeast is mostly hard sandstone with shale and the southeast is mostly polycarbonate rocks the central and southern parts of the karst plain are characterized by the overburden lithology of clay and gravel which is weakly permeable the underlying bedrock is mostly carbonate rocks mainly dolomite with extremely developed karst fissures and a large amount of water enrichment in fissures in the karst caves he 2017 various typical karst landforms such as collapse dolines sinkholes caves karst windows and underground river systems developed due to the long term weathering of rock and erosion effects of groundwater the karst area is approximately 175 000 km2 accounting for 53 1 of the total area of the xijiang basin chen et al 2020 karst is widely developed in the northern basin forming underground rivers and karst springs are densely distributed in the middle and lower reaches of the basin a total of 38 underground rivers have been identified in du an yao autonomous county in the liujiang river basin and there are a total of 99 tributaries which ultimately flow into the main stream of the xijiang surface river system and are discharged through the wuzhou river gauge fig 1b at the basin outlet the liujiang karst basin is in the middle of the xijiang river basin where karst is highly developed fig 1a and the distribution area of soluble carbonate rocks accounts for 84 6 of the total basin area the northern part of the basin is an east west arc shaped fold area with soluble rocks as synclines and sand shale as anticlines in the western section sand shale is less exposed and karst valleys are mainly arranged along the strike the western area is a large area of continuous limestone distribution mainly peak tuft valleys the eastern part of the basin is a hilly area with alternating soft and hard rocks due to different erosion resistances the hard rocks form low mountains with gentle slopes in the direction and steep slopes behind the central part of the basin is dominated by a solitary peak plain and a peak forest plain 2 3 modelling data the modelling data for the karst liuxihe model are mainly rainfall and flow data as well as high resolution digital elevation model dem data land use data and soil type data among these data rainfall data are telemetered by setting up rain gauges with full coverage in the basin including 248 68 and 8 rain gauges fig 1b c and d in the xijiang basin liujiang basin and beijiang basin respectively these rain gauges cover the entire watershed area evenly so the rainfall observations obtained can reflect the actual rainfall in the basin the flow data in this study are mainly derived from the flood data of surface rivers and the outlet discharge of karst underground rivers and hourly flood processes from 2008 to 2016 at the basin outlet were collected in each of the three basins to refine the flood process simulation effect in different hydrological years we divided the time series of these flood processes into wet years normal years and dry years in this study a year with an average peak flood discharge greater than 40 000 m3 s was a wet year in the xijiang basin it was 20 000 m3 s in the liujiang basin and 4 000 m3 s in the beijiang basin a year with an average peak flood lower than 10 000 m3 s was a dry year in the xijiang basin it was 4 000 m3 s in the liujiang basin and 1 000 m3 s in the beijiang basin a year with an average peak flood between these values was a normal year in these three basins the dem land use and soil type data are the basic property modelling data for a hydrologic model these property data can be downloaded at no cost from online databases and the download link is provided at the end of the article the original spatial resolution of the dem was 90 m 90 m and the resolution for both the land use and soil type data was 1000 m 1000 m these values were resampled at 200 m 200 m in the karst liuxihe model according to the previous research results of the effects of model resolution on its performance chen et al 2017 notably dem data in karst areas need to be preprocessed for the original data before modelling which mainly involves the classification of negative landforms such as sinkholes and other depressions in karst areas through basin surveys then these real depressions are kept when filling and only the false depressions caused by the dem data errors are filled when modelling some hydrogeological data such as the flow direction of the underground rivers and the distribution of karst conduits were obtained through tracer tests in the study area the results of the tracer test showed that the karst conduit system is well developed in the aquifers and some of these large conduits form underground river systems the volume of underground rivers mainly comes from rainfall infiltration recharge and water exchange between surface rivers and karst aquifers the flow process at the outlet of the underground river responds very quickly to rainfall and the outflow will rise approximately 12 h after a rainstorm heavy rainfall of more than 50 mm in 24 h the flow rate of the underground river is approximately 2 92 m s 1 during the flood season of the year and 0 46 m s 1 in the dry season 3 methodology 3 1 karst liuxihe model chen 2009 proposed a distributed hydrologic model i e the liuxihe model for flood simulation and forecasting in nonkarst regions to make this model suitable for karst areas li et al 2019 2021 improved the model structure and parameters to develop the karst liuxihe model and this model has been successfully applied in several karst basins compared with other commonly distributed hydrologic models which typically have a complex distributed structure and more parameters the karst liuxihe model has only a two layer structure and few parameters li et al 2021 making it easier to model karst areas the two layer structure includes the surface structure and underground structure where the surface structures include the vegetation cover and soil layer in the model and the underground structure is divided into the epikarst zone the shallow karst water bearing system under the soil layer includes fissures and conduit systems and the deep karst water bearing system includes the rock stratum and the underground river system the surface structure of the model controls the generation and confluence process of surface water in the area mainly calculating evapotranspiration depression filling surface runoff generation and confluence while the underground structure completes the process of underground runoff confluence output including the calculation of infiltration underground river confluence etc in addition this model can simulate the floods of both surface rivers and karst underground rivers li et al 2021 2022 notably the karst liuxihe model may not be suitable for the calculation of surface runoff from excess rainfall water on exposed karst landforms because the runoff yield module is saturated indicating runoff generation under saturated conditions which is applicable to the calculation of rainfall runoff processes in buried wet karst areas therefore the runoff generation module in the karst liuxihe model was improved by adding an excess infiltration runoff module to simulate the surface runoff from excess rainfall water on exposed karst landforms in addition the parameter optimization algorithm of the model was improved in this study thereby improving the convergence efficiency of the algorithm 3 2 improving the runoff yield module to describe the process of excess infiltration runoff on exposed karst landforms in the study area the runoff yield module was improved by adding the module of excess infiltration runoff in the karst liuxihe model to enable the model to identify and characterize the water movement in spatially anisotropic karst water bearing media the entire subsurface of the karst basin was divided into a series of karst hydrological response units khrus ren 2006 li et al 2021 in the model and the runoff at the outlet section of the basin was finally summarized by calculating the runoff in each unit the improvement in the runoff yield module was mainly reflected in the optimization of the algorithm for runoff generation the rainfall falling on the exposed karst landform units first meets the water shortage in the vadose zone but if the rainfall intensity is greater than the infiltration capacity or if the soil is already saturated it may produce excess infiltration runoff on the exposed landforms the excess infiltration runoff in the karst liuxihe model can be described as follows chen 2018 1 p r t p i t e p l w max a r si p i f i p i f max r si 0 p i f max f max α f c f β f s where pr t and pi t are the

sectional area of the river channel m2 r si is the excess infiltration runoff in the model mm f max is the infiltration capacity which is changed in different karst landform units α and β are the parameters of the holtan model and f s is the stable depth of soil water infiltration mm the water volume of karst underground rivers in the study area mainly originates from rainfall infiltration recharge and water exchange between surface rivers and karst aquifers the rainfall infiltration water supply is an important source of water in the epikarst zone where the water bearing media are highly heterogeneous and water movement can be divided into rapid flow in large karst conduits and slow flow in small karst fissures williams 2008 the confluence of these areas of rapid flow and slow flow can be calculated as follows 2 q t ijk b ijk δ h δ l r i c j t t slow r a p i d t t slow n r ρ g r i c j l k 12 v t t rapid k ij e f ij h ij e f ij z ij f ij where q t ijk is the flow confluence

calibration when building a hydrologic model in karst basins it is necessary to obtain some key initial hydrogeological parameters in advance and then optimize the parameters of the model on this basis table 1 lists the initial hydrogeological parameters which include the initial rainfall infiltration coefficients and the parameters of the epikarst zone in the karst liuxihe model an improved particle swarm optimization ipso algorithm was used for model calibration to stimulate the activity of each particle in the algorithm and improve its global convergence efficiency ten artificial chaotic perturbations were added to the ipso algorithm and improved chaotic particle swarm optimization icpso was proposed in this study the inverse mapping equation of the chaotic variable is defined as follows 4 x ij x min x max x min z ij z ij 1 α z α z ij where xij is the optimal variable of the model parameter x max x min is the difference between the maximum and minimum variables zij is the chaotic variable before adding disturbance and z ij is the variable after adding disturbance α is the variable determined based on the adaptive algorithm and z is a chaotic variable when the optimal particle is mapped to the interval 0 1 3 4 uncertainty analysis and model evaluation uncertainty analysis of hydrologic models is very important for evaluating model performance biondi et al 2010 in general the uncertainty of hydrologic models originates from the uncertainty of the input data model structure and parameters krzysztofowicz and kelly 2000 krzysztofowicz 2014 in this study the input data for the karst liuxihe model such as the rainfall and flow data were preprocessed to reduce the uncertainty of the model input among them the preprocessed approach for rainfall data is derived from previous studies beven and binley 2006 li et al 2019 this study evaluated the impact of water exchange on surface flood simulation results at different watershed scales to ensure that other modelling conditions did not affect the uncertainty of the simulation results therefore the conditions such as the dem soil and land use data and the spatial and temporal resolutions of the model were kept consistent in the modelling except for the watershed area which varied the uncertainty of the model structure was reduced by improving the runoff generation algorithm equation 1 parameter uncertainty analysis mainly refers to parameter sensitivity analysis in this study this analysis can identify the sensitive and nonsensitive parameters of the model so that the nonsensitive parameters need not be optimized during parameter optimization which greatly improves the efficiency of the model calculation bogner and pappenberger 2011 the parameter sensitivity analysis method is a multiparameter sensitivity analysis mpsa algorithm choi et al 1999 which is improved based on the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue method for the specific steps of parameter sensitivity analysis refer to previous research results li et al 2019 a multiple objective function composed of the nash sutcliffe coefficient and the water balance coefficient 50 weighting each is employed to evaluate the model performance which can comprehensively reflect the simulated effects of flood peak discharge and total flood volume li et al 2021 in addition the correlation coefficient process relative error peak flow error and peak flow time error hours are used to verify the simulation effects the multiple objective function is calculated as follows 5 mof 0 5 n s c 0 5 w b c n s c 1 i 1 n q i q i 2 i 1 n q i q 2 w b c i 1 n q i i 1 n q i i 1 n q i where mof is the value of the multiple objective function nsc is the nash sutcliffe coefficient qi and qi are the observation and simulation flood peak discharge respectively l s 1 q is the average observation peak discharge l s 1 n is the number of simulations and wbc is the water balance coefficient the multiple objective function can also reflect the influence of model parameters on the simulation results the threshold value of the mof was set to 0 85 and if the mof exceeded 0 85 the simulation result was acceptable otherwise it was an unacceptable simulation the degree of separation ds between acceptable and unacceptable values indicated the sensitivity of the parameters here ds 1 mof and the greater the ds value is the greater the degree of separation and the more sensitive this parameter is 3 5 model setting and running model settings for the karst liuxihe model refer to the set of initial conditions before the model is run for the three karst basins of xijiang liujiang and beijiang the setting conditions of the model should be consistent including the same spatial and temporal resolutions of the model for which the spatial resolution was 200 m 200 m and the time step of flood simulations was 1 h model settings and running in this study mainly included the following aspects 1 the value range of the initial parameters of the model were set according to the attributes of each parameter and for the karst liuxihe model in this study the initial parameter range was set to 0 5 2 5 2 the range of the initial soil moisture was set to 0 to 100 of the saturation moisture content the initial soil moisture before each flooding event was calculated according to several runs of the model and the trial results were corrected according to the measured soil moisture data in the watershed of course for continuous floods with time series the soil moisture content at the end of one flood was the soil moisture in the early stage of the next flood 3 the dynamics of karst underground rivers including the water level and flow process were monitored in real time by river gauges at the outlet of the underground rivers present in the study area the river base flow was determined according to the multiyear average dry season runoff 4 the necessary modelling hydrogeological parameters were obtained such as the thickness of the epikarst zone the dynamics of karst groundwater and the permeability coefficient by means of watershed surveys tracer tests or infiltration tests in the basin 5 the karst subwatershed and karst hydrological response units khrus were delineated in the model and rainfall and flow data as well as the dem land use and soil type data were input into the model 6 model calibration and flood simulation were performed the icpso algorithm was proposed in this study to optimize the model parameters fifteen hourly flood processes were simulated to validate the model performance then the uncertainty of the simulation results was analysed in detail 4 results 4 1 results of the parametric sensitivity analysis the parametric sensitivity analysis of the hydrologic model can be used to determine the parameters that have a greater impact on the simulation results that is the sensitive parameters conversely those that have little impact are nonsensitive parameters in this way we can calibrate the karst liuxihe model by varying these sensitive parameters and ignoring the nonsensitive ones during parameter optimization which greatly reduces the computational workload and improves the convergence efficiency of the model the values of the mof equation 5 indicate the influence of model parameters on the simulation results the threshold value of the mof 0 85 was used to determine whether a simulation result was acceptable or not and the degree of separation ds between acceptable and unacceptable values indicated the sensitivity of the parameters table 2 lists the calculation results for the ds value and the greater the ds value is the more sensitive the parameter is the parameter sensitivity analysis showed that the parameters related to permeability and rock porosity were highly sensitive those related to soil water content were sensitive those related to river channel attributes were moderately sensitive and those related to evapotranspiration were not sensitive in this study the highly sensitive sensitive and moderately sensitive parameters were the sensitive parameters of the model the sensitivity order of each parameter in the model is described as follows saturation permeability coefficient macro void volume ratio specific yield saturated water content field capacity soil layer thickness soil coefficient channel roughness infiltration coefficient bottom slope bottom width evaporation coefficient therefore the nonsensitive parameter the evaporation coefficient does not require optimization 4 2 results of parametric optimization to evaluate the impact of only basin scales on the simulation results it is necessary to keep the other model factors of the three basins consistent therefore the three basins share an optimal parameter set with the xijiang karst river basin because the liujiang basin and beijiang basin are subbasins of the xijiang basin and the parameter optimization results of the xijiang river are also theoretically applicable to its subbasins fifteen hourly surface flood processes from 2008 to 2016 in each basin were collected for flood simulations in this study among them 60 of the initial continuous flow process was used for model calibration and the remaining flow process was used for model validation improved chaotic particle swarm optimization icpso was proposed to optimize the model parameters and the evolutionary process of the objective function value in parametric optimization is described as follows from the results in fig 3 the evolutionary process of the objective function values for these three basins was basically consistent where the parametric objective function converged after approximately 40 iterations for the xijiang basin after approximately 30 iterations for the liujiang basin and at 20 iterations for the beijiang basin the number of iteration calculations of the three watersheds was small and acceptable showing that the convergence of parameters was fast and the icpso for parametric optimization in this study was effective the global optimal set of parameters derived from the parameter preferences was treated as the final set of parameters for the three basins and used for flood simulation validation 4 3 flood simulations in the three basins fifteen surface flood processes in the three basins were collected to verify the flood simulation effects at different watershed scales each flood process was simulated twice the simulation effects when the water exchange between the surface river and karst aquifer was considered and the simulations when the water was exchanged were not considered these values were compared to quantitatively evaluate the impact of this water exchange on the simulation results at different watershed scales to verify the effect of water exchange on the simulation results in different hydrological years these fifteen flood processes were derived from different hydrological year series which were divided into five floods each in wet years normal years and dry years the flood simulation results of the three basins were given in the order of the basin areas from largest to smallest fig 4 shows these flood simulation effects in the xijiang basin from the surface flood simulation results in fig 4 the simulated flood effects in wet normal and dry years were basically consistent with the observed values regardless of whether the water exchange between the surface river and karst aquifer was considered such fitting degrees were satisfactory which also indicated that whether water exchange was considered had little effect on the simulation results to quantitatively estimate the impact of the water exchange between the surface river and karst aquifer on the simulation results at the scale of the xijiang river basin 353 100 km2 six evaluation indexes including the nash sutcliffe coefficient water balance coefficient correlation coefficient process relative error peak flow error and peak flow time error hours were adopted to evaluate the model performance table 3 lists these evaluation indexes of flood simulations all six evaluation indexes of surface flood simulations in table 3 in different hydrological years were satisfactory when the water exchange between the surface river and karst aquifer was considered in the model we the average process relative error was 16 and the peak flow error was 10 which can reflect the deviation from simulations and observations and these errors are acceptable in practical flood forecasting the standard of error required by local flood control authorities is less than 20 the evaluation indexes of we and nwe the water exchange between the surface river and karst aquifer was not considered in the model which means the flow estimated in equation 3 was blocked in the flood simulations in table 3 were roughly similar and the former results were slightly better than the latter for instance the average nash sutcliffe coefficient of we was 0 92 and it was 0 91 for nwe the average correlation coefficient of we was 0 92 and it was 0 90 for nwe the average process relative error of we was 16 and it was 18 for nwe the average peak flow error of we was 10 and it was 12 for nwe the average water balance coefficient of we was 0 93 and it was 0 92 for nwe and the average peak flow time error of we was 1 h and it was 2 h for nwe which indicated that whether the water exchange was considered had little effect on the simulation results this result was consistent with the flood simulation results in fig 4 for the liujiang basin fifteen surface flood processes were simulated to verify whether the water exchange between the surface river and karst aquifer would affect the simulation results fig 5 shows the flood simulation effects from the surface flood simulation results in fig 5 the simulated flood processes were close to the observed values especially when the water exchange between the surface river and karst aquifer was considered we in the model the simulation results of wet years normal years and dry years were strongly consistent with the observed results which was reflected in the fact that both the simulated peak flow and the whole flood process were very close to the observations however if the water exchange between the surface river and karst aquifer was not considered nwe there was a certain deviation between the simulated surface flood results and the observed values and the simulation effects of nwe were worse than those of we from fig 5 the simulated surface flood peak flows of nwe in wet years were larger than the observed values while the situation was reversed in dry years the simulated peak flows of nwe in normal years agreed with the observed results but the simulated flood processes were larger than the observed values in addition the simulated peak flows of nwe in wet years appeared earlier than the observed peak flows fig 5a b while they appeared later in dry years fig 5e f to further compare the flood simulation effects of we and nwe six evaluation indexes are shown in table 4 from the results in table 4 all six surface flood simulation evaluation indexes were good especially the we indexes which are described as follows the average nash sutcliffe coefficient correlation coefficient process relative error peak flow error water balance coefficient and peak flow time error hours were 0 92 0 91 15 11 0 95 and 1 h respectively and these values were 0 87 0 88 22 18 0 92 and 5 h respectively for nwe the indexes of we were better than those of nwe indicating that the simulated surface flood results of we were better this conclusion was consistent with the results in fig 5 from table 4 these six simulation evaluation indexes of we were best in wet years followed by normal years and they were worst in dry years indicating that the karst liuxihe model works well in surface flood simulations in wet years in addition the simulated flows of nwe were larger than the observed flows in wet years and normal years water balance coefficient 1 and the opposite was true in dry years table 4 the simulated peak flows of nwe in wet years appeared earlier peak flow time error hours 5 0 while they appeared later in dry years peak flow time error hours 6 0 these flood simulation evaluation indexes further confirmed the flood simulation effects in fig 5 for the smallest basin the beijiang basin fifteen surface flood processes were also simulated based on we and nwe fig 6 shows the flood simulation effects fig 6 shows that the simulated surface flood results based on we and nwe differed greatly when the water exchange between the surface river and karst aquifer was considered the simulated flood effects based on we agreed with the observed effects in wet normal and dry years however if water exchange was not considered in the model the simulated floods based on nwe were poor and greatly different from the observed values in wet years the simulated peak flows of nwe were much larger than those of the observed values and the simulated flood peaks appeared much earlier while the results of the simulated peak flow values and time were reversed in dry years in normal years the simulated peak flows of nwe were slightly larger than those of the observed values table 5 lists the six evaluation indexes of surface flood simulations based on we and nwe in the beijiang basin as shown in table 5 compared with the evaluation indexes of surface flood simulations based on we those based on nwe were much worse the average nash sutcliffe coefficient correlation coefficient process relative error peak flow error water balance coefficient and peak flow time error hours based on we were 0 95 0 94 13 9 0 94 and 2 h respectively and for nwe they were 0 78 0 83 26 22 0 92 and 10 h respectively indicating that the simulated surface flood effects of we were far superior to those of nwe in addition the simulated flood peaks of nwe were severely overestimated and appeared early in wet years and these results were reversed in dry years 5 discussion 5 1 discussion of the flood simulation effects the surface flood simulation results in figs 4 to 6 and tables 3 to 5 were satisfactory in particular the simulated flood peak discharges were very accurate and the simulated flood process error was within the acceptable range the forecast error of flooding in the region is required to be less than 20 from the results in table 6 the six evaluation indexes of flood simulations for these basins we were excellent in particular the nash certainty coefficient and correlation coefficient were more than 0 9 which is difficult to achieve in actual flood simulation and forecasting these reasonable surface flood simulation results showed that the improvement of the karst liuxihe model in this study was effective implying that the improvements of the runoff yield module and parameter optimization algorithm were feasible to further evaluate the effects of the improved karst liuxihe model on flood simulations table 6 lists the observed average flows flood peak discharge flood volume and peak flow time compared with the simulations the surface flood simulation results in table 6 show that the improved karst liuxihe model had good effects on the quantitative simulation of flood processes in the three karst basins as reflected by the similarity between the simulated average flows and the observed values in particular the simulated flood peak discharges had an excellent fit with the observed discharges and the simulation errors of flood peak discharge and flood volume met the error threshold required by local flood forecasts no more than 20 in addition the simulated peak flood occurrence times were close to the measured situations in general the flood simulations by the improved karst liuxihe model were satisfactory in these three selected basins implying that the improvement in the model in this study was feasible 5 2 assessing the impact of water exchange on flood simulation results the surface flood simulations based on we and nwe in the three basins showed different results as shown in figs 4 to 6 and tables 4 to 5 in the modelling and flood simulation all variables such as the dem and model parameters were kept constant except for the change in watershed area so that the effect of the change in watershed scale on the flood simulation results could be effectively evaluated table 7 lists the average values of the evaluation indexes in these three basins table 7 the average values of the evaluation indexes in flood simulations from the results in table 7 all six evaluation indexes of surface flood simulations based on we were better than those based on nwe for which the indexes of the former were far better than those of the latter in the beijiang basin while they were slightly better in the xijiang basin and the results for the liujiang basin were in the middle notably the average water balance coefficients of we and nwe in the beijiang basin did not look very different in fact the simulated water balance coefficients of we were much better than those of the new model this finding was only because the simulated values in wet years were greater than 1 while the results in dry years were less than 1 and the difference was not reflected after taking the average value table 7 shows that the water exchange between the surface river and karst aquifer with and without consideration had the greatest impact on the simulation results in the beijiang basin followed by the liujiang basin and the least impact was in the xijiang basin which means that for different basin scales the order of the influence of this water exchange on the simulation results was beijiang liujiang xijiang basins therefore for the large xijiang karst basin 350 000 km2 whether water exchange is considered in the model has little influence on the surface flood simulation and forecasting results suggesting that there is little hydrological difference between karst and nonkarst hydrology in the xijiang basin while it is very different in the small beijiang karst basin 1 700 km2 in the future this water exchange between surface rivers and karst aquifers can be ignored in flood forecasting of xijiang karst areas and treated the same as that in nonkarst areas which can greatly reduce modelling difficulty and improve forecast accuracy however surface flood simulation and forecasting in the small beijiang karst basin must consider this water exchange 5 3 effect of watershed scale on flood simulations in this study the influence of water exchange between surface rivers and karst aquifers on surface flood simulation results at different watershed scales table 6 could reflect the influence of watershed scale change on flood simulation and forecasting in karst basins according to the simulated flood results in these three basins the size of the karst watershed had a great influence on the karst flood simulations especially for small karst basin areas such as the beijiang basin however for a large xijiang karst river basin this water exchange has little effect on the surface flood simulation results the benefit of ignoring the water exchange between surface rivers and karst aquifers when surface flood forecasts in large karst basins are reflected in two ways first it lowers the hydrologic modelling data requirements considering that it is extremely difficult to obtain the spatially anisotropic development characteristics of karst subsurface fissure and conduit systems and complex hydrogeological data in karst areas it is easier to build a hydrologic model similar to that of nonkarst models if the water exchange between surface rivers and karst aquifers can be ignored indicating that the calculation of karst underground hydrological processes is not needed i e modelling data related to karst characteristics are not needed second this approach improves model computational efficiency to a large extent without significantly degrading model performance and flood forecasting accuracy 5 4 comparison of flood simulations in different flood years to evaluate the effects of water exchange at different watershed scales on the surface flood simulation results in different flood years the flood processes during wet years normal years and dry years in these three basins were simulated by the karst liuxihe model table 8 shows the six evaluation indexes of flood simulations in different flood years from the results in table 8 all evaluation indexes of surface flood simulations based on we were better than those based on nwe and this result was most pronounced in the smallest basin the beijiang river basin the difference between the simulation effects based on we and nwe decreased as the watershed area increased for the largest basin the xijiang basin there was little difference between the two simulation effects from the results in wet years in table 8 the simulated water balance coefficients of nwe were greater than those of we the results of the beijiang and liujiang basins were even greater than 1 and the simulated surface flood processes and peak flows were overestimated fig 5a b and fig 6a b compared to the observed values however the situation was reversed in dry years the simulated peak flow time error hours based on nwe in wet years was positive but it was negative in dry years which means that the simulated flood peak discharge appeared earlier in wet years and later in dry years the model is not ineffective the simulation results are consistent with the real situation of the basins in wet years abundant rainfall during the flood season leads to a surge in the flow of surface rivers due to water pressure some of the water from the surface river is replenished to the karst underground river system through the connected karst underground conduits if the water exchange relationship between the surface river and karst aquifer was not considered in the model nwe the simulated floods of the surface river were relatively larger and simulated peak flows appeared earlier than those of the observed values in dry years the overall rainfall was low and the flow of the surface river was small additionally under the condition of water pressure part of the karst groundwater will be replenished to the surface river through the connected underground conduits if water exchange is not considered nwe making the simulated surface floods lower and causing the simulated flood peak discharge to appear later than the observed peak the simulated surface flood results of normal years were between those of wet and dry years 5 5 uncertainty analysis it is necessary to perform uncertainty analyses on the simulation results of hydrologic models which is an important means to evaluate model performance the uncertainty of model input model structure and parameters results in the uncertainty of flood simulation and prediction krzysztofowicz 2014 5 5 1 uncertainty analysis of the model input data the input data of the karst liuxihe model including mainly rainfall runoff data dem land use and soil type data were preprocessed to reduce uncertainty for instance the rainfall and flow data were reviewed for reliability consistency and representativeness before being imported into the model wunsch et al 2022 for which the abrupt changes and unreasonable data were eliminated from the rainfall flow process line to ensure data reliability in a comparison with the data of adjacent gauges and the long series of historical data of this gauge the data of obviously unreasonable gauges were eliminated to ensure consistency the different flood years including the flood processes during wet years normal years and dry years in these three basins were collected which demonstrated that the selected flow data are representative and can cover the flow process during any hydrological year in the basin the high resolution dem data were also manually calibrated mainly through watershed surveys to determine the negative karst topography such as sinkholes and karst skylights then these real depressions were kept in the model filling calculation and only the false depressions caused by the error of dem data were filled if this factor is ignored in hydrologic modelling in karst areas it will lead to incorrect calculation results li et al 2021 to evaluate the influence of different watershed scales on the simulation results the same initial conditions such as initial soil water content were maintained in the three basins xijiang liujiang and beijiang karst basins during the model setting process because these three basins have a hierarchical relationship the consistency of these attribute data will not bring uncertainty to the simulation results 5 5 2 uncertainty analysis of the model structure the structure of the karst liuxihe model is relatively simple including only surface and underground double layer structures the surface structure controls the calculation of surface runoff generation and confluence while the underground structure completes the calculation of underground runoff confluence in the basin mainly referring to karst groundwater confluence both the surface and underground structures of the model contain two layers the vegetation cover and soil layer are in the surface structure and the epikarst zone and the deep karst water bearing system form the underground structure such a simple model structure is relatively rare in distributed models other commonly used distributed groundwater models usually have a more complex structure and require a large amount of hydrogeological data for modelling in karst areas martha et al 2021 in contrast the karst liuxihe model in this study requires fewer modelling data in karst flood simulations and the uncertainty due to the model structure is low in addition the structure of the karst liuxihe model is improved in this study and the mode of the excess infiltration runoff was added based on the storage mode mainly reflected in the optimization of the algorithm for runoff generation equation 1 which can reduce the uncertainty of the model structure 5 5 3 uncertainty analysis of the model parameters the uncertainty of model parameters will bring great uncertainty to the simulation results krzysztofowicz and kelly 2000 and the selection of suitable parameter optimization and sensitivity analysis methods can reduce the uncertainty of model parameters to a certain extent in this study improved chaotic particle swarm optimization icpso was proposed to calibrate the model parameters and a multiparameter sensitivity analysis mpsa algorithm choi et al 1999 was used for parameter sensitivity analysis the icpso greatly increased the calculation efficiency of model parameters even for a large river basin such as the xijiang basin the model only needed 40 iterations to converge indicating that the icpso method for parametric optimization was effective the results of the parameter sensitivity analysis table 2 showed that the saturation permeability coefficient macrocrack volume ratio and specific yield parameters were highly sensitive these parameters are related to permeability and rock porosity indicating that the spatial structure and properties of water bearing media in karst areas have a great influence on the generation and confluence of the rainfall runoff process and thereby affect the final flood simulation results these model parameters are related to hydrogeological conditions demonstrating that the hydrogeological characteristics of karst areas are the key factors affecting the effectiveness of hydrologic model flood simulation these results are consistent with the conclusions obtained by previous work on hydrologic model modelling and flood simulation forecasting in karst areas ford and williams 2007 lamoreaux and lamoreaux 2007 vesper 2013 the parameters related to soil water content were sensitive for instance the initial soil moisture will have a great impact on the flood rising process not only affecting the flood peak flow but also affecting the time of the flood peak if the soil has been fully saturated before the flood the flood peak discharge will appear quickly the parameters related to evapotranspiration were not sensitive indicating that the amount of evapotranspiration in a flood is relatively small and has little influence on flood simulation results in the parameter sensitivity analysis we focused on whether the parameters related to the karst characteristics of the three watersheds had a serious impact on the simulation results fig 7 shows the parameter sensitivity results of these three basins in fig 7 the larger the sensitivity value of the parameter is the more sensitive the parameter is and the more influence it has on the simulation results the order of parameter sensitivity of the three basins was consistent with the calculated results in table 2 from the results of fig 7 for the xijiang basin the sensitivity of all parameters was low the most sensitive parameters related to karst characteristics including the saturation permeability coefficient spc macrocrack volume ratio mcvr and specific yield sy had sensitivity values less than 0 4 indicating that these parameters related to karst characteristics had little influence on the surface flood simulation results and that karst characteristics can be ignored in the xijiang basin this finding suggests that there is little difference between karst and nonkarst hydrology in the xijiang karst basin for the beijiang basin the parameters related to karst characteristics were highly sensitive the sensitivity values of the spc mcvr and sy parameters exceeded 0 85 which had a great influence on the surface flood simulation results the parameter sensitivity of the liujiang basin was between those of the xijiang and beijiang basins this result indicated that for the beijiang and liujiang karst basins model parameters related to karst characteristics had a greater impact on model performance and the karst characteristics within the basin need to be considered in modelling by ignoring the difference great uncertainty in the surface flood simulations and forecasts will result 6 conclusions it is a great challenge to accurately depict the water exchange between surface rivers and karst aquifers in surface flood simulations of changing watersheds this study improved the distributed karst liuxihe model to simulate surface floods in three different karst watersheds and evaluated the effects of water exchange on simulated flood results the following conclusions were obtained based on the results of this study 1 parametric sensitivity analysis showed that the parameters related to permeability and rock porosity were highly sensitive such as the saturation permeability coefficient macrocrack volume ratio and specific yield which greatly influenced the flood simulation results while the evaporation coefficient parameter was not sensitive which represents a tiny fraction of the water in a flood the nonsensitive parameter does not need to be optimized in model calibration and by ignoring it we can improve the convergence efficiency of the model 2 the objective function of the improved chaotic particle swarm optimization algorithm icpso converged after only 40 iterations even when it was used for parameter optimization in a large karst basin such as the xijiang basin 353 100 km2 which showed that the algorithm was efficient and the improvement of the algorithm in this study was feasible 3 in the largest basin the xijiang karst basin the simulated surface flood effects in wet normal and dry years were basically consistent with the observed values regardless of whether the water exchange between the surface river and karst aquifer was considered in the model indicating that whether the water exchange is considered has little effect on the simulation results in the xijiang basin in the smallest basin the beijiang basin when water exchange we was considered the simulated surface flood effects agreed with the observed effects in wet normal and dry years however if the water exchange was not considered nwe the simulated floods were poor and greatly different from the observed values the simulated peak flows in wet years were much larger than those of the observed values and the simulated flood peaks appeared much earlier while the results of the simulated peak flow values and time were reversed in dry years 4 there was limited influence of the water exchange between the surface river and karst aquifer on the surface flood simulation results for the xijiang basin therefore this water exchange can be ignored in the future when modelling and flood forecasting in the xijiang karst basin which will greatly reduce the modelling cost without greatly impacting the model performance however the water exchange has a great influence on the surface flood simulation results in the beijiang and liujiang basins and the karst basin therefore it is necessary to perform more calculations of this water exchange during modelling otherwise the surface flood forecasting results will exhibit great uncertainty the contribution of this paper is mainly reflected in two aspects first the karst liuxihe is effectively improved in this study as reflected by the improvement in the runoff generation and confluence algorithms in the model for which the runoff yield module in the model was improved to accurately characterize the process of excess infiltration runoff on exposed karst landforms in the study area the good flood simulation results showed that the improvement of the karst liuxihe model was feasible and effective in addition compared with the traditional karst groundwater numerical models the improved karst liuxihe model has a lower data requirement for modelling applications in karst areas due to its simple two layer model structure after improvement second a quantitative assessment of the impact of water exchange between surface rivers and karst aquifers on surface flood simulations and forecasts in the xijiang karst basin can provide technical support for flood prevention and mitigation in the region in a follow up study we will further analyse the threshold value of the watershed area that affects karst surface flood simulation and forecasting by comparing multiple watershed scales e g 70 000 km2 100 000 km2 150 000 km2 200 000 km2 and 300 000 km2 to determine when the watershed area of the karst area reaches the critical value and whether the water exchange between the surface river and karst aquifer affects the simulation results of surface floods declaration of competing interest the

1769,the complex subsurface conditions and spatial anisotropy of water bearing media in karst basins result in much more variable runoff generation and confluence processes and water circulation than those in nonkarst basins therefore accurate flood forecasting is more difficult in karst areas and it is challenging to accurately quantify the water exchange relationship between surface rivers and karst aquifers to provide key technical support for accurate flood forecasts in karst basins this study improved a distributed physical hydrologic model the karst liuxihe model by improving the runoff generation and confluence algorithms and the parameter optimization algorithm to simulate surface floods in three different karst watersheds in southern china additionally in the model calculations this study focused on the influence of water exchange on surface flood simulations in changing watersheds the results showed that for the largest basin xijiang basin 353 100 km2 considering or not considering the water exchange between the surface river and karst aquifer had little effect on the surface flood simulation results however this water exchange had a great effect on the surface simulations for the smallest basin the beijiang basin 1 700 km2 for instance the simulated average peak flow showed a 29 difference and the total amount of flooding showed a 25 difference between dry years and normal years therefore when forecasting surface floods in small karst areas the water exchange relationship between surface rivers and karst aquifers must be considered the results showed that the impact of groundwater on surface rivers can be disregarded when forecasting surface floods in the large xijiang karst basin and can be treated directly as surface flood forecasting in nonkarst areas the application of this strategy will greatly simplify the cost of hydrologic modelling in the xijiang basin by improving the karst liuxihe model the accuracy of its flood simulation and general applicability in karst basins were greatly enhanced the improvement in the karst hydrological model in this study provides a good tool for flood simulation and forecasting in the karst regions of southwest china keywords flood simulation and forecasting water exchange karst liuxihe model karst basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction karst areas are widely distributed across southwest china li et al 2019 especially in the xijiang river basin the study area selected in this paper where subsurface karst fissures and conduit systems are strongly developed the main water supply source in the underground river system is rainfall infiltration water and the discharge process of the underground river outlet is very responsive to rainfall in recent years the frequent occurrence of extreme rainfall events worldwide has resulted in many karst areas experiencing severe floods causing extensive losses of lives and property vesper 2013 darras et al 2015 mesnil et al 2021 therefore it is important to develop simulation tools that can predict flooding in karst areas ambroise et al 1996 janža 2010 iacobellis et al 2015 renard and bertrand 2017 hydrologic models may provide critical technical support for regional flood management and damage assessment ravbar and kovacic 2009 hosseini et al 2014 bitri et al 2014 apollonio et al 2018 in general hydrological forecasting in karst basins is much more difficult than that in nonkarst basins knöll et al 2020 the subsurface conditions runoff generation and confluence processes in karst areas are more complex and spatially variable darras et al 2015 sadat and bazvand 2021 for instance the spatial structure of aquifers in karst areas is usually anisotropic ford and williams 2007 lamoreaux and lamoreaux 2007 in particular the structure of water bearing media fissures and conduit systems in karst basins is very different from that in nonkarst basins resulting in great spatiotemporal differences in the hydrological characteristics between karst and nonkarst areas žugaj and ranko 1996 wu et al 2017 wang et al 2019 many scholars have carried out targeted studies accordingly and have assessed the exact factors that influence runoff generation and confluence processes in karst basins castellarin et al 2001 assessed the impact of measurement and modelling methods on flood frequency analysis the results showed that similarity measures based on seasonality indexes were effective for estimating extreme flow quantiles however this study focused mainly on evaluating the impact of the time scale change on the runoff forecast and lacked an evaluation of the spatial change impact ebrahimian et al 2017 discussed the impacts of climate and human activities on regional flood forecasting in malaysia and quantitatively estimated the possible hydrological consequences of potential land use and climate changes on the hydrological regime the conclusions of this study only apply to the local fixed study area and do not explore the impact of catchment scale changes on hydrological processes lian et al 2020 adopted three independent quantitative methods to distinguish the relative contributions of climate change and human activity in a mesoscale karst basin and identified the spatial variability in the hydrological response to climate change and ecological restoration however the analytical results of this study are only applicable to mesoscale karst basins and not large karst basins such as the xijiang river the above studies focus mainly on the impact of climate or land use changes on hydrological processes in the region but quantitative assessments of hydrological processes and the water cycle in karst areas and their impacts on spatial scale changes in the watershed are lacking considering that the subsurface conditions and hydrogeological characteristics of karst areas are complex and variable it is unclear how the hydrological processes in karst areas especially subsurface hydrological processes respond quantitatively to spatial scale differences among basins therefore this study focuses on the impact of the water exchange between surface rivers and karst aquifers on the surface flood simulation results obtained by using a distributed hydrologic model in basins at various scales this water exchange is a very common phenomenon in karst basins and can change dramatically with the seasons in general during the flood season the surface river water mainly replenishes the karst aquifer while during the dry season the opposite is true as the water conserved in the karst aquifer in turn replenishes the water shortage in the surface river this water exchange is very important for flood forecasting in the region and if this part of the water cycle is neglected in the model calculation it may lead to water imbalance in the model and bring great uncertainty to the forecast results thus this study quantitatively simulates and evaluates the impact of this water exchange on flood forecasting one of the objectives of this study to quantitatively simulate and forecast karst floods accurately in practice it is crucial to select a suitable hydrologic model liu et al 2005 darras et al 2015 current hydrologic models especially distributed hydrologic models have been widely used in karst areas and have achieved good results kraller et al 2014 renard and bertrand 2017 however the commonly used distributed groundwater models have multiple complex structures and various parameters which require a massive amount of hydrogeological data for modelling in karst areas li et al 2020 for instance the modflow cfp model requires detailed distribution information on karst underground conduits martha et al 2021 and borehole pumping tests may also be necessary to fully understand groundwater dynamics to address the challenge of the large demand for modelling data in karst basins the karst liuxihe model developed based on the liuxihe model chen 2009 2018 was employed to simulate surface floods in this study the storage mode was used in the karst liuxihe model to describe the runoff generation of subsurface karst groundwater considering that there are some exposed karst landforms in the study area a certain excess surface runoff remaining after infiltration may be generated on these geomorphic units and this runoff is also an important part of flood water therefore this study improved the runoff generation and confluence algorithms in the karst liuxihe model and the module of excess infiltration runoff was added to the model to calculate the excess infiltration surface runoff on the exposed karst landforms by improving the structure and algorithm of the karst liuxihe model this study aims to improve the accuracy of the model reduce the data demand for modelling in karst areas and make it generally applicable to hydrological forecasting of karst areas in southwest china the second objective of this study there are great differences in karst development in different basins which may affect the evaluation of the water exchange between surface aquifers and aquifers in surface flood simulations at the watershed scale to avoid this problem the three research areas selected in this study have a subordinate relationship and they all belong to the same xijiang karst basin including the xijiang basin itself and its first level tributary the liujiang karst basin and the first level tributary of the liujiang basin the beijiang karst basin the flood simulation effects at the outlets of the three basins were compared to evaluate the impact of catchment scale changes on flood forecasting the main purpose here is to explore whether the water exchange between the surface aquifer and karst aquifer at different watershed scales has a serious impact on the simulation results if the impact is not serious the improved karst liuxihe model can ignore this water exchange interaction when simulating and forecasting surface floods in karst watersheds which can greatly simplify the cost of modelling in karst basins in addition the theoretical improvement of the hydrologic model and the application of flood simulations in this study provide a feasible scheme for hydrological predictions in karst regions 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the study area is the xijiang karst watershed in southern china which is located at 102 14 114 50 e and 21 31 26 49 n the xijiang river is the main stream of the pearl river basin with a total length of 2 075 km an average annual runoff depth of 651 37 mm and an average gradient of 0 58 luo et al 2010 it is the longest river in the pearl river system and the third largest river in china behind only the yangtze and yellow rivers in length the catchment area of the xijiang watershed is 353 100 km2 which accounts for 75 6 of the entire pearl river basin the xijiang river originates from maxiong mountain in qujing city of yunnan province and flows through yunnan guizhou guangxi and guangdong provinces from west to east the main tributaries of the xijiang river are the nanpanjiang beipan jiang hongshui river liujiang yujiang hegui river and qianxun river the research areas in this study were the entire xijiang karst watershed the liujiang the tributary of xijiang karst watershed and the beijiang the tributary of liujiang karst watershed fig 1 shows the drainage maps of these three watersheds 2 2 hydrometeorology and geology the climate of the xijiang basin is a tropical and subtropical monsoon climate influenced by both the low latitude easterly wind belt and the middle and high latitude westerly belt the annual average temperature is 14 to 22 c and the multiyear average precipitation is 1629 mm chen et al 2020 in summer the southeast and southwest monsoons prevail with high temperature and humidity and frequent typhoon invasion resulting in frequent and strong rainstorms the rainfall season in the basin is long but the distribution of rainfall within the year is extremely uneven precipitation is concentrated mainly in the flood season from april to september which generally accounts for approximately 70 to 80 of the annual precipitation the dry season october to march has less precipitation approximately 300 to 350 mm accounting for only 20 to 30 of the annual precipitation wang et al 2009 the liujiang river is the second largest tributary of the xijiang river system with a total length of 1121 km and a basin area of 58 270 km2 the topography of the basin is high in the north and northwest and low in the south and southeast the middle and upper reaches of the basin are mostly alpine canyons accounting for approximately 47 of the basin area the beijiang river is a tributary of the liujiang river with a length of 130 km and a watershed area of 1773 km2 the geographical characteristics of the beijiang river basin are mainly mountainous hills with an average elevation of 603 m and a maximum elevation of 2 081 m the beijiang river basin is the famous rainstorm centre area in the xijiang river basin where the annual average rainfall is more than 1800 mm the maximum 12 hour rainfall is 644 19 mm the maximum 24 hour rainfall is 779 1 mm and the maximum 3 day rainfall is 1335 15 mm luo et al 2010 the river network in the basin is dense and the river slope is very large thus the river level at the basin outlet rises and falls violently and responds very quickly to rainfall the three basins in this study have a subordinate relationship the beijiang river is a tributary of the liujiang river where its flood is the main source of the liujiang river flood and the liujiang river is a tributary of the xijiang river and is an important component of the xijiang river floods therefore the flooding process in the three basins has a sequential order i e a flooding process first converges with the liujiang basin through the outlet of the beijiang basin then converges with the main stream of the xijiang river through the outlet of the liujiang basin and finally converges with the wuzhou river gauge fig 1b through the outlet of the xijiang basin the topography of the xijiang basin is generally high in the north low in the south high in the west and low in the east there are three types of landforms in the basin mountains hills and plains which mainly consist of three macroscopic units the yunnan guizhou plateau the guangxi basin and the pearl river delta plain among them the guangxi basin is the main geomorphic unit of the basin the main stream of the xijiang river and its larger tributaries began to develop after the yanshan movement in the cretaceous period approximately 100 million years ago and the himalayan movement in the tertiary period 30 million years ago forced the uplift of the yunnan guizhou plateau resulting in large topographic relief in the upper reaches of the xijiang river in the north and south pan rivers the hongshui river and the liujiang river basin and consequently many typical canyons and landscapes rapidly formed fig 2 shows the three dimensional topographic distribution of the xijiang river basin the xijiang karst basin is the main distribution area of karst in south china the general geomorphology of the basin is mainly karst geomorphology peak forest plain and peak cluster depression the xijiang river is in a karst valley basin which is covered by quaternary loose deposits controlled by the sweeping action of the xijiang river and the karst geological background the surface is dominated by the quaternary river alluvial layer and karst dissolution residual accumulation with a thickness of approximately 10 to 20 m continuous carbonate rocks sandstone shale and carbonate interclastic rocks are widely distributed in the basin where the area of carbonate rocks is 18 36 104 km2 accounting for 55 7 of the total area which is mainly distributed on the southwest side of the basin fig 1a the distribution area of clastic rocks combined with carbonate rocks is 52 965 km2 accounting for 15 of the total area the outcrops in the basin mainly include upper devonian limestone d3 lower carboniferous datang formation limestone c1d c1d3 middle carboniferous limestone c2d and upper carboniferous limestone c3 upper permian carbonate rocks with clastic rocks p2d p2h

by the sandstone shale rock group carbonate rock group and carbonate rock with clastic rock group the western part is mainly carbonate rock formation and the lithology is mainly limestone the northeast is mostly hard sandstone with shale and the southeast is mostly polycarbonate rocks the central and southern parts of the karst plain are characterized by the overburden lithology of clay and gravel which is weakly permeable the underlying bedrock is mostly carbonate rocks mainly dolomite with extremely developed karst fissures and a large amount of water enrichment in fissures in the karst caves he 2017 various typical karst landforms such as collapse dolines sinkholes caves karst windows and underground river systems developed due to the long term weathering of rock and erosion effects of groundwater the karst area is approximately 175 000 km2 accounting for 53 1 of the total area of the xijiang basin chen et al 2020 karst is widely developed in the northern basin forming underground rivers and karst springs are densely distributed in the middle and lower reaches of the basin a total of 38 underground rivers have been identified in du an yao autonomous county in the liujiang river basin and there are a total of 99 tributaries which ultimately flow into the main stream of the xijiang surface river system and are discharged through the wuzhou river gauge fig 1b at the basin outlet the liujiang karst basin is in the middle of the xijiang river basin where karst is highly developed fig 1a and the distribution area of soluble carbonate rocks accounts for 84 6 of the total basin area the northern part of the basin is an east west arc shaped fold area with soluble rocks as synclines and sand shale as anticlines in the western section sand shale is less exposed and karst valleys are mainly arranged along the strike the western area is a large area of continuous limestone distribution mainly peak tuft valleys the eastern part of the basin is a hilly area with alternating soft and hard rocks due to different erosion resistances the hard rocks form low mountains with gentle slopes in the direction and steep slopes behind the central part of the basin is dominated by a solitary peak plain and a peak forest plain 2 3 modelling data the modelling data for the karst liuxihe model are mainly rainfall and flow data as well as high resolution digital elevation model dem data land use data and soil type data among these data rainfall data are telemetered by setting up rain gauges with full coverage in the basin including 248 68 and 8 rain gauges fig 1b c and d in the xijiang basin liujiang basin and beijiang basin respectively these rain gauges cover the entire watershed area evenly so the rainfall observations obtained can reflect the actual rainfall in the basin the flow data in this study are mainly derived from the flood data of surface rivers and the outlet discharge of karst underground rivers and hourly flood processes from 2008 to 2016 at the basin outlet were collected in each of the three basins to refine the flood process simulation effect in different hydrological years we divided the time series of these flood processes into wet years normal years and dry years in this study a year with an average peak flood discharge greater than 40 000 m3 s was a wet year in the xijiang basin it was 20 000 m3 s in the liujiang basin and 4 000 m3 s in the beijiang basin a year with an average peak flood lower than 10 000 m3 s was a dry year in the xijiang basin it was 4 000 m3 s in the liujiang basin and 1 000 m3 s in the beijiang basin a year with an average peak flood between these values was a normal year in these three basins the dem land use and soil type data are the basic property modelling data for a hydrologic model these property data can be downloaded at no cost from online databases and the download link is provided at the end of the article the original spatial resolution of the dem was 90 m 90 m and the resolution for both the land use and soil type data was 1000 m 1000 m these values were resampled at 200 m 200 m in the karst liuxihe model according to the previous research results of the effects of model resolution on its performance chen et al 2017 notably dem data in karst areas need to be preprocessed for the original data before modelling which mainly involves the classification of negative landforms such as sinkholes and other depressions in karst areas through basin surveys then these real depressions are kept when filling and only the false depressions caused by the dem data errors are filled when modelling some hydrogeological data such as the flow direction of the underground rivers and the distribution of karst conduits were obtained through tracer tests in the study area the results of the tracer test showed that the karst conduit system is well developed in the aquifers and some of these large conduits form underground river systems the volume of underground rivers mainly comes from rainfall infiltration recharge and water exchange between surface rivers and karst aquifers the flow process at the outlet of the underground river responds very quickly to rainfall and the outflow will rise approximately 12 h after a rainstorm heavy rainfall of more than 50 mm in 24 h the flow rate of the underground river is approximately 2 92 m s 1 during the flood season of the year and 0 46 m s 1 in the dry season 3 methodology 3 1 karst liuxihe model chen 2009 proposed a distributed hydrologic model i e the liuxihe model for flood simulation and forecasting in nonkarst regions to make this model suitable for karst areas li et al 2019 2021 improved the model structure and parameters to develop the karst liuxihe model and this model has been successfully applied in several karst basins compared with other commonly distributed hydrologic models which typically have a complex distributed structure and more parameters the karst liuxihe model has only a two layer structure and few parameters li et al 2021 making it easier to model karst areas the two layer structure includes the surface structure and underground structure where the surface structures include the vegetation cover and soil layer in the model and the underground structure is divided into the epikarst zone the shallow karst water bearing system under the soil layer includes fissures and conduit systems and the deep karst water bearing system includes the rock stratum and the underground river system the surface structure of the model controls the generation and confluence process of surface water in the area mainly calculating evapotranspiration depression filling surface runoff generation and confluence while the underground structure completes the process of underground runoff confluence output including the calculation of infiltration underground river confluence etc in addition this model can simulate the floods of both surface rivers and karst underground rivers li et al 2021 2022 notably the karst liuxihe model may not be suitable for the calculation of surface runoff from excess rainfall water on exposed karst landforms because the runoff yield module is saturated indicating runoff generation under saturated conditions which is applicable to the calculation of rainfall runoff processes in buried wet karst areas therefore the runoff generation module in the karst liuxihe model was improved by adding an excess infiltration runoff module to simulate the surface runoff from excess rainfall water on exposed karst landforms in addition the parameter optimization algorithm of the model was improved in this study thereby improving the convergence efficiency of the algorithm 3 2 improving the runoff yield module to describe the process of excess infiltration runoff on exposed karst landforms in the study area the runoff yield module was improved by adding the module of excess infiltration runoff in the karst liuxihe model to enable the model to identify and characterize the water movement in spatially anisotropic karst water bearing media the entire subsurface of the karst basin was divided into a series of karst hydrological response units khrus ren 2006 li et al 2021 in the model and the runoff at the outlet section of the basin was finally summarized by calculating the runoff in each unit the improvement in the runoff yield module was mainly reflected in the optimization of the algorithm for runoff generation the rainfall falling on the exposed karst landform units first meets the water shortage in the vadose zone but if the rainfall intensity is greater than the infiltration capacity or if the soil is already saturated it may produce excess infiltration runoff on the exposed landforms the excess infiltration runoff in the karst liuxihe model can be described as follows chen 2018 1 p r t p i t e p l w max a r si p i f i p i f max r si 0 p i f max f max α f c f β f s where pr t and pi t are the

sectional area of the river channel m2 r si is the excess infiltration runoff in the model mm f max is the infiltration capacity which is changed in different karst landform units α and β are the parameters of the holtan model and f s is the stable depth of soil water infiltration mm the water volume of karst underground rivers in the study area mainly originates from rainfall infiltration recharge and water exchange between surface rivers and karst aquifers the rainfall infiltration water supply is an important source of water in the epikarst zone where the water bearing media are highly heterogeneous and water movement can be divided into rapid flow in large karst conduits and slow flow in small karst fissures williams 2008 the confluence of these areas of rapid flow and slow flow can be calculated as follows 2 q t ijk b ijk δ h δ l r i c j t t slow r a p i d t t slow n r ρ g r i c j l k 12 v t t rapid k ij e f ij h ij e f ij z ij f ij where q t ijk is the flow confluence

calibration when building a hydrologic model in karst basins it is necessary to obtain some key initial hydrogeological parameters in advance and then optimize the parameters of the model on this basis table 1 lists the initial hydrogeological parameters which include the initial rainfall infiltration coefficients and the parameters of the epikarst zone in the karst liuxihe model an improved particle swarm optimization ipso algorithm was used for model calibration to stimulate the activity of each particle in the algorithm and improve its global convergence efficiency ten artificial chaotic perturbations were added to the ipso algorithm and improved chaotic particle swarm optimization icpso was proposed in this study the inverse mapping equation of the chaotic variable is defined as follows 4 x ij x min x max x min z ij z ij 1 α z α z ij where xij is the optimal variable of the model parameter x max x min is the difference between the maximum and minimum variables zij is the chaotic variable before adding disturbance and z ij is the variable after adding disturbance α is the variable determined based on the adaptive algorithm and z is a chaotic variable when the optimal particle is mapped to the interval 0 1 3 4 uncertainty analysis and model evaluation uncertainty analysis of hydrologic models is very important for evaluating model performance biondi et al 2010 in general the uncertainty of hydrologic models originates from the uncertainty of the input data model structure and parameters krzysztofowicz and kelly 2000 krzysztofowicz 2014 in this study the input data for the karst liuxihe model such as the rainfall and flow data were preprocessed to reduce the uncertainty of the model input among them the preprocessed approach for rainfall data is derived from previous studies beven and binley 2006 li et al 2019 this study evaluated the impact of water exchange on surface flood simulation results at different watershed scales to ensure that other modelling conditions did not affect the uncertainty of the simulation results therefore the conditions such as the dem soil and land use data and the spatial and temporal resolutions of the model were kept consistent in the modelling except for the watershed area which varied the uncertainty of the model structure was reduced by improving the runoff generation algorithm equation 1 parameter uncertainty analysis mainly refers to parameter sensitivity analysis in this study this analysis can identify the sensitive and nonsensitive parameters of the model so that the nonsensitive parameters need not be optimized during parameter optimization which greatly improves the efficiency of the model calculation bogner and pappenberger 2011 the parameter sensitivity analysis method is a multiparameter sensitivity analysis mpsa algorithm choi et al 1999 which is improved based on the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue method for the specific steps of parameter sensitivity analysis refer to previous research results li et al 2019 a multiple objective function composed of the nash sutcliffe coefficient and the water balance coefficient 50 weighting each is employed to evaluate the model performance which can comprehensively reflect the simulated effects of flood peak discharge and total flood volume li et al 2021 in addition the correlation coefficient process relative error peak flow error and peak flow time error hours are used to verify the simulation effects the multiple objective function is calculated as follows 5 mof 0 5 n s c 0 5 w b c n s c 1 i 1 n q i q i 2 i 1 n q i q 2 w b c i 1 n q i i 1 n q i i 1 n q i where mof is the value of the multiple objective function nsc is the nash sutcliffe coefficient qi and qi are the observation and simulation flood peak discharge respectively l s 1 q is the average observation peak discharge l s 1 n is the number of simulations and wbc is the water balance coefficient the multiple objective function can also reflect the influence of model parameters on the simulation results the threshold value of the mof was set to 0 85 and if the mof exceeded 0 85 the simulation result was acceptable otherwise it was an unacceptable simulation the degree of separation ds between acceptable and unacceptable values indicated the sensitivity of the parameters here ds 1 mof and the greater the ds value is the greater the degree of separation and the more sensitive this parameter is 3 5 model setting and running model settings for the karst liuxihe model refer to the set of initial conditions before the model is run for the three karst basins of xijiang liujiang and beijiang the setting conditions of the model should be consistent including the same spatial and temporal resolutions of the model for which the spatial resolution was 200 m 200 m and the time step of flood simulations was 1 h model settings and running in this study mainly included the following aspects 1 the value range of the initial parameters of the model were set according to the attributes of each parameter and for the karst liuxihe model in this study the initial parameter range was set to 0 5 2 5 2 the range of the initial soil moisture was set to 0 to 100 of the saturation moisture content the initial soil moisture before each flooding event was calculated according to several runs of the model and the trial results were corrected according to the measured soil moisture data in the watershed of course for continuous floods with time series the soil moisture content at the end of one flood was the soil moisture in the early stage of the next flood 3 the dynamics of karst underground rivers including the water level and flow process were monitored in real time by river gauges at the outlet of the underground rivers present in the study area the river base flow was determined according to the multiyear average dry season runoff 4 the necessary modelling hydrogeological parameters were obtained such as the thickness of the epikarst zone the dynamics of karst groundwater and the permeability coefficient by means of watershed surveys tracer tests or infiltration tests in the basin 5 the karst subwatershed and karst hydrological response units khrus were delineated in the model and rainfall and flow data as well as the dem land use and soil type data were input into the model 6 model calibration and flood simulation were performed the icpso algorithm was proposed in this study to optimize the model parameters fifteen hourly flood processes were simulated to validate the model performance then the uncertainty of the simulation results was analysed in detail 4 results 4 1 results of the parametric sensitivity analysis the parametric sensitivity analysis of the hydrologic model can be used to determine the parameters that have a greater impact on the simulation results that is the sensitive parameters conversely those that have little impact are nonsensitive parameters in this way we can calibrate the karst liuxihe model by varying these sensitive parameters and ignoring the nonsensitive ones during parameter optimization which greatly reduces the computational workload and improves the convergence efficiency of the model the values of the mof equation 5 indicate the influence of model parameters on the simulation results the threshold value of the mof 0 85 was used to determine whether a simulation result was acceptable or not and the degree of separation ds between acceptable and unacceptable values indicated the sensitivity of the parameters table 2 lists the calculation results for the ds value and the greater the ds value is the more sensitive the parameter is the parameter sensitivity analysis showed that the parameters related to permeability and rock porosity were highly sensitive those related to soil water content were sensitive those related to river channel attributes were moderately sensitive and those related to evapotranspiration were not sensitive in this study the highly sensitive sensitive and moderately sensitive parameters were the sensitive parameters of the model the sensitivity order of each parameter in the model is described as follows saturation permeability coefficient macro void volume ratio specific yield saturated water content field capacity soil layer thickness soil coefficient channel roughness infiltration coefficient bottom slope bottom width evaporation coefficient therefore the nonsensitive parameter the evaporation coefficient does not require optimization 4 2 results of parametric optimization to evaluate the impact of only basin scales on the simulation results it is necessary to keep the other model factors of the three basins consistent therefore the three basins share an optimal parameter set with the xijiang karst river basin because the liujiang basin and beijiang basin are subbasins of the xijiang basin and the parameter optimization results of the xijiang river are also theoretically applicable to its subbasins fifteen hourly surface flood processes from 2008 to 2016 in each basin were collected for flood simulations in this study among them 60 of the initial continuous flow process was used for model calibration and the remaining flow process was used for model validation improved chaotic particle swarm optimization icpso was proposed to optimize the model parameters and the evolutionary process of the objective function value in parametric optimization is described as follows from the results in fig 3 the evolutionary process of the objective function values for these three basins was basically consistent where the parametric objective function converged after approximately 40 iterations for the xijiang basin after approximately 30 iterations for the liujiang basin and at 20 iterations for the beijiang basin the number of iteration calculations of the three watersheds was small and acceptable showing that the convergence of parameters was fast and the icpso for parametric optimization in this study was effective the global optimal set of parameters derived from the parameter preferences was treated as the final set of parameters for the three basins and used for flood simulation validation 4 3 flood simulations in the three basins fifteen surface flood processes in the three basins were collected to verify the flood simulation effects at different watershed scales each flood process was simulated twice the simulation effects when the water exchange between the surface river and karst aquifer was considered and the simulations when the water was exchanged were not considered these values were compared to quantitatively evaluate the impact of this water exchange on the simulation results at different watershed scales to verify the effect of water exchange on the simulation results in different hydrological years these fifteen flood processes were derived from different hydrological year series which were divided into five floods each in wet years normal years and dry years the flood simulation results of the three basins were given in the order of the basin areas from largest to smallest fig 4 shows these flood simulation effects in the xijiang basin from the surface flood simulation results in fig 4 the simulated flood effects in wet normal and dry years were basically consistent with the observed values regardless of whether the water exchange between the surface river and karst aquifer was considered such fitting degrees were satisfactory which also indicated that whether water exchange was considered had little effect on the simulation results to quantitatively estimate the impact of the water exchange between the surface river and karst aquifer on the simulation results at the scale of the xijiang river basin 353 100 km2 six evaluation indexes including the nash sutcliffe coefficient water balance coefficient correlation coefficient process relative error peak flow error and peak flow time error hours were adopted to evaluate the model performance table 3 lists these evaluation indexes of flood simulations all six evaluation indexes of surface flood simulations in table 3 in different hydrological years were satisfactory when the water exchange between the surface river and karst aquifer was considered in the model we the average process relative error was 16 and the peak flow error was 10 which can reflect the deviation from simulations and observations and these errors are acceptable in practical flood forecasting the standard of error required by local flood control authorities is less than 20 the evaluation indexes of we and nwe the water exchange between the surface river and karst aquifer was not considered in the model which means the flow estimated in equation 3 was blocked in the flood simulations in table 3 were roughly similar and the former results were slightly better than the latter for instance the average nash sutcliffe coefficient of we was 0 92 and it was 0 91 for nwe the average correlation coefficient of we was 0 92 and it was 0 90 for nwe the average process relative error of we was 16 and it was 18 for nwe the average peak flow error of we was 10 and it was 12 for nwe the average water balance coefficient of we was 0 93 and it was 0 92 for nwe and the average peak flow time error of we was 1 h and it was 2 h for nwe which indicated that whether the water exchange was considered had little effect on the simulation results this result was consistent with the flood simulation results in fig 4 for the liujiang basin fifteen surface flood processes were simulated to verify whether the water exchange between the surface river and karst aquifer would affect the simulation results fig 5 shows the flood simulation effects from the surface flood simulation results in fig 5 the simulated flood processes were close to the observed values especially when the water exchange between the surface river and karst aquifer was considered we in the model the simulation results of wet years normal years and dry years were strongly consistent with the observed results which was reflected in the fact that both the simulated peak flow and the whole flood process were very close to the observations however if the water exchange between the surface river and karst aquifer was not considered nwe there was a certain deviation between the simulated surface flood results and the observed values and the simulation effects of nwe were worse than those of we from fig 5 the simulated surface flood peak flows of nwe in wet years were larger than the observed values while the situation was reversed in dry years the simulated peak flows of nwe in normal years agreed with the observed results but the simulated flood processes were larger than the observed values in addition the simulated peak flows of nwe in wet years appeared earlier than the observed peak flows fig 5a b while they appeared later in dry years fig 5e f to further compare the flood simulation effects of we and nwe six evaluation indexes are shown in table 4 from the results in table 4 all six surface flood simulation evaluation indexes were good especially the we indexes which are described as follows the average nash sutcliffe coefficient correlation coefficient process relative error peak flow error water balance coefficient and peak flow time error hours were 0 92 0 91 15 11 0 95 and 1 h respectively and these values were 0 87 0 88 22 18 0 92 and 5 h respectively for nwe the indexes of we were better than those of nwe indicating that the simulated surface flood results of we were better this conclusion was consistent with the results in fig 5 from table 4 these six simulation evaluation indexes of we were best in wet years followed by normal years and they were worst in dry years indicating that the karst liuxihe model works well in surface flood simulations in wet years in addition the simulated flows of nwe were larger than the observed flows in wet years and normal years water balance coefficient 1 and the opposite was true in dry years table 4 the simulated peak flows of nwe in wet years appeared earlier peak flow time error hours 5 0 while they appeared later in dry years peak flow time error hours 6 0 these flood simulation evaluation indexes further confirmed the flood simulation effects in fig 5 for the smallest basin the beijiang basin fifteen surface flood processes were also simulated based on we and nwe fig 6 shows the flood simulation effects fig 6 shows that the simulated surface flood results based on we and nwe differed greatly when the water exchange between the surface river and karst aquifer was considered the simulated flood effects based on we agreed with the observed effects in wet normal and dry years however if water exchange was not considered in the model the simulated floods based on nwe were poor and greatly different from the observed values in wet years the simulated peak flows of nwe were much larger than those of the observed values and the simulated flood peaks appeared much earlier while the results of the simulated peak flow values and time were reversed in dry years in normal years the simulated peak flows of nwe were slightly larger than those of the observed values table 5 lists the six evaluation indexes of surface flood simulations based on we and nwe in the beijiang basin as shown in table 5 compared with the evaluation indexes of surface flood simulations based on we those based on nwe were much worse the average nash sutcliffe coefficient correlation coefficient process relative error peak flow error water balance coefficient and peak flow time error hours based on we were 0 95 0 94 13 9 0 94 and 2 h respectively and for nwe they were 0 78 0 83 26 22 0 92 and 10 h respectively indicating that the simulated surface flood effects of we were far superior to those of nwe in addition the simulated flood peaks of nwe were severely overestimated and appeared early in wet years and these results were reversed in dry years 5 discussion 5 1 discussion of the flood simulation effects the surface flood simulation results in figs 4 to 6 and tables 3 to 5 were satisfactory in particular the simulated flood peak discharges were very accurate and the simulated flood process error was within the acceptable range the forecast error of flooding in the region is required to be less than 20 from the results in table 6 the six evaluation indexes of flood simulations for these basins we were excellent in particular the nash certainty coefficient and correlation coefficient were more than 0 9 which is difficult to achieve in actual flood simulation and forecasting these reasonable surface flood simulation results showed that the improvement of the karst liuxihe model in this study was effective implying that the improvements of the runoff yield module and parameter optimization algorithm were feasible to further evaluate the effects of the improved karst liuxihe model on flood simulations table 6 lists the observed average flows flood peak discharge flood volume and peak flow time compared with the simulations the surface flood simulation results in table 6 show that the improved karst liuxihe model had good effects on the quantitative simulation of flood processes in the three karst basins as reflected by the similarity between the simulated average flows and the observed values in particular the simulated flood peak discharges had an excellent fit with the observed discharges and the simulation errors of flood peak discharge and flood volume met the error threshold required by local flood forecasts no more than 20 in addition the simulated peak flood occurrence times were close to the measured situations in general the flood simulations by the improved karst liuxihe model were satisfactory in these three selected basins implying that the improvement in the model in this study was feasible 5 2 assessing the impact of water exchange on flood simulation results the surface flood simulations based on we and nwe in the three basins showed different results as shown in figs 4 to 6 and tables 4 to 5 in the modelling and flood simulation all variables such as the dem and model parameters were kept constant except for the change in watershed area so that the effect of the change in watershed scale on the flood simulation results could be effectively evaluated table 7 lists the average values of the evaluation indexes in these three basins table 7 the average values of the evaluation indexes in flood simulations from the results in table 7 all six evaluation indexes of surface flood simulations based on we were better than those based on nwe for which the indexes of the former were far better than those of the latter in the beijiang basin while they were slightly better in the xijiang basin and the results for the liujiang basin were in the middle notably the average water balance coefficients of we and nwe in the beijiang basin did not look very different in fact the simulated water balance coefficients of we were much better than those of the new model this finding was only because the simulated values in wet years were greater than 1 while the results in dry years were less than 1 and the difference was not reflected after taking the average value table 7 shows that the water exchange between the surface river and karst aquifer with and without consideration had the greatest impact on the simulation results in the beijiang basin followed by the liujiang basin and the least impact was in the xijiang basin which means that for different basin scales the order of the influence of this water exchange on the simulation results was beijiang liujiang xijiang basins therefore for the large xijiang karst basin 350 000 km2 whether water exchange is considered in the model has little influence on the surface flood simulation and forecasting results suggesting that there is little hydrological difference between karst and nonkarst hydrology in the xijiang basin while it is very different in the small beijiang karst basin 1 700 km2 in the future this water exchange between surface rivers and karst aquifers can be ignored in flood forecasting of xijiang karst areas and treated the same as that in nonkarst areas which can greatly reduce modelling difficulty and improve forecast accuracy however surface flood simulation and forecasting in the small beijiang karst basin must consider this water exchange 5 3 effect of watershed scale on flood simulations in this study the influence of water exchange between surface rivers and karst aquifers on surface flood simulation results at different watershed scales table 6 could reflect the influence of watershed scale change on flood simulation and forecasting in karst basins according to the simulated flood results in these three basins the size of the karst watershed had a great influence on the karst flood simulations especially for small karst basin areas such as the beijiang basin however for a large xijiang karst river basin this water exchange has little effect on the surface flood simulation results the benefit of ignoring the water exchange between surface rivers and karst aquifers when surface flood forecasts in large karst basins are reflected in two ways first it lowers the hydrologic modelling data requirements considering that it is extremely difficult to obtain the spatially anisotropic development characteristics of karst subsurface fissure and conduit systems and complex hydrogeological data in karst areas it is easier to build a hydrologic model similar to that of nonkarst models if the water exchange between surface rivers and karst aquifers can be ignored indicating that the calculation of karst underground hydrological processes is not needed i e modelling data related to karst characteristics are not needed second this approach improves model computational efficiency to a large extent without significantly degrading model performance and flood forecasting accuracy 5 4 comparison of flood simulations in different flood years to evaluate the effects of water exchange at different watershed scales on the surface flood simulation results in different flood years the flood processes during wet years normal years and dry years in these three basins were simulated by the karst liuxihe model table 8 shows the six evaluation indexes of flood simulations in different flood years from the results in table 8 all evaluation indexes of surface flood simulations based on we were better than those based on nwe and this result was most pronounced in the smallest basin the beijiang river basin the difference between the simulation effects based on we and nwe decreased as the watershed area increased for the largest basin the xijiang basin there was little difference between the two simulation effects from the results in wet years in table 8 the simulated water balance coefficients of nwe were greater than those of we the results of the beijiang and liujiang basins were even greater than 1 and the simulated surface flood processes and peak flows were overestimated fig 5a b and fig 6a b compared to the observed values however the situation was reversed in dry years the simulated peak flow time error hours based on nwe in wet years was positive but it was negative in dry years which means that the simulated flood peak discharge appeared earlier in wet years and later in dry years the model is not ineffective the simulation results are consistent with the real situation of the basins in wet years abundant rainfall during the flood season leads to a surge in the flow of surface rivers due to water pressure some of the water from the surface river is replenished to the karst underground river system through the connected karst underground conduits if the water exchange relationship between the surface river and karst aquifer was not considered in the model nwe the simulated floods of the surface river were relatively larger and simulated peak flows appeared earlier than those of the observed values in dry years the overall rainfall was low and the flow of the surface river was small additionally under the condition of water pressure part of the karst groundwater will be replenished to the surface river through the connected underground conduits if water exchange is not considered nwe making the simulated surface floods lower and causing the simulated flood peak discharge to appear later than the observed peak the simulated surface flood results of normal years were between those of wet and dry years 5 5 uncertainty analysis it is necessary to perform uncertainty analyses on the simulation results of hydrologic models which is an important means to evaluate model performance the uncertainty of model input model structure and parameters results in the uncertainty of flood simulation and prediction krzysztofowicz 2014 5 5 1 uncertainty analysis of the model input data the input data of the karst liuxihe model including mainly rainfall runoff data dem land use and soil type data were preprocessed to reduce uncertainty for instance the rainfall and flow data were reviewed for reliability consistency and representativeness before being imported into the model wunsch et al 2022 for which the abrupt changes and unreasonable data were eliminated from the rainfall flow process line to ensure data reliability in a comparison with the data of adjacent gauges and the long series of historical data of this gauge the data of obviously unreasonable gauges were eliminated to ensure consistency the different flood years including the flood processes during wet years normal years and dry years in these three basins were collected which demonstrated that the selected flow data are representative and can cover the flow process during any hydrological year in the basin the high resolution dem data were also manually calibrated mainly through watershed surveys to determine the negative karst topography such as sinkholes and karst skylights then these real depressions were kept in the model filling calculation and only the false depressions caused by the error of dem data were filled if this factor is ignored in hydrologic modelling in karst areas it will lead to incorrect calculation results li et al 2021 to evaluate the influence of different watershed scales on the simulation results the same initial conditions such as initial soil water content were maintained in the three basins xijiang liujiang and beijiang karst basins during the model setting process because these three basins have a hierarchical relationship the consistency of these attribute data will not bring uncertainty to the simulation results 5 5 2 uncertainty analysis of the model structure the structure of the karst liuxihe model is relatively simple including only surface and underground double layer structures the surface structure controls the calculation of surface runoff generation and confluence while the underground structure completes the calculation of underground runoff confluence in the basin mainly referring to karst groundwater confluence both the surface and underground structures of the model contain two layers the vegetation cover and soil layer are in the surface structure and the epikarst zone and the deep karst water bearing system form the underground structure such a simple model structure is relatively rare in distributed models other commonly used distributed groundwater models usually have a more complex structure and require a large amount of hydrogeological data for modelling in karst areas martha et al 2021 in contrast the karst liuxihe model in this study requires fewer modelling data in karst flood simulations and the uncertainty due to the model structure is low in addition the structure of the karst liuxihe model is improved in this study and the mode of the excess infiltration runoff was added based on the storage mode mainly reflected in the optimization of the algorithm for runoff generation equation 1 which can reduce the uncertainty of the model structure 5 5 3 uncertainty analysis of the model parameters the uncertainty of model parameters will bring great uncertainty to the simulation results krzysztofowicz and kelly 2000 and the selection of suitable parameter optimization and sensitivity analysis methods can reduce the uncertainty of model parameters to a certain extent in this study improved chaotic particle swarm optimization icpso was proposed to calibrate the model parameters and a multiparameter sensitivity analysis mpsa algorithm choi et al 1999 was used for parameter sensitivity analysis the icpso greatly increased the calculation efficiency of model parameters even for a large river basin such as the xijiang basin the model only needed 40 iterations to converge indicating that the icpso method for parametric optimization was effective the results of the parameter sensitivity analysis table 2 showed that the saturation permeability coefficient macrocrack volume ratio and specific yield parameters were highly sensitive these parameters are related to permeability and rock porosity indicating that the spatial structure and properties of water bearing media in karst areas have a great influence on the generation and confluence of the rainfall runoff process and thereby affect the final flood simulation results these model parameters are related to hydrogeological conditions demonstrating that the hydrogeological characteristics of karst areas are the key factors affecting the effectiveness of hydrologic model flood simulation these results are consistent with the conclusions obtained by previous work on hydrologic model modelling and flood simulation forecasting in karst areas ford and williams 2007 lamoreaux and lamoreaux 2007 vesper 2013 the parameters related to soil water content were sensitive for instance the initial soil moisture will have a great impact on the flood rising process not only affecting the flood peak flow but also affecting the time of the flood peak if the soil has been fully saturated before the flood the flood peak discharge will appear quickly the parameters related to evapotranspiration were not sensitive indicating that the amount of evapotranspiration in a flood is relatively small and has little influence on flood simulation results in the parameter sensitivity analysis we focused on whether the parameters related to the karst characteristics of the three watersheds had a serious impact on the simulation results fig 7 shows the parameter sensitivity results of these three basins in fig 7 the larger the sensitivity value of the parameter is the more sensitive the parameter is and the more influence it has on the simulation results the order of parameter sensitivity of the three basins was consistent with the calculated results in table 2 from the results of fig 7 for the xijiang basin the sensitivity of all parameters was low the most sensitive parameters related to karst characteristics including the saturation permeability coefficient spc macrocrack volume ratio mcvr and specific yield sy had sensitivity values less than 0 4 indicating that these parameters related to karst characteristics had little influence on the surface flood simulation results and that karst characteristics can be ignored in the xijiang basin this finding suggests that there is little difference between karst and nonkarst hydrology in the xijiang karst basin for the beijiang basin the parameters related to karst characteristics were highly sensitive the sensitivity values of the spc mcvr and sy parameters exceeded 0 85 which had a great influence on the surface flood simulation results the parameter sensitivity of the liujiang basin was between those of the xijiang and beijiang basins this result indicated that for the beijiang and liujiang karst basins model parameters related to karst characteristics had a greater impact on model performance and the karst characteristics within the basin need to be considered in modelling by ignoring the difference great uncertainty in the surface flood simulations and forecasts will result 6 conclusions it is a great challenge to accurately depict the water exchange between surface rivers and karst aquifers in surface flood simulations of changing watersheds this study improved the distributed karst liuxihe model to simulate surface floods in three different karst watersheds and evaluated the effects of water exchange on simulated flood results the following conclusions were obtained based on the results of this study 1 parametric sensitivity analysis showed that the parameters related to permeability and rock porosity were highly sensitive such as the saturation permeability coefficient macrocrack volume ratio and specific yield which greatly influenced the flood simulation results while the evaporation coefficient parameter was not sensitive which represents a tiny fraction of the water in a flood the nonsensitive parameter does not need to be optimized in model calibration and by ignoring it we can improve the convergence efficiency of the model 2 the objective function of the improved chaotic particle swarm optimization algorithm icpso converged after only 40 iterations even when it was used for parameter optimization in a large karst basin such as the xijiang basin 353 100 km2 which showed that the algorithm was efficient and the improvement of the algorithm in this study was feasible 3 in the largest basin the xijiang karst basin the simulated surface flood effects in wet normal and dry years were basically consistent with the observed values regardless of whether the water exchange between the surface river and karst aquifer was considered in the model indicating that whether the water exchange is considered has little effect on the simulation results in the xijiang basin in the smallest basin the beijiang basin when water exchange we was considered the simulated surface flood effects agreed with the observed effects in wet normal and dry years however if the water exchange was not considered nwe the simulated floods were poor and greatly different from the observed values the simulated peak flows in wet years were much larger than those of the observed values and the simulated flood peaks appeared much earlier while the results of the simulated peak flow values and time were reversed in dry years 4 there was limited influence of the water exchange between the surface river and karst aquifer on the surface flood simulation results for the xijiang basin therefore this water exchange can be ignored in the future when modelling and flood forecasting in the xijiang karst basin which will greatly reduce the modelling cost without greatly impacting the model performance however the water exchange has a great influence on the surface flood simulation results in the beijiang and liujiang basins and the karst basin therefore it is necessary to perform more calculations of this water exchange during modelling otherwise the surface flood forecasting results will exhibit great uncertainty the contribution of this paper is mainly reflected in two aspects first the karst liuxihe is effectively improved in this study as reflected by the improvement in the runoff generation and confluence algorithms in the model for which the runoff yield module in the model was improved to accurately characterize the process of excess infiltration runoff on exposed karst landforms in the study area the good flood simulation results showed that the improvement of the karst liuxihe model was feasible and effective in addition compared with the traditional karst groundwater numerical models the improved karst liuxihe model has a lower data requirement for modelling applications in karst areas due to its simple two layer model structure after improvement second a quantitative assessment of the impact of water exchange between surface rivers and karst aquifers on surface flood simulations and forecasts in the xijiang karst basin can provide technical support for flood prevention and mitigation in the region in a follow up study we will further analyse the threshold value of the watershed area that affects karst surface flood simulation and forecasting by comparing multiple watershed scales e g 70 000 km2 100 000 km2 150 000 km2 200 000 km2 and 300 000 km2 to determine when the watershed area of the karst area reaches the critical value and whether the water exchange between the surface river and karst aquifer affects the simulation results of surface floods declaration of competing interest the
