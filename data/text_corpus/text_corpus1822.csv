9110,precision agriculture is most effective in areas where significant in field variation occurs the palouse region of the pacific northwest in the us a vast area of undulating fertile farmland has relatively high in field variation in water retention and crop yield due to regional topography and uneven soil erosion the regional agricultural systems depend on the soil at or near field capacity towards the end of a wet spring to support crops throughout the summer drought period dryland agricultural systems and high in field variation and changing climate make water retention management practices throughout the region critical a finite element vadose zone transport model was developed and used to understand the benefits of the targeted application of biochar on water retention and water redistribution in a representative hillslope the model utilizes measured soil hydraulic properties to predict soil moisture distribution over the dry season a redwood sawdust and wheat straw biochar was amended at 4 and 7 concentrations by mass biochar amended soils showed an increase in water retention and apparent reduction in unsaturated hydraulic conductivity as the soil approached saturated conditions after two months of bare field evaporation the model showed that biochar impacts water redistribution in the soil profile contributing to positive and negative changes and a net increase in water retention model outputs with biochar showed increased retention in and around the amendment area although the magnitude between outputs varied with some samples showing minimal effectiveness despite the differences in magnitude with targeted biochar amendment these results indicate that biochar can change water redistribution up to 0 5 in a soil profile additionally the developed model shows promise as a field and regional level management tool to determine the best return on investment from biochar application when applied in a targeted manner keywords biochar soil moisture modeling groundwater precision agriculture data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction feeding a growing population and a changing climate are two significant problems that are imminent in the foreseeable future for generations overuse of resources and continued population growth has stressed global environmental systems creating a need for progressive sustainable solutions to these stressors zhang et al 2021 addressing the difficulties surrounding agriculture on a local and global level is an integral part of mitigating these issues directly increasing sustainable farming practices preserve land fertility for consistent crop development and reduces greenhouse gasses horrigan et al 2002 gan et al 2014 creating sustainable and efficient agricultural systems entails addressing the deficiencies in agriculture that are detrimental to local regional and global soil health and crop yields precision agriculture can aid in this pursuit the underlying objective of precision agriculture is site specific land management by matching the site specific needs in a field with resource inputs that respond to those needs investing in site specific management technologies is more logical when significant variation occurs within a single field due to topographic variation requiring multiple management strategies rabia et al 2022 suggested interdisciplinary research efforts to enhance the understanding and promote application of topographic information in precision agriculture the palouse area of the pacific northwest united states spans from southeastern washington to west central idaho and consists of over two million acres of rich agricultural land hall and walker 1999 hartmans and michalson 2000 the area is centered around latitude 46 8802 n and longitude 117 3643 w relying on stored soil water deep into the summer months like most dryland cropping environments the palouse consistently produces significant crop yields of chickpeas winter wheat spring wheat and canola stored soil water is key to dryland agriculture and the patterns of stored soil water are linked to the topography beven and kirkby 1979 wilson et al 2005 cropping sequences schlegel et al 2017 and tillage practices fuentes et al 2003 jin et al 2007 kühling et al 2017 throughout the year stored soil water will fluctuate spatially eagleson 1978 due to climatic changes brown et al 2021 vegetation eagleson 1978 topography burt and butcher 1985 and heterogeneous soil profiles sheets and hendrickx 1995 the palouse while fertile historically has some of the fastest eroding topsoil in the united states since this land was first cultivated about 100 years ago all of the original topsoil has been lost from about 10 of palouse cropland and one fourth to three fourths of the original topsoil has been lost from another 60 of cropland usda 1978 areas with less topsoil generally the tops and steeper hillslopes have low organic matter poor water retention and poor nutrient use cycling as a result of the shallow topsoil depth kaiser 1967 topsoil and soil organic matter loss impairs the soil s water holding capacity reduces the soil s natural fertility and requires increased use of fertilizers to maintain yields hartmans and michalson 2000 these soil characteristics are counterproductive for dryland agricultural systems a study in whitman county found an average annual erosion rate over 26 years of 0 7 tons of soil for each bushel of wheat raised and in some places the figure was as high as 2 3 tons of topsoil lost per bushel of wheat kaiser 1967 the complexities of farming in the palouse extend beyond erosion and degraded soils at the top of the hills argillic and fragipan horizons in north facing hillslopes lead to perched water tables in the winter months which drive rapid subsurface lateral flows and accelerates the eluviation of clays in albic esoil horizons brooks et al 2012 mcdaniel et al 2008 2001 the argillic fragipan layers reduce the storage capacity of the soil by restricting the already shallow topsoil and impacting crop yields the impermeable fragipan layers can be relatively shallow in the soil 0 65 m and along with the formation of perched water tables drive the hydrologic processes of these areas brooks et al 2004 topography based surface and subsurface lateral flow is an influential determinant of water movement and storage in the winter and spring months western et al 2002 zhu et al 2010 the topographical complexities erosion factors and complex surface subsurface hydrology culminate in significant variation in crop yields throughout the palouse the variability within palouse fields is high and combined with diverse management legacies and irregular weather patterns create heterogeneous growing conditions weddell et al 2017 crop yields of winter wheat can vary from 5 bushels acre to as high as 110 bushels acre in the same field o keeffe et al 2020 fig 1a displays a drone image of a typical field in the palouse showing significant variation in crop dryness due to lack of moisture along ridges fig 1b displays the erosion potential and top soil depth in a typical hillslope with variations in slope and direction the 1967 kaiser study of whitman county showed that wheat yield was directly affected by soil erosion and eroded soil on hilltops and steep slopes produced only 32 of the yields of non eroded soil kaiser 1967 data analysis performed by yang et al 1998 obtained from a wheat field in the palouse region confirmed a statistically significant correlation linking topographic attributes including elevation slope and aspect to effects on wheat yield which could explain 13 35 of the variability in wheat yield for the whole fields though 49 84 of the yield variability could be explained by topography in some regions within the five fields yang et al 1998 locations with steeper slopes and higher elevations had a negative impact on wheat yield varied in a typical field at a magnitude of over 20 fold confirming findings from the 1967 study yang et al 1998 changes in topography and soil properties will influence water distribution however these changes are site specific corwin and lesch 2005 2003 due to the inherent variability associated with palouse dryland crop production a one size fits all recommendation for management is of little value koenig 2005 the nature of the palouse and a greater understanding of the agriculture and hydrology around the region provides an opportunity for the use of precision agriculture techniques to deal with the complexities of farming in the palouse this study aims to provide support and information regarding the integration of biochar into precision agriculture as a method for soil restoration primarily through manipulation of water retention and redistribution in the palouse 1 1 biochar as a potential solution biochar is the carbon rich solid product from thermochemical conversion of biomass usually manure wood leaves and crop residues and is generally enclosed in an oxygen deprived environment intended for use as a soil amendment as a means of improving soil productivity and health lehmann and joseph 2009 hornung et al 2021 biochar has been shown to positively affect soil fertility and water retention characteristics in the soil aller et al 2017 dokoohaki et al 2017 jatav et al 2021 research by hudson 1994 showed a positive correlation between organic matter om and available water content awc for sand r2 0 79 silt loam r2 0 58 and silty clay loam r2 0 76 in all texture groups when om increased from 0 5 to 3 the available water content doubled hudson 1994 lehmann et al 2015 noted that organic matter contributes to soil fertility by retaining plant available water and nutrients or promoting the formation of soil structure lehmann and kleber 2015 a comprehensive meta analysis regarding the impacts of biochar application on plant growth conducted by jeffrey et al 2011 showed that amending soils with biochar largely helped the soil fertility and crop yields outweighing the neutral results and one negative result jeffery et al 2011 further this analysis showed an average positive effect of 10 on crop yield across soil types jeffery et al 2011 razzaghi et al 2020 performed a meta analysis of recent research involving biochar and its effects on soil properties this study demonstrated biochar on average decreased the soil bd by 9 field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp greatly increased for coarse textured soils by 51 and 47 respectively and moderately for medium textured soils by 13 increase and a 9 increase respectively the same study found that there was minimal effect on the fc of the soil for fine textured soil but pwp decreased by roughly 5 razzaghi et al 2020 despite the documented positive effects of the biochar amendment on soils the effectiveness of the amendment depends significantly upon the physiochemical characteristics of the biochar and the properties of the soil such as structure soil type nutrient concentration and particle size edeh and buss 2020 the physiochemical characteristics of biochar largely vary depending on the conditions of thermochemical conversion and the feedstock used for processing agegnehu et al 2017 bhogal et al 2009 chowdhury et al 2016 el naggar et al 2019 jeffery et al 2011 lehmann and kleber 2015 palansooriya et al 2019 the primary hypothesis of this work the evaluation of using biochar as a method for increasing soil water retention and redistribution is based upon the positive impacts observed from biochar amendments demonstrated in these previous studies understanding the pathways in which biochar amendment affects the soil is critical to understanding how biochar amendment may affect water retention and redistribution among the key soil properties altered by biochar additions are bulk density porosity including pore size and pore connectivity grain size distribution and soil surface chemistry basso et al 2013 masiello et al 2019b these changes manifest themselves as measurable shifts in soil hydrologic properties such as soil hydrologic conductivity k and the energy with which water is held in soil or matric potential masiello et al 2019b the matric potential and k for soils are further affected by a combination of soil water content density degree of saturation void ratio particle structure tortuosity soil texture and size shape and abundance of pores campbell et al 2021 chung et al 2018 whalley et al 2013 it is well documented that biochar affects a combination of both soil physical barnes et al 2014 biederman and harpole 2013 devereux et al 2013 and hydraulic properties devereux et al 2013 lim et al 2016 therefore it is appropriate to hypothesize similar changes to soil physical and hydraulic properties in the palouse region this prompts the need for measurement or estimation of the effects of biochar amendment on soil physical and hydraulic properties to effectively address the primary hypothesis of this work the research involving biochar amendment in the soil shows promise for integrating biochar into soil water management practices in the palouse currently biochar is cost prohibitive for uniform application across large areas of farmland shifting from a uniform application to a selective targeted application would allow the utilization of biochar in the region to precisely mitigate soil depth low organic matter and poor water retention characteristics that hinder soil productivity throughout the palouse this study aims to evaluate the integration of biochar into precision agriculture strategies in the palouse it focuses on the complexities of farming in the palouse to ascertain valuable information regarding the effectiveness of biochar use on water retention and local agriculture using numerical modeling and finite element analysis fea a matlab model was developed with the partial differential equation toolbox to simulate the redistribution of water throughout a hilly topography hydraulic properties of palouse silt loam soil with different biochar concentrations were measured to understand the effects of biochar on soil water retention characteristics the model utilizes laboratory measurements of soil hydraulic properties and meteorological data to simulate water redistribution over the dry summer months of the palouse this study aims to determine a the effectiveness of biochar integration into precision agriculture b the impact of biochar amendment on the soil hydraulic properties of a palouse silt loam soil through laboratory measurements c an assessment of biochar as a soil restoration technique in the palouse and d the effectiveness and validity of the developed model to simulate water redistribution and retention in a soil profile for this research a generic hillslope deemed representative of areas in the palouse was used no specific location was used however the inputs meteorological and soil properties used in this study represent the greater palouse region 2 materials and methods the method section is divided into vadose zone transport modeling and laboratory experimentation the laboratory experimentation provided data for the different soil sample properties throughout the entire soil moisture range while the vadose zone transport modeling provided the larger impact of biochar over a specified duration the model simulated the effects of biochar on water retention and redistribution on an hourly time step the developed model is a bare soil vadose zone transport model that is open strictly to evaporation off the soil s surface and percolation out of the bottom of the geometry the model developed throughout this work is the preliminary baseline development that could eventually be expanded to more complex applications the initial model would simulate a small catchment in a watershed and more specifically it would simulate one small hillslope in a catchment the use of finite element analysis fea is important because it provides flexibility and scalability that is desired for larger watershed applications hourly changes to soil water is simulated in two dimensions laterally in the soil profile and vertically deeper into the soil profile fea further allows for the simulation of the soil water inside a specified geometry which is important for understanding how biochar amendment may affect soil close to the surface and deeper into the profile fea utilizes a mesh and node approach to simulate the moisture redistribution each node in the geometry will have values of matric potential hydraulic conductivity and diffusivity associated with the current water content of that node as the water content changes the soil properties of that node change creating the need for soil property characteristics throughout the entire water content range these values are obtained from the lab experimentation 2 1 theory vadose zone transport model development to model the redistribution of water in a vadose zone a representative model geometry is required given the significant variation in the topography of the palouse region a simplified generic hillslope is most effective for showing biochar application across a wide variety of topographies an idealized hillslope was created using a sinusoidal wave from π 2 to 3π 2 fig 2 the sinusoidal curve serves as the representation of hillslope profile with concave and convex sections the base thickness of the hillslope was set to be 2 m and the height of the sloped region was set to be 1 m the length of the hillslope is 10 m wide theoretically if the mechanics of the model are validated and functioning appropriately the model geometry could change from a small hillslope to a larger more realistic hillslope profile that can be found in the region the dimensional parameters used to model the hillslope are shown in fig 2 the primary forces that drive the moisture throughout the hillslope are the gradient of the hydraulic head and the capillary action or diffusion process henry darcy first developed this notion and has since become darcy s law hubbert 1957 1 q k d ϕ dl darcy s law is valid only for laminar flow which occurs for reynold s number re less than 1 most practical applications of groundwater flow have re 1 and thus can be modeled with darcy s law darcy s law summarizes water flow through a saturated soil column and can be applied to the specified geometry found in fig 2 if θ is the volume of water per unit volume of soil the time rate of change of moisture θ in a unit soil cube is the divergence of the flow into the soil matrix this notion can be given by the following 2 d θ dt divergence of q k ϕ for unsaturated soil pore space contains both air and water the hydraulic potential is the sum of pressure head p elevation head z soil matric potential ψ and osmotic potential this study assumes that the osmotic potential is negligible the matric potential is the portion of the water potential that can be attributed to the attraction of the soil matrix for water the matric potential used to be called the capillary potential because over a large part of its range the matric potential is due to capillary action however as the water content decreases in a porous material water held in pores due to capillarity becomes negligibly small compared to the water held directly on particle surfaces therefore the term matric potential covers phenomena beyond cases for which a capillary analogy is appropriate kirkham 2005 for unsaturated soil the hydraulic potential is given by 3 ϕ p ψ z the matric potential ψ is a function of moisture content ψ is zero at saturation and above and is negative for lower moisture combining eqs 2 and 3 4 d θ dt k ψ k p k z where ψ d ψ dl d ψ d θ d θ dl d ψ d θ θ d θ dl is the change in moisture content between two points in any direction either in the x y or z direction the term k d ψ d θ is defined as soil diffusivity d this parameter is dependent upon the soil moisture content and is given by 5 d θ k θ d ψ d θ assuming a homogeneous and isotropic soil matrix the k and ψ are scalar functions of θ for a saturated soil profile under equilibrium conditions the pressure head is equal to the height of the saturated layer for unsaturated soil the hydraulic head is less than the height of the soil layer we can assume a linear relationship between pressure head p and moisture content of the soil profile as p h θ θ fc θ s θ fc where h is the depth of the soil element from the surface fig 2 θs is the saturated moisture content and θfc is the moisture content at field capacity fc 33kpa the linear relationship applies to the saturated layer in the soil by definition soil below field capacity is under the force of only gravity and therefore pressure head p is 0 the gradient of p in the horizontal direction is 0 and hence k p z k θ θ fc θ s θ fc k θ s θ fc θ z the gradient of elevation in the vertical direction z z 1 and 0 in the horizontal direction hence 2 z 0 therefore eq 4 can be written as d θ dt d θ k 1 θ s θ fc θ z 0 if θ θ fc 6 d θ dt d θ 0 if θ θ fc both equations in eq 6 are included for completeness and clarity the model setup and initial conditions described in section 2 7 indicate that the soil moisture does not increase beyond θfc the second equation which is applicable for all moisture contents that do not develop positive pressures is sufficient based upon the initial conditions set in the model and was used throughout eq 6 is a generic equation that applies to any soil type although this model is focused on homogeneous soil conditions restrictive layers like argillic and fragipan horizons may exist these restrictive layers reduce the vertical infiltration of water deeper into the soil profile and can form perched water tables brooks et al 2004 the inclusion of these restrictive layers in the composite soil profile helps predict perched water tables and observed rapid subsurface lateral flows brooks et al 2012 mcdaniel et al 2008 2001 2 2 boundary conditions eq 6 provides the governing pde equation for moisture movement inside the soil matrix the moisture distribution around the boundary such as the topsoil surface depends on boundary conditions set in the model the soil surface where the soil exchanges moisture with the environment was developed based upon research by wang et al 2019 this research applied a kelvin equation for heat transfer under dry conditions to calculate the equilibrium matric potential of the soil surface with atmospheric air which is given by 7 ψ a rt mg ln rh where r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 t kelvin is the absolute temperature m is the molecular weight of water 0 018015 kg mol 1 g is the gravitational acceleration 9 81 m s 2 and rh is the in equilibrium relative humidity at soil surface wang et al 2019 analogous to applying newton s law of cooling via convection the rate of evaporation is assumed to be proportional to the difference between soil potential at the surface and air equating the rate of evaporation to the rate of change of moisture content to the surface the following is derived 8 d θ dt ε ψ ψ a where ε l 1t 1 is evaporation constant or factor similar in meaning to convective heat transfer coefficient in thermal systems the evaporation rate ε is defined as the depth of water evaporated per unit of time per unit gradient of matric potential and has units of t 1 the value of ε is a function of the soil temperature wind speed and other energy sources aiding evaporation however for simplicity ε is set to a constant value obtained from lab experiment explained later in section 2 4 was set to 6 25 10 9 combining eq 8 with eq 6 we get the boundary condition 9 n d k 1 θ s θ fc θ ε ψ ψ a note that instead of divergence the derivative is taken in the direction normal to the surface the boundary condition for either side in fig 2 is assumed to be in equilibrium with its neighbor and hence no moisture is exchanged the boundary condition for the bottom is assumed to be at field capacity a separate boundary is constructed for the biochar amendment area allowing for water transmittance across the boundary layer 2 3 finite element analysis with matlab pde solver analytic solution to eq 9 with initial boundary conditions is almost impossible matlab s partial differential equation pde toolbox solves scalar equations of the form expressed in eq 9 since moisture is a scalar quantity and is the only component being considered the scalar form of the equation can be applied matlab pde toolbox was used to solve the partial differential equation in eq 6 matlab has a standard form of the equation mathworks 2006 for its pde solver given by 10 m 2 θ d t 2 d θ dt c θ a θ f for a 3 d representation of the model matlab internally computes c θ as c θ x y z c x 0 0 0 c y 0 0 0 c z θ x θ y θ z for an isotropic diffusivity coefficient eq 6 can be written in matrix form as 11 d θ dt x y z d 0 0 0 d 0 0 0 d k 1 θ s θ r θ x θ y θ z 0 for a 2 d representation of palouse hill comparing eqs 10 and 11 m 0 d 1 a 0 f 0 the value of c is computed conditionally c d 0 0 d k 1 θ s θ r if θ r θ θ s otherwise c d neumann boundary condition is applied in the upper surface where water evaporates matlab s way of specifying neumann boundary conditions is given by the equation 12 n c u qu g comparing eq 12 to eq 9 gives q 0 and g ε ψ ψ a the value of c is the same as shown above the theory and fea approach culminate in the generated mesh for the specified geometry fig 2 the fea mesh is displayed in fig 3 the geometry is confined on both the left and right sides the surface is open to evaporation and the bottom is open to percolation additionally this is a uniform vadose zone profile which is idealistic the mesh size was set to 1 cm the nodes in the black area indicate the biochar amendment area which will have biochar amended soil characteristics the blue nodes indicate control nodes 100 soil biochar is amended to 5 of the hillslope area the initial conditions for the model consist of matric potential diffusivity and hydraulic conductivity values assigned to each node based on laboratory measurements further explained in section 2 6 the initial conditions for the model are the measured values at saturated condition that is explained in detail in section 2 7 the changes in matric potential hydraulic conductivity and diffusivity used by the model as soil moisture depletes are shown in fig 5 2 4 determination of evaporative factor ε the model s output was validated based on statistical comparison between simulated and measured soil moisture sm data the sm data from the model output is easily accessible however the fast pace of biochar development diversity of feedstocks biochar production methods and responses by agricultural horticultural silvicultural and rangeland systems coupled with short funding cycles and the lack of a comprehensive coordinated approach have left significant gaps in biochar s knowledge base amonette et al 2021 these knowledge gaps have generated a need for coordinated large scale regionally focused long term studies of biochar production and application to answer questions about the technology s cost and potential impact and guide future development amonette et al 2021 these factors create a lack of easily accessible long term field data required for biochar model calibration the lack of knowledge and measured biochar sm data led to calibrating the redistribution model through other means an experiment was designed to monitor changes in sm for a confined saturated soil core over time evaporation off the soil s surface was the singular driving force for this experiment the model s geometry and conditions could then be changed to match the experimental setup and conditions allowing for direct comparison between simulated and measured sm data recalling eq 8 d θ dt ε ψ ψ a the evaporation constant ε is deemed a constant value for simplicity inherently ε is a function of evaporative forces like wind speed air temperature and radiation which would ordinarily change throughout a specified time step but not the case here the evaporative factor ε can therefore be iteratively determined to better match the measured simulated sm data to the observed sm data by running multiple model simulations with changed ε values 2 5 sample composition and preparation to assess the effectiveness of biochar in moisture redistribution a mixture of soil samples and biochar samples were measured for soil hydraulic properties in a laboratory setting disturbed soil was collected at the university of idaho parker farm outside of moscow idaho the soil throughout the region is dominated by palouse silt loam soil classified as fine silty mixed superactive mesic pachic ultic haploxerolls ncss 2013 soil samples were sieved with a no 6 mesh sieve diameter 3 35 mm usa standard testing sieve astm e 11 specification to ensure that larger soil aggregates and rocks did not create a higher degree of variability during experimentation biochar were obtained through carbon logic llc part of ag energy solutions in spokane washington a redwood sawdust rsd and a wheat straw ws biochar were used which was produced from gasification the two biochar samples are displayed below in fig 4 proximal analysis corresponding with astm proximate analysis procedures was performed on both biochar samples surface area analysis was performed by using the brunauer emmett teller bet methodology the coefficient of uniformity was determined by sieve analysis american geosciences institute defines coefficient of uniformity as the ratio of the sieve size through which 60 by weight of the material passes to the sieve size that allows 10 of the material to pass relevant biochar properties are shown in table 1 other biochar properties fall within the ranges reported by jatav et al 2021 biochar samples were added to the soil and manually mixed until a homogenous mixture was formed both rsd and ws samples were mixed at 0 100 soil 4 and 7 concentration by dry mass this allowed for the determination of the potential trends from increasing the biochar concentration on soil hydraulic properties each sample was manually mixed using stir sticks until a homogenous mixture formed samples were mixed in bulk and then stored for later testing textural analysis and other soil characteristics for all samples were performed by best test analytics in moses lake washington the external soil lab received disturbed soil samples which needed to be reconstituted for specific soil tests analysis exp bulk density bd textural analysis was determined by mechanical analysis hydrometer methodology the soil textural analysis displayed 26 sand 58 silt and 16 clay this is indicative of a silt loam soil which is the primary soil in the region the organic matter om was determined by the walkley black om testing methodology walkley and black 1934 key soil properties of interest are tabulated below in table 2 the data presented in table 2 combines values obtained from the external laboratory and estimations made from the hyprop more information can be found in section 2 6 an important thing to note regarding the initial soil sample properties in table 2 is the om values for each of the samples the control sample has an om value that is high for a palouse silt loam soil this deviation from a typical value of 2 9 national cooperative soil survey 2021 is likely due to sample collection the soil that was collected was disturbed and therefore it lacked the typical structure found in the soil furthermore more om may have been introduced when it was disturbed accounted for by the higher initial om content of the control despite this the general trend observed between samples is consistent with what is expected with biochar amendment in soil furthermore intuitively biochar amendment primarily organic carbon would increase the om of the soil to larger values than observed through walkley black testing upon evaluation the testing service noted that some biochar in each sample floated in the chromate and sulfuric acid solution when testing using the walkley black testing methodology this likely caused the discrepancies between the measured and the expected changes in om 2 6 experimental setup for determining soil hydraulic properties the driving equation for the fea model eq 6 utilizes soil hydraulic properties matric potential hydraulic conductivity k and diffusivity d the soil hydraulic properties for the different soil samples were measured or derived by using a combination of the hyprop from meter group campbell et al 2015 wp4c dew point potentiometer from meter group and fundamental soil physics model equations provided by van genuchten 1980 paper van genuchten 1980 the hyprop follows the simplified evaporation method developed by schindler in 1980 schindler et al 2010 this method measures the matric potential of a confined saturated soil core saturated from the bottom to remove air as the soil sample dries the matric potential is measured by two tensiometers at two different heights in the soil column to account for the disturbed nature of the initial soil samples each sample was intentionally packed into the soil rings prior to testing the control was packed into the soil ring to a targeted bulk density throughout the region 1 20 g cm3 national cooperative soil survey 2021 each following sample was then packed following the same procedure to ensure that there was no significant variation in compaction between samples the developed procedure reduces the effects of potential compaction between samples and creates support for the biochar affecting the bd of the samples consistent with both the samples tested at the external laboratory table 2 and literature masiello et al 2019b each soil sample was tested in replicate 4 times per sample the results from each replicate were averaged and compiled to obtain a representative average soil hydraulic property for each sample utilizing the measured matric potential values the van genuchten model with m 1 1 n can be applied to derive values of unsaturated k and diffusivity d these equations are described in further detail in the original work yet they are presented as follows 13 k r θ θ 1 2 1 1 θ 1 m m 2 14 k θ k r k sat where kr θ is the relative hydraulic conductivity at any given water content cm day ksat is the saturated hydraulic conductivity cm day θ θ θ r θ s θ r m is a van genuchten parameter d θ is the diffusivity at any given water content and d ψ is the difference in matric potential between water contents and dθ is the difference in water contents kr can be converted to k θ by utilizing eq 13 eq 13 and 14 lead to an indirect estimation of k θ for different soils the ksat value in equation 14 is key to the hyprop accurately estimating k θ of a soil sample ksat values can either be directly measured externally and input into the hyprop software or estimated from pedotransfer functions ptfs the ksat values presented in this work were estimated using ptfs found in rosetta a natural resources conservation service nrcs soil tool which is found as a neural network in hydrus 1d an additional nrcs soil tool šimůnek et al 2013 rosetta utilizes a hierarchical approach to estimate the ksat for different soil samples utilizing more data regarding the soil sample for more specific equations three levels of ptfs were used to estimate the ksat values the first ptf utilized soil texture sand silt and clay and bd the second ptf utilizes the soil texture bd and field capacity fc where fc θv at 33 kpa the third ptf equation uses soil texture bd fc and permanent wilting point pwp where pwp θv at 1500 kpa biochar s influence on ksat was accounted for through changes in bd fc and pwp changes to soil texture while likely were ignored the estimated ksat values from each of the three ptfs were then averaged to obtain the overall estimated ksat values for each of the soil samples eqs 5 13 and 14 are applicable to the moisture range between the residual θr and the saturated θs water contents in nature the soil at the surface and a thin layer below may go below θr if the environment is sufficiently dry or drought conditions occur to account for the potential drought conditions there was a need to model soil hydraulic properties beyond θr research performed by campbell and shiozawa 1992 illustrated that at moisture contents below θr film flow water movement prevails and will decrease linearly with the log scale matric suction campbell and shiozawa 1992 below θr the matric suction and film water content relationship can be expressed as 15 ψ ψ 0 ψ θ r ψ 0 θ θ r as suggested by schneider and goss 2012 ψ 0 is the air dry moisture of soil ψ 0 6 3 104 m schneider and goss 2012 according to research from wang et al 2019 applicable for film flow below θr the conductivity of the soil can then be determined by the following wang et al 2019 16 k k θ r θ θ r ψ ψ θ r 2 3 the diffusivity is less complex to model below θr since the diffusivity is a function of both matric potential and hydraulic conductivity once both these properties are determined the diffusivity at any moisture content is known based on eq 5 for inputting the soil hydraulic data into the model the water content increased linearly from 0 to θs the magnitude of each saturation range is unique to each sample due to biochar affecting the θs for the samples the moisture content increases at a rate of 0 5 moisture over the entire range providing adequate resolution for the model the data were averaged across all four replicates and compiled for matlab 2 7 initial conditions and model setup hourly temperature and relative humidity data for 2010 were downloaded from noaa meteorological data noaa 2021 national weather service data for spokane airport outside of spokane washington this is required to estimate soil evaporation based upon eq 8 the downloaded data had an hourly record of dew point and dry bulb temperature relative humidity was derived from psychrometric relation based on the august roche magnus approximation which implies that saturation vapor pressure changes approximately exponentially with temperature under typical atmospheric conditions regional weather data provides adequate representation for the climate humidity and temperature in the palouse region the model operates under the assumption that this is a bare hillslope has no vegetation and the soil is isometric and uniform the entire field is held initially at field capacity at 33 kpa fc 33kpa positive pressure in the profile is not a factor the field capacity is set by the soil sample that is applied to the soil i e if biochar amendment occurs the amendment area is initially at biochar s fc 33kpa values these conditions represent a late spring field after sufficient rainfall the model is assumed to begin on april 30th and will dry over the next two months 60 days under the primary forces of evaporation and water redistribution there is no further precipitation input into the system over the 60 days of simulation the modeled evaporation is allowed only on nodes along the surface and driven by the matric potential difference between the air and the node on any given day eq 8 the moisture underneath is transported to the surface by diffusion process driven by matric potential gradient to assess biochar s potential integration into precision agriculture an application region was chosen on the hillslope profile biochar was amended to 5 of the hillslope and at a depth of 30 cm all samples could be applied to the hillslope allowing for comparison in effect across both biochar type and concentration it is important to note that biochar was applied to a uniform soil profile a uniform profile disregards the argillic and fragipan horizons that can form throughout various topographies in the palouse these hardpan layers drive subsurface lateral flow in the soil profiles which are important for understanding stored water and redistribution throughout a hillslope brooks et al 2004 applying biochar to a uniform soil profile will still provide valuable insights into how biochar can affect water redistribution in undulating topography but may not be uniformly representative of all applications in the palouse the biochar amendment zone is indicated as black dots in fig 3 each mesh node was initially assigned the mean value of matric potential hydraulic conductivity and diffusivity pertaining to the specific biochar amendment presented in table 3 matlab allows each node within a defined zone to have specific initial conditions and hydraulic properties this feature was used to calculate zone specific moisture movement using hydraulic properties from fig 5 finally the effectiveness of biochar amendment from this model will depend on the initial conditions set for the simulation the results presented in this research depict one specific scenario and outcome changing the initial conditions will change the final output from the model rendering biochar either effective or ineffective depending on the model inputs universal blanket statements regarding the effectiveness of biochar in all scenarios should be avoided 3 results and discussion 3 1 biochar s effects on silt loam soil hydraulic properties in general increasing the concentration of biochar amendment reduced the bd g cm3 of the soil table 2 this was consistent for all types and concentrations increasing biochar amendment increased soil porosity table 2 the reduction in bd and increases in porosity from biochar was statistically significant from control biochar amendment in silt loam soil did influence the soil s hydraulic properties which is consistent with literature biederman and harpole 2013 castellini et al 2015 el naggar et al 2019 hardie et al 2014 jeffery et al 2019 masiello et al 2019a the bulk density bd presented in table 3 was for hyprop following recommended compaction procedure it is important to note that they are not significantly different from the bd in table 2 which indicates that the compaction procedure during samples preparation did not affect results the fc is reported at two tensions 33 kpa fc 33kpa and 6 kpa fc 6kpa the computed van genuchten vg parameters from the hyprop are also shown in table 3 values in this table show the averages of the four replicates with standard deviation a t test was conducted for fc 33kpa fc 6kpa pwp 1500kpa residual moisture content θr and saturated moisture content θs between biochar treated and control at 95 confidence interval ci the statistically significant values are noted in table 3 in general biochar amendment showed a mixed effect on field capacity rsd biochar application decreased field capacity while ws biochar reduced the field capacity this may be due to the variation in biochar particle size reflected from the coefficient of uniformity the rsd biochar had a coefficient of uniformity less than half of ws biochar table 1 low coefficient of uniformity of rsd mean more heterogeneous size distribution and hence reduced the fc ws biochar with a higher coefficient of uniformity in general increased the fc from table 2 table 3 and eqs 13 through 16 fig 5 was constructed displaying the matric potential hydraulic conductivity and diffusivity curves for each sample the maric potentials in fig 5 are actually negative values showing their magnitudes fig 5 shows minimal change to water retention through matric potentials please note that they are negative values indicating suction potential and presented as positive numbers ranging from 102 to 105 cm with biochar amendment despite more deviation from the control at tensions around 105 cm the changes to pwp and θr were minimal due to extremely low hydraulic conductivity is and that it falls near pwp the effect from biochar amendment are insignificant in this moisture range however towards saturated conditions biochar showed more significant effects as biochar significantly changes the soil hydraulic conductivity in wet conditions at a higher moisture range above 0 35 for a given matric potential biochar application showed increased moisture retention the difference was larger for higher matric potential fig 5a the increase in water retention with biochar is due to higher porosity in biochar this is consistent with devereux et al 2013 and gaskin et al 2007 who showed increases in the water holding capacity at tensions from 20 kpa to 100 kpa devereux et al 2013 gaskin et al 2007 the net increase however is dependent on the type of biochar biochar with a higher uniformity coefficient showed a greater increase in moisture retention this indicates that the particle size and surface interactions affected the pore characteristics in the soil differently liu et al 2017 the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat values estimated from the ptfs showed significant 95 ci increases in ksat when amended with biochar both concentration and type from fig 5 biochar amendment reduces unsaturated hydraulic conductivity as the soil approached saturated conditions moisture contents 35 these findings were consistent with research performed by barnes et al 2014 they found that despite an increase in porosity and a reduction in bd the hydraulic conductivity of the soil decreased further this research pointed to two mechanisms driving these effects the internal structure and the higher field capacity of biochar they described that the high internal porosity of the biochar creates two theoretical flow pathways for water to move one in the interstitial space between the soil and biochar particles and the second within the biochar itself the second of which increase the tortuosity of the soil which would decrease k lastly their research pointed to the idea that biochar has a high field capacity and therefore water may have continued to be absorbed by the biochar leading to an observation of an apparent decrease in k despite more water being in the soil barnes et al 2014 the shape of the diffusivity curve mimics the conductivity curves for each of the soil samples the effects of biochar both concentration 4 and 7 and type rsd and ws were consistent between the conductivity and diffusivity curves 3 2 model output both rsd and ws amendments were simulated using the developed model consistent with the initial conditions and theory described in section 2 7 both biochar types were amended at 4 and 7 concentrations by dry mass the model simulated the drying of the soil for 60 days beginning on april 30th of 2010 and tracked the changes in soil moisture on an hourly basis fig 6 displays moisture difference plots biochar amendment minus the control at the end of the simulation with each of the biochar amendments positive values on the legend right of each plot equate to areas with more moisture from biochar amendment the black contour line denotes a zero difference contour line the areas outside the zero contour line indicate a reduction in moisture content or no change whereas the area inside the contour line displays increased moisture content all biochar samples showed an increase in moisture content in and around the amendment area the magnitude in which the retention increased varied between each of the samples with the 7 rsd having the largest increase in moisture content upwards of a 0 5 increase in some areas compared to the control the 4 ws sample showed a smaller maximum increase in retention with just over 0 02 increase from the control the 4 rsd and 7 ws samples showed similar increases in retention leading to a maximum increase in retention of 0 06 and 0 1 increase from the control for the 4 rsd and 7 ws respectively these effects are also minimal all samples showed a decrease in moisture content on either side adjacent to the amendment area there was no additional water input into the system throughout the simulation which indicates that less moisture was distributed laterally from the top of the hillslope leading to less moisture in these areas the model output shows that biochar does change how moisture is retained and redistributed in the soil the zero contour lines indicate differences in vertical redistribution of water deeper into the soil profile the 4 rsd sample showed the most vertical redistribution of water into the soil profile the 4 rsd amendment had the highest diffusivity fig 5b of all amendments which would account for more vertical moisture redistribution into deeper portions of the soil profile even under dry conditions the increase in moisture content was larger for the higher application rate the 7 rsd provided the highest increase in moisture retention at the hilltop it is important to note that this discussion involves the change in moisture observed at the end of the simulation while the results at the end of the simulation highlight the potential effects of biochar deep into the growing season it does not provide a full picture of biochar s effects on soil water throughout the entire simulation as the change in moisture at the end of the simulation is minimal in most samples any changes to moisture content from biochar amendment are cumulative and any difference in moisture observed at any point in the simulation would influence theoretical hydrologic and crop processes the developed model allows for the animation of the output over time which can be found at youtu be ip5yzsixfim an indication of the cumulative effect of biochar can be ascertained by plotting the change in the moisture content of a specific node in the mesh over time fig 7 displays the moisture difference between a respective biochar amendment and the control sample for a specific node in the soil profile over time the node is located in the middle of hillslope near the soil surface in the amendment area and 10 cm below the hilltop soil surface initially all samples showed a reduction in moisture content when amended with biochar this is attributed to the differences in the fc 33kpa with biochar amendment despite the initial decrease in moisture content all samples showed eventual increases in moisture content over time as the season progressed and soil became drier the magnitude of the changes in moisture content varied depending on the amendment type and concentration 3 3 determination of evaporative factor ε fig 8 displays the simulated sm achieved with the chosen ε value plotted against the measured sm data from the experiment the value of ε was determined iteratively using matlab by comparing predicted moisture and observed moisture choosing the value that best fit the measured moisture using eq 9 a constant value of ε 6 25 10 9 produced the lowest error between observed and predicted moisture fig 8 with a coefficient of determination r2 0 99 mean absolute error of 0 003 and a percent bias of 0 3 the results indicate that the current model performs adequately a larger field experiment will be needed to determine ε as a function of other environmental variables 4 conclusion amending the silt loam soil with redwood sawdust or wheat straw biochar showed a possibility of changing the water redistribution and retention in an undulating soil profile increasing the biochar amendment concentration correlated with more soil water holding capacities during dry months biochar amendment had less impact on water retention through most unsaturated range however as the soil approached saturation or near saturated conditions θ 0 35 the biochar helped the soil retain more water there was an apparent reduction in unsaturated k for both amendment types and concentrations despite estimated increases in ksat the developed vadose zone model showed promise as a tool for predicting changes in soil moisture over time with varied biochar amendments over the simulated period of 60 days the amended soil with 7 rsd showed increased soil moisture up to 0 5 at the tops of the hillslopes while the magnitude of the increase in retention varied amongst samples the results are promising and prompt further investigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following financial interests personal

9110,precision agriculture is most effective in areas where significant in field variation occurs the palouse region of the pacific northwest in the us a vast area of undulating fertile farmland has relatively high in field variation in water retention and crop yield due to regional topography and uneven soil erosion the regional agricultural systems depend on the soil at or near field capacity towards the end of a wet spring to support crops throughout the summer drought period dryland agricultural systems and high in field variation and changing climate make water retention management practices throughout the region critical a finite element vadose zone transport model was developed and used to understand the benefits of the targeted application of biochar on water retention and water redistribution in a representative hillslope the model utilizes measured soil hydraulic properties to predict soil moisture distribution over the dry season a redwood sawdust and wheat straw biochar was amended at 4 and 7 concentrations by mass biochar amended soils showed an increase in water retention and apparent reduction in unsaturated hydraulic conductivity as the soil approached saturated conditions after two months of bare field evaporation the model showed that biochar impacts water redistribution in the soil profile contributing to positive and negative changes and a net increase in water retention model outputs with biochar showed increased retention in and around the amendment area although the magnitude between outputs varied with some samples showing minimal effectiveness despite the differences in magnitude with targeted biochar amendment these results indicate that biochar can change water redistribution up to 0 5 in a soil profile additionally the developed model shows promise as a field and regional level management tool to determine the best return on investment from biochar application when applied in a targeted manner keywords biochar soil moisture modeling groundwater precision agriculture data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction feeding a growing population and a changing climate are two significant problems that are imminent in the foreseeable future for generations overuse of resources and continued population growth has stressed global environmental systems creating a need for progressive sustainable solutions to these stressors zhang et al 2021 addressing the difficulties surrounding agriculture on a local and global level is an integral part of mitigating these issues directly increasing sustainable farming practices preserve land fertility for consistent crop development and reduces greenhouse gasses horrigan et al 2002 gan et al 2014 creating sustainable and efficient agricultural systems entails addressing the deficiencies in agriculture that are detrimental to local regional and global soil health and crop yields precision agriculture can aid in this pursuit the underlying objective of precision agriculture is site specific land management by matching the site specific needs in a field with resource inputs that respond to those needs investing in site specific management technologies is more logical when significant variation occurs within a single field due to topographic variation requiring multiple management strategies rabia et al 2022 suggested interdisciplinary research efforts to enhance the understanding and promote application of topographic information in precision agriculture the palouse area of the pacific northwest united states spans from southeastern washington to west central idaho and consists of over two million acres of rich agricultural land hall and walker 1999 hartmans and michalson 2000 the area is centered around latitude 46 8802 n and longitude 117 3643 w relying on stored soil water deep into the summer months like most dryland cropping environments the palouse consistently produces significant crop yields of chickpeas winter wheat spring wheat and canola stored soil water is key to dryland agriculture and the patterns of stored soil water are linked to the topography beven and kirkby 1979 wilson et al 2005 cropping sequences schlegel et al 2017 and tillage practices fuentes et al 2003 jin et al 2007 kühling et al 2017 throughout the year stored soil water will fluctuate spatially eagleson 1978 due to climatic changes brown et al 2021 vegetation eagleson 1978 topography burt and butcher 1985 and heterogeneous soil profiles sheets and hendrickx 1995 the palouse while fertile historically has some of the fastest eroding topsoil in the united states since this land was first cultivated about 100 years ago all of the original topsoil has been lost from about 10 of palouse cropland and one fourth to three fourths of the original topsoil has been lost from another 60 of cropland usda 1978 areas with less topsoil generally the tops and steeper hillslopes have low organic matter poor water retention and poor nutrient use cycling as a result of the shallow topsoil depth kaiser 1967 topsoil and soil organic matter loss impairs the soil s water holding capacity reduces the soil s natural fertility and requires increased use of fertilizers to maintain yields hartmans and michalson 2000 these soil characteristics are counterproductive for dryland agricultural systems a study in whitman county found an average annual erosion rate over 26 years of 0 7 tons of soil for each bushel of wheat raised and in some places the figure was as high as 2 3 tons of topsoil lost per bushel of wheat kaiser 1967 the complexities of farming in the palouse extend beyond erosion and degraded soils at the top of the hills argillic and fragipan horizons in north facing hillslopes lead to perched water tables in the winter months which drive rapid subsurface lateral flows and accelerates the eluviation of clays in albic esoil horizons brooks et al 2012 mcdaniel et al 2008 2001 the argillic fragipan layers reduce the storage capacity of the soil by restricting the already shallow topsoil and impacting crop yields the impermeable fragipan layers can be relatively shallow in the soil 0 65 m and along with the formation of perched water tables drive the hydrologic processes of these areas brooks et al 2004 topography based surface and subsurface lateral flow is an influential determinant of water movement and storage in the winter and spring months western et al 2002 zhu et al 2010 the topographical complexities erosion factors and complex surface subsurface hydrology culminate in significant variation in crop yields throughout the palouse the variability within palouse fields is high and combined with diverse management legacies and irregular weather patterns create heterogeneous growing conditions weddell et al 2017 crop yields of winter wheat can vary from 5 bushels acre to as high as 110 bushels acre in the same field o keeffe et al 2020 fig 1a displays a drone image of a typical field in the palouse showing significant variation in crop dryness due to lack of moisture along ridges fig 1b displays the erosion potential and top soil depth in a typical hillslope with variations in slope and direction the 1967 kaiser study of whitman county showed that wheat yield was directly affected by soil erosion and eroded soil on hilltops and steep slopes produced only 32 of the yields of non eroded soil kaiser 1967 data analysis performed by yang et al 1998 obtained from a wheat field in the palouse region confirmed a statistically significant correlation linking topographic attributes including elevation slope and aspect to effects on wheat yield which could explain 13 35 of the variability in wheat yield for the whole fields though 49 84 of the yield variability could be explained by topography in some regions within the five fields yang et al 1998 locations with steeper slopes and higher elevations had a negative impact on wheat yield varied in a typical field at a magnitude of over 20 fold confirming findings from the 1967 study yang et al 1998 changes in topography and soil properties will influence water distribution however these changes are site specific corwin and lesch 2005 2003 due to the inherent variability associated with palouse dryland crop production a one size fits all recommendation for management is of little value koenig 2005 the nature of the palouse and a greater understanding of the agriculture and hydrology around the region provides an opportunity for the use of precision agriculture techniques to deal with the complexities of farming in the palouse this study aims to provide support and information regarding the integration of biochar into precision agriculture as a method for soil restoration primarily through manipulation of water retention and redistribution in the palouse 1 1 biochar as a potential solution biochar is the carbon rich solid product from thermochemical conversion of biomass usually manure wood leaves and crop residues and is generally enclosed in an oxygen deprived environment intended for use as a soil amendment as a means of improving soil productivity and health lehmann and joseph 2009 hornung et al 2021 biochar has been shown to positively affect soil fertility and water retention characteristics in the soil aller et al 2017 dokoohaki et al 2017 jatav et al 2021 research by hudson 1994 showed a positive correlation between organic matter om and available water content awc for sand r2 0 79 silt loam r2 0 58 and silty clay loam r2 0 76 in all texture groups when om increased from 0 5 to 3 the available water content doubled hudson 1994 lehmann et al 2015 noted that organic matter contributes to soil fertility by retaining plant available water and nutrients or promoting the formation of soil structure lehmann and kleber 2015 a comprehensive meta analysis regarding the impacts of biochar application on plant growth conducted by jeffrey et al 2011 showed that amending soils with biochar largely helped the soil fertility and crop yields outweighing the neutral results and one negative result jeffery et al 2011 further this analysis showed an average positive effect of 10 on crop yield across soil types jeffery et al 2011 razzaghi et al 2020 performed a meta analysis of recent research involving biochar and its effects on soil properties this study demonstrated biochar on average decreased the soil bd by 9 field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp greatly increased for coarse textured soils by 51 and 47 respectively and moderately for medium textured soils by 13 increase and a 9 increase respectively the same study found that there was minimal effect on the fc of the soil for fine textured soil but pwp decreased by roughly 5 razzaghi et al 2020 despite the documented positive effects of the biochar amendment on soils the effectiveness of the amendment depends significantly upon the physiochemical characteristics of the biochar and the properties of the soil such as structure soil type nutrient concentration and particle size edeh and buss 2020 the physiochemical characteristics of biochar largely vary depending on the conditions of thermochemical conversion and the feedstock used for processing agegnehu et al 2017 bhogal et al 2009 chowdhury et al 2016 el naggar et al 2019 jeffery et al 2011 lehmann and kleber 2015 palansooriya et al 2019 the primary hypothesis of this work the evaluation of using biochar as a method for increasing soil water retention and redistribution is based upon the positive impacts observed from biochar amendments demonstrated in these previous studies understanding the pathways in which biochar amendment affects the soil is critical to understanding how biochar amendment may affect water retention and redistribution among the key soil properties altered by biochar additions are bulk density porosity including pore size and pore connectivity grain size distribution and soil surface chemistry basso et al 2013 masiello et al 2019b these changes manifest themselves as measurable shifts in soil hydrologic properties such as soil hydrologic conductivity k and the energy with which water is held in soil or matric potential masiello et al 2019b the matric potential and k for soils are further affected by a combination of soil water content density degree of saturation void ratio particle structure tortuosity soil texture and size shape and abundance of pores campbell et al 2021 chung et al 2018 whalley et al 2013 it is well documented that biochar affects a combination of both soil physical barnes et al 2014 biederman and harpole 2013 devereux et al 2013 and hydraulic properties devereux et al 2013 lim et al 2016 therefore it is appropriate to hypothesize similar changes to soil physical and hydraulic properties in the palouse region this prompts the need for measurement or estimation of the effects of biochar amendment on soil physical and hydraulic properties to effectively address the primary hypothesis of this work the research involving biochar amendment in the soil shows promise for integrating biochar into soil water management practices in the palouse currently biochar is cost prohibitive for uniform application across large areas of farmland shifting from a uniform application to a selective targeted application would allow the utilization of biochar in the region to precisely mitigate soil depth low organic matter and poor water retention characteristics that hinder soil productivity throughout the palouse this study aims to evaluate the integration of biochar into precision agriculture strategies in the palouse it focuses on the complexities of farming in the palouse to ascertain valuable information regarding the effectiveness of biochar use on water retention and local agriculture using numerical modeling and finite element analysis fea a matlab model was developed with the partial differential equation toolbox to simulate the redistribution of water throughout a hilly topography hydraulic properties of palouse silt loam soil with different biochar concentrations were measured to understand the effects of biochar on soil water retention characteristics the model utilizes laboratory measurements of soil hydraulic properties and meteorological data to simulate water redistribution over the dry summer months of the palouse this study aims to determine a the effectiveness of biochar integration into precision agriculture b the impact of biochar amendment on the soil hydraulic properties of a palouse silt loam soil through laboratory measurements c an assessment of biochar as a soil restoration technique in the palouse and d the effectiveness and validity of the developed model to simulate water redistribution and retention in a soil profile for this research a generic hillslope deemed representative of areas in the palouse was used no specific location was used however the inputs meteorological and soil properties used in this study represent the greater palouse region 2 materials and methods the method section is divided into vadose zone transport modeling and laboratory experimentation the laboratory experimentation provided data for the different soil sample properties throughout the entire soil moisture range while the vadose zone transport modeling provided the larger impact of biochar over a specified duration the model simulated the effects of biochar on water retention and redistribution on an hourly time step the developed model is a bare soil vadose zone transport model that is open strictly to evaporation off the soil s surface and percolation out of the bottom of the geometry the model developed throughout this work is the preliminary baseline development that could eventually be expanded to more complex applications the initial model would simulate a small catchment in a watershed and more specifically it would simulate one small hillslope in a catchment the use of finite element analysis fea is important because it provides flexibility and scalability that is desired for larger watershed applications hourly changes to soil water is simulated in two dimensions laterally in the soil profile and vertically deeper into the soil profile fea further allows for the simulation of the soil water inside a specified geometry which is important for understanding how biochar amendment may affect soil close to the surface and deeper into the profile fea utilizes a mesh and node approach to simulate the moisture redistribution each node in the geometry will have values of matric potential hydraulic conductivity and diffusivity associated with the current water content of that node as the water content changes the soil properties of that node change creating the need for soil property characteristics throughout the entire water content range these values are obtained from the lab experimentation 2 1 theory vadose zone transport model development to model the redistribution of water in a vadose zone a representative model geometry is required given the significant variation in the topography of the palouse region a simplified generic hillslope is most effective for showing biochar application across a wide variety of topographies an idealized hillslope was created using a sinusoidal wave from π 2 to 3π 2 fig 2 the sinusoidal curve serves as the representation of hillslope profile with concave and convex sections the base thickness of the hillslope was set to be 2 m and the height of the sloped region was set to be 1 m the length of the hillslope is 10 m wide theoretically if the mechanics of the model are validated and functioning appropriately the model geometry could change from a small hillslope to a larger more realistic hillslope profile that can be found in the region the dimensional parameters used to model the hillslope are shown in fig 2 the primary forces that drive the moisture throughout the hillslope are the gradient of the hydraulic head and the capillary action or diffusion process henry darcy first developed this notion and has since become darcy s law hubbert 1957 1 q k d ϕ dl darcy s law is valid only for laminar flow which occurs for reynold s number re less than 1 most practical applications of groundwater flow have re 1 and thus can be modeled with darcy s law darcy s law summarizes water flow through a saturated soil column and can be applied to the specified geometry found in fig 2 if θ is the volume of water per unit volume of soil the time rate of change of moisture θ in a unit soil cube is the divergence of the flow into the soil matrix this notion can be given by the following 2 d θ dt divergence of q k ϕ for unsaturated soil pore space contains both air and water the hydraulic potential is the sum of pressure head p elevation head z soil matric potential ψ and osmotic potential this study assumes that the osmotic potential is negligible the matric potential is the portion of the water potential that can be attributed to the attraction of the soil matrix for water the matric potential used to be called the capillary potential because over a large part of its range the matric potential is due to capillary action however as the water content decreases in a porous material water held in pores due to capillarity becomes negligibly small compared to the water held directly on particle surfaces therefore the term matric potential covers phenomena beyond cases for which a capillary analogy is appropriate kirkham 2005 for unsaturated soil the hydraulic potential is given by 3 ϕ p ψ z the matric potential ψ is a function of moisture content ψ is zero at saturation and above and is negative for lower moisture combining eqs 2 and 3 4 d θ dt k ψ k p k z where ψ d ψ dl d ψ d θ d θ dl d ψ d θ θ d θ dl is the change in moisture content between two points in any direction either in the x y or z direction the term k d ψ d θ is defined as soil diffusivity d this parameter is dependent upon the soil moisture content and is given by 5 d θ k θ d ψ d θ assuming a homogeneous and isotropic soil matrix the k and ψ are scalar functions of θ for a saturated soil profile under equilibrium conditions the pressure head is equal to the height of the saturated layer for unsaturated soil the hydraulic head is less than the height of the soil layer we can assume a linear relationship between pressure head p and moisture content of the soil profile as p h θ θ fc θ s θ fc where h is the depth of the soil element from the surface fig 2 θs is the saturated moisture content and θfc is the moisture content at field capacity fc 33kpa the linear relationship applies to the saturated layer in the soil by definition soil below field capacity is under the force of only gravity and therefore pressure head p is 0 the gradient of p in the horizontal direction is 0 and hence k p z k θ θ fc θ s θ fc k θ s θ fc θ z the gradient of elevation in the vertical direction z z 1 and 0 in the horizontal direction hence 2 z 0 therefore eq 4 can be written as d θ dt d θ k 1 θ s θ fc θ z 0 if θ θ fc 6 d θ dt d θ 0 if θ θ fc both equations in eq 6 are included for completeness and clarity the model setup and initial conditions described in section 2 7 indicate that the soil moisture does not increase beyond θfc the second equation which is applicable for all moisture contents that do not develop positive pressures is sufficient based upon the initial conditions set in the model and was used throughout eq 6 is a generic equation that applies to any soil type although this model is focused on homogeneous soil conditions restrictive layers like argillic and fragipan horizons may exist these restrictive layers reduce the vertical infiltration of water deeper into the soil profile and can form perched water tables brooks et al 2004 the inclusion of these restrictive layers in the composite soil profile helps predict perched water tables and observed rapid subsurface lateral flows brooks et al 2012 mcdaniel et al 2008 2001 2 2 boundary conditions eq 6 provides the governing pde equation for moisture movement inside the soil matrix the moisture distribution around the boundary such as the topsoil surface depends on boundary conditions set in the model the soil surface where the soil exchanges moisture with the environment was developed based upon research by wang et al 2019 this research applied a kelvin equation for heat transfer under dry conditions to calculate the equilibrium matric potential of the soil surface with atmospheric air which is given by 7 ψ a rt mg ln rh where r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 t kelvin is the absolute temperature m is the molecular weight of water 0 018015 kg mol 1 g is the gravitational acceleration 9 81 m s 2 and rh is the in equilibrium relative humidity at soil surface wang et al 2019 analogous to applying newton s law of cooling via convection the rate of evaporation is assumed to be proportional to the difference between soil potential at the surface and air equating the rate of evaporation to the rate of change of moisture content to the surface the following is derived 8 d θ dt ε ψ ψ a where ε l 1t 1 is evaporation constant or factor similar in meaning to convective heat transfer coefficient in thermal systems the evaporation rate ε is defined as the depth of water evaporated per unit of time per unit gradient of matric potential and has units of t 1 the value of ε is a function of the soil temperature wind speed and other energy sources aiding evaporation however for simplicity ε is set to a constant value obtained from lab experiment explained later in section 2 4 was set to 6 25 10 9 combining eq 8 with eq 6 we get the boundary condition 9 n d k 1 θ s θ fc θ ε ψ ψ a note that instead of divergence the derivative is taken in the direction normal to the surface the boundary condition for either side in fig 2 is assumed to be in equilibrium with its neighbor and hence no moisture is exchanged the boundary condition for the bottom is assumed to be at field capacity a separate boundary is constructed for the biochar amendment area allowing for water transmittance across the boundary layer 2 3 finite element analysis with matlab pde solver analytic solution to eq 9 with initial boundary conditions is almost impossible matlab s partial differential equation pde toolbox solves scalar equations of the form expressed in eq 9 since moisture is a scalar quantity and is the only component being considered the scalar form of the equation can be applied matlab pde toolbox was used to solve the partial differential equation in eq 6 matlab has a standard form of the equation mathworks 2006 for its pde solver given by 10 m 2 θ d t 2 d θ dt c θ a θ f for a 3 d representation of the model matlab internally computes c θ as c θ x y z c x 0 0 0 c y 0 0 0 c z θ x θ y θ z for an isotropic diffusivity coefficient eq 6 can be written in matrix form as 11 d θ dt x y z d 0 0 0 d 0 0 0 d k 1 θ s θ r θ

condition is applied in the upper surface where water evaporates matlab s way of specifying neumann boundary conditions is given by the equation 12 n c u qu g comparing eq 12 to eq 9 gives q 0 and g ε ψ ψ a the value of c is the same as shown above the theory and fea approach culminate in the generated mesh for the specified geometry fig 2 the fea mesh is displayed in fig 3 the geometry is confined on both the left and right sides the surface is open to evaporation and the bottom is open to percolation additionally this is a uniform vadose zone profile which is idealistic the mesh size was set to 1 cm the nodes in the black area indicate the biochar amendment area which will have biochar amended soil characteristics the blue nodes indicate control nodes 100 soil biochar is amended to 5 of the hillslope area the initial conditions for the model consist of matric potential diffusivity and hydraulic conductivity values assigned to each node based on laboratory measurements further explained in section 2 6 the initial conditions for the model are the measured values at saturated condition that is explained in detail in section 2 7 the changes in matric potential hydraulic conductivity and diffusivity used by the model as soil moisture depletes are shown in fig 5 2 4 determination of evaporative factor ε the model s output was validated based on statistical comparison between simulated and measured soil moisture sm data the sm data from the model output is easily accessible however the fast pace of biochar development diversity of feedstocks biochar production methods and responses by agricultural horticultural silvicultural and rangeland systems coupled with short funding cycles and the lack of a comprehensive coordinated approach have left significant gaps in biochar s knowledge base amonette et al 2021 these knowledge gaps have generated a need for coordinated large scale regionally focused long term studies of biochar production and application to answer questions about the technology s cost and potential impact and guide future development amonette et al 2021 these factors create a lack of easily accessible long term field data required for biochar model calibration the lack of knowledge and measured biochar sm data led to calibrating the redistribution model through other means an experiment was designed to monitor changes in sm for a confined saturated soil core over time evaporation off the soil s surface was the singular driving force for this experiment the model s geometry and conditions could then be changed to match the experimental setup and conditions allowing for direct comparison between simulated and measured sm data recalling eq 8 d θ dt ε ψ ψ a the evaporation constant ε is deemed a constant value for simplicity inherently ε is a function of evaporative forces like wind speed air temperature and radiation which would ordinarily change throughout a specified time step but not the case here the evaporative factor ε can therefore be iteratively determined to better match the measured simulated sm data to the observed sm data by running multiple model simulations with changed ε values 2 5 sample composition and preparation to assess the effectiveness of biochar in moisture redistribution a mixture of soil samples and biochar samples were measured for soil hydraulic properties in a laboratory setting disturbed soil was collected at the university of idaho parker farm outside of moscow idaho the soil throughout the region is dominated by palouse silt loam soil classified as fine silty mixed superactive mesic pachic ultic haploxerolls ncss 2013 soil samples were sieved with a no 6 mesh sieve diameter 3 35 mm usa standard testing sieve astm e 11 specification to ensure that larger soil aggregates and rocks did not create a higher degree of variability during experimentation biochar were obtained through carbon logic llc part of ag energy solutions in spokane washington a redwood sawdust rsd and a wheat straw ws biochar were used which was produced from gasification the two biochar samples are displayed below in fig 4 proximal analysis corresponding with astm proximate analysis procedures was performed on both biochar samples surface area analysis was performed by using the brunauer emmett teller bet methodology the coefficient of uniformity was determined by sieve analysis american geosciences institute defines coefficient of uniformity as the ratio of the sieve size through which 60 by weight of the material passes to the sieve size that allows 10 of the material to pass relevant biochar properties are shown in table 1 other biochar properties fall within the ranges reported by jatav et al 2021 biochar samples were added to the soil and manually mixed until a homogenous mixture was formed both rsd and ws samples were mixed at 0 100 soil 4 and 7 concentration by dry mass this allowed for the determination of the potential trends from increasing the biochar concentration on soil hydraulic properties each sample was manually mixed using stir sticks until a homogenous mixture formed samples were mixed in bulk and then stored for later testing textural analysis and other soil characteristics for all samples were performed by best test analytics in moses lake washington the external soil lab received disturbed soil samples which needed to be reconstituted for specific soil tests analysis exp bulk density bd textural analysis was determined by mechanical analysis hydrometer methodology the soil textural analysis displayed 26 sand 58 silt and 16 clay this is indicative of a silt loam soil which is the primary soil in the region the organic matter om was determined by the walkley black om testing methodology walkley and black 1934 key soil properties of interest are tabulated below in table 2 the data presented in table 2 combines values obtained from the external laboratory and estimations made from the hyprop more information can be found in section 2 6 an important thing to note regarding the initial soil sample properties in table 2 is the om values for each of the samples the control sample has an om value that is high for a palouse silt loam soil this deviation from a typical value of 2 9 national cooperative soil survey 2021 is likely due to sample collection the soil that was collected was disturbed and therefore it lacked the typical structure found in the soil furthermore more om may have been introduced when it was disturbed accounted for by the higher initial om content of the control despite this the general trend observed between samples is consistent with what is expected with biochar amendment in soil furthermore intuitively biochar amendment primarily organic carbon would increase the om of the soil to larger values than observed through walkley black testing upon evaluation the testing service noted that some biochar in each sample floated in the chromate and sulfuric acid solution when testing using the walkley black testing methodology this likely caused the discrepancies between the measured and the expected changes in om 2 6 experimental setup for determining soil hydraulic properties the driving equation for the fea model eq 6 utilizes soil hydraulic properties matric potential hydraulic conductivity k and diffusivity d the soil hydraulic properties for the different soil samples were measured or derived by using a combination of the hyprop from meter group campbell et al 2015 wp4c dew point potentiometer from meter group and fundamental soil physics model equations provided by van genuchten 1980 paper van genuchten 1980 the hyprop follows the simplified evaporation method developed by schindler in 1980 schindler et al 2010 this method measures the matric potential of a confined saturated soil core saturated from the bottom to remove air as the soil sample dries the matric potential is measured by two tensiometers at two different heights in the soil column to account for the disturbed nature of the initial soil samples each sample was intentionally packed into the soil rings prior to testing the control was packed into the soil ring to a targeted bulk density throughout the region 1 20 g cm3 national cooperative soil survey 2021 each following sample was then packed following the same procedure to ensure that there was no significant variation in compaction between samples the developed procedure reduces the effects of potential compaction between samples and creates support for the biochar affecting the bd of the samples consistent with both the samples tested at the external laboratory table 2 and literature masiello et al 2019b each soil sample was tested in replicate 4 times per sample the results from each replicate were averaged and compiled to obtain a representative average soil hydraulic property for each sample utilizing the measured matric potential values the van genuchten model with m 1 1 n can be applied to derive values of unsaturated k and diffusivity d these equations are described in further detail in the original work yet they are presented as follows 13 k r θ θ 1 2 1 1 θ 1 m m 2 14 k θ k r k sat where kr θ is the relative hydraulic conductivity at any given water content cm day ksat is the saturated hydraulic conductivity cm day θ θ θ r θ s θ r m is a van genuchten parameter d θ is the diffusivity at any given water content and d ψ is the difference in matric potential between water contents and dθ is the difference in water contents kr can be converted to k θ by utilizing eq 13 eq 13 and 14 lead to an indirect estimation of k θ for different soils the ksat value in equation 14 is key to the hyprop accurately estimating k θ of a soil sample ksat values can either be directly measured externally and input into the hyprop software or estimated from pedotransfer functions ptfs the ksat values presented in this work were estimated using ptfs found in rosetta a natural resources conservation service nrcs soil tool which is found as a neural network in hydrus 1d an additional nrcs soil tool šimůnek et al 2013 rosetta utilizes a hierarchical approach to estimate the ksat for different soil samples utilizing more data regarding the soil sample for more specific equations three levels of ptfs were used to estimate the ksat values the first ptf utilized soil texture sand silt and clay and bd the second ptf utilizes the soil texture bd and field capacity fc where fc θv at 33 kpa the third ptf equation uses soil texture bd fc and permanent wilting point pwp where pwp θv at 1500 kpa biochar s influence on ksat was accounted for through changes in bd fc and pwp changes to soil texture while likely were ignored the estimated ksat values from each of the three ptfs were then averaged to obtain the overall estimated ksat values for each of the soil samples eqs 5 13 and 14 are applicable to the moisture range between the residual θr and the saturated θs water contents in nature the soil at the surface and a thin layer below may go below θr if the environment is sufficiently dry or drought conditions occur to account for the potential drought conditions there was a need to model soil hydraulic properties beyond θr research performed by campbell and shiozawa 1992 illustrated that at moisture contents below θr film flow water movement prevails and will decrease linearly with the log scale matric suction campbell and shiozawa 1992 below θr the matric suction and film water content relationship can be expressed as 15 ψ ψ 0 ψ θ r ψ 0 θ θ r as suggested by schneider and goss 2012 ψ 0 is the air dry moisture of soil ψ 0 6 3 104 m schneider and goss 2012 according to research from wang et al 2019 applicable for film flow below θr the conductivity of the soil can then be determined by the following wang et al 2019 16 k k θ r θ θ r ψ ψ θ r 2 3 the diffusivity is less complex to model below θr since the diffusivity is a function of both matric potential and hydraulic conductivity once both these properties are determined the diffusivity at any moisture content is known based on eq 5 for inputting the soil hydraulic data into the model the water content increased linearly from 0 to θs the magnitude of each saturation range is unique to each sample due to biochar affecting the θs for the samples the moisture content increases at a rate of 0 5 moisture over the entire range providing adequate resolution for the model the data were averaged across all four replicates and compiled for matlab 2 7 initial conditions and model setup hourly temperature and relative humidity data for 2010 were downloaded from noaa meteorological data noaa 2021 national weather service data for spokane airport outside of spokane washington this is required to estimate soil evaporation based upon eq 8 the downloaded data had an hourly record of dew point and dry bulb temperature relative humidity was derived from psychrometric relation based on the august roche magnus approximation which implies that saturation vapor pressure changes approximately exponentially with temperature under typical atmospheric conditions regional weather data provides adequate representation for the climate humidity and temperature in the palouse region the model operates under the assumption that this is a bare hillslope has no vegetation and the soil is isometric and uniform the entire field is held initially at field capacity at 33 kpa fc 33kpa positive pressure in the profile is not a factor the field capacity is set by the soil sample that is applied to the soil i e if biochar amendment occurs the amendment area is initially at biochar s fc 33kpa values these conditions represent a late spring field after sufficient rainfall the model is assumed to begin on april 30th and will dry over the next two months 60 days under the primary forces of evaporation and water redistribution there is no further precipitation input into the system over the 60 days of simulation the modeled evaporation is allowed only on nodes along the surface and driven by the matric potential difference between the air and the node on any given day eq 8 the moisture underneath is transported to the surface by diffusion process driven by matric potential gradient to assess biochar s potential integration into precision agriculture an application region was chosen on the hillslope profile biochar was amended to 5 of the hillslope and at a depth of 30 cm all samples could be applied to the hillslope allowing for comparison in effect across both biochar type and concentration it is important to note that biochar was applied to a uniform soil profile a uniform profile disregards the argillic and fragipan horizons that can form throughout various topographies in the palouse these hardpan layers drive subsurface lateral flow in the soil profiles which are important for understanding stored water and redistribution throughout a hillslope brooks et al 2004 applying biochar to a uniform soil profile will still provide valuable insights into how biochar can affect water redistribution in undulating topography but may not be uniformly representative of all applications in the palouse the biochar amendment zone is indicated as black dots in fig 3 each mesh node was initially assigned the mean value of matric potential hydraulic conductivity and diffusivity pertaining to the specific biochar amendment presented in table 3 matlab allows each node within a defined zone to have specific initial conditions and hydraulic properties this feature was used to calculate zone specific moisture movement using hydraulic properties from fig 5 finally the effectiveness of biochar amendment from this model will depend on the initial conditions set for the simulation the results presented in this research depict one specific scenario and outcome changing the initial conditions will change the final output from the model rendering biochar either effective or ineffective depending on the model inputs universal blanket statements regarding the effectiveness of biochar in all scenarios should be avoided 3 results and discussion 3 1 biochar s effects on silt loam soil hydraulic properties in general increasing the concentration of biochar amendment reduced the bd g cm3 of the soil table 2 this was consistent for all types and concentrations increasing biochar amendment increased soil porosity table 2 the reduction in bd and increases in porosity from biochar was statistically significant from control biochar amendment in silt loam soil did influence the soil s hydraulic properties which is consistent with literature biederman and harpole 2013 castellini et al 2015 el naggar et al 2019 hardie et al 2014 jeffery et al 2019 masiello et al 2019a the bulk density bd presented in table 3 was for hyprop following recommended compaction procedure it is important to note that they are not significantly different from the bd in table 2 which indicates that the compaction procedure during samples preparation did not affect results the fc is reported at two tensions 33 kpa fc 33kpa and 6 kpa fc 6kpa the computed van genuchten vg parameters from the hyprop are also shown in table 3 values in this table show the averages of the four replicates with standard deviation a t test was conducted for fc 33kpa fc 6kpa pwp 1500kpa residual moisture content θr and saturated moisture content θs between biochar treated and control at 95 confidence interval ci the statistically significant values are noted in table 3 in general biochar amendment showed a mixed effect on field capacity rsd biochar application decreased field capacity while ws biochar reduced the field capacity this may be due to the variation in biochar particle size reflected from the coefficient of uniformity the rsd biochar had a coefficient of uniformity less than half of ws biochar table 1 low coefficient of uniformity of rsd mean more heterogeneous size distribution and hence reduced the fc ws biochar with a higher coefficient of uniformity in general increased the fc from table 2 table 3 and eqs 13 through 16 fig 5 was constructed displaying the matric potential hydraulic conductivity and diffusivity curves for each sample the maric potentials in fig 5 are actually negative values showing their magnitudes fig 5 shows minimal change to water retention through matric potentials please note that they are negative values indicating suction potential and presented as positive numbers ranging from 102 to 105 cm with biochar amendment despite more deviation from the control at tensions around 105 cm the changes to pwp and θr were minimal due to extremely low hydraulic conductivity is and that it falls near pwp the effect from biochar amendment are insignificant in this moisture range however towards saturated conditions biochar showed more significant effects as biochar significantly changes the soil hydraulic conductivity in wet conditions at a higher moisture range above 0 35 for a given matric potential biochar application showed increased moisture retention the difference was larger for higher matric potential fig 5a the increase in water retention with biochar is due to higher porosity in biochar this is consistent with devereux et al 2013 and gaskin et al 2007 who showed increases in the water holding capacity at tensions from 20 kpa to 100 kpa devereux et al 2013 gaskin et al 2007 the net increase however is dependent on the type of biochar biochar with a higher uniformity coefficient showed a greater increase in moisture retention this indicates that the particle size and surface interactions affected the pore characteristics in the soil differently liu et al 2017 the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat values estimated from the ptfs showed significant 95 ci increases in ksat when amended with biochar both concentration and type from fig 5 biochar amendment reduces unsaturated hydraulic conductivity as the soil approached saturated conditions moisture contents 35 these findings were consistent with research performed by barnes et al 2014 they found that despite an increase in porosity and a reduction in bd the hydraulic conductivity of the soil decreased further this research pointed to two mechanisms driving these effects the internal structure and the higher field capacity of biochar they described that the high internal porosity of the biochar creates two theoretical flow pathways for water to move one in the interstitial space between the soil and biochar particles and the second within the biochar itself the second of which increase the tortuosity of the soil which would decrease k lastly their research pointed to the idea that biochar has a high field capacity and therefore water may have continued to be absorbed by the biochar leading to an observation of an apparent decrease in k despite more water being in the soil barnes et al 2014 the shape of the diffusivity curve mimics the conductivity curves for each of the soil samples the effects of biochar both concentration 4 and 7 and type rsd and ws were consistent between the conductivity and diffusivity curves 3 2 model output both rsd and ws amendments were simulated using the developed model consistent with the initial conditions and theory described in section 2 7 both biochar types were amended at 4 and 7 concentrations by dry mass the model simulated the drying of the soil for 60 days beginning on april 30th of 2010 and tracked the changes in soil moisture on an hourly basis fig 6 displays moisture difference plots biochar amendment minus the control at the end of the simulation with each of the biochar amendments positive values on the legend right of each plot equate to areas with more moisture from biochar amendment the black contour line denotes a zero difference contour line the areas outside the zero contour line indicate a reduction in moisture content or no change whereas the area inside the contour line displays increased moisture content all biochar samples showed an increase in moisture content in and around the amendment area the magnitude in which the retention increased varied between each of the samples with the 7 rsd having the largest increase in moisture content upwards of a 0 5 increase in some areas compared to the control the 4 ws sample showed a smaller maximum increase in retention with just over 0 02 increase from the control the 4 rsd and 7 ws samples showed similar increases in retention leading to a maximum increase in retention of 0 06 and 0 1 increase from the control for the 4 rsd and 7 ws respectively these effects are also minimal all samples showed a decrease in moisture content on either side adjacent to the amendment area there was no additional water input into the system throughout the simulation which indicates that less moisture was distributed laterally from the top of the hillslope leading to less moisture in these areas the model output shows that biochar does change how moisture is retained and redistributed in the soil the zero contour lines indicate differences in vertical redistribution of water deeper into the soil profile the 4 rsd sample showed the most vertical redistribution of water into the soil profile the 4 rsd amendment had the highest diffusivity fig 5b of all amendments which would account for more vertical moisture redistribution into deeper portions of the soil profile even under dry conditions the increase in moisture content was larger for the higher application rate the 7 rsd provided the highest increase in moisture retention at the hilltop it is important to note that this discussion involves the change in moisture observed at the end of the simulation while the results at the end of the simulation highlight the potential effects of biochar deep into the growing season it does not provide a full picture of biochar s effects on soil water throughout the entire simulation as the change in moisture at the end of the simulation is minimal in most samples any changes to moisture content from biochar amendment are cumulative and any difference in moisture observed at any point in the simulation would influence theoretical hydrologic and crop processes the developed model allows for the animation of the output over time which can be found at youtu be ip5yzsixfim an indication of the cumulative effect of biochar can be ascertained by plotting the change in the moisture content of a specific node in the mesh over time fig 7 displays the moisture difference between a respective biochar amendment and the control sample for a specific node in the soil profile over time the node is located in the middle of hillslope near the soil surface in the amendment area and 10 cm below the hilltop soil surface initially all samples showed a reduction in moisture content when amended with biochar this is attributed to the differences in the fc 33kpa with biochar amendment despite the initial decrease in moisture content all samples showed eventual increases in moisture content over time as the season progressed and soil became drier the magnitude of the changes in moisture content varied depending on the amendment type and concentration 3 3 determination of evaporative factor ε fig 8 displays the simulated sm achieved with the chosen ε value plotted against the measured sm data from the experiment the value of ε was determined iteratively using matlab by comparing predicted moisture and observed moisture choosing the value that best fit the measured moisture using eq 9 a constant value of ε 6 25 10 9 produced the lowest error between observed and predicted moisture fig 8 with a coefficient of determination r2 0 99 mean absolute error of 0 003 and a percent bias of 0 3 the results indicate that the current model performs adequately a larger field experiment will be needed to determine ε as a function of other environmental variables 4 conclusion amending the silt loam soil with redwood sawdust or wheat straw biochar showed a possibility of changing the water redistribution and retention in an undulating soil profile increasing the biochar amendment concentration correlated with more soil water holding capacities during dry months biochar amendment had less impact on water retention through most unsaturated range however as the soil approached saturation or near saturated conditions θ 0 35 the biochar helped the soil retain more water there was an apparent reduction in unsaturated k for both amendment types and concentrations despite estimated increases in ksat the developed vadose zone model showed promise as a tool for predicting changes in soil moisture over time with varied biochar amendments over the simulated period of 60 days the amended soil with 7 rsd showed increased soil moisture up to 0 5 at the tops of the hillslopes while the magnitude of the increase in retention varied amongst samples the results are promising and prompt further investigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following financial interests personal

9111,deficit irrigation can maximize the water productivity wp of guayule and increase the percent rubber r in shrubs compared to irrigation meeting full crop evapotranspiration etc in this study we hypothesize that certain deficit irrigation strategies that impose soil water deficits during specific periods of growth or throughout the growing season might produce higher r and equivalent rubber yield ry thereby increasing wp compared to full irrigation herein growth and yield responses of direct seeded guayule to different water deficit schemes were evaluated in an experiment on a silty clay loam soil in a field in central arizona using furrow irrigation two guayule cultivars az2 and az6 were grown for 22 5 months apr 2020 mar 2022 in a split plot design with six irrigation treatments in whole plots and cultivars in split plots after homogeneous irrigation for two months irrigation treatments were begun a control treatment was irrigated to meet full etc the other five treatments were irrigated with less water using various deficit irrigation strategies imposed during the two year growing period measurements included plant height h cover fraction fc soil water contents harvest of dry biomass db ry resin yield rey r and percent resin re total water applied twa by irrigation and precipitation to treatments varied from 2780 to 1084 mm and db varied from 20 5 to 9 1 mg ha 1 the h and fc were significantly greater at higher irrigation levels while they were also significantly greater in az6 than az2 the db ry and rey generally increased linearly with twa however it was found that a treatment applying every other irrigation of the control resulted in statistically equivalent yields to the control with 36 less irrigation the r generally decreased with twa while re did not change however db r and re were significantly greater for az2 than az6 as were ry rey and wp among the deficit treatments evaluated every other irrigation offers the best strategy to significantly increase guayule wp without causing a yield penalty keywords rubber soil water water productivity evapotranspiration crop coefficient data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction guayule parthenium argentatum a gray is a perennial shrub native to the desert of northcentral mexico and southwestern texas that produces high quality natural rubber nr appropriate for usage in commercial grade tires rasutis et al 2015 eranki et al 2018 besides nr guayule produces valuable co products such as resin and biofuels nakayama 2005 rasutis et al 2015 guayule commercialization efforts to achieve a domestic supply of nr have a longstanding history in the u s desert southwest ray et al 2010 where efforts have accelerated in recent years due to increasing nr demands and disruptions in imported nr supplies from overseas eranki et al 2018 a crucial breakthrough to advancing commercialization is that guayule crops can now be successfully established in fields by direct seeding in soil rather than by transplanting a method which has proven to be cost prohibitive for growers elshikha et al 2021 wang et al 2020 optimal seed germination rates for the most available cultivar az 2 occur when average daytime air temperatures are about 22 c wang et al 2020 the optimal planting windows for germination in the region are either late apr to mid may or mid oct the apr may planting is desirable because of the subsequent weather conditions needed for achieving active growth a significant challenge to expanding guayule production is that drastic water reductions for agriculture are occurring due to ongoing drought conditions in u s desert regions direct seeded guayule can require a significant amount of irrigation for germination and crop establishment the shallow planted seed needs to be wetted on a near daily basis to keep the surface soil wet until emergence is complete which may take two three weeks bucks et al 1986 following emergence irrigation is needed until the crop is fully established two three months after planting bucks et al 1986 the amount of irrigation needed to meet crop evapotranspiration etc of guayule has been determined to be on the order of 1300 1500 mm per year bucks et al 1985b nakayama 1991 hunsaker and elshikha 2017 during guayule s active growing period in the u s desert early spring through mid fall biomass measured on a dry weight basis db increases with irrigation typically linearly for two to four year old shrubs bucks et al 1985c nakayama et al 1991 hunsaker et al 2019 while the rubber bearing tissues are produced in the stems branches and roots during active growth it is widely believed that the percent rubber r content of the shrub is increased during periods of limited growth due to soil water deficit and other stresses such as cold temperatures benedict et al 1947 kelly 1975 wang et al 2022 as a perennial desert shrub once guayule is established after planting it is extremely drought tolerant and can survive extended periods without water application bucks et al 1985a foster and coffelt 2005 however the relative gain in r due to high soil water stress and limited growth may or may not be enough to achieve rubber yield ry similar to or greater than that for fully irrigated guayule disparate results on the relationship between ry and soil water depletion exist in the literature many studies on guayule grown in lighter soil types in u s desert areas have shown that the ry was significantly greater when the root zone soil water depletion during active growth was maintained at less than 55 65 versus higher depletion levels hunter and kelley 1946 miyamoto et al 1984 bucks et al 1985a 1985b hunsaker and elshikha 2017 elshikha et al 2021 however exceptions to those results are found in the literature for example veihmeyer and hendrickson 1961 on a sandy loam soil in the state of california showed no difference in ry after two years between a well irrigated treatment maximum 40 depletion a treatment irrigated about every other time of the former and a treatment not irrigated during the entire second year the literature on guayule yield responses to irrigation for studies conducted on heavier soil types that have higher soil water retention is not extensive though the body indicates that less rather than more irrigation increases ry the hunter and kelley 1946 results on a silty clay loam soil in california show significantly less ry was attained when soil water depletion was maintained at 25 versus much higher depletion levels they provide evidence that maintaining low soil water depletion during the first year of growth and then terminating irrigation during the second summer of guayule does not curtail db but does increase r compared to the well watered treatments further hunter and kelley 1946 show significantly greater r and ry for treatments with minimal irrigation after crop establishment where soil water depletion reached 100 for an appreciable amount of time in more recent studies in arizona using direct seeding on a clay to silty clay loam soil elshikha et al 2021 and wang et al 2022 reported greater ry for the treatment receiving 50 less irrigation maintained at about 75 soil water depletion than that applied to the 100 etc replacement treatment 55 maximum soil water depletion also significantly greater water productivity wp rubber yield per unit of total water applied twa pereira et al 2012 was achieved with 50 less irrigation in that study benedict et al 1947 and veihmeyer and hendrickson 1961 suggest that a significant increase in r accumulation can be forced in guayule by alternating periods of low and high soil water deficits compared to maintaining low soil water deficits over the growing period as attained with fully irrigated guayule they indicate these alternating periods of soil water deficit should be maintained throughout the active growing season rather than in the non active winter growth period the natural plant resin in guayule is found in all parts of the shrub including the leaves compared to ry there has been less attention focused on studying irrigation strategies to enhance the resin yield rey of guayule the percent resin re content of the whole plant generally varies from about 7 10 ray et al 2010 and has been shown to either increase or decrease with irrigation amount in field studies bucks et al 1985b hunsaker and elshikha 2017 hunsaker et al 2019 elshikha et al 2021 for guayule grown in the above studies for two years the rey increased often significantly at higher irrigation amounts on lighter soils but showed less variability among irrigation levels on the heavier soil elshikha et al 2021 guayule growers in the u s southwest will likely not have an irrigation delivery close to that needed to meet 100 of etc 1300 1500 mm per year for guayule grown on lighter soils some literature indicates an irrigation deficit of 20 25 for full etc would not reduce ry significantly bucks et al 1985a 1985b hunsaker and elshikha 2017 elshikha et al 2021 however on heavier soils there appears to be a greater opportunity to reduce irrigation water use even much more than 25 in this study we hypothesize that certain deficit irrigation strategies that impose high water stress during a specific period of the guayule s ontogeny or throughout the entire growing season might result in equivalent or even higher rubber yields due to increased rubber content compared to fully irrigated guayule in particular reduction of irrigation during summer when etc demands and growth are highest may provide a significant increase in the ry wp to date guayule irrigation research on growth and yield responses to specifically planned soil water deficits is limited and almost totally absent for direct seeded guayule therefore we conducted a field experiment on a heavier soil type in central arizona that exposed direct seeded guayule to various pre determined soil water deficit periods over a 22 5 month long growing season the objectives of the study were 1 to evaluate the effects of planned deficit irrigation on guayule growth parameters db r re ry rey and wp and 2 to determine optimum deficit irrigation strategies for two cultivars that are being considered for guayule commercialization 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design

method irrigation plots were blocked on the far end of the field with berms so that all water applied remained in the plot area because the two guayule cultivars were embedded within each irrigation treatment both cultivars in the treatment were irrigated simultaneously in may 2020 2 25 m long 51 mm diameter galvanized steel access tubes were installed vertically in the soil in the 3rd row of each 4 row plot during installation of access tubes for the neutron probe using a tractor mounted soil sampler model 25 ts giddings machine comp windsor co usa soil samples were collected as described

below the surface in 0 30 m increments measurements began on may 21 2020 and were made at all 36 plot locations every 7 9 days may nov 2020 and apr nov 2021 and about every two weeks during winter months differential treatment irrigation amounts were initiated on july 16 2020 following the two months of establishment irrigations apr jun 2020 one treatment i1 served as the baseline control treatment whose irrigation scheduling was based on a soil water balance swb of the rooting depth zr eq 1 1 d r i d r i 1 p i i i cr i ro i et c i dp i where dr i and dr i 1 are the root zone depletion mm at the end of day i and day i 1 respectively and pi ii cri roi etc i and dpi are amounts of precipitation net irrigation depth capillary rise runoff from the soil surface crop et and deep percolation respectively on day i all in units of mm cri and roi were considered zero due to the low groundwater table and the use of blocked furrows respectively the inputs for ii were the average measured irrigation depths given to the three i1 treatment replicates inputs of pi were provided by the azmet weather station for the site when pi was less 1 0 mm it was assumed negligible and not applied in eq 1 daily values of total available water tawi of the daily rooting depth zr i were calculated as 2 taw i 1000 z r i fc wp where tawi is in mm zr i in m and field capacity fc and wilting point wp are in m3 m 3 the fc and wp used for tawi were the average field values provided in table 2 over the estimated zr i the limits for dr i in eq 1 are zero at fc and taw at pwp since dr i cannot be less than zero on a given day i following irrigation and or precipitation an amount for dpi was computed when necessary to balance eq 1 if dr i was less than zero on day i daily percent soil water depletion swdi was calculated as 3 swd i 100 1 taw i d r i taw i where swdi is in percent and tawi and dr i are as previously defined the daily zr for the swb of eq 1 began with an initial depth of 0 60 m for the first 60 days after planting dap was increased to a depth of 1 20 m for 61 210 dap and then was increased to a maximum zr of 2 0 m from 211 dap mid nov 2020 through the end of the growing season the modeled changes in zr were developed from soil water depletion patterns observed during the first seven months of spring planted direct seeded guayule as reported by elshikha et al 2021 the i1 irrigation scheduling was intended to maintain swdi between 20 and 65 to minimize dpi irrigation application amounts for i1 were planned to restore 80 of calculated dr i in mm limiting the maximum swd to 65 for i1 provided a depletion level that has been reported as sufficient for guayule to minimize the effects of reduced etc due to water stress hunsaker and elshikha 2017 bucks et al 1985a 1985b initiation of eq 1 was on the day of seeding i e day i 1 where it was assumed that the dr i 1 in eq 1 for the 0 60 m depth was the taw calculated as 99 mm during the first 30 dap prior to nnm measurements of θv eq 1 used the dual crop coefficient procedures of fao 56 allen et al 1998 to estimate etc i 4 et c i k cb i k e i et o i where etc i is estimated mm kcb i is the basal crop coefficient unitless ke i is the soil evaporation coefficient unitless and eto i is the penman monteith grass reference evapotranspiration mm provided by the azmet weather station for the site prior to θv measurements the kcb i was estimated as 0 20 based on kcb data derived for early season well watered direct seeded guayule elshikha et al 2021 the ke i values were calculated following ii and pi events using fao56 methods which require a separate swb of the soil evaporation layer ze assumed as 0 10 m 5 d e i d e i 1 p i i i f w i e s i f ew i dp e i where de i and de i 1 are the cumulative depth of evaporation following wetting of the exposed and wetted fraction of the surface soil at the end of day i and end of day i 1 respectively pi and ii are as previously defined es i is soil evaporation and dpe i is deep percolation loss if soil water content exceeds fc on day i where all these variables are in units of mm the fw i and few i are the fraction of the soil surface wetted by pi and ii and the exposed and wetted fraction respectively on day i dimensionless for the ze swb calculations value of the readily evaporable water rew was 10 mm for the silty clay surface soil and total evaporable water tew was calculated using the fc and wp values for the 0 30 m depth table 2 using the tew equation in allen et al 1998 the tew was calculated as 27 9 mm for the 0 10 m soil evaporation layer and tew was the de i 1 value used in the model at seeding following ii and pi events 1 0 mm depletion of ze was calculated on a daily basis by eq 5 stage 1 drying energy limiting occurred until cumulative de i was greater than rew stage 2 drying falling rate was determined by eq 6 6 k r i tew d e i 1 tew rew where kr i is the daily evaporation reduction coefficient calculated for de i 1 rew whereas kr i 1 0 during stage 1 drying the ke i were computed as 7 k e i min k r i k cmax i k cb i f ew i k cmax i where kr i kcb i and few i in eq 7 are as previously defined and kcmax i is the maximum daily value of the combined kcb and ke i coefficients that can occur following ii or pi and is a function of mean daily u2 daily rhmin and estimated daily crop height h the limit for kcmax i was constrained to kcb i 0 05 allen et al 1998 other parameters required in the ke i calculations include fraction of canopy cover fc and the wetting fractions fw of the irrigation systems which were 1 0 for both sprinkler and level furrow irrigation i e 100 surface water coverage for the h and fc we used the average i1 treatment height and cover that were measured intermittently section 2 5 and interpolated for daily estimates starting on may 21 2020 measured θv was used to quantify the actual etc etc act for the i1 treatment swb model eq 1 actual etc was calculated as the residual of the swb for periods bounded by two adjacent dates of θv measurements eq 8 8 et cact d r 2 d r 1 i p dp where etc act is the total actual et mm that occurred in the period from the first 1

depth of average treatment measured irrigation mm total measured precipitation and total deep percolation below the root zone mm that occurred during the period the total etc act for each period were used to model actual et etc act i on a daily basis where the sum of etc act i was required to be equal to the total etc act in the period but whose individual values varied according to daily eto and daily soil evaporation the etc act i values in each period were found by iteration of the fao56 dual kc calculations until daily values of kcb ke i eto i summed to total etc act in the period eq 9 9

each day i to j in a given period ke i is the soil evaporation coefficient on day i and eto i is the pm eto mm on day i and etc act i is daily actual crop et mm on day i the ke i were determined with the fao56 dual kc procedures using the same ke parameters described earlier after two months of guayule germination establishment irrigations ending on jun 21 2020 the i1 treatment was irrigated another six times through mid nov 2020 irrigation for the i1 treatment during the year 2020 was terminated after mid nov 2020 irrigation from march 2021 late winter onward the i1 treatment received a total of 10 irrigations in calendar year 2021 where its final irrigation before harvest was in late oct 2021 the five other treatments i2 i6 each received the same irrigation as i1 through jun 21 2020 the principles regarding the irrigation scheduling for the i2 i6 treatments after the establishment irrigations are as follows considering the suppositions of hunter and kelly 1946 on a silty clay loam soil the i2 and i3 treatments were fully irrigated for the first 15 and 11 months after planting i e through early jul 2021 and early mar 2021 respectively table 2 through those dates the i2 and i3 were irrigated on the same days with essentially the same amounts as i1 the assumption was that etc and db accumulation for the i2 and i3 treatments up to those points in the growing season would be comparable to that in the fully irrigated i1 treatment in previous direct seeded guayule experiments at eloy fully irrigated guayule achieved 100 cover at 10 months after planting in april whereas maximum guayule biomass was achieved by 15 months elshikha et al 2021 wang et al 2022 thus the premise behind the i2 treatment strategy was that after 15 months of growth a significant amount of irrigation water could be saved by terminating irrigation altogether while achieving about the same db expected for the full irrigation schedule of i1 treatment further the soil water stress that would be imposed upon i2 during the final seven months prior to harvest table 2 might result in higher r versus i1 and thus higher ry the hypothesis for the i3 treatment strategy was similar to that for i2 except that i3 after 11 months of full irrigation was given a single spring and a single fall irrigation in 2021 table 2 we considered that these two irrigations would boost the treatment s biomass accumulation somewhat in 2021 but by not irrigating i3 during the peak etc and growth period of summer total water use would be reduced and rubber production would be stimulated due to the stress imposed during the summer period although final biomass for i3 under this scenario was anticipated to be less than that for the fully irrigated i1 it was also expected that r would be higher for i3 than i1 due to the high soil water deficit imposed during the summer of 2021 table 2 the irrigation amounts applied in spring and fall 2021 to i3 were based on soil water content measurements such that the soil water depletion measured just prior to the irrigations was fully replenished to fc the i4 i6 treatments were designed to re consider some of the successful results of reduced irrigation presented in early guayule research by hunter and kelley 1946 benedict et al 1947 and veihmeyer and hendrickson 1961 all refer strategies to force higher r accumulation in shrubs by alternating periods of high and low water stress during the active growing season the i4 treatment was to receive 50 of the irrigation water needed for the fully irrigated guayule i1 treatment after crop establishment starting in mid jul 2020 the i4 irrigation timing followed the i1 schedule but i4 irrigations were only applied every other time the i1 treatment was irrigated table 2 thus the i4 scheduling regime was similar to a veihmeyer and hendrickson 1961 alternating irrigation treatment but it was started in the first year of our experiment the irrigation water applied to i4 were planned to be the same amounts as those given to i1 on every other irrigation date thus when i4 was not irrigated the soil water stress in the treatment would increase whereas when not irrigated the water stress would be alleviated the i5 and i6 treatments table 2 were included to evaluate the effects of much more prolonged periods of extreme soil water deficit followed by infrequent periods of low water stress through occasional irrigation after the last establishment irrigation the i5 treatment was to receive only two additional irrigations in the first year of growth planned for late summer 2020 and late winter 2021 plus two irrigations during the second year of growth planned for mid spring 2021 and early fall 2021 for i6 one additional irrigation was given during the first year of growth late summer 2020 plus one during the second year of growth early spring 2021 as for i3 the supplemental irrigation amounts applied to i5 and i6 replaced the soil water depletion measured just prior to the irrigations to fc fertilizer was applied to all treatments on jul 15 2020 in the form of urea ammonium nitrate 32 n which was injected into the water to all treatment plots at a rate of 65 kg n ha 1 the same rate was applied to treatments in mar 15 2021 this rate 65 kg n ha 1 per year was suggested by bucks et al 1985a for adequate growth for guayule plants and was used in recent guayule studies by hunsaker and elshikha 2017 and hunsaker et al 2019 the injection was done using a single head hydraulic diaphragm chemigation injection pump baldor motor vl3504 santa fe springs ca usa the pump was connected through injection ports to the mainline delivering the water to the furrow plots 2 5 plant growth measurements manual measurements of guayule h and canopy widths were made for nine plants per plot starting on june 12 2020 thereafter h and width measurements were made about every 30 days which continued until mar 2022 canopy width data were used to calculate fc as a percent by eq 10 10 f c w ew w ns 1 p d 100 where w ew is plant width in the east west direction m w ns is plant width in the north south direction m and 1 p d is planting area 1 plant density p d m 2 whole plant samples were harvested on mar 01 2022 22 5 months after planting three 2 m2 sections from each plot were hand harvested all plant harvests were limited to the inner two rows of each plot to minimize any edge effects on plant growth plants were cut at the ground level stover and immediately weighed for fresh weight and then air dried outdoors on shaded wire shelves for 7 days and re weighed for dry weight coffelt and ray 2010 plants were shredded and ground before a subsample was taken and placed in the oven at 140 c for 24 h to remove remaining moisture and then re weighed samples were analyzed at bridgestone americas inc eloy for r and re determined using a soxhlet based near infrared spectroscopy nir method that has high correlation to other guayule rubber analysis methods placido et al 2020 2 6 statistical analyses irrigation and cultivar effects were analyzed statistically using a randomized split plot model with proc mixed sas institute inc 2016 for the

excel 3 results 3 1 irrigation precipitation soil water depletion and crop evapotranspiration the irrigation amounts and the number of irrigations applied to the six treatments are summarized in table 3 prior to differential irrigation a total of 511 mm was applied apr jun 2020 to all treatment plots initially through a sprinkler system 293 mm then by level furrow irrigation 218 mm in 2020 irrigation was terminated in mid nov for the i1 i4 treatments whereas the final irrigation in 2020 for i5 and i6 was in late summer effective precipitation events 1 0 mm per day totaled 25 mm in jul and aug 2020 and totaled 27 mm from mid nov 2020 to the end of feb 2021 irrigation was resumed in early mar 2021 for all treatments except i6 early apr 2021 the final irrigations of the experiment were applied to i1 i2 i3 i5 and i6 treatments on oct 28 jul 05 sep 29 and apr 08 2021 respectively cumulative effective precipitation from mar 01 2021 through harvest mar 01 2022 was 209 mm about 50 mm above the normal yearly precipitation at the location level furrow irrigation amounts for the i1 treatment ranged from 42 mm in may 2020 160 mm in may and jun 2021 the i1 irrigation frequency varied from 1 to 3 irrigations per month highest irrigation frequencies occurred in the spring and summer in both 2020 and 2021 table 3 total irrigation applied during the 22 5 month growth period varied for treatments from 2519 mm for i1 to 822 mm for i6 table 3 total effective precipitation during the period was 261 mm the trends for the cumulative total water applied twa i e cumulative irrigation plus cumulative precipitation with time are shown for irrigation treatments in fig 3 compared to the final twa of the i1 treatment table 3 the reductions in twa for the i2 16 treatments were 17 33 33 51 and 61 respectively average measured swd for irrigation treatments including both cultivars are shown from the beginning of nmm measurements in late may 2020 through late feb 2022 figs 4a and b during the first year of growth fig 4a average swd for the i1 treatment slightly exceeded the 65 target by about 5 on two dates aug 11 and sep 29 2020 during the second year of growth fig 4b measured swd for the i1 was 65 in mid apr and early may but was less than 65 for all dates thereafter notably higher swd than that of i1 was observed for the i4 i6 treatments starting in the latter half of jul 2020 after initiation of soil water deficit periods for those treatments thereafter the swd for the i5 and i6 treatments stayed consistently higher than that for i1 where they often exceeded 80 90 during their water deficit periods table 2 the irrigation regime of every other irrigation i4 resulted in alternating periods of elevated and diminished differences in the i4 swd compared to that for i1 the elevated swd mainly occurred during mid jul mid aug in 2020 late jun early aug 2021 and early nov 2021 late feb 2022 figs 4a and b during other times i4 and i1 had similar swd the measured swd for i4 was greater than 80 on two dates early aug 2020 and early ray 2021 as expected marked increases in swd for the i2 and i3 treatments compared to i1 did not arise until early spring 2021 i3 and late summer 2021 i2 following the cutback and termination of irrigation for those treatments table 2 the swd for i3 was especially high during summer 2021 82 89 whereas it was 51 80 for i2 during the same summer period for measurement dates in fig 4a the average and range of swd were 48 11 71 47 8 74 50 9 78 53 11 89 67 8 91 and 59 3 83 for i1 i6 respectively for measurement dates in fig 4b swd averaged 54 34 68 69 38 82 79 55 89 72 56 81 80 56 93 and 81 65 88 for i1 i6 respectively the combined estimated and actual daily etc rate averaged by month and daily cumulative etc for the 22 5 months of guayule growth are shown for the i1 treatment in fig 5 in 2020 the daily etc was estimated through may 20 2020 the swb calculations indicated that 71 mm of water percolated below the root zone during late apr late may when germination establishment irrigations were applied thereafter calculated dp was minimal for the i1 treatment and likely minimal in all other treatments as well relatively high average daily etc rates occurred during apr and may 2020 reflecting primarily soil evaporation contributions following frequent germination establishment irrigations first through the sprinkler system and then by level furrow irrigation starting in early may starting in late jun 2020 level furrow irrigations to i1 were much less frequent resulting in less soil evaporation and lower average etc values than in apr may as the crop grew during summer of 2020 average daily etc increased from about 4 0 mm d 1 in jun until reaching maximum values 6 0 mm d 1 in aug and sep 2020 average monthly kc values calculated for jun jul aug and sep 2020 data were 0 47 0 68 0 85 1 03 respectively after aug the monthly average etc rate steadily declined until it fell to a minimum value in jan 2021 of 1 0 mm d 1 during the winter dormancy months of feb mar 2021 the etc rate increased slightly and then increased rapidly starting in spring 2021 the maximum monthly etc rate was 10 3 mm d 1 in jun 2021 the corresponding monthly kc value in jun was about 1 16 the climate in jul and aug 2021 was much more humid than jun and precipitation was above historical normal during those months average etc declined to 8 0 mm d 1 however compared to jun the monthly kc for jul and aug increased 1 26 and 1 33 respectively perhaps due to higher soil evaporation from the precipitation the etc continued to decline until it reached a minimum value 0 5 mm d 1 in dec 2021 and had a corresponding kc of about 0 30 the etc rate increased to a value of 1 0 mm d 1 in jan and feb 2022 shortly before harvest as the monthly averaged etc data would suggest cumulative daily etc for the i1 treatment rose rapidly from jun to sept 2020 and then leveled off during the winter dormancy period starting in dec fig 5 the rate of increase in cumulative etc was higher during the second summer of 2021 than during the first year of growth the trend in cumulative etc during winter dormancy periods was similar in both years cumulative etc was 1250 mm from late apr through dec 2020 1860 mm from jan 01 to dec 31 2021 and 55 mm jan 01 feb 24 2022 for the 22 5 months of growth the total etc was 3165 mm 3 2 plant growth guayule h for irrigation treatments with time are shown separately for the az2 and az6 cultivars figs 6a and b respectively statistical analysis indicated that h was significantly greater for az2 than az6 plants starting from the first measurements made in early jul 2020 while there was no significant differences for h between irrigation treatments until mid oct 2020 or 5 5 months after planting differences in h between the cultivars were significant throughout the entire growing period with az2 having taller plants than az6 from early nov 2020 through late apr 2021 the h for i1 was significantly greater than h for i4 i6 but not the h for the i2 and i3 treatments the h differences from late may early nov in 2021 were consistently greater for i1 and i2 than for i5 and i6 for az2 but not for az6 final measurements just before harvest in 2022 revealed that mean h for the i1 and i2 were both significantly greater than those for i3 i6 for az2 whereas the h for i1 and i2 were only significantly greater than the i6 treatment for az6 percent fractional canopy cover increased for irrigation treatments from early jul until nov 2020 for both az2 and az6 figs 7a and b respectively similar to h results fc was significantly greater for az2 than az6 in jul and aug 2020 when differences for fc between irrigation treatments were not significant for measurements from sep through early feb 2021 mean fc was greater for az2 than az6 though the differences varied between being significant and not significant during that time period by late apr 2021 onward the fc differences between cultivars were not significant while az2 initially exhibited more vigorous cover development than az6 during the first summer by early spring 2021 the mean fc for az6 was the same as that for az2 significant irrigation treatment effects on fc did not occur until mid nov 2020 or about a month later than significant irrigation effects on h in mid nov the fc for treatments i1 i4 were significantly greater than for i6 but not i5 by late may 2021 the fc were close to 100 for the i1 i4 treatments in both cultivars and were significantly greater than those for the i5 and i6 treatments fc less than 90 from late jun onward differences in fc due to irrigation were not significant as the i5 and i6 treatments attained fc greater than 90 in jun and 100 by early oct 2021 3 3 yield and water productivity the db means for both cultivars increased linearly with twa and regression of db vs twa for treatments had a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 85 fig 8a statistically both the main effect of irrigation and the cultivar effect on db were significant while irrigation by cultivar interaction was not significant the db mean for irrigation treatment was highest for the i1 treatment and lowest for the i6 treatment table 4 while the db means for the i1 i2 and i4 treatments were not significantly different from each other they were each significantly greater than those for the i3 i5 and i6 table 4 mean db by cultivar was 9 higher for az2 than az6 and the difference was significant as seen in fig 8a db differences between cultivars were more pronounced within the i3 i4 and i6 treatments compared to the i1 i2 and i5 treatments however statistical comparisons of cultivars within each irrigation treatment indicated that the db mean only differed significantly between cultivars within the i4 treatment table 4 it is notable that the mean db of the az2 cultivar for the i4 treatment was 19 2 mg ha 1 which was only 8 lower than that for az2 for the i1 treatment consistent with the irrigation mean results for cultivars the az2 cultivar within the i4 treatment had significantly greater db than that for i3 which received essentially the same twa as i4 as well as those for i5 and i6 table 4 irrigation and the cultivar effects on db wp were significant mean db wp for irrigation treatments was highest for i4 closely followed by i5 where both treatments were significantly greater than the dp wp for i1 and i3 table 4 while mean db wp for the i2 and i6 treatments were higher than for i1 and i3 the differences were not significant the mean db wp was significantly greater for az2 than az6 though statistical comparison of cultivars within each irrigation treatment indicated that only az2 within i4 and i6 treatments had significantly greater db wp than az6 the az2 cultivar within the i4 i5 and i6 treatments achieved significantly greater db wp than all other irrigation cultivar combinations except for az6 within the i5 treatment table 4 numerically db wp was the highest 1 03 kg m 3 for the az2 cultivar within the i4 irrigation treatment the r in plants at harvest was significantly different for irrigation treatment and cultivar and there was no interaction the mean r generally increased with decreasing twa and increasing swd although mean r for the i1 i2 and i4 treatments was less than those the i3 i5 and i6 treatments significant differences in mean r due to irrigation occurred only between the i5 versus the i1 i2 and i4 treatments table 4 for cultivars mean r was 20 higher for az2 than az6 within all irrigation treatments r for az2 was significantly greater than those for az6 statistically r was significantly greater for the az2 cultivar within the i5 and i6 treatments than those for all other irrigation cultivar combinations except for az2 within the i3 treatment table 4 unlike r re was not significantly different due to irrigation while the cultivar effect on re was significant interaction between irrigation and cultivar was also significant comparison of cultivars within irrigation treatments revealed that re was significantly greater for az2 than az6 within the i1 i2 i3 and i5 treatments but not within the i4 and i6 treatments highest re occurred for the az2 cultivar within the i1 and i2 irrigation treatments which were significantly greater than re for all other irrigation cultivar combinations except those for az2 within the i3 and i5 treatments table 4 as it was found for db the ry means for cultivars increased linearly with twa where the r2 of the linear regression was 0 59 fig 8b for ry irrigation and cultivar effects were significant the irrigation means for ry were highest for the i1 treatment followed by i2 and i4 which were not significantly different than for i1 table 4 due to higher r for the i3 and i5 compared to i2 and i4 the ry for i3 was not significantly different than that for i2 while ry for i5 was not significantly different than that for i4 table 4 the mean ry for the i6 treatment was significantly lower than the ry for all other treatments the combination of higher db and r for the az2 than az6 cultivar resulted in az2 having 27 higher ry the differences in ry for cultivars are clearly observed in fig 8b because differences in ry between cultivars were marked linear regressions of ry versus twa were performed separately for the cultivars which gave high r2 values to 0 86 and 0 91 for az2 and az6 respectively data not shown the maximum ry of 864 kg ha 1 was attained for az2 within the i1 treatment the second and third highest ry were attained for az2 within the i4 and i2 treatments which were about 10 11 lower than the ry for i1 the ry wp was also significantly affected by irrigation and cultivar while there was no interaction for irrigation mean ry wp was significantly greater for the i4 i5 and i6 treatments than for i1 differences similar to those found for db wp table 4 however for ry wp the mean was highest for the i5 treatment then for i4 vis a viz the db wp ranking the mean ry wp was significantly lower for the i1 than all but the i2 treatment the cultivar differences were similar to that for ry where mean ry wp was 26 higher for az2 than az6 the best ry wp was attained in the az2 cultivar within i5 closely followed by az2 within the i4 and i6 treatments table 4 the rey had similar irrigation treatment and cultivar trends with twa to those shown for ry in fig 8b the r2 of the linear regression of rey vs twa fig 8c was 0 69 higher than the r2 for ry vs twa for rey the irrigation and cultivar effects were both significant mean rey was highest for the i1 treatment but was not significantly greater than for i2 and i4 table 4 both i1 and i2 means were greater than means for i3 i5 and i6 while the mean for i4 was significantly greater than means for i5 and i6 only for cultivars the mean rey for az2 was 24 greater than the mean for az6 as both db and re were greater for az2 than az6 because differences between cultivars were pronounced linear regressions of rey versus twa were performed separately for the two cultivars those regressions increased the r2 to 0 93 and 0 85 for az2 and az6 respectively data not shown as with ry maximum rey was also obtained in the az2 cultivar within the i1 treatment the mean rey wp were highest among irrigation treatments for i4 and i5 which were both significantly greater than the rey wp for i1 table 4 for rey wp a significant cultivar effect occurred and there was no interaction within a given irrigation treatment rey wp was significantly greater for az2 than az6 for the i1 i4 treatments but not for the i5 and i6 treatments maximum ry wp occurred for az2 within the i4 treatment followed by az2 within the i5 treatment the percent reductions in total irrigation total i and twa applied to the i2 i6 treatments from that to the fully irrigated i1 amounts varied from 17 to 19 for i2 to 61 67 for i6 table 5 for the i2 i6 treatments the percent reduction in the mean yield parameters were less than those for twa except in the case of i3 which were about the same as the twa reduction table 5 relative to the reduction in twa for treatments yield reductions were the least for the i4 treatment where yields declined only about 15 or less than one half the twa reduction of 33 when considering just the az2 cultivar the i4 reductions for db and ry were less than 10 or less than one third of the percent twa reduction among the other deficit treatments the most notable was the i5 treatment having a 52 reduction in twa losing about 40 in db but only 31 in ry the percent reductions of the yield parameters for the i2 and i6 treatments compared to their twa reductions were less substantial i e reductions on the order of 6 9 lower for yield than twa the percent increases in the wp of the yield parameters were the most for the i4 and i5 treatments and were generally similar between the two treatments table 5 however given the greater reduction in twa for the i5 than i4 the relative gain in wp was more appreciable 4 discussion this experiment was conducted to evaluate yield responses to six different irrigation strategies for two direct seeded guayule cultivars grown in the u s southwest desert climate for the study we focused on the most common irrigation system furrow that is used for field crops in pinal county arizona where the study was conducted limited past research suggested that irrigation water use could be substantially reduced for guayule grown in heavier soils which hold more available water than lighter soils while maintaining or increasing the ry generally associated with fully irrigated guayule thus the experiment was conducted on a heavier silty clay loam soil in eloy consequently the results are limited to the soil type planting period and irrigation method used in the experiment additional research and analysis would be needed to evaluate deficit irrigation regimes for guayule grown in similar and lighter soils with pressurized and non pressurized irrigation systems in the region for direct seeded guayule there is need to keep the soil surface layer wet during the first two weeks for optimum germination and to then to provide moist soil conditions for seedlings over the next six weeks until stand establishment is complete bucks et al 1986 jorge et al 2006 dissanayake et al 2008 in this experiment a total of 511 mm was applied to plots for the two months following planting to meet the germination establishment soil water conditions over one half the amount was applied with sprinklers for the first two weeks while the remainder was applied by furrow irrigation the total applied was 25 less than what was reported by elshikha et al 2021 for the first two months in earlier direct seeded studies with sprinkler furrow irrigation at the eloy location however in the earlier eloy study more irrigation was provided by furrow during the establishment period compared to the present study in direct seeded field germination experiments on a sand soil in yuma arizona bucks et al 1986 applied daily irrigation for 14 day germination periods for early apr plantings followed by irrigation about every three days during the subsequent establishment period in that study between 100 and 150 mm of total irrigation for germination and 215 250 mm total irrigation for the next two months was applied as an overhead mist using a lateral move sprinkler system although the direct seeded guayule germination and survival rates in that study were quite poor this earlier work shows that germination establishment irrigation use could be considerably lower than 500 mm the present study and elshikha et al 2021 have clearly demonstrated that high guayule plant populations are now attainable with direct seeding in both heavy and light soils however a major gap still exists on how to appropriately manage direct seeded guayule irrigation during germination establishment more research should be conducted to determine optimum frequencies and amounts of irrigation that satisfy the needed soil moisture levels under various soil types irrigation system methods planting dates and locations the cumulative irrigation applied to the i1 treatment after 22 5 months 2519 mm was about 700 mm less or 22 less than applied to the spring planted level furrow treatment after 23 months in the earlier direct seeded study at eloy elshikha et al 2021 compared to the latter study the lower amount for i1 was due to less germination establishment irrigation significantly lower irrigation requirements during the second year summer due to frequent precipitation and that no irrigation was needed during the final four months before harvest other studies in central arizona using transplants and furrow irrigation reported cumulative irrigation amounts of 3360 mm after 21 months bucks et al 1985a and 3570 mm after 24 months hunsaker and elshikha 2017 for well watered treatments some general outcomes of db and rubber production can be related to the soil water depletion levels of the treatments in the study during the first year of the experiment the average measured swd was similar for the i1 i4 treatments 47 53 and higher though not extreme for i5 and i6 67 and 59 respectively however during the second year swd averaged 54 69 79 72 80 and 81 for i1 i6 respectively the results show that db was significantly reduced for treatments with 79 or greater average swd in the second year i e i3 i5 and i6 while r was also significantly increased at the higher swd levels however the increase in r for those treatments was far less than that needed to achieve ry comparable to treatments with lower average swd in the second year the r results for the i5 and i6 differ considerably from the hunter and kelley 1946 findings also on a heavier soil type the i5 and i6 obtained about a 20 increase in rubber content over the well watered treatment whereas hunter and kelley 1946 found about a 50 increase in r for extremely dry treatments over r obtained for well watered treatments the irrigation regime of the i6 treatment in the present study was very similar to the number 4 treatment of hunter and kelley where only a spring irrigation was given in the second year the average swd of i6 in the second year was less than that estimated for the number 4 treatment 90 as precipitation was significant at eloy in jul aug of the second year it is possible however that the r would have been higher in i6 and i5 had there been no rain in summer to decrease the treatment s soil water stress level the responses in db and r using alternating periods of high and low swd for the i4 treatment was consistent with the treatment of every other irrigation studied by veihmeyer and hendrickson 1961 after two years of growth in each study there was no difference between the alternate irrigation and the fully irrigated treatment in r nor db for a treatment with a single spring irrigation in the second year similar to number 4 treatment of taylor and kelley and the present i6 veihmeyer and hendrickson 1961 found a significant increase in r over the well watered but it was only 20 higher like the r gain for i6 for the same soil type in earlier studies at eloy elshikha et al 2021 wang et al 2022 applying about one half the irrigation applied to fully irrigated furrow plots did not increase the r nor significantly reduce the db of guayule this was consistent with the i4 results where the average swd was maintained at about 75 during the second year of growth in the earlier eloy studies elshikha et al 2021 reported etc data from a direct seeded guayule experiment in 2018 2020 at the same location and planting date as the present study for the well watered level furrow treatment in that study they indicate a maximum etc rate of 10 8 mm d 1 occurred in jun of the second year bucks et al 1985b determined maximum etc rates were 7 0 mm d 1 in the first year during aug sep and were about 10 0 mm d 1 in the second year during jun jul for a well watered furrow irrigation treatment with spring transplanted guayule in good agreement with the current and previous studies hunsaker and elshikha 2017 reported well watered fall transplanted guayule using level furrow irrigation had etc rates of 6 4 mm d 1 in aug and sep of the first year and 9 8 mm d 1 in jun jul of the second year relevant literature on guayule kc estimation based on eto was provided by elshikha et al 2021 that study indicated average monthly kc values for the well watered level furrow treatment were somewhat higher during the first summer jun sep 0 74 1 23 compared to the those in present study in the second year monthly kc were higher in jun 1 23 but lower in jul and aug 1 17 and 1 22 respectively than the kc for those months during the present study cumulative etc for the i1 treatment 3165 mm was about 5 lower than that for the well watered level furrow treatment in elshikha et al 2021 for approximately the same guayule growing period in other studies cumulative etc was 3000 and 3275 mm bucks et al 1985b and hunsaker and elshikha 2017 respectively indicating similar crop water use for well watered direct seeded and transplanted guayule linear relationships of guayule db ry and rey regressed by cumulative etc or by total twa have been reported in the literature for two year and four year transplanted crops miyamoto et al 1984 bucks et al 1985c nakayama 1991 hunsaker et al 2019 hunsaker and elshikha 2017 in the cited studies the r2 for db versus the water variable were somewhat higher 0 90 0 98 than the r2 obtained for db by twa in the present study 0 85 as pointed out years ago by miyamoto et al 1984 guayule db production is driven by water input and thus db generally responds to water in a similar manner as that observed for many vegetative crops on the other hand relationships of ry to water can be more variable than for db particularly if there is a pronounced decline in r at higher water input the range of r2 for ry versus water input from the transplanted studies above varied from 0 48 to 0 91 and averaged 0 77 while it was lower 0 59 in the present study for rey versus water r2 values were 0 90 or higher from the literature but 0 69 in the present study however the lower r2 in the present study were greatly affected by significant differences in ry and rey between az2 and az6 the ry and rey with twa were highly linear when regressions considered each cultivar separately giving r2 values more in line with the literature current results suggest that linear relationships between direct seeded guayule yield parameters with water will hold up even with extremely different irrigation timing though different cultivars may have different linear relationships the mean db for the az2 cultivar within the i1 treatment was about 21 lower than that obtained with direct seeded az2 grown at the same location for a well watered furrow irrigation treatment elshikha et al 2021 however the earlier study treatment received 24 more twa consequently db wp was about the same for the i1 treatment and the well watered furrow treatment in the earlier study at eloy 0 75 and 0 74 kg m 3 respectively the db for i1 was comparable to well watered guayule transplants grown with furrow irrigation in other arizona studies on lighter soils bucks et al 1985b coffelt and ray 2010 hunsaker and elshikha 2017 earlier data for well watered guayule on the silty clay loam soil in california indicate db about 40 lower than the i1 although the az2 cultivar within the i1 treatment achieved less db than the furrow treatment of elshikha et al 2021 due to the higher r and re in the present study ry and rey were similar in the studies where ry and rey for i1 was 11 higher and 5 lower than those in the earlier study respectively in regard to rubber and resin contents the az2 cultivar in the present study achieved r and re that averaged 4 5 and 8 1 respectively compared to 2 9 and 7 1 for the furrow treatment reported by elshikha et al 2021 the present study elshikha et al 2021 and wang et al 2022 used a different laboratory analytic method to determine the r and re i e the soxhlet based nir method placido et al 2020 than that used in the cited earlier guayule studies i e accelerated solvent extraction ase method pearson et al 2013 while the two methods are well correlated r by ase is notably higher than that by nir placido et al 2020 therefore r re ry and rey for present and earlier studies cannot be compared without bias in the present study as evidenced by the significant irrigation by cultivar interaction for re re response to irrigation was different between the az2 and az6 cultivars while re for az2 generally increased with the irrigation treatment twa it generally decreased with twa for az6 discrepancies in the final r and re also occurred between the az2 significantly greater and az6 cultivars although mean db for az2 was only 9 greater than for az6 cultivar differences in r and re resulted 28 and 24 higher mean ry and rey for az2 than az6 respectively which resulted in significantly greater mean ry wp and rey wp for az2 of about the same magnitude reasons for the different cultivar r responses are unclear and differ from ray et al 1999 who indicated significantly higher r for az6 than az2 after two years however the significantly greater re for az2 than az6 was consistent with ray et al 1999 though less extreme in the latter the plant height and cover data indicate much more rapid development occurred for the az2 than az6 within each irrigation level because az6 plants were significantly shorter than az2 it is possible that lower r for az6 occurred because those plants may have experienced lower water stress effects than those experienced by the az2 plants within the same irrigation treatment in comparing the different water deficit strategies to i1 it appears that the i4 treatment every other irrigation of i1 approach is the best option to substantially reduce guayule irrigation water use in this soil type this was most evident in az2 where final db ry and rey were not significantly lower than those for i1 even though twa was curtailed by 33 and irrigation by 36 the db wp ry wp and rey wp for az2 within i4 were maximum or near maximum and always significantly greater than those for i1 the az6 cultivar within the i4 treatment had significantly greater db wp and rey wp than for az6 within i1 but also had lower db and ry than the i1 terminating irrigation in the second year at mid summer seven months before the final harvest i2 resulted in a 17 reduction in twa 19 for irrigation which did not significantly reduce db ry and rey compared to i1 however unlike the i4 the reduction in twa for i2 did not significantly increase the wp above those for i1 this was the case for either cultivar terminating irrigation during summer months in the second guayule year i3 cut twa to the same extent as for i4 however the effects of this water deficit period significantly reduced db and yields compared to i1 and did not increase wp while the i3 treatment had somewhat higher r than for i1 the difference was not significant thus it appears that imposing severe water stress during the entire second summer of guayule when etc demand is highest was harmful rather than beneficial for the i5 and i6 treatments having extremely limited irrigation after establishment the i5 two irrigations per year appeared to fare better than the i6 one irrigation per year with regard to yields and wp however while the db ry rey and the wp were always higher for i5 than i6 they were not significantly greater except in the case of db for the az6 cultivar the i5 treatment did achieve significantly greater r than i1 in az2 but the low db production in i5 cut short attaining ry sufficiently close to i1 considering that the db and yield responses for the i3 and i5 treatments were not significantly different and that both treatments had severe water deficit during the second summer it is inferred that both treatment approaches could achieve higher db without significantly changing the total irrigation given to the treatments during the experiment in other guayule studies biomass for well watered guayule rapidly increased from early spring to near maximum levels in late summer during the second year hunsaker and elshikha 2017 hunsaker et al 2019 wang et al 2022 severely limited irrigation treatments during this period however had much slower db accumulation as shown in hunsaker and elshikha 2017 and hunsaker et al 2019 for the i3 and i5 treatment approaches providing one summer irrigation and deleting the fall irrigation might significantly increase the db with a potential gain in the final r that those treatments achieved in the experiment thus twa for the two treatment approaches would not have to change only irrigation timing the same irrigation timing switch is foreseen as also improving the i6 treatment approach in pinal county growers are presently reducing the number of hectares that they planted in the past because colorado river water is no longer available for irrigation traditional crops such as cotton and alfalfa grown in the county and much of the u s southwest desert require about 1450 1900 mm of irrigation per year nass 2010 however yields for such crops typically decline rapidly when water stress occurs due to limited irrigation bronson et al 2019 hunsaker et al 2002 guayule is seen as a viable crop alternative in the region because it can withstand significant water stress and as the i4 treatment indicates needs substantially less irrigation per year 800 mm to achieve maximum yields significant reductions in irrigation needed in germination establishment of guayule may also be likely with additional research focus as mentioned earlier considering the possibility that future water allotment cutbacks will be insufficient for even the i4 schedule e g on the order of 500 mm year then the guayule crop would have to be managed similar to the i5 scheme however based on the poor yield for i5 it would probably be more effective to provide the allotted water in spring and summer where it can be utilized by the plant for growth 5 conclusions direct seeded guayule cultivars az6 and az2 were grown in a field experiment conducted for 22 5 months in central arizona on a silty loam to silty clay loam soil using level furrow irrigation the aim was to determine effective deficit irrigation strategies that could be used to reduce irrigation water use while maintaining guayule biomass and rubber and resin yields comparable to those attained with a fully irrigated control treatment clearly the best deficit irrigation strategy found was applying irrigation every other time the fully irrigated treatment was irrigated in this study fully irrigated guayule required irrigation about every 10 days during summer months and about every 30 days during spring and fall deficit irrigation strategies that imposed high soil water deficits during the summer of the second year of guayule were deemed to be detrimental even though they significantly reduced irrigation water use we conclude that subjecting guayule to severe water deficits during the second summer was not a good strategy future research should evaluate deficit irrigation strategies that focuses on fall rather than summer soil water deficits during the second year of guayule in this regard it may be possible to boost the rubber yields to some extent under extremely limited irrigation if only a single irrigation can be applied during the second summer because az2 outperformed az6 for all yield and water productivity criteria az2 should be the cultivar focus for guayule commercialization efforts future research is also needed to determine best management practices and more efficient early season irrigation practices for establishing direct seeded guayule crops using surface drip irrigation instead of sprinklers

9111,deficit irrigation can maximize the water productivity wp of guayule and increase the percent rubber r in shrubs compared to irrigation meeting full crop evapotranspiration etc in this study we hypothesize that certain deficit irrigation strategies that impose soil water deficits during specific periods of growth or throughout the growing season might produce higher r and equivalent rubber yield ry thereby increasing wp compared to full irrigation herein growth and yield responses of direct seeded guayule to different water deficit schemes were evaluated in an experiment on a silty clay loam soil in a field in central arizona using furrow irrigation two guayule cultivars az2 and az6 were grown for 22 5 months apr 2020 mar 2022 in a split plot design with six irrigation treatments in whole plots and cultivars in split plots after homogeneous irrigation for two months irrigation treatments were begun a control treatment was irrigated to meet full etc the other five treatments were irrigated with less water using various deficit irrigation strategies imposed during the two year growing period measurements included plant height h cover fraction fc soil water contents harvest of dry biomass db ry resin yield rey r and percent resin re total water applied twa by irrigation and precipitation to treatments varied from 2780 to 1084 mm and db varied from 20 5 to 9 1 mg ha 1 the h and fc were significantly greater at higher irrigation levels while they were also significantly greater in az6 than az2 the db ry and rey generally increased linearly with twa however it was found that a treatment applying every other irrigation of the control resulted in statistically equivalent yields to the control with 36 less irrigation the r generally decreased with twa while re did not change however db r and re were significantly greater for az2 than az6 as were ry rey and wp among the deficit treatments evaluated every other irrigation offers the best strategy to significantly increase guayule wp without causing a yield penalty keywords rubber soil water water productivity evapotranspiration crop coefficient data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction guayule parthenium argentatum a gray is a perennial shrub native to the desert of northcentral mexico and southwestern texas that produces high quality natural rubber nr appropriate for usage in commercial grade tires rasutis et al 2015 eranki et al 2018 besides nr guayule produces valuable co products such as resin and biofuels nakayama 2005 rasutis et al 2015 guayule commercialization efforts to achieve a domestic supply of nr have a longstanding history in the u s desert southwest ray et al 2010 where efforts have accelerated in recent years due to increasing nr demands and disruptions in imported nr supplies from overseas eranki et al 2018 a crucial breakthrough to advancing commercialization is that guayule crops can now be successfully established in fields by direct seeding in soil rather than by transplanting a method which has proven to be cost prohibitive for growers elshikha et al 2021 wang et al 2020 optimal seed germination rates for the most available cultivar az 2 occur when average daytime air temperatures are about 22 c wang et al 2020 the optimal planting windows for germination in the region are either late apr to mid may or mid oct the apr may planting is desirable because of the subsequent weather conditions needed for achieving active growth a significant challenge to expanding guayule production is that drastic water reductions for agriculture are occurring due to ongoing drought conditions in u s desert regions direct seeded guayule can require a significant amount of irrigation for germination and crop establishment the shallow planted seed needs to be wetted on a near daily basis to keep the surface soil wet until emergence is complete which may take two three weeks bucks et al 1986 following emergence irrigation is needed until the crop is fully established two three months after planting bucks et al 1986 the amount of irrigation needed to meet crop evapotranspiration etc of guayule has been determined to be on the order of 1300 1500 mm per year bucks et al 1985b nakayama 1991 hunsaker and elshikha 2017 during guayule s active growing period in the u s desert early spring through mid fall biomass measured on a dry weight basis db increases with irrigation typically linearly for two to four year old shrubs bucks et al 1985c nakayama et al 1991 hunsaker et al 2019 while the rubber bearing tissues are produced in the stems branches and roots during active growth it is widely believed that the percent rubber r content of the shrub is increased during periods of limited growth due to soil water deficit and other stresses such as cold temperatures benedict et al 1947 kelly 1975 wang et al 2022 as a perennial desert shrub once guayule is established after planting it is extremely drought tolerant and can survive extended periods without water application bucks et al 1985a foster and coffelt 2005 however the relative gain in r due to high soil water stress and limited growth may or may not be enough to achieve rubber yield ry similar to or greater than that for fully irrigated guayule disparate results on the relationship between ry and soil water depletion exist in the literature many studies on guayule grown in lighter soil types in u s desert areas have shown that the ry was significantly greater when the root zone soil water depletion during active growth was maintained at less than 55 65 versus higher depletion levels hunter and kelley 1946 miyamoto et al 1984 bucks et al 1985a 1985b hunsaker and elshikha 2017 elshikha et al 2021 however exceptions to those results are found in the literature for example veihmeyer and hendrickson 1961 on a sandy loam soil in the state of california showed no difference in ry after two years between a well irrigated treatment maximum 40 depletion a treatment irrigated about every other time of the former and a treatment not irrigated during the entire second year the literature on guayule yield responses to irrigation for studies conducted on heavier soil types that have higher soil water retention is not extensive though the body indicates that less rather than more irrigation increases ry the hunter and kelley 1946 results on a silty clay loam soil in california show significantly less ry was attained when soil water depletion was maintained at 25 versus much higher depletion levels they provide evidence that maintaining low soil water depletion during the first year of growth and then terminating irrigation during the second summer of guayule does not curtail db but does increase r compared to the well watered treatments further hunter and kelley 1946 show significantly greater r and ry for treatments with minimal irrigation after crop establishment where soil water depletion reached 100 for an appreciable amount of time in more recent studies in arizona using direct seeding on a clay to silty clay loam soil elshikha et al 2021 and wang et al 2022 reported greater ry for the treatment receiving 50 less irrigation maintained at about 75 soil water depletion than that applied to the 100 etc replacement treatment 55 maximum soil water depletion also significantly greater water productivity wp rubber yield per unit of total water applied twa pereira et al 2012 was achieved with 50 less irrigation in that study benedict et al 1947 and veihmeyer and hendrickson 1961 suggest that a significant increase in r accumulation can be forced in guayule by alternating periods of low and high soil water deficits compared to maintaining low soil water deficits over the growing period as attained with fully irrigated guayule they indicate these alternating periods of soil water deficit should be maintained throughout the active growing season rather than in the non active winter growth period the natural plant resin in guayule is found in all parts of the shrub including the leaves compared to ry there has been less attention focused on studying irrigation strategies to enhance the resin yield rey of guayule the percent resin re content of the whole plant generally varies from about 7 10 ray et al 2010 and has been shown to either increase or decrease with irrigation amount in field studies bucks et al 1985b hunsaker and elshikha 2017 hunsaker et al 2019 elshikha et al 2021 for guayule grown in the above studies for two years the rey increased often significantly at higher irrigation amounts on lighter soils but showed less variability among irrigation levels on the heavier soil elshikha et al 2021 guayule growers in the u s southwest will likely not have an irrigation delivery close to that needed to meet 100 of etc 1300 1500 mm per year for guayule grown on lighter soils some literature indicates an irrigation deficit of 20 25 for full etc would not reduce ry significantly bucks et al 1985a 1985b hunsaker and elshikha 2017 elshikha et al 2021 however on heavier soils there appears to be a greater opportunity to reduce irrigation water use even much more than 25 in this study we hypothesize that certain deficit irrigation strategies that impose high water stress during a specific period of the guayule s ontogeny or throughout the entire growing season might result in equivalent or even higher rubber yields due to increased rubber content compared to fully irrigated guayule in particular reduction of irrigation during summer when etc demands and growth are highest may provide a significant increase in the ry wp to date guayule irrigation research on growth and yield responses to specifically planned soil water deficits is limited and almost totally absent for direct seeded guayule therefore we conducted a field experiment on a heavier soil type in central arizona that exposed direct seeded guayule to various pre determined soil water deficit periods over a 22 5 month long growing season the objectives of the study were 1 to evaluate the effects of planned deficit irrigation on guayule growth parameters db r re ry rey and wp and 2 to determine optimum deficit irrigation strategies for two cultivars that are being considered for guayule commercialization 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design planting and crop establishment a direct seeded guayule irrigation experiment began in apr 2020 at a 1 60 ha field located at the bridgestone americas inc guayule research farm in eloy arizona usa 32 67 ºn lat 111 63 ºw long 482 m a s l the field consisted of a total of 36 100 m long plots that were each 4 06 m wide the experimental design was a randomized split plot design in which the field was divided into three blocks having six irrigation treatments denoted as i1 to i6 in 18 whole plots and two guayule cultivars denoted as az2 and az6 the split plot treatment within whole plots the six irrigation treatments were randomly assigned within each block and then az2 and az6 were randomly assigned within each irrigation treatment of the block the field layout irrigation methods and irrigation treatments are described in more detail below in this section and in section 2 4 while the two cultivars used in the study are described below on apr 20 21 2020 seed of cultivar lines az2 and az6 were planted in the plot rows 1 016 m apart using a four row planter mini seeder 1 1 mention of trade names or commercial products in this article is solely for the purpose of providing

weeks after planting apr 22 may 11 2020 for seedling germination as recommended by dissanayake et al 2008 after sprinklers were removed guayule seedlings in all plots were kept well watered by irrigating several times during the next seven weeks may 13 jun 21 2020 using level furrow irrigation martin and gilley 1993 a common surface irrigation method used in the area irrigation treatments were initiated in mid july 2020 using the level furrow irrigation method the guayule crop was grown for approximately 22 5 months and the experiment was terminated following plot harvests on mar 01 2022 described in section 2 5 2 2 climatic parameters the weather data used in the study were obtained from the arizona meteorological network station in coolidge arizona azmet https cals arizona edu azmet 05 htm located 33 km directly north of the eloy field site plots of averaged daily historical weather parameters at the station jan 2003 through dec 2021 show the long term patterns fig 1a yearly maximum daily air temperatures ta max typically increase from around 20 c in jan feb to above 40 c from early jun through mid jul the historical ta max values decline slightly below 40 c during the mid jul to mid sep summer monsoon period from start of fall through the end of dec ta max typically declines from about 36 16 c respectively long term minimum daily air temperatures ta min follow similar yearly patterns as ta max fig 1a the ta min can often be less than 0 c during dec and jan months the historical minimum relative humidity rhmin and precipitation are lowest in may and jun and highest during winter months and during summer monsoon months fig 1a historical data indicate a mean yearly precipitation of 158 mm at the station where the two primary rainy seasons occur from dec to feb and from jul to sep fig 1a the historical daily standardized penman monteith grass reference evapotranspiration eto allen et al 1998 varied from 1 6 mm in late dec to 8 9 mm in mid jun fig 1a the mean yearly eto for the 19 years was 1790 mm at the station seasonal differences in daily wind speeds at 2 0 m height u2 were not extreme though they were highest in the months of apr to jun averaging 2 1 m s 1 and lowest in the months of sep and oct averaging 1 4 m s 1 the daily weather parameters for the study period from late apr 2020 through the end of feb 2022 are shown in fig 1b after planting high temperatures and low humidity conditions were dominant during the two month guayule germination establishment period apr 23 to jun 21 2020 where daily ta max averaged 38 7 c 3 0 c higher than historical and daily rhmin averaged 5 4 3 5 lower than historical during this period the daily eto averaged 8 2 mm compared to 7 6 mm for historical the climate during the summer growth period in 2020 continued to be hotter and dryer than historical norms where daily ta max averaged 41 0 c and rhmin averaged 13 1 from jun 22 to sep 20 historically ta max and rhmin average 39 0 c and 19 8 during the summer period respectively precipitation during summer 2020 was also particularly scant 26 mm compared to historical 57 mm similarly fall 2020 and winter months in 2020 2021 dec 2020 mar 2021 were dryer and warmer than normal in fall 2020 the daily rhmin and ta max 11 3 and 30 0 c respectively about 8 4 lower and 2 7 c higher than historical respectively for winter months of 2020 2021 the differences in average rhmin and ta max compared to historical were similar to those in fall 2020 cumulative daily eto from planting in apr thru dec 31 2020 was 1517 mm this was about 10 greater than the mean historical eto during the same timeframe 1386 mm weather parameters during may and jun 2021 in the second year growing period were not especially different than those in 2020 fig 1b however a big difference between the 2020 and 2021 guayule growing years occurred during summer months where in 2021 the rhmin and precipitation were well above historical for jul sep for calendar year 2021 cumulative eto totaled 1820 mm which was only 2 higher than mean historical eto 1790 mm overall the spring to fall growing period in 2021 was more moderate than that in 2020 in terms of temperature and aridity on the other hand the daily u2 were higher during the months of apr to jun in 2021 averaging 2 5 m s 1 than in 2020 averaging 2 0 m s 1 weather data for the final two months of the season in jan and feb 2022 were generally similar to those in jan and feb of 2021 2 3 soil characteristics the field site is mapped as a gadsden series fine loamy montmorillontic calcareous hyperthermic vertic torrifluvents usda scs 1991 these soils are predominantly clay or silty clay loam having 35 clay content the soil has relatively high water holding capacity but low water intake which can impede water penetration to deeper soil layers in the profile soil textures at the field were determined for soil samples collected in may 2020 during the installation of neutron meter access tubes described in section 2 4 the samples were obtained within each of the 36 treatment plots at soil depths from 0 to 2 1 m in 0 3 m increments the soil textures were analyzed using the bouyoucos hydrometer method gee and bauder 1986 average soil type varied in the profile from silty clay soil in the top 0 0 3 m to a loamy sand soil at the deepest depth table 1 the field capacity fc permanent wilting point pwp and available water fc pwp water content characteristics were estimated for each 0 0 30 m soil depth using the soil water characteristics routine of spaw soil plant air water a usda hydrologic simulation model saxton and willey 2005 by entering the measured soil texture fraction values soil organic matter contents were adjusted in the usda routine to reflect typical organic matter contents at the soil depths as reported by usda scs 1991 for the eloy soil type the estimated available water for depths varied from 0 156 to 0 176 m3 m 3 for the heavier soil types to 0 102 m3 m 3 for the loamy sand 2 4 field layout irrigation system soil water measurement and irrigation treatments fig 2 illustrates the guayule field experiment layout showing the three blocks ri riii the 18 irrigation treatment whole plots within the blocks i1 i6 and the two cultivars within each irrigation treatment plot az2 and az6 the 36 separate experimental plots are enumerated as p1 p36 in fig 2 irrigation water was supplied by a wet well pumping station from an irrigation pond reservoir at the farm level furrow irrigation water delivery occurred via an underground 18 zone distribution manifold 101 6 mm diam schedule 40 pvc controlled with 18 separate solenoid valves v1 v18 in fig 2 located at the head end of each irrigation plot the system delivered water at a rate of 15 8 l s 1 as measured by a calibrated in line propeller type water meter after sprinklers were removed each of the 18 irrigation treatment plots were irrigated separately using the level furrow method irrigation plots were blocked on the far end of the field with berms so that all water applied remained in the plot area because the two guayule cultivars were embedded within each irrigation treatment both cultivars in the treatment were irrigated simultaneously in may 2020 2 25 m long 51 mm diameter galvanized steel access tubes were installed vertically in the soil in the 3rd row of each 4 row plot during installation of access tubes for the neutron probe using a tractor mounted soil sampler model 25 ts giddings machine comp windsor co usa soil samples were collected as described before in section 2 3 a field calibrated neutron moisture meter nmm model 503 campbell pacific nuclear martinez ca usa was used to measure volumetric soil water contents θv m3 m 3 from 0 15 to 1 95 m below the surface in 0 30 m increments measurements began on may 21 2020 and were made at all 36 plot locations every 7 9 days may nov 2020 and apr nov 2021 and about every two weeks during winter months differential treatment irrigation amounts were initiated on july 16 2020 following the two months of establishment irrigations apr jun 2020 one treatment i1 served as the baseline control treatment whose irrigation scheduling was based on a soil water balance swb of the rooting depth zr eq 1 1 d r i d r i 1 p i i i cr i ro i et c i dp i where dr i and dr i 1 are the root zone depletion mm at the end of day i and day i 1 respectively and pi ii cri roi etc i and dpi are amounts of precipitation net irrigation depth capillary rise runoff from the soil surface crop et and deep percolation respectively on day i all in units of mm cri and roi were considered zero due to the low groundwater table and the use of blocked furrows respectively the inputs for ii were the average measured irrigation depths given to the three i1 treatment replicates inputs of pi were provided by the azmet weather station for the site when pi was less 1 0 mm it was assumed negligible and not applied in eq 1 daily values of total available water tawi of the daily rooting depth zr i were calculated as 2 taw i 1000 z r i fc wp where tawi is in mm zr i in m and field capacity fc and wilting point wp are in m3 m 3 the fc and wp used for tawi were the average field values provided in table 2 over the estimated zr i the limits for dr i in eq 1 are zero at fc and taw at pwp since dr i cannot be less than zero on a given day i following irrigation and or precipitation an amount for dpi was computed when necessary to balance eq 1 if dr i was less than zero on day i daily percent soil water depletion swdi was calculated as 3 swd i 100 1 taw i d r i taw i where swdi is in percent and tawi and dr i are as previously defined the daily zr for the swb of eq 1 began with an initial depth of 0 60 m for the first 60 days after planting dap was increased to a depth of 1 20 m for 61 210 dap and then was increased to a maximum zr of 2 0 m from 211 dap mid nov 2020 through the end of the growing season the modeled changes in zr were developed from soil water depletion patterns observed during the first seven months of spring planted direct seeded guayule as reported by elshikha et al 2021 the i1 irrigation scheduling was intended to maintain swdi between 20 and 65 to minimize dpi irrigation application amounts for i1 were planned to restore 80 of calculated dr i in mm limiting the maximum swd to 65 for i1 provided a depletion level that has been reported as sufficient for guayule to minimize the effects of reduced etc due to water stress hunsaker and elshikha 2017 bucks et al 1985a 1985b initiation of eq 1 was on the day of seeding i e day i 1 where it was assumed that the dr i 1 in eq 1 for the 0 60 m depth was the taw calculated as 99 mm during the first 30 dap prior to nnm measurements of θv eq 1 used the dual crop coefficient procedures of fao 56 allen et al 1998 to estimate etc i 4 et c i k cb i k e i et o i where etc i is estimated mm kcb i is the basal crop coefficient unitless ke i is the soil evaporation coefficient unitless and eto i is the penman monteith grass reference evapotranspiration mm provided by the azmet weather station for the site prior to θv measurements the kcb i was estimated as 0 20 based on kcb data derived for early season well watered direct seeded guayule elshikha et al 2021 the ke i values were calculated following ii and pi events using fao56 methods which require a separate swb of the soil evaporation layer ze assumed as 0 10 m 5 d e i d e i 1 p i i i f w i e s i f ew i dp e i where de i and de i 1 are the cumulative depth of evaporation following wetting of the exposed and wetted fraction of the surface soil at the end of day i and end of day i 1 respectively pi and ii are as previously defined es i is soil evaporation and dpe i is deep percolation loss if soil water content exceeds fc on day i where all these variables are in units of mm the fw i and few i are the fraction of the soil surface wetted by pi and ii and the exposed and wetted fraction respectively on day i dimensionless for the ze swb calculations value of the readily evaporable water rew was 10 mm for the silty clay surface soil and total evaporable water tew was calculated using the fc and wp values for the 0 30 m depth table 2 using the tew equation in allen et al 1998 the tew was calculated as 27 9 mm for the 0 10 m soil evaporation layer and tew was the de i 1 value used in the model at seeding following ii and pi events 1 0 mm depletion of ze was calculated on a daily basis by eq 5 stage 1 drying energy limiting occurred until cumulative de i was greater than rew stage 2 drying falling rate was determined by eq 6 6 k r i tew d e i 1 tew rew where kr i is the daily evaporation reduction coefficient calculated for de i 1 rew whereas kr i 1 0 during stage 1 drying the ke i were computed as 7 k e i min k r i k cmax i k cb i f ew i k cmax i where kr i kcb i and few i in eq 7 are as previously defined and kcmax i is the maximum daily value of the combined kcb and ke i coefficients that can occur following ii or pi and is a function of mean daily u2 daily rhmin and estimated daily crop height h the limit for kcmax i was constrained to kcb i 0 05 allen et al 1998 other parameters required in the ke i calculations include fraction of canopy cover fc and the wetting fractions fw of the irrigation systems which were 1 0 for both sprinkler and level furrow irrigation i e 100 surface water coverage for the h and fc we used the average i1 treatment height and cover that were measured intermittently section 2 5 and interpolated for daily estimates starting on may 21 2020 measured θv was used to quantify the actual etc etc act for the i1 treatment swb model eq 1 actual etc was calculated as the residual of the swb for periods bounded by two adjacent dates of θv measurements eq 8 8 et cact d r 2 d r 1 i p dp where etc act is the total actual et mm that occurred in the period from the first 1 to second 2 measurement date dr 1 and dr 2 are the average measured depletion mm for the six i1 plots both cultivars on the first and second date respectively the i p and dp respectively are total depth of average treatment measured irrigation mm total measured precipitation and total deep percolation below the root zone mm that occurred during the period the total etc act for each period were used to model actual et etc act i on a daily basis where the sum of etc act i was required to be equal to the total etc act in the period but whose individual values varied according to daily eto and daily soil evaporation the etc act i values in each period were found by iteration of the fao56 dual kc calculations until daily values of kcb ke i eto i summed to total etc act in the period eq 9 9 et cact i 1 j 1 1 k cb k e i i 1 j 1 1 et cact i where etc act is the total mm for all days from 1 to j in a given period determined in eq 9 kcb is a uniform single value basal crop coefficient for each day i to j in a given period ke i is the soil evaporation coefficient on day i and eto i is the pm eto mm on day i and etc act i is daily actual crop et mm on day i the ke i were determined with the fao56 dual kc procedures using the same ke parameters described earlier after two months of guayule germination establishment irrigations ending on jun 21 2020 the i1 treatment was irrigated another six times through mid nov 2020 irrigation for the i1 treatment during the year 2020 was terminated after mid nov 2020 irrigation from march 2021 late winter onward the i1 treatment received a total of 10 irrigations in calendar year 2021 where its final irrigation before harvest was in late oct 2021 the five other treatments i2 i6 each received the same irrigation as i1 through jun 21 2020 the principles regarding the irrigation scheduling for the i2 i6 treatments after the establishment irrigations are as follows considering the suppositions of hunter and kelly 1946 on a silty clay loam soil the i2 and i3 treatments were fully irrigated for the first 15 and 11 months after planting i e through early jul 2021 and early mar 2021 respectively table 2 through those dates the i2 and i3 were irrigated on the same days with essentially the same amounts as i1 the assumption was that etc and db accumulation for the i2 and i3 treatments up to those points in the growing season would be comparable to that in the fully irrigated i1 treatment in previous direct seeded guayule experiments at eloy fully irrigated guayule achieved 100 cover at 10 months after planting in april whereas maximum guayule biomass was achieved by 15 months elshikha et al 2021 wang et al 2022 thus the premise behind the i2 treatment strategy was that after 15 months of growth a significant amount of irrigation water could be saved by terminating irrigation altogether while achieving about the same db expected for the full irrigation schedule of i1 treatment further the soil water stress that would be imposed upon i2 during the final seven months prior to harvest table 2 might result in higher r versus i1 and thus higher ry the hypothesis for the i3 treatment strategy was similar to that for i2 except that i3 after 11 months of full irrigation was given a single spring and a single fall irrigation in 2021 table 2 we considered that these two irrigations would boost the treatment s biomass accumulation somewhat in 2021 but by not irrigating i3 during the peak etc and growth period of summer total water use would be reduced and rubber production would be stimulated due to the stress imposed during the summer period although final biomass for i3 under this scenario was anticipated to be less than that for the fully irrigated i1 it was also expected that r would be higher for i3 than i1 due to the high soil water deficit imposed during the summer of 2021 table 2 the irrigation amounts applied in spring and fall 2021 to i3 were based on soil water content measurements such that the soil water depletion measured just prior to the irrigations was fully replenished to fc the i4 i6 treatments were designed to re consider some of the successful results of reduced irrigation presented in early guayule research by hunter and kelley 1946 benedict et al 1947 and veihmeyer and hendrickson 1961 all refer strategies to force higher r accumulation in shrubs by alternating periods of high and low water stress during the active growing season the i4 treatment was to receive 50 of the irrigation water needed for the fully irrigated guayule i1 treatment after crop establishment starting in mid jul 2020 the i4 irrigation timing followed the i1 schedule but i4 irrigations were only applied every other time the i1 treatment was irrigated table 2 thus the i4 scheduling regime was similar to a veihmeyer and hendrickson 1961 alternating irrigation treatment but it was started in the first year of our experiment the irrigation water applied to i4 were planned to be the same amounts as those given to i1 on every other irrigation date thus when i4 was not irrigated the soil water stress in the treatment would increase whereas when not irrigated the water stress would be alleviated the i5 and i6 treatments table 2 were included to evaluate the effects of much more prolonged periods of extreme soil water deficit followed by infrequent periods of low water stress through occasional irrigation after the last establishment irrigation the i5 treatment was to receive only two additional irrigations in the first year of growth planned for late summer 2020 and late winter 2021 plus two irrigations during the second year of growth planned for mid spring 2021 and early fall 2021 for i6 one additional irrigation was given during the first year of growth late summer 2020 plus one during the second year of growth early spring 2021 as for i3 the supplemental irrigation amounts applied to i5 and i6 replaced the soil water depletion measured just prior to the irrigations to fc fertilizer was applied to all treatments on jul 15 2020 in the form of urea ammonium nitrate 32 n which was injected into the water to all treatment plots at a rate of 65 kg n ha 1 the same rate was applied to treatments in mar 15 2021 this rate 65 kg n ha 1 per year was suggested by bucks et al 1985a for adequate growth for guayule plants and was used in recent guayule studies by hunsaker and elshikha 2017 and hunsaker et al 2019 the injection was done using a single head hydraulic diaphragm chemigation injection pump baldor motor vl3504 santa fe springs ca usa the pump was connected through injection ports to the mainline delivering the water to the furrow plots 2 5 plant growth measurements manual measurements of guayule h and canopy widths were made for nine plants per plot starting on june 12 2020 thereafter h and width measurements were made about every 30 days which continued until mar 2022 canopy width data were used to calculate fc as a percent by eq 10 10 f c w ew w ns 1 p d 100 where w ew is plant width in the east west direction m w ns is plant width in the north south direction m and 1 p d is planting area 1 plant density p d m 2 whole plant samples were harvested on mar 01 2022 22 5 months after planting three 2 m2 sections from each plot were hand harvested all plant harvests were limited to the inner two rows of each plot to minimize any edge effects on plant growth plants were cut at the ground level stover and immediately weighed for fresh weight and then air dried outdoors on shaded wire shelves for 7 days and re weighed for dry weight coffelt and ray 2010 plants were shredded and ground before a subsample was taken and placed in the oven at 140 c for 24 h to remove remaining moisture and then re weighed samples were analyzed at bridgestone americas inc eloy for r and re determined using a soxhlet based near infrared spectroscopy nir method that has high correlation to other guayule rubber analysis methods placido et al 2020 2 6 statistical analyses irrigation and cultivar effects were analyzed statistically using a randomized split plot model with proc mixed sas institute inc 2016 for the

excel 3 results 3 1 irrigation precipitation soil water depletion and crop evapotranspiration the irrigation amounts and the number of irrigations applied to the six treatments are summarized in table 3 prior to differential irrigation a total of 511 mm was applied apr jun 2020 to all treatment plots initially through a sprinkler system 293 mm then by level furrow irrigation 218 mm in 2020 irrigation was terminated in mid nov for the i1 i4 treatments whereas the final irrigation in 2020 for i5 and i6 was in late summer effective precipitation events 1 0 mm per day totaled 25 mm in jul and aug 2020 and totaled 27 mm from mid nov 2020 to the end of feb 2021 irrigation was resumed in early mar 2021 for all treatments except i6 early apr 2021 the final irrigations of the experiment were applied to i1 i2 i3 i5 and i6 treatments on oct 28 jul 05 sep 29 and apr 08 2021 respectively cumulative effective precipitation from mar 01 2021 through harvest mar 01 2022 was 209 mm about 50 mm above the normal yearly precipitation at the location level furrow irrigation amounts for the i1 treatment ranged from 42 mm in may 2020 160 mm in may and jun 2021 the i1 irrigation frequency varied from 1 to 3 irrigations per month highest irrigation frequencies occurred in the spring and summer in both 2020 and 2021 table 3 total irrigation applied during the 22 5 month growth period varied for treatments from 2519 mm for i1 to 822 mm for i6 table 3 total effective precipitation during the period was 261 mm the trends for the cumulative total water applied twa i e cumulative irrigation plus cumulative precipitation with time are shown for irrigation treatments in fig 3 compared to the final twa of the i1 treatment table 3 the reductions in twa for the i2 16 treatments were 17 33 33 51 and 61 respectively average measured swd for irrigation treatments including both cultivars are shown from the beginning of nmm measurements in late may 2020 through late feb 2022 figs 4a and b during the first year of growth fig 4a average swd for the i1 treatment slightly exceeded the 65 target by about 5 on two dates aug 11 and sep 29 2020 during the second year of growth fig 4b measured swd for the i1 was 65 in mid apr and early may but was less than 65 for all dates thereafter notably higher swd than that of i1 was observed for the i4 i6 treatments starting in the latter half of jul 2020 after initiation of soil water deficit periods for those treatments thereafter the swd for the i5 and i6 treatments stayed consistently higher than that for i1 where they often exceeded 80 90 during their water deficit periods table 2 the irrigation regime of every other irrigation i4 resulted in alternating periods of elevated and diminished differences in the i4 swd compared to that for i1 the elevated swd mainly occurred during mid jul mid aug in 2020 late jun early aug 2021 and early nov 2021 late feb 2022 figs 4a and b during other times i4 and i1 had similar swd the measured swd for i4 was greater than 80 on two dates early aug 2020 and early ray 2021 as expected marked increases in swd for the i2 and i3 treatments compared to i1 did not arise until early spring 2021 i3 and late summer 2021 i2 following the cutback and termination of irrigation for those treatments table 2 the swd for i3 was especially high during summer 2021 82 89 whereas it was 51 80 for i2 during the same summer period for measurement dates in fig 4a the average and range of swd were 48 11 71 47 8 74 50 9 78 53 11 89 67 8 91 and 59 3 83 for i1 i6 respectively for measurement dates in fig 4b swd averaged 54 34 68 69 38 82 79 55 89 72 56 81 80 56 93 and 81 65 88 for i1 i6 respectively the combined estimated and actual daily etc rate averaged by month and daily cumulative etc for the 22 5 months of guayule growth are shown for the i1 treatment in fig 5 in 2020 the daily etc was estimated through may 20 2020 the swb calculations indicated that 71 mm of water percolated below the root zone during late apr late may when germination establishment irrigations were applied thereafter calculated dp was minimal for the i1 treatment and likely minimal in all other treatments as well relatively high average daily etc rates occurred during apr and may 2020 reflecting primarily soil evaporation contributions following frequent germination establishment irrigations first through the sprinkler system and then by level furrow irrigation starting in early may starting in late jun 2020 level furrow irrigations to i1 were much less frequent resulting in less soil evaporation and lower average etc values than in apr may as the crop grew during summer of 2020 average daily etc increased from about 4 0 mm d 1 in jun until reaching maximum values 6 0 mm d 1 in aug and sep 2020 average monthly kc values calculated for jun jul aug and sep 2020 data were 0 47 0 68 0 85 1 03 respectively after aug the monthly average etc rate steadily declined until it fell to a minimum value in jan 2021 of 1 0 mm d 1 during the winter dormancy months of feb mar 2021 the etc rate increased slightly and then increased rapidly starting in spring 2021 the maximum monthly etc rate was 10 3 mm d 1 in jun 2021 the corresponding monthly kc value in jun was about 1 16 the climate in jul and aug 2021 was much more humid than jun and precipitation was above historical normal during those months average etc declined to 8 0 mm d 1 however compared to jun the monthly kc for jul and aug increased 1 26 and 1 33 respectively perhaps due to higher soil evaporation from the precipitation the etc continued to decline until it reached a minimum value 0 5 mm d 1 in dec 2021 and had a corresponding kc of about 0 30 the etc rate increased to a value of 1 0 mm d 1 in jan and feb 2022 shortly before harvest as the monthly averaged etc data would suggest cumulative daily etc for the i1 treatment rose rapidly from jun to sept 2020 and then leveled off during the winter dormancy period starting in dec fig 5 the rate of increase in cumulative etc was higher during the second summer of 2021 than during the first year of growth the trend in cumulative etc during winter dormancy periods was similar in both years cumulative etc was 1250 mm from late apr through dec 2020 1860 mm from jan 01 to dec 31 2021 and 55 mm jan 01 feb 24 2022 for the 22 5 months of growth the total etc was 3165 mm 3 2 plant growth guayule h for irrigation treatments with time are shown separately for the az2 and az6 cultivars figs 6a and b respectively statistical analysis indicated that h was significantly greater for az2 than az6 plants starting from the first measurements made in early jul 2020 while there was no significant differences for h between irrigation treatments until mid oct 2020 or 5 5 months after planting differences in h between the cultivars were significant throughout the entire growing period with az2 having taller plants than az6 from early nov 2020 through late apr 2021 the h for i1 was significantly greater than h for i4 i6 but not the h for the i2 and i3 treatments the h differences from late may early nov in 2021 were consistently greater for i1 and i2 than for i5 and i6 for az2 but not for az6 final measurements just before harvest in 2022 revealed that mean h for the i1 and i2 were both significantly greater than those for i3 i6 for az2 whereas the h for i1 and i2 were only significantly greater than the i6 treatment for az6 percent fractional canopy cover increased for irrigation treatments from early jul until nov 2020 for both az2 and az6 figs 7a and b respectively similar to h results fc was significantly greater for az2 than az6 in jul and aug 2020 when differences for fc between irrigation treatments were not significant for measurements from sep through early feb 2021 mean fc was greater for az2 than az6 though the differences varied between being significant and not significant during that time period by late apr 2021 onward the fc differences between cultivars were not significant while az2 initially exhibited more vigorous cover development than az6 during the first summer by early spring 2021 the mean fc for az6 was the same as that for az2 significant irrigation treatment effects on fc did not occur until mid nov 2020 or about a month later than significant irrigation effects on h in mid nov the fc for treatments i1 i4 were significantly greater than for i6 but not i5 by late may 2021 the fc were close to 100 for the i1 i4 treatments in both cultivars and were significantly greater than those for the i5 and i6 treatments fc less than 90 from late jun onward differences in fc due to irrigation were not significant as the i5 and i6 treatments attained fc greater than 90 in jun and 100 by early oct 2021 3 3 yield and water productivity the db means for both cultivars increased linearly with twa and regression of db vs twa for treatments had a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 85 fig 8a statistically both the main effect of irrigation and the cultivar effect on db were significant while irrigation by cultivar interaction was not significant the db mean for irrigation treatment was highest for the i1 treatment and lowest for the i6 treatment table 4 while the db means for the i1 i2 and i4 treatments were not significantly different from each other they were each significantly greater than those for the i3 i5 and i6 table 4 mean db by cultivar was 9 higher for az2 than az6 and the difference was significant as seen in fig 8a db differences between cultivars were more pronounced within the i3 i4 and i6 treatments compared to the i1 i2 and i5 treatments however statistical comparisons of cultivars within each irrigation treatment indicated that the db mean only differed significantly between cultivars within the i4 treatment table 4 it is notable that the mean db of the az2 cultivar for the i4 treatment was 19 2 mg ha 1 which was only 8 lower than that for az2 for the i1 treatment consistent with the irrigation mean results for cultivars the az2 cultivar within the i4 treatment had significantly greater db than that for i3 which received essentially the same twa as i4 as well as those for i5 and i6 table 4 irrigation and the cultivar effects on db wp were significant mean db wp for irrigation treatments was highest for i4 closely followed by i5 where both treatments were significantly greater than the dp wp for i1 and i3 table 4 while mean db wp for the i2 and i6 treatments were higher than for i1 and i3 the differences were not significant the mean db wp was significantly greater for az2 than az6 though statistical comparison of cultivars within each irrigation treatment indicated that only az2 within i4 and i6 treatments had significantly greater db wp than az6 the az2 cultivar within the i4 i5 and i6 treatments achieved significantly greater db wp than all other irrigation cultivar combinations except for az6 within the i5 treatment table 4 numerically db wp was the highest 1 03 kg m 3 for the az2 cultivar within the i4 irrigation treatment the r in plants at harvest was significantly different for irrigation treatment and cultivar and there was no interaction the mean r generally increased with decreasing twa and increasing swd although mean r for the i1 i2 and i4 treatments was less than those the i3 i5 and i6 treatments significant differences in mean r due to irrigation occurred only between the i5 versus the i1 i2 and i4 treatments table 4 for cultivars mean r was 20 higher for az2 than az6 within all irrigation treatments r for az2 was significantly greater than those for az6 statistically r was significantly greater for the az2 cultivar within the i5 and i6 treatments than those for all other irrigation cultivar combinations except for az2 within the i3 treatment table 4 unlike r re was not significantly different due to irrigation while the cultivar effect on re was significant interaction between irrigation and cultivar was also significant comparison of cultivars within irrigation treatments revealed that re was significantly greater for az2 than az6 within the i1 i2 i3 and i5 treatments but not within the i4 and i6 treatments highest re occurred for the az2 cultivar within the i1 and i2 irrigation treatments which were significantly greater than re for all other irrigation cultivar combinations except those for az2 within the i3 and i5 treatments table 4 as it was found for db the ry means for cultivars increased linearly with twa where the r2 of the linear regression was 0 59 fig 8b for ry irrigation and cultivar effects were significant the irrigation means for ry were highest for the i1 treatment followed by i2 and i4 which were not significantly different than for i1 table 4 due to higher r for the i3 and i5 compared to i2 and i4 the ry for i3 was not significantly different than that for i2 while ry for i5 was not significantly different than that for i4 table 4 the mean ry for the i6 treatment was significantly lower than the ry for all other treatments the combination of higher db and r for the az2 than az6 cultivar resulted in az2 having 27 higher ry the differences in ry for cultivars are clearly observed in fig 8b because differences in ry between cultivars were marked linear regressions of ry versus twa were performed separately for the cultivars which gave high r2 values to 0 86 and 0 91 for az2 and az6 respectively data not shown the maximum ry of 864 kg ha 1 was attained for az2 within the i1 treatment the second and third highest ry were attained for az2 within the i4 and i2 treatments which were about 10 11 lower than the ry for i1 the ry wp was also significantly affected by irrigation and cultivar while there was no interaction for irrigation mean ry wp was significantly greater for the i4 i5 and i6 treatments than for i1 differences similar to those found for db wp table 4 however for ry wp the mean was highest for the i5 treatment then for i4 vis a viz the db wp ranking the mean ry wp was significantly lower for the i1 than all but the i2 treatment the cultivar differences were similar to that for ry where mean ry wp was 26 higher for az2 than az6 the best ry wp was attained in the az2 cultivar within i5 closely followed by az2 within the i4 and i6 treatments table 4 the rey had similar irrigation treatment and cultivar trends with twa to those shown for ry in fig 8b the r2 of the linear regression of rey vs twa fig 8c was 0 69 higher than the r2 for ry vs twa for rey the irrigation and cultivar effects were both significant mean rey was highest for the i1 treatment but was not significantly greater than for i2 and i4 table 4 both i1 and i2 means were greater than means for i3 i5 and i6 while the mean for i4 was significantly greater than means for i5 and i6 only for cultivars the mean rey for az2 was 24 greater than the mean for az6 as both db and re were greater for az2 than az6 because differences between cultivars were pronounced linear regressions of rey versus twa were performed separately for the two cultivars those regressions increased the r2 to 0 93 and 0 85 for az2 and az6 respectively data not shown as with ry maximum rey was also obtained in the az2 cultivar within the i1 treatment the mean rey wp were highest among irrigation treatments for i4 and i5 which were both significantly greater than the rey wp for i1 table 4 for rey wp a significant cultivar effect occurred and there was no interaction within a given irrigation treatment rey wp was significantly greater for az2 than az6 for the i1 i4 treatments but not for the i5 and i6 treatments maximum ry wp occurred for az2 within the i4 treatment followed by az2 within the i5 treatment the percent reductions in total irrigation total i and twa applied to the i2 i6 treatments from that to the fully irrigated i1 amounts varied from 17 to 19 for i2 to 61 67 for i6 table 5 for the i2 i6 treatments the percent reduction in the mean yield parameters were less than those for twa except in the case of i3 which were about the same as the twa reduction table 5 relative to the reduction in twa for treatments yield reductions were the least for the i4 treatment where yields declined only about 15 or less than one half the twa reduction of 33 when considering just the az2 cultivar the i4 reductions for db and ry were less than 10 or less than one third of the percent twa reduction among the other deficit treatments the most notable was the i5 treatment having a 52 reduction in twa losing about 40 in db but only 31 in ry the percent reductions of the yield parameters for the i2 and i6 treatments compared to their twa reductions were less substantial i e reductions on the order of 6 9 lower for yield than twa the percent increases in the wp of the yield parameters were the most for the i4 and i5 treatments and were generally similar between the two treatments table 5 however given the greater reduction in twa for the i5 than i4 the relative gain in wp was more appreciable 4 discussion this experiment was conducted to evaluate yield responses to six different irrigation strategies for two direct seeded guayule cultivars grown in the u s southwest desert climate for the study we focused on the most common irrigation system furrow that is used for field crops in pinal county arizona where the study was conducted limited past research suggested that irrigation water use could be substantially reduced for guayule grown in heavier soils which hold more available water than lighter soils while maintaining or increasing the ry generally associated with fully irrigated guayule thus the experiment was conducted on a heavier silty clay loam soil in eloy consequently the results are limited to the soil type planting period and irrigation method used in the experiment additional research and analysis would be needed to evaluate deficit irrigation regimes for guayule grown in similar and lighter soils with pressurized and non pressurized irrigation systems in the region for direct seeded guayule there is need to keep the soil surface layer wet during the first two weeks for optimum germination and to then to provide moist soil conditions for seedlings over the next six weeks until stand establishment is complete bucks et al 1986 jorge et al 2006 dissanayake et al 2008 in this experiment a total of 511 mm was applied to plots for the two months following planting to meet the germination establishment soil water conditions over one half the amount was applied with sprinklers for the first two weeks while the remainder was applied by furrow irrigation the total applied was 25 less than what was reported by elshikha et al 2021 for the first two months in earlier direct seeded studies with sprinkler furrow irrigation at the eloy location however in the earlier eloy study more irrigation was provided by furrow during the establishment period compared to the present study in direct seeded field germination experiments on a sand soil in yuma arizona bucks et al 1986 applied daily irrigation for 14 day germination periods for early apr plantings followed by irrigation about every three days during the subsequent establishment period in that study between 100 and 150 mm of total irrigation for germination and 215 250 mm total irrigation for the next two months was applied as an overhead mist using a lateral move sprinkler system although the direct seeded guayule germination and survival rates in that study were quite poor this earlier work shows that germination establishment irrigation use could be considerably lower than 500 mm the present study and elshikha et al 2021 have clearly demonstrated that high guayule plant populations are now attainable with direct seeding in both heavy and light soils however a major gap still exists on how to appropriately manage direct seeded guayule irrigation during germination establishment more research should be conducted to determine optimum frequencies and amounts of irrigation that satisfy the needed soil moisture levels under various soil types irrigation system methods planting dates and locations the cumulative irrigation applied to the i1 treatment after 22 5 months 2519 mm was about 700 mm less or 22 less than applied to the spring planted level furrow treatment after 23 months in the earlier direct seeded study at eloy elshikha et al 2021 compared to the latter study the lower amount for i1 was due to less germination establishment irrigation significantly lower irrigation requirements during the second year summer due to frequent precipitation and that no irrigation was needed during the final four months before harvest other studies in central arizona using transplants and furrow irrigation reported cumulative irrigation amounts of 3360 mm after 21 months bucks et al 1985a and 3570 mm after 24 months hunsaker and elshikha 2017 for well watered treatments some general outcomes of db and rubber production can be related to the soil water depletion levels of the treatments in the study during the first year of the experiment the average measured swd was similar for the i1 i4 treatments 47 53 and higher though not extreme for i5 and i6 67 and 59 respectively however during the second year swd averaged 54 69 79 72 80 and 81 for i1 i6 respectively the results show that db was significantly reduced for treatments with 79 or greater average swd in the second year i e i3 i5 and i6 while r was also significantly increased at the higher swd levels however the increase in r for those treatments was far less than that needed to achieve ry comparable to treatments with lower average swd in the second year the r results for the i5 and i6 differ considerably from the hunter and kelley 1946 findings also on a heavier soil type the i5 and i6 obtained about a 20 increase in rubber content over the well watered treatment whereas hunter and kelley 1946 found about a 50 increase in r for extremely dry treatments over r obtained for well watered treatments the irrigation regime of the i6 treatment in the present study was very similar to the number 4 treatment of hunter and kelley where only a spring irrigation was given in the second year the average swd of i6 in the second year was less than that estimated for the number 4 treatment 90 as precipitation was significant at eloy in jul aug of the second year it is possible however that the r would have been higher in i6 and i5 had there been no rain in summer to decrease the treatment s soil water stress level the responses in db and r using alternating periods of high and low swd for the i4 treatment was consistent with the treatment of every other irrigation studied by veihmeyer and hendrickson 1961 after two years of growth in each study there was no difference between the alternate irrigation and the fully irrigated treatment in r nor db for a treatment with a single spring irrigation in the second year similar to number 4 treatment of taylor and kelley and the present i6 veihmeyer and hendrickson 1961 found a significant increase in r over the well watered but it was only 20 higher like the r gain for i6 for the same soil type in earlier studies at eloy elshikha et al 2021 wang et al 2022 applying about one half the irrigation applied to fully irrigated furrow plots did not increase the r nor significantly reduce the db of guayule this was consistent with the i4 results where the average swd was maintained at about 75 during the second year of growth in the earlier eloy studies elshikha et al 2021 reported etc data from a direct seeded guayule experiment in 2018 2020 at the same location and planting date as the present study for the well watered level furrow treatment in that study they indicate a maximum etc rate of 10 8 mm d 1 occurred in jun of the second year bucks et al 1985b determined maximum etc rates were 7 0 mm d 1 in the first year during aug sep and were about 10 0 mm d 1 in the second year during jun jul for a well watered furrow irrigation treatment with spring transplanted guayule in good agreement with the current and previous studies hunsaker and elshikha 2017 reported well watered fall transplanted guayule using level furrow irrigation had etc rates of 6 4 mm d 1 in aug and sep of the first year and 9 8 mm d 1 in jun jul of the second year relevant literature on guayule kc estimation based on eto was provided by elshikha et al 2021 that study indicated average monthly kc values for the well watered level furrow treatment were somewhat higher during the first summer jun sep 0 74 1 23 compared to the those in present study in the second year monthly kc were higher in jun 1 23 but lower in jul and aug 1 17 and 1 22 respectively than the kc for those months during the present study cumulative etc for the i1 treatment 3165 mm was about 5 lower than that for the well watered level furrow treatment in elshikha et al 2021 for approximately the same guayule growing period in other studies cumulative etc was 3000 and 3275 mm bucks et al 1985b and hunsaker and elshikha 2017 respectively indicating similar crop water use for well watered direct seeded and transplanted guayule linear relationships of guayule db ry and rey regressed by cumulative etc or by total twa have been reported in the literature for two year and four year transplanted crops miyamoto et al 1984 bucks et al 1985c nakayama 1991 hunsaker et al 2019 hunsaker and elshikha 2017 in the cited studies the r2 for db versus the water variable were somewhat higher 0 90 0 98 than the r2 obtained for db by twa in the present study 0 85 as pointed out years ago by miyamoto et al 1984 guayule db production is driven by water input and thus db generally responds to water in a similar manner as that observed for many vegetative crops on the other hand relationships of ry to water can be more variable than for db particularly if there is a pronounced decline in r at higher water input the range of r2 for ry versus water input from the transplanted studies above varied from 0 48 to 0 91 and averaged 0 77 while it was lower 0 59 in the present study for rey versus water r2 values were 0 90 or higher from the literature but 0 69 in the present study however the lower r2 in the present study were greatly affected by significant differences in ry and rey between az2 and az6 the ry and rey with twa were highly linear when regressions considered each cultivar separately giving r2 values more in line with the literature current results suggest that linear relationships between direct seeded guayule yield parameters with water will hold up even with extremely different irrigation timing though different cultivars may have different linear relationships the mean db for the az2 cultivar within the i1 treatment was about 21 lower than that obtained with direct seeded az2 grown at the same location for a well watered furrow irrigation treatment elshikha et al 2021 however the earlier study treatment received 24 more twa consequently db wp was about the same for the i1 treatment and the well watered furrow treatment in the earlier study at eloy 0 75 and 0 74 kg m 3 respectively the db for i1 was comparable to well watered guayule transplants grown with furrow irrigation in other arizona studies on lighter soils bucks et al 1985b coffelt and ray 2010 hunsaker and elshikha 2017 earlier data for well watered guayule on the silty clay loam soil in california indicate db about 40 lower than the i1 although the az2 cultivar within the i1 treatment achieved less db than the furrow treatment of elshikha et al 2021 due to the higher r and re in the present study ry and rey were similar in the studies where ry and rey for i1 was 11 higher and 5 lower than those in the earlier study respectively in regard to rubber and resin contents the az2 cultivar in the present study achieved r and re that averaged 4 5 and 8 1 respectively compared to 2 9 and 7 1 for the furrow treatment reported by elshikha et al 2021 the present study elshikha et al 2021 and wang et al 2022 used a different laboratory analytic method to determine the r and re i e the soxhlet based nir method placido et al 2020 than that used in the cited earlier guayule studies i e accelerated solvent extraction ase method pearson et al 2013 while the two methods are well correlated r by ase is notably higher than that by nir placido et al 2020 therefore r re ry and rey for present and earlier studies cannot be compared without bias in the present study as evidenced by the significant irrigation by cultivar interaction for re re response to irrigation was different between the az2 and az6 cultivars while re for az2 generally increased with the irrigation treatment twa it generally decreased with twa for az6 discrepancies in the final r and re also occurred between the az2 significantly greater and az6 cultivars although mean db for az2 was only 9 greater than for az6 cultivar differences in r and re resulted 28 and 24 higher mean ry and rey for az2 than az6 respectively which resulted in significantly greater mean ry wp and rey wp for az2 of about the same magnitude reasons for the different cultivar r responses are unclear and differ from ray et al 1999 who indicated significantly higher r for az6 than az2 after two years however the significantly greater re for az2 than az6 was consistent with ray et al 1999 though less extreme in the latter the plant height and cover data indicate much more rapid development occurred for the az2 than az6 within each irrigation level because az6 plants were significantly shorter than az2 it is possible that lower r for az6 occurred because those plants may have experienced lower water stress effects than those experienced by the az2 plants within the same irrigation treatment in comparing the different water deficit strategies to i1 it appears that the i4 treatment every other irrigation of i1 approach is the best option to substantially reduce guayule irrigation water use in this soil type this was most evident in az2 where final db ry and rey were not significantly lower than those for i1 even though twa was curtailed by 33 and irrigation by 36 the db wp ry wp and rey wp for az2 within i4 were maximum or near maximum and always significantly greater than those for i1 the az6 cultivar within the i4 treatment had significantly greater db wp and rey wp than for az6 within i1 but also had lower db and ry than the i1 terminating irrigation in the second year at mid summer seven months before the final harvest i2 resulted in a 17 reduction in twa 19 for irrigation which did not significantly reduce db ry and rey compared to i1 however unlike the i4 the reduction in twa for i2 did not significantly increase the wp above those for i1 this was the case for either cultivar terminating irrigation during summer months in the second guayule year i3 cut twa to the same extent as for i4 however the effects of this water deficit period significantly reduced db and yields compared to i1 and did not increase wp while the i3 treatment had somewhat higher r than for i1 the difference was not significant thus it appears that imposing severe water stress during the entire second summer of guayule when etc demand is highest was harmful rather than beneficial for the i5 and i6 treatments having extremely limited irrigation after establishment the i5 two irrigations per year appeared to fare better than the i6 one irrigation per year with regard to yields and wp however while the db ry rey and the wp were always higher for i5 than i6 they were not significantly greater except in the case of db for the az6 cultivar the i5 treatment did achieve significantly greater r than i1 in az2 but the low db production in i5 cut short attaining ry sufficiently close to i1 considering that the db and yield responses for the i3 and i5 treatments were not significantly different and that both treatments had severe water deficit during the second summer it is inferred that both treatment approaches could achieve higher db without significantly changing the total irrigation given to the treatments during the experiment in other guayule studies biomass for well watered guayule rapidly increased from early spring to near maximum levels in late summer during the second year hunsaker and elshikha 2017 hunsaker et al 2019 wang et al 2022 severely limited irrigation treatments during this period however had much slower db accumulation as shown in hunsaker and elshikha 2017 and hunsaker et al 2019 for the i3 and i5 treatment approaches providing one summer irrigation and deleting the fall irrigation might significantly increase the db with a potential gain in the final r that those treatments achieved in the experiment thus twa for the two treatment approaches would not have to change only irrigation timing the same irrigation timing switch is foreseen as also improving the i6 treatment approach in pinal county growers are presently reducing the number of hectares that they planted in the past because colorado river water is no longer available for irrigation traditional crops such as cotton and alfalfa grown in the county and much of the u s southwest desert require about 1450 1900 mm of irrigation per year nass 2010 however yields for such crops typically decline rapidly when water stress occurs due to limited irrigation bronson et al 2019 hunsaker et al 2002 guayule is seen as a viable crop alternative in the region because it can withstand significant water stress and as the i4 treatment indicates needs substantially less irrigation per year 800 mm to achieve maximum yields significant reductions in irrigation needed in germination establishment of guayule may also be likely with additional research focus as mentioned earlier considering the possibility that future water allotment cutbacks will be insufficient for even the i4 schedule e g on the order of 500 mm year then the guayule crop would have to be managed similar to the i5 scheme however based on the poor yield for i5 it would probably be more effective to provide the allotted water in spring and summer where it can be utilized by the plant for growth 5 conclusions direct seeded guayule cultivars az6 and az2 were grown in a field experiment conducted for 22 5 months in central arizona on a silty loam to silty clay loam soil using level furrow irrigation the aim was to determine effective deficit irrigation strategies that could be used to reduce irrigation water use while maintaining guayule biomass and rubber and resin yields comparable to those attained with a fully irrigated control treatment clearly the best deficit irrigation strategy found was applying irrigation every other time the fully irrigated treatment was irrigated in this study fully irrigated guayule required irrigation about every 10 days during summer months and about every 30 days during spring and fall deficit irrigation strategies that imposed high soil water deficits during the summer of the second year of guayule were deemed to be detrimental even though they significantly reduced irrigation water use we conclude that subjecting guayule to severe water deficits during the second summer was not a good strategy future research should evaluate deficit irrigation strategies that focuses on fall rather than summer soil water deficits during the second year of guayule in this regard it may be possible to boost the rubber yields to some extent under extremely limited irrigation if only a single irrigation can be applied during the second summer because az2 outperformed az6 for all yield and water productivity criteria az2 should be the cultivar focus for guayule commercialization efforts future research is also needed to determine best management practices and more efficient early season irrigation practices for establishing direct seeded guayule crops using surface drip irrigation instead of sprinklers

9112,in recent years global warming has led to frequent waterlogging disaster wld hindering the normal growth and development of crops affecting the sustainable development of the peanut industry and food security in china henan province the main peanut producing area with frequent wld was selected as the study area based on the soil crop atmosphere continuum system this study constructed a comprehensive waterlogging index cwi to monitor waterlogging events to determine the applicability of cwi the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei was calculated a risk assessment model was constructed to evaluate the hazards of wld during the different stages of development of spring peanut the water stress at different growth stages of peanut on crucial physiological indices were studied to determine the natural vulnerability curve of wld as a consequence based on the four factor theory of disaster formation this study established a dynamic wld assessment model for peanut and evaluated the comprehensive risk of wld in henan from 1990 to 2020 the results indicated that the cwi is capable of accurately identifying waterlogging events and peanut responded significantly differently to water stress the longer the duration of stress in the late growth period lgp the higher was the rate of yield reduction the comprehensive risk of wld to peanut rose from north to south during the three growth periods during the lgp high risk regions constituted approximately 34 3 of the total population this study provides a scientific basis and technical support for better

waterlogging index is the most commonly used standard for monitoring and management wang et al 2019 currently the waterlogging indices used for the hazard assessment of disaster inducing factors mainly include three types i e single multiple and aggregated wang et al 2019 xu et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 most single indices only consider precipitation factors such as the precipitation anomaly percentage pa and the standard precipitation index spi although they can intuitively reflect the waterlogging caused by abnormal precipitation cong et al 2017 however considering precipitation alone leads to incomplete results since it does not include factors such as soil and crops leading to its poor applicability for monitoring waterlogging events in different regions yildirak and selcuk kestel 2015 wang et al 2019 multiple indices such as palmer drought severity index pdsi and crop moisture index cmi van der schrier et al 2011 were established considering other variables compared with single indices multiple indices can better monitor water change but have some limitations since they do not consider the impact of land cover on water balance narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 in recent years the development and application of waterlogging indices based on remote sensing has been widely studied hassan et al 2019 amer 2021 for example the normalized difference water index ndvi and soil moisture index smi can objectively reflect the surface vegetation and water and monitor wld in the study area however when analyzing the influence of waterlogging on crops meteorological factors are seldom considered zhang et al 2018 which makes the results lack pertinence the construction of aggregated indices considers several factors for example wang et al 2019 accurately analyzed the drought and waterlogging of maize in central and western jilin province based on the comprehensive drought and waterlogging indices constructed by pdsi standardized normalized difference vegetation index zndvi and standardized soil moisture index zsm as the formation of agricultural waterlogging is complicated and involves many factors koroleva et al 2019 it is necessary to construct an aggregated index for a complete evaluation agro meteorological disaster risk assessment is a process of evaluating the possibility of agro meteorological disasters and possible reduction of agricultural output loss of quality and finance zhang 2004 related research is not only a hot spot in the field of catastrophe and agrometeorology but also relevant for government administrative and agricultural production departments zhang et al 2006 jia et al 2012 presently theories on the assessment of disaster risk at home and abroad mainly include two factor three factor and four factor theories zhang et al 2006 based on the two factor theory zhang et al 2019 constructed a dynamic drought risk assessment model to assess the drought risk of maize in jilin province villani et al 2022 assessed drought risk in the mediterranean agricultural basin from three aspects hazard vulnerability and exposure pei et al 2019 selected four evaluation indices from four cities in heilongjiang province as application examples and analyzed the temporal and spatial changes in agricultural drought risk a few studies have been conducted on comprehensive waterlogging indices and most of them use single or multiple indices to monitor drought bijaber et al 2018 khan et al 2020 in addition many research systems for risk assessment are static and lack dynamic risk assessment based on agro meteorological disaster risk formation mechanism and multi source data zhang et al 2019 cui et al 2021 the common target crops for research on agro meteorological disaster risk assessment in china are maize wheat rice and other field crops zhang et al 2019 guo et al 2021 li et al 2021 however there is insufficient data on cash crops ma et al 2021a yang et al 2022 therefore based on the soil crop atmosphere continuum system a comprehensive waterlogging index cwi was established to analyze the wld hazard of peanut during different growth periods and the water balance and waterlogging in different stages of peanut are reflected from many angles then based on the four factor theory zhang et al 2006 the vulnerability and risk formation mechanism of wld were explored using crucial physiological rate indicators in different growth stages with water stress as the starting point and wld risk was comprehensively and dynamically evaluated the main contents of this paper relating to peanut in henan are as follows 1 cwi was used to analyze the temporal and spatial distribution of waterlogging events in different growth periods 2 evaluation of water stress on crucial physiological indices to determine the vulnerability of wld combined with water stress and 3 construction of comprehensive risk assessment model to evaluate wld risk the results obtained will have important practical significance for rational irrigation stable yield increase and sustainable development in different growth periods it can also be extended to other disaster types and regions growing different crops for comprehensive risk assessment and management 2 study area and data sources 2 1 study area henan fig 1 is located in the middle of china 31 23 36 22 n 110 21 116 39 e and it is one of the main peanut producing areas in china in 2020 the peanut yield of henan exceeded 5 94 106 t accounting for about 34 of the total national yield henan province bureau of statistics 2021 henan has a medium latitude subtropical monsoon climate the annual mean temperature is 12 9 16 5 the average annual sunshine hours are about 1505 9 2230 7 h and the annual precipitation is 500 1100 mm so it is suitable for planting peanut the precipitation is relatively concentrated in peanut growing season and prone to wld reducing production of peanut zhang et al 2022 2 2 data sources the vegetation index selected was divided into two parts the gimms 3 g dataset 1990 1 1999 12 provided by national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa with a spatial resolution of 8 km 8 km and the monthly ndvi dataset mod13a3 provided by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa with a high spatial resolution of 1 km 1 km 2000 1 2020 12 the gimms 3 g dataset was resampled to the same resolution as that of the mod13a3 dataset the final ndvi dataset s obtained using the maximum value composite mvc method the data sources used in this study are shown in table 1 3 methods 3 1 framework for wld risk assessment as shown in fig 2 this study is based on the four factor theory combining the previous studies wei et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 and the actual water demand for peanut the growth was divided into three periods namely the early growth period egp middle growth period mgp and late growth period lgp table 2 at each growth period the comprehensive wld risk was dynamically evaluated by selecting indicators from four criteria hazard vulnerability exposure and disaster prevention and mitigation to establish the risk assessment index 3 2 wld hazard assessment 3 2 1 wld hazard assessment based on multi source data 3 2 1 1 cwi based on the soil crop atmosphere continuum system the waterlogging index describes the duration severity and scope of wld however because of the complexity of the spatiotemporal variation it is not possible to accurately monitor wld using a single index wang et al 2019 the influence of meteorological factors the water demand of vegetation and soil conditions should be considered in agricultural wld anderson et al 2013 rekwar et al 2022 therefore this study is based on the comprehensive soil crop atmosphere continuum system fig 3 integrating meteorological and remote sensing data reanalysis of multi source data selecting crop water surplus and deficit index cwsdi vegetation condition index vci and soil moisture condition index smci based on the water demand and effective precipitation the cwsdi was based on meteorological data provided by the national information meteorological science center and the vci was calculated based on the ndvi smci was the reanalyzed data calculated based on the high spatial resolution climate surface dataset of the global land area finally the cwi was constructed by combining the weighting method based on the ideal point and calculated using formula wang et al 2019 1 cwi i ω 1 cwsdi i ω 2 vci i ω 3 smci i where ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 are the weights of the three indices calculated as 0 426 0 234 and 0 340 respectively based on the combination weighting method 3 2 1 1 1 cwsdi continuous precipitation at sowing led to excessive soil moisture and resultant delay rainy weather also caused reduction in the photosynthesis and respiration intensity pollen transmission overgrowth of weeds in farmland stunting of normal growth of peanut and delayed harvest bishnoi and krishnamoorthy 1992 jiang et al 2022 therefore cwsdi was selected as a comprehensive index affecting the wld the formula used is as follows wang et al 2018 2 cwsdi i p ei et ci et ci in which i is the growth period p ei is the effective precipitation mm of crops et ci is crop water demand mm and when cwsdi i 0 0 0 it means water surplus deficit and balance of water budget respectively guo et al 2022 3 p et α t p t 4 p ei t 1 n p et in which p t is the tth time rainfall mm p et is the tth effective rainfall mm α is the effective utilization coefficient when p t 5 mm α t 0 5 p t 50 mm α t 0 9 p t 50 mm α t 0 75 p et is the effective crop precipitation mm guo et al 2022 5 et c k c et 0 6 et 0 0 408 r n g γ 900 t mean 273 u 2 e s e a γ 1 0 34 u 2 in the formula et0 is the potential evapotranspiration of crops calculated by the penman monteith p m model recommended by fao 56 mm d 1 is the slope of saturated water vapor pressure curve kpa c rn is surface net radiation mj m 2 d 1 g is soil heat flux mj m 2 d

saturated water vapor pressure kpa ea is the actual water vapor pressure kpa at present there are few observed data on peanut which can only be determined according to the crop coefficient recommended by fao and previous studies valipour 2017 wei et al 2021 the kc values of peanut in the egp mgp and lgp are 0 5 1 15 and 0 6 respectively 3 2 1 1 2 smci smci is the normalized calculation of the soil moisture variables indicating the waterlogging degree to quantify events the smci index reflects the dynamic effect of precipitation on soil moisture the larger the value the higher will be the rainfall and soil moisture which affect the average growth of crop resulting in reduced or no yield shen et al 2019 cao et al 2022 the formula is 7 smci i sm i sm min sm max sm min smci is the normalized soil moisture condition index and is expressed as pixel of soil moisture in the root zone in the same months from 1990 to 2020 smmax and smmin represent the maximum and minimum soil moisture in each pixel of growth periods in the last 31 years respectively 3 2 1 1 3 vci the wld greatly affects growth at all stages leading to a decrease of vegetation quiring and ganesh 2010 wang et al 2019 therefore in this study the vci was selected to quantify the degree of environmental stress on vegetation to reflect the severity of waterlogging affecting the growth of peanut 8 vci i ndvi i ndvi min ndvi max ndvi min the vci represents the growth of vegetation ndvmax and ndvimin represent the maximum and minimum values of ndvi for each pixel for each growth stages over the last 31 years respectively 3 2 1 2 wld hazard assessment at present few reports are available on the classification of waterlogging based on cwi at home and abroad and most of them depend on meteorological index the standard precipitation evapotranspiration index spei is widely used and more accurate for dividing the degree of waterlogging chen et al 2020b zhu et al 2022 in addition wld are caused either by extreme or concentrated precipitation accompanied by high short and sudden precipitation intensity chen et al 2020a deng et al 2022 therefore to verify the applicability of the cwi we selected the monthly scale spei and combined with previous studies wang et al 2019 used the equal interval method to classify different grades of waterlogging events table 3 according to table 3 the waterlogging grades in the study area were divided and the frequency of occurrence was calculated for different growth periods of peanut the calculation is as follows ma et al 2021b 9 f li n li n 100 where nli is the number of l grade waterlogging events in the ith growth period n is the sequence length the risk of disaster inducing factors is characterized by the frequency and intensity and expressed as h f f i zhang et al 2006 ma et al 2021b in this study the intensity of mild moderate severe and extremely severe waterlogging events i1 4 were assigned to 1 2 3 and 4 respectively that is the higher the frequency and intensity of waterlogging the greater is the risk therefore the expression of hazard factors in different growth periods based on the cwi is as follows 10 h i l 1 4 f li i l where fli is the frequency of waterlogging events of different levels in different growth periods and il is the corresponding waterlogging intensity 3 2 1 3 comparison and verification of spei index and cwi spei is a widely used and accurate index for dividing waterlogging degree implying that waterlogging is not only affected by precipitation but is also related to evapotranspiration gao et al 2017 li and huang 2021 yang et al 2021 to verify the usability of cwi this study compared the spei with cwi the calculation of spei is as follows vicente serrano et al 2010 11 d h p h pet h ph is the monthly precipitation mm and peth mm d 1 is the monthly potential evapotranspiration of crops calculated using the p m model the dh data series is normalized and the index corresponding to each value is calculated because there may be negative values in the original data series the spei adopts the log logistic probability distribution of the three parameters and its cumulative function is as follows 12 f x 1 α x γ β 1 where parameters α β and γ are obtained by linear matrix fitting 13 α w 0 2 w 1 β τ 1 1 β τ 1 1 β 14 β 2 w 1 w 0 6 w 1 w 0 6 w 2 15 γ w 0 α τ 1 1 β τ 1 1 β where τ is the factorial function and w0 w1 and w2 are the probability weighted moments of the original data sequence dh the calculation is as follows 16 w s 1 n h 1 n 1 f h s d h 17 f h h 0 35 n where n is the number of months involved standardization of the cumulative probability density 18 p 1 f x when the cumulative probability density is p 0 5 19 w 2 ln p 20 spei w c 0 c 1 w c 2 w 2 1 d 1 w d 2 w 2 d 3

of wld vulnerability based on the water stress experiment vulnerability is also referred to as the vulnerability of a disaster bearing body because the main disaster bearing body is peanut the damage is contributed by long term waterlogging and excessive soil moisture excessive soil moisture hinders chlorophyll synthesis accelerates senescence and shedding of leaves and ultimately results in hypoxia of the root system that hinders the pod formation zhang et al 2012 sezen et al 2019 waterlogging time and soil moisture are two quantitative indicators of waterlogging therefore this study combined the loss rate of physiological indices formula 22 soil water content in different growth periods and different waterlogging times in one experiment using a statistical method the wld vulnerability curve was constructed then according to previous studies efon et al 2022 valipour and dietrich 2022 and based on the era5 dataset volumetric water content of soil combined with this vulnerability curve the wld vulnerability in henan from 1990 to 2020 was evaluated 22 rlr i v ck v wl v c k 100 rlr i is the degree of damage to peanut during different growth periods expressed by the relative loss rate v ck is the corresponding physiological and biochemical indices measured in the control and v wl is the related physiological and biochemical indices measured under water stress 3 3 1 materials and methods the water stress experiment was carried out for two years beginning from may 2020 to september 2021 under a rain shelter at the jilin agricultural university facility agriculture base 43 48 n 125 24 e the region has a monsoon climate of medium latitudes annual precipitation is 500 650 mm the annual average temperature is 0 6 7 full pods were selected and dried for 2 3 days shells were removed and the seed of common cultivar baisha 1016 grown in henan was selected in early may the seeds were sown using plastic barrels with an inner diameter of 35 cm at an average of three seeds per barrel and one seedling per barrel was reserved according to the growth period three water treatments one water tank 14 m2 and one control area 6 m2 were set aside in the shelter fig 4 normal irrigated peanut plants were used as control with soil having relative water content of 65 75 ma et al 2021 and each treatment was repeated thrice the experiments were conducted during the egp mgp and lgp table 4 combined with previous studies ma et al 2021 and the actual precipitation in henan the waterlogging durations were 3 5 7 and 9 d water surface maintained 2 3 cm higher than the soil layer during different growth periods peanut were removed after 3 5 7 and 9 days of water stress after the water returned to the normal level the crop was irrigated until harvest fig 5 3 3 2 selection of observation indexes and measurement methods 3 3 2 1 selection of observation indices and measurement rainy weather in the egp often leads to low temperatures not conducive to the growth of plants plant height is the most intuitive expression of plant morphological development and internal physiological and biochemical levels and is also a morphological index that is easily observed huang et al 2022 olorunwa et al 2022 therefore plant height was selected as the loss index in the egp before entering the mgp vigorous vegetative development is observed in mgp during which the stem and leaf grow faster zhang et al 2012 and so the leaf area index lai was selected as the loss index lgp is crucial for yield and a large amount of precipitation leads to lodging causing inconvenient ventilation of stems and leaves flooding of roots hypoxia in root habitat decreased accumulation of dry matter and hindered formation of the above and underground biomass haro et al 2022 therefore the yield was selected as the loss index before application of different water treatments in each growth period 10 peanut with similar growth were marked after the growth plant height and lai were measured and the yield was recorded after maturity table 5 depicts the measurement methods measurement intervals and instruments used to measure the indices 3 3 3 statistical analysis excel 2019 microsoft corp redmond washington usa was used for data processing and the two year average of the measured indices under different stress treatments was calculated the least significant difference lsd test in spss statistical product service solutions version 26 0 ibm inc chicago il usa was used to analyze the data and the significance level was 0 05 use origin 2021 originlab corp northampton ma usa for curve fitting and drawing 3 4 selection of exposure indices in this study the peanut was the main disaster bearing body and the exposure of the disaster bearing body was mainly manifested in the sown area of crops the larger the sown area the greater the exposure zhang et al 2020 ma et al 2021a therefore the planting area ratio was selected to analyze wld exposure 23 r a a p a c where ra is the planting area ratio of peanut and ap and ac are the planted and cultivated land area of peanut in each city of henan respectively 3 5 selection of disaster prevention and mitigation capacity indices disaster prevention and mitigation capacity indicates the extent to which the affected area can recover from wld in a certain period and is inversely proportional to the occurrence of wld i e the higher the capacity the faster is the recovery liu et al 2022a regional irrigation and drainage and fertilizer consumption indicate the level of irrigation and drainage capacity and agricultural production ma et al 2021a whereas rural workers and per capita gdp reflect the input level to avoid waterlogging table 6 3 6 wld assessment index system and risk assessment model according to the four factor theory of natural disaster risk formation zhang et al 2006 the wld assessment index as shown in table 6 was constructed in which the weights of each index were calculated by the combination weighting method finally the weighted comprehensive average method was used to construct an index for evaluating four factors based on the formula 24 h i s 1 n w hsi x hsi in formula 24 hi denotes the hazard in each growth period s is the number of evaluation indexes and whsi and xhsi represent the weights and hazard indexes in different growth periods 25 v i rlr i vi is the wld vulnerability in each growth period and rlri is the loss rate of physiological and biochemical indexes of peanut in each growth period 26 e r a e is the wld exposure and ra is the ratio of peanut planting area 27 c s 1 n w cs x cs in formula 27 c is the wld prevention and mitigation capacity and wcs and xcs are the weights and values of evaluation indexes of disaster prevention and mitigation ability respectively combining the evaluation indices of the above four elements a dynamic wld risk assessment model is described as follows 28 r i h i wh v i wv e we 1 c wc ri is the wld risk assessment index in different growth periods wh wv we and wc are the weights for wld hazard vulnerability exposure and disaster prevention and mitigation capacity and the weights are 0 321 0 284 0 243 and 0 152 respectively 3 7 standardization process as the units of the selected evaluation indexes are different in order to facilitate calculation each index is now standardized and the calculation method is as follows ma et al 2021b the higher the positive index value the higher the risk of wld of peanut which makes 29 x ms x ms x min x max x min the higher the negative index value the lower the risk of wld of peanut which makes 30 x ms x max x ms x max x min where xms is the sth index of the mth object xms is the sth index of the mth object after standardization and xmax and xmin respectively correspond to the maximum and minimum values of this index 3 8 combination weighting method based on ideal point method 3 8 1 analytic hierarchy process ahp ahp is a mature theory and is widely applied among subjective weighting methods this method divides relevant indicators into objectives criteria and schemes and based on these conducts qualitative and quantitative analyses its calculation process is quick and simple therefore it has unique advantages for determining the weights of various indicators at different levels in complex systems sivakumar et al 2021 veisi et al 2022 3 8 2 objective weighting method the entropy weight method calculates the information entropy of indicators based on objective data and the variation process liu et al 2022b because the objective weight method for obtaining the weights of each index is almost unaffected by subjective factors it largely avoids the influence of human factors on the results zhe et al 2021 therefore in this study the entropy method was chosen as the objective weight method 3 8 3 combination weighting method in the existing research on combination weighting methods the linear weighting and multiplication normalization methods are commonly used pena et al 2022 however the multiplication normalization is suitable for situations in which there are a large number of participating indices and the weight values of each index are not significantly different the linear weighting method relies more on personal subjective experience and understanding therefore this study adopted a combination of subjective and objective weights based on the ideal point method which not only reduces subjective randomness but also considers objective reality jiang et al 2015 wang et al 2016 the calculation is as follows the obtained subjective weight and objective weight are defined as δ 1 δ 2 δ n θ θ 1 θ 2 θ n the weight value of combination weighting is defined as w c ω 1 ω 1 ω n q j j 1 2 n is the ideal value of each index attribute in each scheme the ideal scheme of the system is as follows 31 y y 1 y 2 y n ω 1 q 1 ω 2 q 2 ω n q n therefore the distance from scheme e to the ideal point is 32 d e j 1 n y ej y j 2 1 2 j 1 n q ej q j 2 ω j 2 1 2 where yej is the value of the corresponding j index in scheme e and the vector is normalized for convenience of calculation 33 δ δ δ 1 2 δ 2 2 δ n 2 34 θ θ θ 1 2 θ 2 2 θ n 2 35 w c ω ω 1 2 ω 2 2 ω n 2 the square of the distance from δ θ ω to the ideal solution is 36 d 1 2 δ j 1 n q ej q j δ j 2 37 d 1 2 θ j 1 n q ej q j θ j 2 38 d 1 2 ω j 1 n q ej q j ω j 2 constructing a nonlinear programming model based on the principle that the result deviation of subjective and objective combination weighting is minimal 39 f ω d e 2 ω d j 2 δ 2 d e 2 ω d j 2 θ 2 then 40 f ω j 1 n q ej q j 2 ω j 2 δ j 2 2 j 1 n q ej q j 2 ω j 2 θ j 2 2 using lagrange s mean value theorem to solve the extreme value of the function we get 41 ω j δ j 2 θ j 2 2 j 1 2 n the result of the combined weights is 42 ω j ω j j 1 n ω j j 1 2 n 3 9 mann kendall method because climate change is an unstable and discontinuous process gocic and trajkovic 2013 the world meteorological organization recommends the mann kendall test to analyze whether there is a change in climate and determine the time of change the m k test method is also often used to detect trends in precipitation and meteorological disasters under the influence of climate change masroor et al 2020 4 results 4 1 temporal and spatial distribution of cwi 4 1 1 temporal variation of pe etc and cwsdi to analyze the interannual variation and the change in effective rainfall crop water requirement and water balance of peanut in different growth periods this study examined pe etc and cwsdi in three growth periods in egp fig 6a 1991 1998 2002 and 2018 were the years when the cwsdi mutated before 1991 pe and cwsdi both showed an upward trend but continued to decline from 1991 to 1997 from 1997 1998 they increased sharply and then decreased rapidly indicating that 1998 was an extremely waterlogged year the average pe in 1998 was approximately 4 2 times higher than in 1997 according to historical data 1998 was a typical waterlogging year in china so the change in the cwsdi was consistent with the actual situation after the change of the cwsdi in 2002 until 2018 the change in trend was relatively mild and extreme waterlogging events rarely occurred during this period the average values of etc and pe were 67 02 mm and 62 46 mm respectively and the moisture was balanced after 2018 the cwsdi dropped rapidly indicating the mutation in 2018 in mgp fig 6b pe in most years was less than etc indicating that extreme waterlogging events were rare however there were three mutation years 2012 2014 and 2016 when the cwsdi during growth period from 2011 to 2016 showed a trend of up down up with a significant change during lgp fig 6c the value of pe was significantly higher than etc with the highest number of changes during 1996 1998 1999 2016 and 2017 from 1996 2000 the value of cwsdi showed a significant v shaped fluctuation three major changes appeared 1996 1998 and 1999 which showed that the trend of the cwsdi was unstable during this growth period pe and cwsdi were both high which indicated that the study area had more precipitation and was humid for a long time overall the changing trends of pe and cwsdi in different growth periods were the same and cwsdi in the later growth period was higher than that in other periods which makes it susceptible to waterlogging 4 1 2 spatial distribution of cwsdi vci smci and cwi study waterlogging in henan from 1990 to 2020 from the perspective of the atmosphere soil and vegetation in multiple dimensions the average values of cwsdi vci smci and cwi in three growth periods for 31 years were assessed the results showed that the values of cwsdi vci smci and cwi were 0 55 0 5 0 20 0 84 0 08 0 84 and 0 05 0 56 in the egp fig 7a d and g fig 8a the southern part of the study area such as xinyang city was humid and the soil moisture was high indicating that waterlogging events occurred easily in mgp fig 7b e h fig 8b the values of cwsdi vci smci and cwi were between 0 61 0 01 0 18 0 88 0 08 0 88 and 0 14 0 41 respectively this growth period was at its peak the rainfall water requirement and evapotranspiration of peanut were relatively high cwsdi value was low which led to the lowest cwi in this growth period among the three growth periods waterlogging had little effect on the growth of peanut cwsdi vci smci and cwi in the lgp fig 7c f i fig 8c were 0 03 0 75 0 23 0 88 0 16 0 76 and 0 17 0 67 respectively which means that this growth period was long with concentrated precipitation the water demand gradually decreased and cwsdi was higher than that in the other two growth periods the areas with high cwsdi smci and cwi expanded showing an increasing trend from north to south the high value was mainly concentrated in the southern region such as west of xinyang and zhumadian high value vci areas were also mainly concentrated in eastern henan overall the cwsdi smci and cwi increased from north to south during the three growth periods in addition the high value regions of cwsdi smci and cwi expanded in the lgp which indicated that the lgp was the most critical period for waterlogging affecting the growth of peanut 4 1 3 comparison and verification of spei and cwi to verify the feasibility of cwi this study combined spei to explore temporal and spatial changes of cwi fig 9 shows the changing trend of the spei and cwi of peanut in henan from 1990 to 2020 at different growth periods a egp b mgp and c lgp overall in different growth periods the changing trends of the two indices were similar in egp fig 9a the m k test was used to analyze the changing years of the two indices the results showed that 1991 2007 and 2018 were common mutated years of the two indices and these indices had obvious upward and downward trends around 1991 2007 and 2018 the 31 year average values of spei and cwi were 0 81 and 0 16 respectively the study area was in a relatively dry state characterized by short growth period and low rainfall fig 6a compared with the other two growth periods the common mutated years of the spei and cwi in the mgp fig 9b were 1994 and 2010 the 31 year average values of spei and cwi were 0 1 and 0 07 respectively it can be seen from fig 6b that the value of etc in all years except 2000 was less than that of pe this is because the growth period that covers the peak of crop development lai plant height etc significantly increased with high water sensitivity and increased water demand in this stage the cwsdi was significantly lower than that in the other growth stages and the areas of high smci and vci values decreased fig 7e h which led to a decrease in cwi in the lgp fig 9c the values of spei and cwi were significantly higher than those of the other two growth periods and the most common mutation occurred in 2018 the 31 year average values of spei and cwi were 0 3 and 0 41 respectively compared with the mgp the precipitation in this growth period was decreased at this stage the crops attained maturity seeds were filled up in pods and the water demand decreased the value of cwsdi was still high and at the same time the smci high value area had expanded fig 7i with high cwi value fig 8c the results indicated that both spei and cwi identified frequent waterlogging events in the lgp and the effects of wld on the growth of peanut were mostly concentrated during this time to further study the applicability of the cwi for different locations of henan this study calculated the correlation coefficient between the spei and cwi from 1990 to 2020 based on pearson correlation fig 9d for the three growth periods the correlation coefficients ranged 0 67 0 92 0 73 0 91 and 0 83 0 95 respectively compared with others the correlation coefficient of the two indices in the lgp was higher from a regional perspective the regions with high correlation coefficients in the three growth periods were gushi xinyang zhumadian and baofeng all of which had coefficients above 0 87 most of these regions are located in the southwest and south of henan and are also the areas with concentrated precipitation overall the correlation coefficients of the two indices in the three growth periods were all between 0 67 and 0 95 and the correlation coefficients were the highest in the lgp 4 2 spatial distribution of waterlogging frequency fig 10 shows the spatial distribution of waterlogging frequency at different grades in the three growth periods of peanut in henan in the egp fig 10a b c d the frequency of the four grades of waterlogging events increased from north to south and the frequency of mild waterlogging was the highest high frequency regions such as zhumadian and western xinyang were mainly concentrated in southern henan in the mgp fig 10e f g h both light and medium waterlogging frequencies showed an increasing trend from north to south in some cities such as xinyang and zhumadian the mild waterlogging frequency reached 58 06 which was significantly higher than that of other regions during this period indicating that these areas have frequent rainfall and are easily affected by waterlogging however severe and extremely severe waterlogging occurred in the mgp in a small part of zhumadian and not in the whole region in the lgp fig 10i j k l the four grades of high value regions of waterlogging frequency expanded compared with those in the other two growth periods and the frequencies of mild and moderate waterlogging events increased from west to east more than half of the study area was in high frequency areas of moderate waterlogging with the highest rate reaching 38 7 the areas with a high frequency of severe and extremely severe waterlogging events were zhumadian nanyang and western xinyang overall the lgp was a period of high waterlogging during the three growth periods waterlogging events frequently occurred in zhumadian and xinyang these areas should strengthen the prevention of rainstorms and floods that affect peanut harvest 4 3 risk assessment of wld hazard fig 11 shows the risk assessment results after natural breaks based on the hazard index for each growth period of peanut from the distribution point of view the risk index of peanut in the egp had an obvious boundary and showed an increasing trend from north to south regions with extremely high hazard levels were mainly concentrated in the west of xinyang the region with low hazard in the mgp accounted for the most of henan approximately 52 6 which extended to the vicinity of central henan compared with the other two growth periods the area with a medium hazard was lesser in mgp most regions in the lgp were at high risk and locations with high or above risk levels accounted for 51 9 extremely high hazard regions were mainly concentrated in zhumadian southeast nanyang and west xinyang and the entire region during this growth period was seriously affected by waterlogging 4 4 risk assessment of wld vulnerability peanut is the main oil crop in henan and the balance between water supply and demand distribution is one of the most critical and sensitive indicators affecting growth and development when the supply exceeds the demand it leads to waterlogging affecting the growth yield and quality and inhibits the growth rate of the peanut industry in the chinese sustainable development economy zhang et al 2022 therefore based on the water stress experiment this study measured the physiological and ecological indices and yield of peanut under different water stress in different growth periods combined with soil water a vulnerability curve was established and wld was assessed 4 4 1 effect on growth and development of peanut 4 4 1 1 plant height the plant height at three growth stages was affected by water stress fig 12a and the degree of influence increased with the increase in waterlogging days compared to control the effect on plant height was not obvious when the stress was for 3 days but when the stress exceeded beyond 5 days the plant height changed significantly the reduction of plant height was 9 8 7 2 and 2 8 in the egp mgp and lgp of water stress respectively after 5 days of stress the reduction of plant height was 25 4 15 6 and 12 1 after 7 days of water stress and 31 8 21 9 and 14 5 after 9 days of water stress which indicated that reduction in plant height increased rapidly when stress increased from 5 to 7 days and further slowed down when the number of days of water stress exceeded 7 days water stress greatly influenced plant height in the egp and mgp but the height of the peanut basically remained unchanged in the lgp indicating that the water stress in the lgp had little influence on the plant height in general the plant height was greatly affected at 5 7 and 9 days of water stress in the egp and mgp 4 4 1 2 lai different growth periods and different water stress treatments resulted in obvious differences in the lai fig 12b during the entire growth period the lai after water stress treatment was lower than that of the control group and the loss rate of lai increased with an increase in number of stress days the change in lai in the egp was not significant which may have been caused by incomplete development of leaves in the egp with the development of growth process the leaves of plants continued to increase resulting in increase of lai when the stress days in the mgp were 5 days obvious differences began to appear among the different treatments when the stress days were 5 7 and 9 the lai reduction were 13 8 24 8 and 28 6 respectively however at lgp the nutrient supply to the leaves decreased the lower leaves turned yellow and gradually fell off and the lai declined zhang et al 2012 tian et al 2021 compared to the control the lai reduction was 8 9 17 2 and 22 2 for stress at 5 7 and 9 days respectively therefore the effect of water stress in lgp was less than that in mgp compared with the other two growth periods the mgp was the most significant period in which the lai was affected by water stress at 5 7 and 9 days 4 4 1 3 yield fig 12c shows that when the water stress in the egp and mgp of peanut lasted for 3 days waterlogging had little effect on the yield of peanut which even slightly increased compared with the control the yield increased by 2 5 and 1 2 in the egp and mgp respectively during water stress for three days possibly because appropriate waterlogging in the egp and mgp can promote the differentiation of effective flower buds increasing the number of flowers per plant then increasing the yield long term waterlogging inhibits the growth and differentiation of plants hinders root development increases the number of adventitious roots and reduces the fresh weight of the roots per unit volume resulting in a decreased yield and commercial value zhang et al 2012 haro et al 2022 therefore the yield loss at 5 7 and 9 days of waterlogging in egp mgp were 2 8 5 7 and 13 4 4 6 11 5 and 14 4 respectively the yield loss for stress days of 3 5 7 and 9 in the lgp were 2 9 5 8 13 6 and 20 8 respectively the yield under different water treatments was lower than that of the control which may be due to the sensitivity of the lgp to water excessive water content leads to a decrease in pod number poor pod development an increase in empty pods decrease in full pod size and yield in general moderate waterlogging increases the yield of peanut and excessive waterlogging decreases the seed yield and quality 4 4 2 vulnerability curve of wld in different growth periods combined with water stress data the curves of the volumetric water content of the soil and loss rate of physiological indices plant height lai and yield in different growth periods of peanut were fitted vulnerability curves and fitting equations of wld in different growth periods in henan were obtained it can be seen that the fitting degree of vulnerability curve of wld of peanut was 0 804 0 784 and 0 764 in the egp mgp and lgp respectively all of which conformed to the f value test at α 0 05 therefore the fitting degree of vulnerability curve for estimating wld vulnerability in different growth periods was good and feasible to evaluate fig 13 shows that the loss rate of various physiological indices in the three growth periods was proportional to the disaster intensity in the egp and mgp the changing trend of the vulnerability curve was similar during the egp mgp the soil water content was from 0 265 0 290 m3 m3 0 255 0 273 m3 m3 and the change in the loss rate was relatively mild then with the increase in soil water content the loss rate rose abruptly increased and then tended to be flat the lgp fig 13c is the critical period of yield therefore waterlogging causes severe yield loss after the soil water content reached 0 315 m3 m3 the yield loss began to rise and increased with increasing soil water this may be due to waterlogging caused by excessive soil moisture and the disharmony between water and air seriously hindering pod filling which eventually led to an increase in the empty pods and decrease in the total yield zhang et al 2012 sezen et al 2019 haro et al 2022 table 7 using the assessment model of wld vulnerability in different growth periods established above and combined with the era5 dataset of the volumetric water content of soil in henan from 1990 to 2020 the spatial distribution of the vulnerability index in each growth period was obtained overall the vulnerability index in the three growth periods showed low vulnerability in the north and high vulnerability in the south in the egp fig 14a high vulnerability areas were mainly concentrated in xinyang in the mgp fig 14b the high vulnerability regions expanded such as luoyang southern sanmenxia nanyang zhumadian and xinyang with the highest vulnerability index of 27 6 during the lgp fig 14c the low vulnerability areas were mainly concentrated in some cities in northern henan whereas the high value regions were primarily concentrated in western and southern henan compared with the other two growth periods there were more regions with high vulnerability in the mgp 4 5 risk assessment of wld exposure the exposure of the disaster bearing body is related to its density therefore this study used the ratio of the peanut planting area to cultivated land as the exposure index the larger the value the greater is the potential loss of a disaster bearing body exposed to risk fig 15 shows the spatial distribution results obtained using the natural breaks method from the exposure index areas with high exposure were mainly concentrated in northern southern and southwestern henan the exposure index of kaifeng was 0 37 indicating that the planting area of peanut accounts for a large proportion however the exposure index of western henan such as jiyuan and sanmenxia was low and the index of jiyuan was only 0 014 the main reason is that the western region has a high terrain and less cultivated land which is not suitable for growing peanut this index not only reflects the exposure of the disaster bearing body but also reflects the planting situation of peanut in henan 4 6 risk assessment of disaster prevention and mitigation capacity fig 16 shows the distribution of the evaluation indices for disaster prevention and mitigation ability the level of irrigation and drainage mechanism in the study area are closely related to the disaster prevention and mitigation the levels of irrigation and drainage in anyang puyang xinxiang shangqiu zhumadian and other places were high fig 16a which shows that when wld occurs these areas can discharge excess water in time to avoid the adverse effects of waterlogging fertilizer consumption at the regional agricultural production is related to crop growth applying appropriate fertilizers can improve the growth of crops increase yield and improve the ability of crops to cope with disasters fertilizer consumption was similar to the distribution trend of rural workers fig 16b c and the values of nanyang zhumadian zhoukou shangqiu xinyang and other places were all high indicating that agricultural production in these areas is promising per capita gdp was positively correlated with disaster prevention and mitigation with high gdp more funds can be invested in disaster prevention and mitigation the high value areas were mainly located in the northwest of henan fig 16d fig 17 shows the distribution map of the disaster prevention and mitigation capacities in henan some areas in zhumadian shangqiu and nanyang were extremely high but the proportion was relatively low accounting for approximately 10 7 the disaster prevention and mitigation capacities of most regions were in the middle and high levels accounting for approximately 75 7 of the entire study area which shows that great attention is to be paid to investment in disaster prevention 4 7 comprehensive risk assessment of wld this study begins with the theoretical framework of natural disaster risk and combines the analysis of four risk assessment factors hazard vulnerability exposure and disaster prevention and mitigation capacity the weight of each risk factor was calculated based on the combination weighting and the final risk assessment value of wld in henan was obtained the natural break method was used to classify the risk levels to assess the risk of wld to peanut in different growth periods the classification standards are listed in table 8 fig 18a and fig 18b show clear regional differences in wld risk levels in the egp and mgp of peanut in henan among them the low risk regions in the egp accounted for 46 2 of the total and were mainly concentrated north of central henan however in the mgp there were more moderate risk regions approximately 31 that lied on the eastern and central parts of henan and high risk areas concentrated in southern henan in the lgp the number of low risk regions decreased accounting for only 21 8 of the population in the henan and compared with the other two growth periods high risk regions expanded accounting for approximately 34 3 overall the risk of wld of peanut in the three growth periods rose from north to south and the high risk regions were mainly concentrated in southern henan the actual precipitation frequency in southern henan was the highest where wld often occurs this shows the credibility of the study in the risk assessment of wld in different growth periods of peanut in henan 4 8 validation of risk evaluation results a typical wld in henan from 1990 to 2020 was investigated to determine the authenticity and reliability of the risk assessment the verification table 9 showed that the results of this study are consistent with historical disaster data and can be used for the dynamic risk assessment of wld in henan 5 discussion in the actual growth process of field crops the occurrence of waterlogging events is not only related to rainfall but also closely related to topography evapotranspiration and other factors koroleva et al 2019 therefore cwi was established in this study by considering precipitation evapotranspiration vegetation growth and soil conditions and then verified by spei calculated from precipitation and evapotranspiration a monitoring index recognized by the society with perfect system standards in previous studies spei performed well in identifying soil dryness and drought monitoring zhu et al 2022 recently it has been applied to identify wet soil conditions and has high accuracy of identification drumond et al 2021 li and huang 2021 this was also confirmed by the comparison between the query of historical disaster events in the following table table 10 and the results obtained in this study for example 1995 1998 and 2007 were the years with frequent wld in the lgp of peanut with 1998 being the typical waterlogging year in china covering an area of 1 49 105 hm2 of crops in henan and 284 million yuan of direct agricultural economic losses wen et al 2005 however the identification of the spei shows that the study area is in a normal state at this stage and cwi can better reflect the actual disaster the results revealed that the water stress test can determine the mechanism of peanut yield reduction due to waterlogging at different growth stages excessive waterlogging in the egp will lead to the dwarfing inhibition of normal growth and development in plants lodging and stem breaking and finally low unit and unstable total yield of peanut however the reason why the waterlogging loss of other physiological indices in this growth period is not high is due to incomplete development of egp zhang et al 2012 mgp is characterized by a vigorous growth period water stress in this growth period greatly influences peanut plant height and lai which seriously slows the growth of stems and leaves thereby reducing photosynthesis and dry matter accumulation shortening of the pod filling time affects pod maturity and plumpness and finally leads to yield reduction zhang et al 2012 tian et al 2021 sezen et al 2019 also showed that water stress during field irrigation would lead to a decrease in lai of peanut in the mediterranean water stress in the lgp leads to incomplete pod development decreased pods and increased empty pods which directly affects the yield ma et al 2021 in previous studies 15 different varieties of peanut were waterlogged for 7 d and found that 100 seed weight pod weight and final yield decreased zeng et al 2022 this study and the previous studies have confirmed that excessive waterlogging in each growth period causes a decrease in the physiological indices of peanut affecting the final yield however the yield increased slightly after moderate waterlogging which may be due to good waterlogging tolerance of the peanut varieties used in the experiment moderate waterlogging in egp promotes the growth of aboveground parts such as stems and leaves and accelerates photosynthesis pan et al 2021 as per cwi and the comprehensive risk assessment results the southern part of henan is known to have a high wld risk level during the three growth periods fig 18 with lgp growth the areas south of central henan are termed as high and extremely high risk areas this may be due to concentrated precipitation and large lgp but the lower water demand will keep the field saturated resulting in too much moisture in roots leading to wld in these areas reddy and reddy 1993 this finding is consistent with the results of previous studies zhang et al 2022 however in previous study only rainfall and the wetness index of continuous rainfall days were selected as the identification indices of the wld however wld is more closely related to the soil moisture and vegetation in the field therefore compared to the results of this study actual damage to peanut is less though the identified area is larger remote sensing is one of the components of cwi and the quality of data will also have a certain impact on the accuracy of results usually remote sensing with a high spatial resolution is difficult to obtain and their coverage is limited curcio et al 2022 the resolution of the remote sensing data selected in this study was not sufficiently high which led to some errors in the results in addition owing to the complexity and diversity of ground objects the pixel data usually contains a variety of surface types called as mixed pixel hsieh et al 2001 and constitutes one of the main factors affecting the accuracy of data foody and cox 1994 lu and weng 2007 in future the quality of the data should be improved and the mixed pixels of remote sensing data should be separated to improve the accuracy of the results in the water stress experiment owing to the limitation of the experimental site only three groups of parallel experiments were set in each group of waterlogging treatments for each growth period which would have also led to a large accidental error in the results in addition this study did not consider the influence of wld on the different peanut varieties because there are differences in waterlogging tolerance and its mechanisms among varieties the final losses due to disaster may differ liu et al 2021 zeng et al 2021 to further study the growth of peanut the number of groups and crop varieties in parallel experiments should be increased theoretically there should be a specific compensation effect between drought and wld that is egp can reduce the harm caused by late drought which will lead to recording of different results zhang et al 2022 therefore in future research the comprehensive risk internal correlation and disaster mechanism of multi disaster inducing factors in multi hazard combinations should be studied in practice application of cwi for agricultural disaster risk assessment is based on multi source data accurately presenting the temporal and spatial distribution law coupled with the water stress experiment the irrigation measures and yield reduction mechanism of peanut in different growth stages were better explored and the vulnerability of peanut was described in detail from the wld and crop growth mechanism the transformation of the risk assessment index from the field to the regional scale was realized which reflects the real process of agro meteorological disaster risk formation this study can also be universally applied by adjusting the adaptability of comprehensive risk assessment of meteorological disasters in different regions by changing the data input and crop types and can be extended to related research on similar different varieties of crops in different regions the results will provide important information for the local government to optimize peanut industry management and ensure sustainable development for farmers to choose reasonable irrigation and drainage facilities it is also of great practical significance to carry out comprehensive risk assessment and disaster prevention and mitigation of peanut wld in henan in the future 6 conclusion according to the soil crop atmosphere system cwi was constructed to explore the temporal and spatial distribution of waterlogging events and hazard through water stress experiment the influence of physiological indices and vulnerability of wld to spring peanut in different growth periods were analyzed and the evaluation indices of exposure and disaster prevention and mitigation ability were selected finally based on the four factor theory a comprehensive risk assessment model was constructed to dynamically assess the wld risk of peanut in henan the main conclusions are 1 the spei and cwi of peanut in different growth periods were calculated from data of meteorological stations in henan from 1990 to 2020 the results showed that the changing trends of the two indices were basically the same in the three growth periods and the correlation coefficients of the two indices were high cwi is capable of accurately identifying waterlogging events 2 there were pronounced regional differences in wld hazards of peanut in the three growth periods all of which showed an increasing trend from north to south and high value areas concentrated in southern henan such as southern nanyang zhumadian and xinyang compared to other growth periods in the lgp areas with high and extremely high hazard accounted for approximately 51 9 3 waterlogging significantly influenced the rate of reduction of plant height during the egp and mgp of peanut lai was significantly affected by water stress in the mgp during the lgp the water demand for peanut decreased and excessive water stress reduced the pod yield however moderate waterlogging increased peanut yield 4 in the three growth periods the vulnerability of northern henan was lower than that of other areas in the same province in the mgp and lgp high vulnerability areas in northern and central henan increased significantly 5 as per comprehensive risk assessment as the growth period advanced the high and moderate risk areas also expanded the proportion of low risk regions in the lgp was 21 8 high and extremely high risk areas accounted for 50 1 and were concentrated in southern henan declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

9112,in recent years global warming has led to frequent waterlogging disaster wld hindering the normal growth and development of crops affecting the sustainable development of the peanut industry and food security in china henan province the main peanut producing area with frequent wld was selected as the study area based on the soil crop atmosphere continuum system this study constructed a comprehensive waterlogging index cwi to monitor waterlogging events to determine the applicability of cwi the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei was calculated a risk assessment model was constructed to evaluate the hazards of wld during the different stages of development of spring peanut the water stress at different growth stages of peanut on crucial physiological indices were studied to determine the natural vulnerability curve of wld as a consequence based on the four factor theory of disaster formation this study established a dynamic wld assessment model for peanut and evaluated the comprehensive risk of wld in henan from 1990 to 2020 the results indicated that the cwi is capable of accurately identifying waterlogging events and peanut responded significantly differently to water stress the longer the duration of stress in the late growth period lgp the higher was the rate of yield reduction the comprehensive risk of wld to peanut rose from north to south during the three growth periods during the lgp high risk regions constituted approximately 34 3 of the total population this study provides a scientific basis and technical support for better exploration of peanut growth under waterlogging stress to manage and reduce the risk of wld keywords comprehensive waterlogging index dynamic risk assessment vulnerability curves water stress waterlogging disaster data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction on february 28th 2022 the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change released the sixth assessment report by the second working group the report states that human activities have undeniably caused climate warming and the risks are more serious than those evaluated previously pörtner et al 2022 the acceleration of warming exacerbates the frequency and intensity of extreme weather leading to frequent waterlogging disaster wld mal et al 2018 seddon et al 2020 ginige et al 2022 in the context of global climate change wld is second only to drought impacting the chinese agriculture and restricting grain production gu et al 2016 according to the statistics national bureau of statistics of china 2021 the national direct economic loss caused by floods was 266 98 billion yuan an increase of 74 71 billion yuan over the previous year with year on year increase of 38 86 the area of crops affected by floods is 7 19 106 hm2 out of which the area of crops never harvested is 1 32 106 hm2 in 2020 therefore it is necessary to assess the wld risk of major cash crops to implement countermeasures the peanut industry is one of the leading factors in promoting the sustainable agriculture development zhou et al 2022 since the 1990 s the total output of peanut in china has ranked first in the world accounting for approximately 40 of the total output of peanut worldwide zhang et al 2022 henan province is an important agricultural production base and has a medium latitude subtropical monsoon climate which has enabled the maintenance of agriculture in plains for a long time luo et al 2020 peng et al 2022 henan is the main peanut producing area in china according to statistics henan province bureau of statistics 2021 in 2020 the peanut yield and planting area in henan rank first in china the peanut industry in henan plays an essential role in the whole country approximately 80 of the annual precipitation occurs in the growing season of peanut and excessive precipitation over a short period leads to wld therefore production is unstable in henan zhang et al 2022 sudden and frequent wld make the roots remain in anoxic state bishnoi and krishnamoorthy 1992 inhibit root respiration and nutrient absorption cause stunted plant growth and increase the susceptibility to lodging reduce pod yield and finally seriously affect the yield of peanut it also cause the peanut to become mouldy and sprout which then will not get harvested and dried resulting in a decline in yield and quality sezen et al 2019 zeng et al 2020 peanut is a cash crop with a high commodity value de oliveira sousa et al 2011 and developing the peanut industry not only increases exports but also reduces a country s dependence on oil imports hence comprehensive processing and utilization of peanut has a bright future rohimah et al 2021 zhou et al 2022 and a risk assessment of peanut wld to maintain the healthy development of social economy assumes significance the impact analysis and evaluation of wld require certain quantitative standards and the waterlogging index is the most commonly used standard for monitoring and management wang et al 2019 currently the waterlogging indices used for the hazard assessment of disaster inducing factors mainly include three types i e single multiple and aggregated wang et al 2019 xu et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 most single indices only consider precipitation factors such as the precipitation anomaly percentage pa and the standard precipitation index spi although they can intuitively reflect the waterlogging caused by abnormal precipitation cong et al 2017 however considering precipitation alone leads to incomplete results since it does not include factors such as soil and crops leading to its poor applicability for monitoring waterlogging events in different regions yildirak and selcuk kestel 2015 wang et al 2019 multiple indices such as palmer drought severity index pdsi and crop moisture index cmi van der schrier et al 2011 were established considering other variables compared with single indices multiple indices can better monitor water change but have some limitations since they do not consider the impact of land cover on water balance narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 in recent years the development and application of waterlogging indices based on remote sensing has been widely studied hassan et al 2019 amer 2021 for example the normalized difference water index ndvi and soil moisture index smi can objectively reflect the surface vegetation and water and monitor wld in the study area however when analyzing the influence of waterlogging on crops meteorological factors are seldom considered zhang et al 2018 which makes the results lack pertinence the construction of aggregated indices considers several factors for example wang et al 2019 accurately analyzed the drought and waterlogging of maize in central and western jilin province based on the comprehensive drought and waterlogging indices constructed by pdsi standardized normalized difference vegetation index zndvi and standardized soil moisture index zsm as the formation of agricultural waterlogging is complicated and involves many factors koroleva et al 2019 it is necessary to construct an aggregated index for a complete evaluation agro meteorological disaster risk assessment is a process of evaluating the possibility of agro meteorological disasters and possible reduction of agricultural output loss of quality and finance zhang 2004 related research is not only a hot spot in the field of catastrophe and agrometeorology but also relevant for government administrative and agricultural production departments zhang et al 2006 jia et al 2012 presently theories on the assessment of disaster risk at home and abroad mainly include two factor three factor and four factor theories zhang et al 2006 based on the two factor theory zhang et al 2019 constructed a dynamic drought risk assessment model to assess the drought risk of maize in jilin province villani et al 2022 assessed drought risk in the mediterranean agricultural basin from three aspects hazard vulnerability and exposure pei et al 2019 selected four evaluation indices from four cities in heilongjiang province as application examples and analyzed the temporal and spatial changes in agricultural drought risk a few studies have been conducted on comprehensive waterlogging indices and most of them use single or multiple indices to monitor drought bijaber et al 2018 khan et al 2020 in addition many research systems for risk assessment are static and lack dynamic risk assessment based on agro meteorological disaster risk formation mechanism and multi source data zhang et al 2019 cui et al 2021 the common target crops for research on agro meteorological disaster risk assessment in china are maize wheat rice and other field crops zhang et al 2019 guo et al 2021 li et al 2021 however there is insufficient data on cash crops ma et al 2021a yang et al 2022 therefore based on the soil crop atmosphere continuum system a comprehensive waterlogging index cwi was established to analyze the wld hazard of peanut during different growth periods and the water balance and waterlogging in different stages of peanut are reflected from many angles then based on the four factor theory zhang et al 2006 the vulnerability and risk formation mechanism of wld were explored using crucial physiological rate indicators in different growth stages with water stress as the starting point and wld risk was comprehensively and dynamically evaluated the main contents of this paper relating to peanut in henan are as follows 1 cwi was used to analyze the temporal and spatial distribution of waterlogging events in different growth periods 2 evaluation of water stress on crucial physiological indices to determine the vulnerability of wld combined with water stress and 3 construction of comprehensive risk assessment model to evaluate wld risk the results obtained will have important practical significance for rational irrigation stable yield increase and sustainable development in different growth periods it can also be extended to other disaster types and regions growing different crops for comprehensive risk assessment and management 2 study area and data sources 2 1 study area henan fig 1 is located in the middle of china 31 23 36 22 n 110 21 116 39 e and it is one of the main peanut producing areas in china in 2020 the peanut yield of henan exceeded 5 94 106 t accounting for about 34 of the total national yield henan province bureau of statistics 2021 henan has a medium latitude subtropical monsoon climate the annual mean temperature is 12 9 16 5 the average annual sunshine hours are about 1505 9 2230 7 h and the annual precipitation is 500 1100 mm so it is suitable for planting peanut the precipitation is relatively concentrated in peanut growing season and prone to wld reducing production of peanut zhang et al 2022 2 2 data sources the vegetation index selected was divided into two parts the gimms 3 g dataset 1990 1 1999 12 provided by national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa with a spatial resolution of 8 km 8 km and the monthly ndvi dataset mod13a3 provided by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa with a high spatial resolution of 1 km 1 km 2000 1 2020 12 the gimms 3 g dataset was resampled to the same resolution as that of the mod13a3 dataset the final ndvi dataset s obtained using the maximum value composite mvc method the data sources used in this study are shown in table 1 3 methods 3 1 framework for wld risk assessment as shown in fig 2 this study is based on the four factor theory combining the previous studies wei et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 and the actual water demand for peanut the growth was divided into three periods namely the early growth period egp middle growth period mgp and late growth period lgp table 2 at each growth period the comprehensive wld risk was dynamically evaluated by selecting indicators from four criteria hazard vulnerability exposure and disaster prevention and mitigation to establish the risk assessment index 3 2 wld hazard assessment 3 2 1 wld hazard assessment based on multi source data 3 2 1 1 cwi based on the soil crop atmosphere continuum system the waterlogging index describes the duration severity and scope of wld however because of the complexity of the spatiotemporal variation it is not possible to accurately monitor wld using a single index wang et al 2019 the influence of meteorological factors the water demand of vegetation and soil conditions should be considered in agricultural wld anderson et al 2013 rekwar et al 2022 therefore this study is based on the comprehensive soil crop atmosphere continuum system fig 3 integrating meteorological and remote sensing data reanalysis of multi source data selecting crop water surplus and deficit index cwsdi vegetation condition index vci and soil moisture condition index smci based on the water demand and effective precipitation the cwsdi was based on meteorological data provided by the national information meteorological science center and the vci was calculated based on the ndvi smci was the reanalyzed data calculated based on the high spatial resolution climate surface dataset of the global land area finally the cwi was constructed by combining the weighting method based on the ideal point and calculated using formula wang et al 2019 1 cwi i ω 1 cwsdi i ω 2 vci i ω 3 smci i where ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 are the weights of the three indices calculated as 0 426 0 234 and 0 340 respectively based on the combination weighting method 3 2 1 1 1 cwsdi continuous precipitation at sowing led to excessive soil moisture and resultant delay rainy weather also caused reduction in the photosynthesis and respiration intensity pollen transmission overgrowth of weeds in farmland stunting of normal growth of peanut and delayed harvest bishnoi and krishnamoorthy 1992 jiang et al 2022 therefore cwsdi was selected as a comprehensive index affecting the wld the formula used is as follows wang et al 2018 2 cwsdi i p ei et ci et ci in which i is the growth period p ei is the effective precipitation mm of crops et ci is crop water demand mm and when cwsdi i 0 0 0 it means water surplus deficit and balance of water budget respectively guo et al 2022 3 p et α t p t 4 p ei t 1 n p et in which p t is the tth time rainfall mm p et is the tth effective rainfall mm α is the effective utilization coefficient when p t 5 mm α t 0 5 p t 50 mm α t 0 9 p t 50 mm α t 0 75 p et is the effective crop precipitation mm guo et al 2022 5 et c k c et 0 6 et 0 0 408 r n g γ 900 t mean 273 u 2 e s e a γ 1 0 34 u 2 in the formula et0 is the potential evapotranspiration of crops

by fao and previous studies valipour 2017 wei et al 2021 the kc values of peanut in the egp mgp and lgp are 0 5 1 15 and 0 6 respectively 3 2 1 1 2 smci smci is the normalized calculation of the soil moisture variables indicating the waterlogging degree to quantify events the smci index reflects the dynamic effect of precipitation on soil moisture the larger the value the higher will be the rainfall and soil moisture which affect the average growth of crop resulting in reduced or no yield shen et al 2019 cao et al 2022 the formula is 7 smci i sm i sm min sm max sm min smci is the normalized soil moisture condition index and is expressed as pixel of soil moisture in the root zone in the same months from 1990 to 2020 smmax and smmin represent the maximum and minimum soil moisture in each pixel of growth periods in the last 31 years respectively 3 2 1 1 3 vci the wld greatly affects growth at all stages leading to a decrease of vegetation quiring and ganesh 2010 wang et al 2019 therefore in this study the vci was selected to quantify the degree of environmental stress on vegetation to reflect the severity of waterlogging affecting the growth of peanut 8 vci i ndvi i ndvi min ndvi max ndvi min the vci represents the growth of vegetation ndvmax and ndvimin represent the maximum and minimum values of ndvi for each pixel for each growth stages over the last 31 years respectively 3 2 1 2 wld hazard assessment at present few reports are available on the classification of waterlogging based on cwi at home and abroad and most of them depend on meteorological index the standard precipitation evapotranspiration index spei is widely used and more accurate for dividing the degree of waterlogging chen et al 2020b zhu et al 2022 in addition wld are caused either by extreme or concentrated precipitation accompanied by high short and sudden precipitation intensity chen et al 2020a deng et al 2022 therefore to verify the applicability of the cwi we selected the monthly scale spei and combined with previous studies wang et al 2019 used the equal interval method to classify different grades of waterlogging events table 3 according to table 3 the waterlogging grades in the study area were divided and the frequency of occurrence was calculated for different growth periods of peanut the calculation is as follows ma et al 2021b 9 f li n li n 100 where nli is the number of l grade waterlogging events in the ith growth period n is the sequence length the risk of disaster inducing factors is characterized by the frequency and intensity and expressed as h f f i zhang et al 2006 ma et al 2021b in this study the intensity of mild moderate severe and extremely severe waterlogging events i1 4 were assigned to 1 2 3 and 4 respectively that is the higher the frequency and intensity of waterlogging the greater is the risk therefore the expression of hazard factors in different growth periods based on the cwi is as follows 10 h i l 1 4 f li i l where fli is the frequency of waterlogging events of different levels in different growth periods and il is the corresponding waterlogging intensity 3 2 1 3 comparison and verification of spei index and cwi spei is a widely used and accurate index for dividing waterlogging degree implying that waterlogging is not only affected by precipitation but is also related to evapotranspiration gao et al 2017 li and huang 2021 yang et al 2021 to verify the usability of cwi this study compared the spei with cwi the calculation of spei is as follows vicente serrano et al 2010 11 d h p h pet h ph is the monthly precipitation mm and peth mm d 1 is the monthly potential evapotranspiration of crops calculated using the p m model the dh data series is normalized and the index corresponding to each value is calculated because there may be negative values in the original data series the spei adopts the log logistic probability distribution of the three parameters and its cumulative function is as follows 12 f x 1 α x γ β 1 where parameters α β and γ are obtained by linear matrix fitting 13 α w 0 2 w 1 β τ 1 1 β τ 1 1 β 14 β 2 w 1 w 0 6 w 1 w 0 6 w 2 15 γ w 0 α τ 1 1 β τ 1 1 β where τ is the factorial function and w0 w1 and w2 are the probability weighted moments of the original data sequence dh the calculation is as follows 16 w s 1 n h 1 n 1 f h s d h 17 f h h 0 35 n where n is the number of months involved standardization of the cumulative probability density 18 p 1 f x when the cumulative probability density is p 0 5 19 w 2 ln p 20 spei w c 0 c 1 w c 2 w 2 1 d 1 w d 2 w 2 d 3

of wld vulnerability based on the water stress experiment vulnerability is also referred to as the vulnerability of a disaster bearing body because the main disaster bearing body is peanut the damage is contributed by long term waterlogging and excessive soil moisture excessive soil moisture hinders chlorophyll synthesis accelerates senescence and shedding of leaves and ultimately results in hypoxia of the root system that hinders the pod formation zhang et al 2012 sezen et al 2019 waterlogging time and soil moisture are two quantitative indicators of waterlogging therefore this study combined the loss rate of physiological indices formula 22 soil water content in different growth periods and different waterlogging times in one experiment using a statistical method the wld vulnerability curve was constructed then according to previous studies efon et al 2022 valipour and dietrich 2022 and based on the era5 dataset volumetric water content of soil combined with this vulnerability curve the wld vulnerability in henan from 1990 to 2020 was evaluated 22 rlr i v ck v wl v c k 100 rlr i is the degree of damage to peanut during different growth periods expressed by the relative loss rate v ck is the corresponding physiological and biochemical indices measured in the control and v wl is the related physiological and biochemical indices measured under water stress 3 3 1 materials and methods the water stress experiment was carried out for two years beginning from may 2020 to september 2021 under a rain shelter at the jilin agricultural university facility agriculture base 43 48 n 125 24 e the region has a monsoon climate of medium latitudes annual precipitation is 500 650 mm the annual average temperature is 0 6 7 full pods were selected and dried for 2 3 days shells were removed and the seed of common cultivar baisha 1016 grown in henan was selected in early may the seeds were sown using plastic barrels with an inner diameter of 35 cm at an average of three seeds per barrel and one seedling per barrel was reserved according to the growth period three water treatments one water tank 14 m2 and one control area 6 m2 were set aside in the shelter fig 4 normal irrigated peanut plants were used as control with soil having relative water content of 65 75 ma et al 2021 and each treatment was repeated thrice the experiments were conducted during the egp mgp and lgp table 4 combined with previous studies ma et al 2021 and the actual precipitation in henan the waterlogging durations were 3 5 7 and 9 d water surface maintained 2 3 cm higher than the soil layer during different growth periods peanut were removed after 3 5 7 and 9 days of water stress after the water returned to the normal level the crop was irrigated until harvest fig 5 3 3 2 selection of observation indexes and measurement methods 3 3 2 1 selection of observation indices and measurement rainy weather in the egp often leads to low temperatures not conducive to the growth of plants plant height is the most intuitive expression of plant morphological development and internal physiological and biochemical levels and is also a morphological index that is easily observed huang et al 2022 olorunwa et al 2022 therefore plant height was selected as the loss index in the egp before entering the mgp vigorous vegetative development is observed in mgp during which the stem and leaf grow faster zhang et al 2012 and so the leaf area index lai was selected as the loss index lgp is crucial for yield and a large amount of precipitation leads to lodging causing inconvenient ventilation of stems and leaves flooding of roots hypoxia in root habitat decreased accumulation of dry matter and hindered formation of the above and underground biomass haro et al 2022 therefore the yield was selected as the loss index before application of different water treatments in each growth period 10 peanut with similar growth were marked after the growth plant height and lai were measured and the yield was recorded after maturity table 5 depicts the measurement methods measurement intervals and instruments used to measure the indices 3 3 3 statistical analysis excel 2019 microsoft corp redmond washington usa was used for data processing and the two year average of the measured indices under different stress treatments was calculated the least significant difference lsd test in spss statistical product service solutions version 26 0 ibm inc chicago il usa was used to analyze the data and the significance level was 0 05 use origin 2021 originlab corp northampton ma usa for curve fitting and drawing 3 4 selection of exposure indices in this study the peanut was the main disaster bearing body and the exposure of the disaster bearing body was mainly manifested in the sown area of crops the larger the sown area the greater the exposure zhang et al 2020 ma et al 2021a therefore the planting area ratio was selected to analyze wld exposure 23 r a a p a c where ra is the planting area ratio of peanut and ap and ac are the planted and cultivated land area of peanut in each city of henan respectively 3 5 selection of disaster prevention and mitigation capacity indices disaster prevention and mitigation capacity indicates the extent to which the affected area can recover from wld in a certain period and is inversely proportional to the occurrence of wld i e the higher the capacity the faster is the recovery liu et al 2022a regional irrigation and drainage and fertilizer consumption indicate the level of irrigation and drainage capacity and agricultural production ma et al 2021a whereas rural workers and per capita gdp reflect the input level to avoid waterlogging table 6 3 6 wld assessment index system and risk assessment model according to the four factor theory of natural disaster risk formation zhang et al 2006 the wld assessment index as shown in table 6 was constructed in which the weights of each index were calculated by the combination weighting method finally the weighted comprehensive average method was used to construct an index for evaluating four factors based on the formula 24 h i s 1 n w hsi x hsi in formula 24 hi denotes the hazard in each growth period s is the number of evaluation indexes and whsi and xhsi represent the weights and hazard indexes in different growth periods 25 v i rlr i vi is the wld vulnerability in each growth period and rlri is the loss rate of physiological and biochemical indexes of peanut in each growth period 26 e r a e is the wld exposure and ra is the ratio of peanut planting area 27 c s 1 n w cs x cs in formula 27 c is the wld prevention and mitigation capacity and wcs and xcs are the weights and values of evaluation indexes of disaster prevention and mitigation ability respectively combining the evaluation indices of the above four elements a dynamic wld risk assessment model is described as follows 28 r i h i wh v i wv e we 1 c wc ri is the wld risk assessment index in different growth periods wh wv we and wc are the weights for wld hazard vulnerability exposure and disaster prevention and mitigation capacity and the weights are 0 321 0 284 0 243 and 0 152 respectively 3 7 standardization process as the units of the selected evaluation indexes are different in order to facilitate calculation each index is now standardized and the calculation method is as follows ma et al 2021b the higher the positive index value the higher the risk of wld of peanut which makes 29 x ms x ms x min x max x min the higher the negative index value the lower the risk of wld of peanut which makes 30 x ms x max x ms x max x min where xms is the sth index of the mth object xms is the sth index of the mth object after standardization and xmax and xmin respectively correspond to the maximum and minimum values of this index 3 8 combination weighting method based on ideal point method 3 8 1 analytic hierarchy process ahp ahp is a mature theory and is widely applied among subjective weighting methods this method divides relevant indicators into objectives criteria and schemes and based on these conducts qualitative and quantitative analyses its calculation process is quick and simple therefore it has unique advantages for determining the weights of various indicators at different levels in complex systems sivakumar et al 2021 veisi et al 2022 3 8 2 objective weighting method the entropy weight method calculates the information entropy of indicators based on objective data and the variation process liu et al 2022b because the objective weight method for obtaining the weights of each index is almost unaffected by subjective factors it largely avoids the influence of human factors on the results zhe et al 2021 therefore in this study the entropy method was chosen as the objective weight method 3 8 3 combination weighting method in the existing research on combination weighting methods the linear weighting and multiplication normalization methods are commonly used pena et al 2022 however the multiplication normalization is suitable for situations in which there are a large number of participating indices and the weight values of each index are not significantly different the linear weighting method relies more on personal subjective experience and understanding therefore this study adopted a combination of subjective and objective weights based on the ideal point method which not only reduces subjective randomness but also considers objective reality jiang et al 2015 wang et al 2016 the calculation is as follows the obtained subjective weight and objective weight are defined as δ 1 δ 2 δ n θ θ 1 θ 2 θ n the weight value of combination weighting is defined as w c ω 1 ω 1 ω n q j j 1 2 n is the ideal value of each index attribute in each scheme the ideal scheme of the system is as follows 31 y y 1 y 2 y n ω 1 q 1 ω 2 q 2 ω n q n therefore the distance from scheme e to the ideal point is 32 d e j 1 n y ej y j 2 1 2 j 1 n q ej q j 2 ω j 2 1 2 where yej is the value of the corresponding j index in scheme e and the vector is normalized for convenience of calculation 33 δ δ δ 1 2 δ 2 2 δ n 2 34 θ θ θ 1 2 θ 2 2 θ n 2 35 w c ω ω 1 2 ω 2 2 ω n 2 the square of the distance from δ θ ω to the ideal solution is 36 d 1 2 δ j 1 n q ej q j δ j 2 37 d 1 2 θ j 1 n q ej q j θ j 2 38 d 1 2 ω j 1 n q ej q j ω j 2 constructing a nonlinear programming model based on the principle that the result deviation of subjective and objective combination weighting is minimal 39 f ω d e 2 ω d j 2 δ 2 d e 2 ω d j 2 θ 2 then 40 f ω j 1 n q ej q j 2 ω j 2 δ j 2 2 j 1 n q ej q j 2 ω j 2 θ j 2 2 using lagrange s mean value theorem to solve the extreme value of the function we get 41 ω j δ j 2 θ j 2 2 j 1 2 n the result of the combined weights is 42 ω j ω j j 1 n ω j j 1 2 n 3 9 mann kendall method because climate change is an unstable and discontinuous process gocic and trajkovic 2013 the world meteorological organization recommends the mann kendall test to analyze whether there is a change in climate and determine the time of change the m k test method is also often used to detect trends in precipitation and meteorological disasters under the influence of climate change masroor et al 2020 4 results 4 1 temporal and spatial distribution of cwi 4 1 1 temporal variation of pe etc and cwsdi to analyze the interannual variation and the change in effective rainfall crop water requirement and water balance of peanut in different growth periods this study examined pe etc and cwsdi in three growth periods in egp fig 6a 1991 1998 2002 and 2018 were the years when the cwsdi mutated before 1991 pe and cwsdi both showed an upward trend but continued to decline from 1991 to 1997 from 1997 1998 they increased sharply and then decreased rapidly indicating that 1998 was an extremely waterlogged year the average pe in 1998 was approximately 4 2 times higher than in 1997 according to historical data 1998 was a typical waterlogging year in china so the change in the cwsdi was consistent with the actual situation after the change of the cwsdi in 2002 until 2018 the change in trend was relatively mild and extreme waterlogging events rarely occurred during this period the average values of etc and pe were 67 02 mm and 62 46 mm respectively and the moisture was balanced after 2018 the cwsdi dropped rapidly indicating the mutation in 2018 in mgp fig 6b pe in most years was less than etc indicating that extreme waterlogging events were rare however there were three mutation years 2012 2014 and 2016 when the cwsdi during growth period from 2011 to 2016 showed a trend of up down up with a significant change during lgp fig 6c the value of pe was significantly higher than etc with the highest number of changes during 1996 1998 1999 2016 and 2017 from 1996 2000 the value of cwsdi showed a significant v shaped fluctuation three major changes appeared 1996 1998 and 1999 which showed that the trend of the cwsdi was unstable during this growth period pe and cwsdi were both high which indicated that the study area had more precipitation and was humid for a long time overall the changing trends of pe and cwsdi in different growth periods were the same and cwsdi in the later growth period was higher than that in other periods which makes it susceptible to waterlogging 4 1 2 spatial distribution of cwsdi vci smci and cwi study waterlogging in henan from 1990 to 2020 from the perspective of the atmosphere soil and vegetation in multiple dimensions the average values of cwsdi vci smci and cwi in three growth periods for 31 years were assessed the results showed that the values of cwsdi vci smci and cwi were 0 55 0 5 0 20 0 84 0 08 0 84 and 0 05 0 56 in the egp fig 7a d and g fig 8a the southern part of the study area such as xinyang city was humid and the soil moisture was high indicating that waterlogging events occurred easily in mgp fig 7b e h fig 8b the values of cwsdi vci smci and cwi were between 0 61 0 01 0 18 0 88 0 08 0 88 and 0 14 0 41 respectively this growth period was at its peak the rainfall water requirement and evapotranspiration of peanut were relatively high cwsdi value was low which led to the lowest cwi in this growth period among the three growth periods waterlogging had little effect on the growth of peanut cwsdi vci smci and cwi in the lgp fig 7c f i fig 8c were 0 03 0 75 0 23 0 88 0 16 0 76 and 0 17 0 67 respectively which means that this growth period was long with concentrated precipitation the water demand gradually decreased and cwsdi was higher than that in the other two growth periods the areas with high cwsdi smci and cwi expanded showing an increasing trend from north to south the high value was mainly concentrated in the southern region such as west of xinyang and zhumadian high value vci areas were also mainly concentrated in eastern henan overall the cwsdi smci and cwi increased from north to south during the three growth periods in addition the high value regions of cwsdi smci and cwi expanded in the lgp which indicated that the lgp was the most critical period for waterlogging affecting the growth of peanut 4 1 3 comparison and verification of spei and cwi to verify the feasibility of cwi this study combined spei to explore temporal and spatial changes of cwi fig 9 shows the changing trend of the spei and cwi of peanut in henan from 1990 to 2020 at different growth periods a egp b mgp and c lgp overall in different growth periods the changing trends of the two indices were similar in egp fig 9a the m k test was used to analyze the changing years of the two indices the results showed that 1991 2007 and 2018 were common mutated years of the two indices and these indices had obvious upward and downward trends around 1991 2007 and 2018 the 31 year average values of spei and cwi were 0 81 and 0 16 respectively the study area was in a relatively dry state characterized by short growth period and low rainfall fig 6a compared with the other two growth periods the common mutated years of the spei and cwi in the mgp fig 9b were 1994 and 2010 the 31 year average values of spei and cwi were 0 1 and 0 07 respectively it can be seen from fig 6b that the value of etc in all years except 2000 was less than that of pe this is because the growth period that covers the peak of crop development lai plant height etc significantly increased with high water sensitivity and increased water demand in this stage the cwsdi was significantly lower than that in the other growth stages and the areas of high smci and vci values decreased fig 7e h which led to a decrease in cwi in the lgp fig 9c the values of spei and cwi were significantly higher than those of the other two growth periods and the most common mutation occurred in 2018 the 31 year average values of spei and cwi were 0 3 and 0 41 respectively compared with the mgp the precipitation in this growth period was decreased at this stage the crops attained maturity seeds were filled up in pods and the water demand decreased the value of cwsdi was still high and at the same time the smci high value area had expanded fig 7i with high cwi value fig 8c the results indicated that both spei and cwi identified frequent waterlogging events in the lgp and the effects of wld on the growth of peanut were mostly concentrated during this time to further study the applicability of the cwi for different locations of henan this study calculated the correlation coefficient between the spei and cwi from 1990 to 2020 based on pearson correlation fig 9d for the three growth periods the correlation coefficients ranged 0 67 0 92 0 73 0 91 and 0 83 0 95 respectively compared with others the correlation coefficient of the two indices in the lgp was higher from a regional perspective the regions with high correlation coefficients in the three growth periods were gushi xinyang zhumadian and baofeng all of which had coefficients above 0 87 most of these regions are located in the southwest and south of henan and are also the areas with concentrated precipitation overall the correlation coefficients of the two indices in the three growth periods were all between 0 67 and 0 95 and the correlation coefficients were the highest in the lgp 4 2 spatial distribution of waterlogging frequency fig 10 shows the spatial distribution of waterlogging frequency at different grades in the three growth periods of peanut in henan in the egp fig 10a b c d the frequency of the four grades of waterlogging events increased from north to south and the frequency of mild waterlogging was the highest high frequency regions such as zhumadian and western xinyang were mainly concentrated in southern henan in the mgp fig 10e f g h both light and medium waterlogging frequencies showed an increasing trend from north to south in some cities such as xinyang and zhumadian the mild waterlogging frequency reached 58 06 which was significantly higher than that of other regions during this period indicating that these areas have frequent rainfall and are easily affected by waterlogging however severe and extremely severe waterlogging occurred in the mgp in a small part of zhumadian and not in the whole region in the lgp fig 10i j k l the four grades of high value regions of waterlogging frequency expanded compared with those in the other two growth periods and the frequencies of mild and moderate waterlogging events increased from west to east more than half of the study area was in high frequency areas of moderate waterlogging with the highest rate reaching 38 7 the areas with a high frequency of severe and extremely severe waterlogging events were zhumadian nanyang and western xinyang overall the lgp was a period of high waterlogging during the three growth periods waterlogging events frequently occurred in zhumadian and xinyang these areas should strengthen the prevention of rainstorms and floods that affect peanut harvest 4 3 risk assessment of wld hazard fig 11 shows the risk assessment results after natural breaks based on the hazard index for each growth period of peanut from the distribution point of view the risk index of peanut in the egp had an obvious boundary and showed an increasing trend from north to south regions with extremely high hazard levels were mainly concentrated in the west of xinyang the region with low hazard in the mgp accounted for the most of henan approximately 52 6 which extended to the vicinity of central henan compared with the other two growth periods the area with a medium hazard was lesser in mgp most regions in the lgp were at high risk and locations with high or above risk levels accounted for 51 9 extremely high hazard regions were mainly concentrated in zhumadian southeast nanyang and west xinyang and the entire region during this growth period was seriously affected by waterlogging 4 4 risk assessment of wld vulnerability peanut is the main oil crop in henan and the balance between water supply and demand distribution is one of the most critical and sensitive indicators affecting growth and development when the supply exceeds the demand it leads to waterlogging affecting the growth yield and quality and inhibits the growth rate of the peanut industry in the chinese sustainable development economy zhang et al 2022 therefore based on the water stress experiment this study measured the physiological and ecological indices and yield of peanut under different water stress in different growth periods combined with soil water a vulnerability curve was established and wld was assessed 4 4 1 effect on growth and development of peanut 4 4 1 1 plant height the plant height at three growth stages was affected by water stress fig 12a and the degree of influence increased with the increase in waterlogging days compared to control the effect on plant height was not obvious when the stress was for 3 days but when the stress exceeded beyond 5 days the plant height changed significantly the reduction of plant height was 9 8 7 2 and 2 8 in the egp mgp and lgp of water stress respectively after 5 days of stress the reduction of plant height was 25 4 15 6 and 12 1 after 7 days of water stress and 31 8 21 9 and 14 5 after 9 days of water stress which indicated that reduction in plant height increased rapidly when stress increased from 5 to 7 days and further slowed down when the number of days of water stress exceeded 7 days water stress greatly influenced plant height in the egp and mgp but the height of the peanut basically remained unchanged in the lgp indicating that the water stress in the lgp had little influence on the plant height in general the plant height was greatly affected at 5 7 and 9 days of water stress in the egp and mgp 4 4 1 2 lai different growth periods and different water stress treatments resulted in obvious differences in the lai fig 12b during the entire growth period the lai after water stress treatment was lower than that of the control group and the loss rate of lai increased with an increase in number of stress days the change in lai in the egp was not significant which may have been caused by incomplete development of leaves in the egp with the development of growth process the leaves of plants continued to increase resulting in increase of lai when the stress days in the mgp were 5 days obvious differences began to appear among the different treatments when the stress days were 5 7 and 9 the lai reduction were 13 8 24 8 and 28 6 respectively however at lgp the nutrient supply to the leaves decreased the lower leaves turned yellow and gradually fell off and the lai declined zhang et al 2012 tian et al 2021 compared to the control the lai reduction was 8 9 17 2 and 22 2 for stress at 5 7 and 9 days respectively therefore the effect of water stress in lgp was less than that in mgp compared with the other two growth periods the mgp was the most significant period in which the lai was affected by water stress at 5 7 and 9 days 4 4 1 3 yield fig 12c shows that when the water stress in the egp and mgp of peanut lasted for 3 days waterlogging had little effect on the yield of peanut which even slightly increased compared with the control the yield increased by 2 5 and 1 2 in the egp and mgp respectively during water stress for three days possibly because appropriate waterlogging in the egp and mgp can promote the differentiation of effective flower buds increasing the number of flowers per plant then increasing the yield long term waterlogging inhibits the growth and differentiation of plants hinders root development increases the number of adventitious roots and reduces the fresh weight of the roots per unit volume resulting in a decreased yield and commercial value zhang et al 2012 haro et al 2022 therefore the yield loss at 5 7 and 9 days of waterlogging in egp mgp were 2 8 5 7 and 13 4 4 6 11 5 and 14 4 respectively the yield loss for stress days of 3 5 7 and 9 in the lgp were 2 9 5 8 13 6 and 20 8 respectively the yield under different water treatments was lower than that of the control which may be due to the sensitivity of the lgp to water excessive water content leads to a decrease in pod number poor pod development an increase in empty pods decrease in full pod size and yield in general moderate waterlogging increases the yield of peanut and excessive waterlogging decreases the seed yield and quality 4 4 2 vulnerability curve of wld in different growth periods combined with water stress data the curves of the volumetric water content of the soil and loss rate of physiological indices plant height lai and yield in different growth periods of peanut were fitted vulnerability curves and fitting equations of wld in different growth periods in henan were obtained it can be seen that the fitting degree of vulnerability curve of wld of peanut was 0 804 0 784 and 0 764 in the egp mgp and lgp respectively all of which conformed to the f value test at α 0 05 therefore the fitting degree of vulnerability curve for estimating wld vulnerability in different growth periods was good and feasible to evaluate fig 13 shows that the loss rate of various physiological indices in the three growth periods was proportional to the disaster intensity in the egp and mgp the changing trend of the vulnerability curve was similar during the egp mgp the soil water content was from 0 265 0 290 m3 m3 0 255 0 273 m3 m3 and the change in the loss rate was relatively mild then with the increase in soil water content the loss rate rose abruptly increased and then tended to be flat the lgp fig 13c is the critical period of yield therefore waterlogging causes severe yield loss after the soil water content reached 0 315 m3 m3 the yield loss began to rise and increased with increasing soil water this may be due to waterlogging caused by excessive soil moisture and the disharmony between water and air seriously hindering pod filling which eventually led to an increase in the empty pods and decrease in the total yield zhang et al 2012 sezen et al 2019 haro et al 2022 table 7 using the assessment model of wld vulnerability in different growth periods established above and combined with the era5 dataset of the volumetric water content of soil in henan from 1990 to 2020 the spatial distribution of the vulnerability index in each growth period was obtained overall the vulnerability index in the three growth periods showed low vulnerability in the north and high vulnerability in the south in the egp fig 14a high vulnerability areas were mainly concentrated in xinyang in the mgp fig 14b the high vulnerability regions expanded such as luoyang southern sanmenxia nanyang zhumadian and xinyang with the highest vulnerability index of 27 6 during the lgp fig 14c the low vulnerability areas were mainly concentrated in some cities in northern henan whereas the high value regions were primarily concentrated in western and southern henan compared with the other two growth periods there were more regions with high vulnerability in the mgp 4 5 risk assessment of wld exposure the exposure of the disaster bearing body is related to its density therefore this study used the ratio of the peanut planting area to cultivated land as the exposure index the larger the value the greater is the potential loss of a disaster bearing body exposed to risk fig 15 shows the spatial distribution results obtained using the natural breaks method from the exposure index areas with high exposure were mainly concentrated in northern southern and southwestern henan the exposure index of kaifeng was 0 37 indicating that the planting area of peanut accounts for a large proportion however the exposure index of western henan such as jiyuan and sanmenxia was low and the index of jiyuan was only 0 014 the main reason is that the western region has a high terrain and less cultivated land which is not suitable for growing peanut this index not only reflects the exposure of the disaster bearing body but also reflects the planting situation of peanut in henan 4 6 risk assessment of disaster prevention and mitigation capacity fig 16 shows the distribution of the evaluation indices for disaster prevention and mitigation ability the level of irrigation and drainage mechanism in the study area are closely related to the disaster prevention and mitigation the levels of irrigation and drainage in anyang puyang xinxiang shangqiu zhumadian and other places were high fig 16a which shows that when wld occurs these areas can discharge excess water in time to avoid the adverse effects of waterlogging fertilizer consumption at the regional agricultural production is related to crop growth applying appropriate fertilizers can improve the growth of crops increase yield and improve the ability of crops to cope with disasters fertilizer consumption was similar to the distribution trend of rural workers fig 16b c and the values of nanyang zhumadian zhoukou shangqiu xinyang and other places were all high indicating that agricultural production in these areas is promising per capita gdp was positively correlated with disaster prevention and mitigation with high gdp more funds can be invested in disaster prevention and mitigation the high value areas were mainly located in the northwest of henan fig 16d fig 17 shows the distribution map of the disaster prevention and mitigation capacities in henan some areas in zhumadian shangqiu and nanyang were extremely high but the proportion was relatively low accounting for approximately 10 7 the disaster prevention and mitigation capacities of most regions were in the middle and high levels accounting for approximately 75 7 of the entire study area which shows that great attention is to be paid to investment in disaster prevention 4 7 comprehensive risk assessment of wld this study begins with the theoretical framework of natural disaster risk and combines the analysis of four risk assessment factors hazard vulnerability exposure and disaster prevention and mitigation capacity the weight of each risk factor was calculated based on the combination weighting and the final risk assessment value of wld in henan was obtained the natural break method was used to classify the risk levels to assess the risk of wld to peanut in different growth periods the classification standards are listed in table 8 fig 18a and fig 18b show clear regional differences in wld risk levels in the egp and mgp of peanut in henan among them the low risk regions in the egp accounted for 46 2 of the total and were mainly concentrated north of central henan however in the mgp there were more moderate risk regions approximately 31 that lied on the eastern and central parts of henan and high risk areas concentrated in southern henan in the lgp the number of low risk regions decreased accounting for only 21 8 of the population in the henan and compared with the other two growth periods high risk regions expanded accounting for approximately 34 3 overall the risk of wld of peanut in the three growth periods rose from north to south and the high risk regions were mainly concentrated in southern henan the actual precipitation frequency in southern henan was the highest where wld often occurs this shows the credibility of the study in the risk assessment of wld in different growth periods of peanut in henan 4 8 validation of risk evaluation results a typical wld in henan from 1990 to 2020 was investigated to determine the authenticity and reliability of the risk assessment the verification table 9 showed that the results of this study are consistent with historical disaster data and can be used for the dynamic risk assessment of wld in henan 5 discussion in the actual growth process of field crops the occurrence of waterlogging events is not only related to rainfall but also closely related to topography evapotranspiration and other factors koroleva et al 2019 therefore cwi was established in this study by considering precipitation evapotranspiration vegetation growth and soil conditions and then verified by spei calculated from precipitation and evapotranspiration a monitoring index recognized by the society with perfect system standards in previous studies spei performed well in identifying soil dryness and drought monitoring zhu et al 2022 recently it has been applied to identify wet soil conditions and has high accuracy of identification drumond et al 2021 li and huang 2021 this was also confirmed by the comparison between the query of historical disaster events in the following table table 10 and the results obtained in this study for example 1995 1998 and 2007 were the years with frequent wld in the lgp of peanut with 1998 being the typical waterlogging year in china covering an area of 1 49 105 hm2 of crops in henan and 284 million yuan of direct agricultural economic losses wen et al 2005 however the identification of the spei shows that the study area is in a normal state at this stage and cwi can better reflect the actual disaster the results revealed that the water stress test can determine the mechanism of peanut yield reduction due to waterlogging at different growth stages excessive waterlogging in the egp will lead to the dwarfing inhibition of normal growth and development in plants lodging and stem breaking and finally low unit and unstable total yield of peanut however the reason why the waterlogging loss of other physiological indices in this growth period is not high is due to incomplete development of egp zhang et al 2012 mgp is characterized by a vigorous growth period water stress in this growth period greatly influences peanut plant height and lai which seriously slows the growth of stems and leaves thereby reducing photosynthesis and dry matter accumulation shortening of the pod filling time affects pod maturity and plumpness and finally leads to yield reduction zhang et al 2012 tian et al 2021 sezen et al 2019 also showed that water stress during field irrigation would lead to a decrease in lai of peanut in the mediterranean water stress in the lgp leads to incomplete pod development decreased pods and increased empty pods which directly affects the yield ma et al 2021 in previous studies 15 different varieties of peanut were waterlogged for 7 d and found that 100 seed weight pod weight and final yield decreased zeng et al 2022 this study and the previous studies have confirmed that excessive waterlogging in each growth period causes a decrease in the physiological indices of peanut affecting the final yield however the yield increased slightly after moderate waterlogging which may be due to good waterlogging tolerance of the peanut varieties used in the experiment moderate waterlogging in egp promotes the growth of aboveground parts such as stems and leaves and accelerates photosynthesis pan et al 2021 as per cwi and the comprehensive risk assessment results the southern part of henan is known to have a high wld risk level during the three growth periods fig 18 with lgp growth the areas south of central henan are termed as high and extremely high risk areas this may be due to concentrated precipitation and large lgp but the lower water demand will keep the field saturated resulting in too much moisture in roots leading to wld in these areas reddy and reddy 1993 this finding is consistent with the results of previous studies zhang et al 2022 however in previous study only rainfall and the wetness index of continuous rainfall days were selected as the identification indices of the wld however wld is more closely related to the soil moisture and vegetation in the field therefore compared to the results of this study actual damage to peanut is less though the identified area is larger remote sensing is one of the components of cwi and the quality of data will also have a certain impact on the accuracy of results usually remote sensing with a high spatial resolution is difficult to obtain and their coverage is limited curcio et al 2022 the resolution of the remote sensing data selected in this study was not sufficiently high which led to some errors in the results in addition owing to the complexity and diversity of ground objects the pixel data usually contains a variety of surface types called as mixed pixel hsieh et al 2001 and constitutes one of the main factors affecting the accuracy of data foody and cox 1994 lu and weng 2007 in future the quality of the data should be improved and the mixed pixels of remote sensing data should be separated to improve the accuracy of the results in the water stress experiment owing to the limitation of the experimental site only three groups of parallel experiments were set in each group of waterlogging treatments for each growth period which would have also led to a large accidental error in the results in addition this study did not consider the influence of wld on the different peanut varieties because there are differences in waterlogging tolerance and its mechanisms among varieties the final losses due to disaster may differ liu et al 2021 zeng et al 2021 to further study the growth of peanut the number of groups and crop varieties in parallel experiments should be increased theoretically there should be a specific compensation effect between drought and wld that is egp can reduce the harm caused by late drought which will lead to recording of different results zhang et al 2022 therefore in future research the comprehensive risk internal correlation and disaster mechanism of multi disaster inducing factors in multi hazard combinations should be studied in practice application of cwi for agricultural disaster risk assessment is based on multi source data accurately presenting the temporal and spatial distribution law coupled with the water stress experiment the irrigation measures and yield reduction mechanism of peanut in different growth stages were better explored and the vulnerability of peanut was described in detail from the wld and crop growth mechanism the transformation of the risk assessment index from the field to the regional scale was realized which reflects the real process of agro meteorological disaster risk formation this study can also be universally applied by adjusting the adaptability of comprehensive risk assessment of meteorological disasters in different regions by changing the data input and crop types and can be extended to related research on similar different varieties of crops in different regions the results will provide important information for the local government to optimize peanut industry management and ensure sustainable development for farmers to choose reasonable irrigation and drainage facilities it is also of great practical significance to carry out comprehensive risk assessment and disaster prevention and mitigation of peanut wld in henan in the future 6 conclusion according to the soil crop atmosphere system cwi was constructed to explore the temporal and spatial distribution of waterlogging events and hazard through water stress experiment the influence of physiological indices and vulnerability of wld to spring peanut in different growth periods were analyzed and the evaluation indices of exposure and disaster prevention and mitigation ability were selected finally based on the four factor theory a comprehensive risk assessment model was constructed to dynamically assess the wld risk of peanut in henan the main conclusions are 1 the spei and cwi of peanut in different growth periods were calculated from data of meteorological stations in henan from 1990 to 2020 the results showed that the changing trends of the two indices were basically the same in the three growth periods and the correlation coefficients of the two indices were high cwi is capable of accurately identifying waterlogging events 2 there were pronounced regional differences in wld hazards of peanut in the three growth periods all of which showed an increasing trend from north to south and high value areas concentrated in southern henan such as southern nanyang zhumadian and xinyang compared to other growth periods in the lgp areas with high and extremely high hazard accounted for approximately 51 9 3 waterlogging significantly influenced the rate of reduction of plant height during the egp and mgp of peanut lai was significantly affected by water stress in the mgp during the lgp the water demand for peanut decreased and excessive water stress reduced the pod yield however moderate waterlogging increased peanut yield 4 in the three growth periods the vulnerability of northern henan was lower than that of other areas in the same province in the mgp and lgp high vulnerability areas in northern and central henan increased significantly 5 as per comprehensive risk assessment as the growth period advanced the high and moderate risk areas also expanded the proportion of low risk regions in the lgp was 21 8 high and extremely high risk areas accounted for 50 1 and were concentrated in southern henan declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

9113,present study was conducted to predict the spatiotemporal groundwater suitability for irrigation purpose through deep learning method long short term memory lstm in northwest of iran sodium adsorption ratio sar as a crucial irrigation water quality criterion for 101 sampling point for an 18 year data period from 2002 to 2019 was utilized as the input for deep learning model in order to forecast the irrigation water quality for the next year 2020 to evaluate the model accuracy in spatiotemporal data forecasting performance criteria such as mean absolute percentage error mape root mean square error rmse and r were used which approved the model accuracy by 1 212 0 312 and 0 89 of mape rmse and r respectively on the other hand the model capability was assessed by rbias and generalization ability ga which results showed that lstm model underestimated the targets with rbias equals to about 1 539 while had an acceptable ga equals to 1 1832 considering the carried out map of irrigation water quality for the study area it was revealed that about 78 have the desirable to acceptable quality for irrigation and the about 22 are moderate to non acceptable the most non acceptable points are juxtaposed to the residential area which shows the anthropogenic effect on groundwater quality through the fertilizers and the other pollutants infiltered into the groundwater resources keywords irrigation water quality sar deep learning method long short memory pollutant data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction groundwater as the most important natural resource are being used mainly in agriculture and the freshwater usage all around the world siebert et al 2010 this valuable resource thus should be protected against the hazardous factors and activities during the recent decades groundwater resources have been confronted different issues such as overextraction anthropogenic contamination and scarcity due to climate change threatening their quality and quantity chen et al 2016 2019 2021 qian et al 2020 burri et al 2019 el asri et al 2019 hou em enou et al 2020 2021 owing the abovementioned factors the groundwater could be unsuitable for drinking and or irrigation usages however monitoring and assessing groundbreaking methods may be valuable to accomplish water quality and reduce contamination and health menaces chowdury et al 2019 krupkov a et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 for this aim various methods and models have been developed and proposed recently to be applied in groundwater quality assessment its contamination mapping and its classification there are different approaches in groundwater quality evaluation such as statistical index based methods or spatial based methods and there is an outstanding development in novel method proposing adimalla and taloor 2020 das et al 2020 el mountassir et al 2020 gao et al 2020 2021 bilali et al 2020 many organizations have proposed guidelines which can be used in irrigation water quality assessment based on vast indices and parameters such as fao who colorado state university etc numerous studies have surveyed the aforementioned approaches for the groundwater quality assessment for example singh et al 2018 have used saaty s analytic hierarchy process sahp in iwqi development kavurmaci and apaydin 2019 assessed the irrigation water quality in turkey using the gis and multicriteria decision analysis model gidey 2018 utilized the geospatial methods to determine the irrigation water quality in northern ethiopia jahin et al 2020 applied principal component analysis pca and factor analysis fa in developing the irrigation water quality index for a basin in egypt sharma et al 2021 analyzed the himalayan rivers water for irrigation purpose they assessed surface water quality calculating sar soluble sodium percentage ssp or na el behairy et al 2021 assessed the irrigation water quality using the gis based study for west nile delta egypt şener et al 2022 conjugated the gis and analytic hierarchy process ahp to assess the irrigation water quality since the groundwater resources have a crucial position in sustainable development there is a vital necessity in finding the groundbreaking and smart methods in their monitoring management and protection these innovative methods should be able to overcome the flaws of routine methods in one hand and have a low cost and high capability owing that artificial intelligence ai techniques and machine learning methods ml can play a substantial role in this field ml models have demonstrated high accuracy in many environmental issues such as forecasting the river flow yaseen et al 2019 groundwater modeling rajaee et al 2019 predicting the water quality indicators lu and ma 2020 foreseeing the groundwater quality for potable usage el bilali et al 2020 tiyasha and yaseen 2020 reviewed the ai techniques utilization in water quality forecasting they reported several studies in this field for instance wagh et al 2016 determined the water quality appropriateness for irrigation via ann model for example yıldız and karakuş 2020 calculated irrigation water quality index iwqi upon to sar na ki and pi applying the multiple regression and artificial neural network ann model ubah et al 2021 predicted the water quality parameters utilizing the artificial neural networks in another study di et al 2019 applied ml models assessing the water quality of yangtze river in china considering the above mentioned studies and their reasonable results it can be attractive for the environmental custodians and organizations to implement ai methods in water quality supervision and protection among the developed ai methods ml has a valuable position and long short term memory lstm as a famous ml technique has revealed its capability recently it has been utilized in many studies and water quality field in particular for example liu et al 2019 analyzed and forecasted the water quality of yangzhou area china using lstm yang et al 2021 applied a hybrid cnn lstm for water quality prediction in the mangrove wetland ecosystem zhou et al and baek et al predicted the water quality in 2018 and 2020 respectively however zhou et al used igra and lstm while baek et al utilize a hybrid model of cnn lstm kouadri et al 2022 compared the results of ann lstm and mlr models in forecasting of irrigation water quality parameters in present study it has tried to use ml method as a contribution for the conventional field methods in irrigation water quality forecasting the novelty of present study is that lstm has been applied to predict the sodium absorption ratio sar as a key factor in irrigation water quality assessment not only temporally but also spatially making a network of spatiotemporal data as a matrix of input data 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the urmia plain is situated in the northwestern of iran at the west side of urmia lake fig 1 the main usage of groundwater resource of this area i e urmia aquifer is for the irrigation demand more than 60 amiri et al 2016c urmia plain has the mediterranean climate its temperature varies between 6 31 c and the average rainfall is about 346 mm annually amiri et al 2017 west azerbaijan province and urmia city in particular have a huge population which work in agriculture branch mostly urmia city and some other adjacent cities of it in west azerbaijan province are known as the top agricultural hub in iran study area has the high rank in production of several farming products in the country which need enormous volume of groundwater consequently the irrigation water quality monitoring and assessment thus is necessary for this area 2 2 irrigation water quality parameter assessment of water appropriateness for irrigation purposes depend on many parameters and indices several organizations and studies have suggested criteria for this aim as mentioned in introduction section in present study the sar factor has been selected as the irrigation water quality criterium due to its capability in calculation and giving the adequate insight of irrigation water quality sar can be expressed and calculated as below 1 s a r n a m g 2 c a 2 2 when the sar is high it concluded that hydraulic conductivity of the soil texture is low which reduces the irrigation efficiency consequently if the sar value is less than 18 upon to the fao guideline the water is assumed appropriate for the irrigation purposes table 1 shows the irrigation water quality classification based on sar fig 2 shows the sar value annual changes during the study time period 2002 2019 for 101 points in urmia plain study area it means that for each individual points there is 18 sar value i e each year one annual value of sar as the average amount of the year 2 3 long short term memory lstm lstm as a type of recurrent neural networks rnn is an innovative one and can overwhelmed the general flaws of rnn via long term dependance learning although it proposed by hochreiter and schmidhuber in 1997 improved by other scholars subsequently fan et al 2020 lstm has a main concept cell state ct and information can pass through its gates without being influenced mentioned gates are three ones and they control the cell state the first gate is called forget gate it chooses the cells which must be forgotten forget gate can be explained as below 2 f t σ w f h t 1 x t b f where ft is the output vector wf and bf are the parameters and are trained for the first gate ft can vary from 0 to 1 and denotes the degree of forget input gate is the second gate and picks the values which must be updated via below equation 3 i t σ w i h t 1 x t b i the output variable allotted to it it can change between zero and one wi and bi are parameters which are trained and xt and ht 1 are the current input and last hidden state respectively the third gate is called output gate and picks the output via sigmoid layer 4 o t σ w o h t 1 x t b 0 where ot is an output vector ranges between 0 and 1 w o and b 0 are parameters which can be trained the new hidden state ht then can be calculated as the last phase 5 h t o t tanh c t fig 3 depicts the schematic flowchart of lstm model for the study aim 2 4 performance evaluation of model for evaluating the performance of the proposed model predicting the sar spatiotemporally three statistical parameters namely root mean square error rmse mean absolute percentage error mape and correlation coefficient r have been utilized and can be calculated as below 6 r m s e i 1 n s a r o i s a r p i 2 n 7 m a p e i 1 n s a r o i s a r p i s a r o i n 100 8 r i 1 n s a r o i s a r o s a r p i s a r p i 1 n s a r o i s a r o 2 i 1 n s a r p i s a r p 2 besides to determine the accuracy of the applied model lstm rbias and generalization ability ga were calculated the rbias reveals if the model tends to underestimate rbias 0 or overestimate rbias 0 the target and can be expressed as below 9 r b i a s i 1 n x o b s e r v e d s a r x p r e d i c t e d s a r i 1 n x o b s e r v e d s a r x observedsar x predictedsar and x o b s e r v e d s a r are observed and the model predicted mean of observed values respectively rbias equals 0 shows that model is perfect while the other values reveal that the model is biased ga in ml models is a vital issue ga value is perfect if approaches to unity if the it is lesser or higher than unity the model is under trained or over trained respectively 10 g a r m s e v a l i d a t i o n p h a s e r m s e t r a i n i n g p h a s e 3 results and discussion the outcomes of the lstm method afterwards were compared with observed calculated sar of data sets data were separated into two sets 80 for training and 20 for validation fig 4 a and b shows the predicted amount of sar versus observed sar for training and validation steps respectively table 2 shows the results of ga calculation as it can be seen the lstm model is near to perfect performance the calculated sar for the period of 2002 2019 which utilized as an input for the lstm model simulated and used for the prediction of sar for the next year 2020 for 101 points in the study area having the concentration of ca2 mg2 and na for the 101 points of the study area for the 2020 sar value was calculated and had been saved as the observational data lstm model then was run to forecast the sar for those 101 points and its outcomes compared with derived sar for 2020 table 3 shows the results of before mentioned statistical parameters for the lstm model implementation and fig 5 shows the comparison between the predicted and observed sar by 2020 as it can be seen in fig 5 at points which have the higher sar the model could not predict the sar value perfectly however it is normal since the model considering the rbias and ga results was biased due to spatial variation of sar the predicted sar for points was plotted on the study area map and revealed that some points with highest sar are located adjacent to the populated residential area i e urmia city fig 6 shows the irrigation water quality classification of the study area and it can be concluded that the more population the most sar and lowest quality of irrigation water will be the crowed area will be accompanied by higher anthropogenic and agricultural activities and more pollution consequently the sar hence will be higher and the water quality will be reduced accordingly taylor diagram for the predicted and observed sar for 2020 plotted afterwards and showed the capability of lstm model in forecasting the sar spatiotemporally fig 7 depicts the taylor diagram for proposed model 4 interpretation of model findings the operative supervision monitoring and planning of the groundwater resources can be improved by the comprehensive insight of the water quality considering that the hydrochemistry of water samples should be noticed and studied sensibly the statistical properties for the major ions predicted and measured for the 101 samples of the study area is shown in table 4 based on table 4 ca2 varies from 150 to 1030 mg l and mg2 ranges from 110to 1160 mg l while na limited between 20 and 770 mg l with a mean of 181 42 mg l k has the lowest concentration among the cations of the study area and varies from 1 to 20 mg l with an average of 9 08 mg l so the order of cations in the study area is ca2 mg2 na k upon to the hydrochemistry statistics of the study area table 4 highest average among the cations belong to ca2 462 mg l and its greater than mg2 mean concentration by 357 mg l this ratio indicates the high amount of hardness in the study area based on the standard deviation values the spatial variation of ca2 and mg2 is greater than that of na and k due to the controlling factors ca2 and mg2 are related with high changeability wu et al 2017 for the anions of the groundwater samples the highest mean concentration belongs to hco3 with 656 85 mg l it ranges from 340 mg l to 1350 mg l while cl and so4 2 concentration varies from 10 to 650 mg l and from 30 to 870 mg l respectively with 136 42 and 218 57 mg l mean concentrations correspondingly anion abundance order in the study area is hco3 so4 2 cl base on the average concentration high variability of standard deviation for the anions reveals the robust spatial diversity of the anions according to wu et al 2017 and li et al 2017c the high spatial variability of anions can be evidence of the high diversity of anthropogenic activities considering the concentration of ions in the study area according to hounslow 1995 if ca2 is higher than so42 as it occurs in the she present area shows that ca2 may have additional sources in addition to gypsum dissolution such as calcite dolomite or silicates li et al 2018d hco3 in combination with ca2 or mg2 can make calcium carbonate caco3 or magnesium carbonate mgco3 which is precipitate in water and soil and make the porosity lower to make a precise insight about the groundwater quality in the study area the piper 1944 trilinear diagram was used to determine the hydro chemical classification and facies fig 8 shows the groundwater samples of the study area plotted in piper diagram in addition to urmia lake water sample based on this diagram fig 8 the main type of groundwater in study areas is ca mg hco3 which is completely different from the urmia lake water type the major cations are ca2 and mg2 and the anion is hco3 ca2 and mg2 in the groundwater samples meaningfully surpass the na and k and the hco3 is more than cl and so42 dramatically results shows the high level of sar and total hardness in the study area which decrease the irrigation water quality and the authorities should consider the water quality changes since the most important resource for the irrigation and drinking purposes in the study area is groundwater on the other hand as it was mentioned above the urmia plain is recognized as the agriculture and farming hub in iran and the most groundwater resources are being consumed for the irrigation purposes study of land use therefore can be helpful for the judgment about the irrigation water quality in the study area to understand the origin of hydro chemical variation of the study area the land use of the study area was plotted with sampling points on it fig 9 as it can be seen the most unsuitable and doubtful irrigation water quality belong to the areas with heavy farming and the nearby to the residential area which approve the effect of farming and anthropogenic activities in this area for the next step of irrigation water quality evaluation and because of the sampling points located in urmia coastal aquifer and the saltwater intrusion into the aquifer is possible saltwater intrusion probability was calculated for the points nearby the urmia lake fig 10 via revelle index revelle 1941 introduced a ratio as its explanation can be seen below 11 re v e l l e i n d e x c l h c o 3 c o 3 2 revelle index shows the impact of saltwater intrusion revelle index more than 1 5 indicates the saltwater intrusion while the lower amount shows no saltwater intrusion table 5 shows the results of revelle index calculation for the shown points in fig 10 as it obvious adjacent wells to the urmia lake have the lower revelle index than 1 5 and it proves that there is no saltwater intrusion there which means the variation in water quality nearby the urmia lake do not depend on saltwater intrusion into the study area overall considering the results of the present study it can be understood that the anthropogenic activities whether the farming or wastewater infiltration can reduce the quality of groundwater resources for different purposes using the intelligent and novel methods such as machine learning methods in management planning and long term decision making by custodians can improve the environment protection and reducing the effect of anthropogenic activities on natural resources it can be suggested that changing of farming pattern and preventing of overextraction of the groundwater resources for the irrigation purposes could make a safer and cleaner environment for the next generations 5 conclusion the present study investigated the capability of lstm method in forecasting the water quality for irrigation purposes via sodium absorption ratio sar spatiotemporal modeling sar was calculated for a time period from 2002 2019 to be used as an input data for lstm model and the sar for 2020 was forecasted the assessment results acclaim the usage of lstm in forecasting irrigation water quality this can be beneficial for the environmental decision makers in planning groundwater resources and their supervision the major limitation of the

9113,present study was conducted to predict the spatiotemporal groundwater suitability for irrigation purpose through deep learning method long short term memory lstm in northwest of iran sodium adsorption ratio sar as a crucial irrigation water quality criterion for 101 sampling point for an 18 year data period from 2002 to 2019 was utilized as the input for deep learning model in order to forecast the irrigation water quality for the next year 2020 to evaluate the model accuracy in spatiotemporal data forecasting performance criteria such as mean absolute percentage error mape root mean square error rmse and r were used which approved the model accuracy by 1 212 0 312 and 0 89 of mape rmse and r respectively on the other hand the model capability was assessed by rbias and generalization ability ga which results showed that lstm model underestimated the targets with rbias equals to about 1 539 while had an acceptable ga equals to 1 1832 considering the carried out map of irrigation water quality for the study area it was revealed that about 78 have the desirable to acceptable quality for irrigation and the about 22 are moderate to non acceptable the most non acceptable points are juxtaposed to the residential area which shows the anthropogenic effect on groundwater quality through the fertilizers and the other pollutants infiltered into the groundwater resources keywords irrigation water quality sar deep learning method long short memory pollutant data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction groundwater as the most important natural resource are being used mainly in agriculture and the freshwater usage all around the world siebert et al 2010 this valuable resource thus should be protected against the hazardous factors and activities during the recent decades groundwater resources have been confronted different issues such as overextraction anthropogenic contamination and scarcity due to climate change threatening their quality and quantity chen et al 2016 2019 2021 qian et al 2020 burri et al 2019 el asri et al 2019 hou em enou et al 2020 2021 owing the abovementioned factors the groundwater could be unsuitable for drinking and or irrigation usages however monitoring and assessing groundbreaking methods may be valuable to accomplish water quality and reduce contamination and health menaces chowdury et al 2019 krupkov a et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 for this aim various methods and models have been developed and proposed recently to be applied in groundwater quality assessment its contamination mapping and its classification there are different approaches in groundwater quality evaluation such as statistical index based methods or spatial based methods and there is an outstanding development in novel method proposing adimalla and taloor 2020 das et al 2020 el mountassir et al 2020 gao et al 2020 2021 bilali et al 2020 many organizations have proposed guidelines which can be used in irrigation water quality assessment based on vast indices and parameters such as fao who colorado state university etc numerous studies have surveyed the aforementioned approaches for the groundwater quality assessment for example singh et al 2018 have used saaty s analytic hierarchy process sahp in iwqi development kavurmaci and apaydin 2019 assessed the irrigation water quality in turkey using the gis and multicriteria decision analysis model gidey 2018 utilized the geospatial methods to determine the irrigation water quality in northern ethiopia jahin et al 2020 applied principal component analysis pca and factor analysis fa in developing the irrigation water quality index for a basin in egypt sharma et al 2021 analyzed the himalayan rivers water for irrigation purpose they assessed surface water quality calculating sar soluble sodium percentage ssp or na el behairy et al 2021 assessed the irrigation water quality using the gis based study for west nile delta egypt şener et al 2022 conjugated the gis and analytic hierarchy process ahp to assess the irrigation water quality since the groundwater resources have a crucial position in sustainable development there is a vital necessity in finding the groundbreaking and smart methods in their monitoring management and protection these innovative methods should be able to overcome the flaws of routine methods in one hand and have a low cost and high capability owing that artificial intelligence ai techniques and machine learning methods ml can play a substantial role in this field ml models have demonstrated high accuracy in many environmental issues such as forecasting the river flow yaseen et al 2019 groundwater modeling rajaee et al 2019 predicting the water quality indicators lu and ma 2020 foreseeing the groundwater quality for potable usage el bilali et al 2020 tiyasha and yaseen 2020 reviewed the ai techniques utilization in water quality forecasting they reported several studies in this field for instance wagh et al 2016 determined the water quality appropriateness for irrigation via ann model for example yıldız and karakuş 2020 calculated irrigation water quality index iwqi upon to sar na ki and pi applying the multiple regression and artificial neural network ann model ubah et al 2021 predicted the water quality parameters utilizing the artificial neural networks in another study di et al 2019 applied ml models assessing the water quality of yangtze river in china considering the above mentioned studies and their reasonable results it can be attractive for the environmental custodians and organizations to implement ai methods in water quality supervision and protection among the developed ai methods ml has a valuable position and long short term memory lstm as a famous ml technique has revealed its capability recently it has been utilized in many studies and water quality field in particular for example liu et al 2019 analyzed and forecasted the water quality of yangzhou area china using lstm yang et al 2021 applied a hybrid cnn lstm for water quality prediction in the mangrove wetland ecosystem zhou et al and baek et al predicted the water quality in 2018 and 2020 respectively however zhou et al used igra and lstm while baek et al utilize a hybrid model of cnn lstm kouadri et al 2022 compared the results of ann lstm and mlr models in forecasting of irrigation water quality parameters in present study it has tried to use ml method as a contribution for the conventional field methods in irrigation water quality forecasting the novelty of present study is that lstm has been applied to predict the sodium absorption ratio sar as a key factor in irrigation water quality assessment not only temporally but also spatially making a network of spatiotemporal data as a matrix of input data 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the urmia plain is situated in the northwestern of iran at the west side of urmia lake fig 1 the main usage of groundwater resource of this area i e urmia aquifer is for the irrigation demand more than 60 amiri et al 2016c urmia plain has the mediterranean climate its temperature varies between 6 31 c and the average rainfall is about 346 mm annually amiri et al 2017 west azerbaijan province and urmia city in particular have a huge population which work in agriculture branch mostly urmia city and some other adjacent cities of it in west azerbaijan province are known as the top agricultural hub in iran study area has the high rank in production of several farming products in the country which need enormous volume of groundwater consequently the irrigation water quality monitoring and assessment thus is necessary for this area 2 2 irrigation water quality parameter assessment of water appropriateness for irrigation purposes depend on many parameters and indices several organizations and studies have suggested criteria for this aim as mentioned in introduction section in present study the sar factor has been selected as the irrigation water quality criterium due to its capability in calculation and giving the adequate insight of irrigation water quality sar can be expressed and calculated as below 1 s a r n a m g 2 c a 2 2 when the sar is high it concluded that hydraulic conductivity of the soil texture is low which reduces the irrigation efficiency consequently if the sar value is less than 18 upon to the fao guideline the water is assumed appropriate for the irrigation purposes table 1 shows the irrigation water quality classification based on sar fig 2 shows the sar value annual changes during the study time period 2002 2019 for 101 points in urmia plain study area it means that for each individual points there is 18 sar value i e each year one annual value of sar as the average amount of the year 2 3 long short term memory lstm lstm as a type of recurrent neural networks rnn is an innovative one and can overwhelmed the general flaws of rnn via long term dependance learning although it proposed by hochreiter and schmidhuber in 1997 improved by other scholars subsequently fan et al 2020 lstm has a main concept cell state ct and information can pass through its gates without being influenced mentioned gates are three ones and they control the cell state the first gate is called forget gate it chooses the cells which must be forgotten forget gate can be explained as below 2 f t σ w f h t 1 x t b f where ft is the output vector wf and bf are the parameters and are trained for the first gate ft can vary from 0 to 1 and denotes the degree of forget input gate is the second gate and picks the values which must be updated via below equation 3 i t σ w i h t 1 x t b i the output variable allotted to it it can change between zero and one wi and bi are parameters which are trained and xt and ht 1 are the current input and last hidden state respectively the third gate is called output gate and picks the output via sigmoid layer 4 o t σ w o h t 1 x t b 0 where ot is an output vector ranges between 0 and 1 w o and b 0 are parameters which can be trained the new hidden state ht then can be calculated as the last phase 5 h t o t tanh c t fig 3 depicts the schematic flowchart of lstm model for the study aim 2 4 performance evaluation of model for evaluating the performance of the proposed model predicting the sar spatiotemporally three statistical parameters namely root mean square error rmse mean absolute percentage error mape and correlation coefficient r have been utilized and can be calculated as below 6 r m s e i 1 n s a r o i s a r p i 2 n 7 m a p e i 1 n s a r o i s a r p i s a r o i n 100 8 r i 1 n s a r o i s a r o s a r p i s a r p i 1 n s a r o i s a r o 2 i 1 n s a r p i s a r p 2 besides to determine the accuracy of the applied model lstm rbias and generalization ability ga were calculated the rbias reveals if the model tends to underestimate rbias 0 or overestimate rbias 0 the target and can be expressed as below 9 r b i a s i 1 n x o b s e r v e d s a r x p r e d i c t e d s a r i 1 n x o b s e r v e d s a r x observedsar x predictedsar and x o b s e r v e d s a r are observed and the model predicted mean of observed values respectively rbias equals 0 shows that model is perfect while the other values reveal that the model is biased ga in ml models is a vital issue ga value is perfect if approaches to unity if the it is lesser or higher than unity the model is under trained or over trained respectively 10 g a r m s e v a l i d a t i o n p h a s e r m s e t r a i n i n g p h a s e 3 results and discussion the outcomes of the lstm method afterwards were compared with observed calculated sar of data sets data were separated into two sets 80 for training and 20 for validation fig 4 a and b shows the predicted amount of sar versus observed sar for training and validation steps respectively table 2 shows the results of ga calculation as it can be seen the lstm model is near to perfect performance the calculated sar for the period of 2002 2019 which utilized as an input for the lstm model simulated and used for the prediction of sar for the next year 2020 for 101 points in the study area having the concentration of ca2 mg2 and na for the 101 points of the study area for the 2020 sar value was calculated and had been saved as the observational data lstm model then was run to forecast the sar for those 101 points and its outcomes compared with derived sar for 2020 table 3 shows the results of before mentioned statistical parameters for the lstm model implementation and fig 5 shows the comparison between the predicted and observed sar by 2020 as it can be seen in fig 5 at points which have the higher sar the model could not predict the sar value perfectly however it is normal since the model considering the rbias and ga results was biased due to spatial variation of sar the predicted sar for points was plotted on the study area map and revealed that some points with highest sar are located adjacent to the populated residential area i e urmia city fig 6 shows the irrigation water quality classification of the study area and it can be concluded that the more population the most sar and lowest quality of irrigation water will be the crowed area will be accompanied by higher anthropogenic and agricultural activities and more pollution consequently the sar hence will be higher and the water quality will be reduced accordingly taylor diagram for the predicted and observed sar for 2020 plotted afterwards and showed the capability of lstm model in forecasting the sar spatiotemporally fig 7 depicts the taylor diagram for proposed model 4 interpretation of model findings the operative supervision monitoring and planning of the groundwater resources can be improved by the comprehensive insight of the water quality considering that the hydrochemistry of water samples should be noticed and studied sensibly the statistical properties for the major ions predicted and measured for the 101 samples of the study area is shown in table 4 based on table 4 ca2 varies from 150 to 1030 mg l and mg2 ranges from 110to 1160 mg l while na limited between 20 and 770 mg l with a mean of 181 42 mg l k has the lowest concentration among the cations of the study area and varies from 1 to 20 mg l with an average of 9 08 mg l so the order of cations in the study area is ca2 mg2 na k upon to the hydrochemistry statistics of the study area table 4 highest average among the cations belong to ca2 462 mg l and its greater than mg2 mean concentration by 357 mg l this ratio indicates the high amount of hardness in the study area based on the standard deviation values the spatial variation of ca2 and mg2 is greater than that of na and k due to the controlling factors ca2 and mg2 are related with high changeability wu et al 2017 for the anions of the groundwater samples the highest mean concentration belongs to hco3 with 656 85 mg l it ranges from 340 mg l to 1350 mg l while cl and so4 2 concentration varies from 10 to 650 mg l and from 30 to 870 mg l respectively with 136 42 and 218 57 mg l mean concentrations correspondingly anion abundance order in the study area is hco3 so4 2 cl base on the average concentration high variability of standard deviation for the anions reveals the robust spatial diversity of the anions according to wu et al 2017 and li et al 2017c the high spatial variability of anions can be evidence of the high diversity of anthropogenic activities considering the concentration of ions in the study area according to hounslow 1995 if ca2 is higher than so42 as it occurs in the she present area shows that ca2 may have additional sources in addition to gypsum dissolution such as calcite dolomite or silicates li et al 2018d hco3 in combination with ca2 or mg2 can make calcium carbonate caco3 or magnesium carbonate mgco3 which is precipitate in water and soil and make the porosity lower to make a precise insight about the groundwater quality in the study area the piper 1944 trilinear diagram was used to determine the hydro chemical classification and facies fig 8 shows the groundwater samples of the study area plotted in piper diagram in addition to urmia lake water sample based on this diagram fig 8 the main type of groundwater in study areas is ca mg hco3 which is completely different from the urmia lake water type the major cations are ca2 and mg2 and the anion is hco3 ca2 and mg2 in the groundwater samples meaningfully surpass the na and k and the hco3 is more than cl and so42 dramatically results shows the high level of sar and total hardness in the study area which decrease the irrigation water quality and the authorities should consider the water quality changes since the most important resource for the irrigation and drinking purposes in the study area is groundwater on the other hand as it was mentioned above the urmia plain is recognized as the agriculture and farming hub in iran and the most groundwater resources are being consumed for the irrigation purposes study of land use therefore can be helpful for the judgment about the irrigation water quality in the study area to understand the origin of hydro chemical variation of the study area the land use of the study area was plotted with sampling points on it fig 9 as it can be seen the most unsuitable and doubtful irrigation water quality belong to the areas with heavy farming and the nearby to the residential area which approve the effect of farming and anthropogenic activities in this area for the next step of irrigation water quality evaluation and because of the sampling points located in urmia coastal aquifer and the saltwater intrusion into the aquifer is possible saltwater intrusion probability was calculated for the points nearby the urmia lake fig 10 via revelle index revelle 1941 introduced a ratio as its explanation can be seen below 11 re v e l l e i n d e x c l h c o 3 c o 3 2 revelle index shows the impact of saltwater intrusion revelle index more than 1 5 indicates the saltwater intrusion while the lower amount shows no saltwater intrusion table 5 shows the results of revelle index calculation for the shown points in fig 10 as it obvious adjacent wells to the urmia lake have the lower revelle index than 1 5 and it proves that there is no saltwater intrusion there which means the variation in water quality nearby the urmia lake do not depend on saltwater intrusion into the study area overall considering the results of the present study it can be understood that the anthropogenic activities whether the farming or wastewater infiltration can reduce the quality of groundwater resources for different purposes using the intelligent and novel methods such as machine learning methods in management planning and long term decision making by custodians can improve the environment protection and reducing the effect of anthropogenic activities on natural resources it can be suggested that changing of farming pattern and preventing of overextraction of the groundwater resources for the irrigation purposes could make a safer and cleaner environment for the next generations 5 conclusion the present study investigated the capability of lstm method in forecasting the water quality for irrigation purposes via sodium absorption ratio sar spatiotemporal modeling sar was calculated for a time period from 2002 2019 to be used as an input data for lstm model and the sar for 2020 was forecasted the assessment results acclaim the usage of lstm in forecasting irrigation water quality this can be beneficial for the environmental decision makers in planning groundwater resources and their supervision the major limitation of the presented method is having bias due to spatial distribution of the measurement points which is predictable the results of proposed model also revealed that dense population and agricultural activities will disturb the soil texture and the groundwater quality consequently using the enormous volume of fertilizers and pesticides in agriculture section will endanger the water resources as the most important natural resource for the sustainable development results of this study can generate a reasonable vision about the usage of novel intelligent methods in natural resources monitoring and studying of the effect of natural features and anthropogenic activities on groundwater resources it also can make a fundament for the supplementary water management programs declaration of competing

9114,quantifying soil water storage by changes in management practices such as double cropping manure application and reduced tillage in semi arid and irrigated crop production areas is important for agricultural production we investigated the effects of winter forage crops triticale dairy manure and tillage on soil physical characteristics soil water storage infiltration runoff saturated hydraulic conductivity and bulk density and silage corn yield in calcareous silty loam soils in southern idaho for six years from 2016 to 2021 soil water storage was measured every 15 cm using a neutron probe down to 150 cm and infiltration and runoff were measured using a cornell sprinkle infiltrometer soil water storage tended to be lower for winter forage crop plus solid dairy manure likely due to increased crop water use infiltration rate runoff and saturated hydraulic conductivity did not improve with winter forage crops or solid dairy manure rainfall before runoff was highest for winter forage crop plus solid dairy manure suggesting that those plots were drier compared to the control during the six years of the study only three of those years saw treatment differences in silage corn yields with yields being the highest for solid dairy manure only combined triticale and silage corn yield was higher in three years for winter forage crop plus solid dairy manure reduced tillage practices did not improve soil water storage soil physical properties or dry biomass yield silage corn or silage corn plus winter forage crop based on these findings using winter forage crops may be beneficial to increase total dry biomass yields in dairy systems that would like to increase their forage production however it is not advised if a producer is only looking to increase silage

efficiency data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction a very small portion of the total water available on the planet is present in the soil daly and porporato 2005 yost and hartemink 2019 but it is essential for crop production soil water storage sws is defined as the water present in the vadose zone also known as the unsaturated soil zone seneviratne et al 2010 the measurement of sws can provide valuable information for land and water managers especially in arid and semi arid regions and can be measured using a variety of sensors such as neutron probes gardner and kirkham 1952 and time domain reflectometry topp and davis 1985 however confounding the ability to manage sws for crop production is the fact that moisture is impacted by several soil properties and management practices the amount of moisture present in the soil is not only influenced by soil organic carbon soc and soil texture yost and hartemink 2019 but is also affected by the use of winter forage crops in double cropping systems application of dairy manure and tillage practices the usage of winter forage crops such as triticale may reduce the amount of water available to cash crops at planting in a double cropping system fouli et al 2012 krueger et al 2011 krueger et al 2011 found that soil moisture was lower in a double cropping system compared to a single cropping system after the winter forage crop was harvested no change in soil moisture was found when the winter forage crop was terminated instead of harvested for forage krueger et al 2011 winter forage crops may also decrease cash crop yield however the total biomass yields increased cash crop winter forage crop siller et al 2016 west et al 2020 for instance kahimba et al 2008 concluded that total water content in soils with winter forage crops was much lower than in soils without a winter forage crop in the top one meter of soil leading to a reduction in cash crop yield this suggests that although the amount of water available for the cash crop to use at planting is lower winter forage crops may increase the overall biomass yield profitability of the field studies have shown that applying dairy manure to the soil improves sws and soil physical properties butler and muir 2006 cabrera et al 2009 mellek and dieckow 2010 cabrera et al 2009 found that sws improved when dairy manure was applied to the soil during the second and third year of the study compared to the control soils that received dairy manure had lower runoff rates implying that more water infiltrated through the soil cabrera et al 2009 improvements to saturated hydraulic conductivity and infiltration rate have also been observed when dairy manure is applied to the soil butler and muir 2006 mellek and dieckow 2010 this may be due to the increase in organic matter in the topsoil which improves the soil structure by reducing bulk density and increasing water holding capacity and water infiltration rates butler and muir 2006 fares et al 2008 mellek and dieckow 2010 tillage influences the amount of water and nutrients a soil can hold for example it has been thought that conservation tillage practices such as no till and strip till systems may reduce the amount of nutrients lost improve soil physical properties and reduce erosion acharya et al 2019 blevins et al 1977 de vita et al 2007 studies have shown conflicting results when measuring sws in soils under different tillage types de vita et al 2007 found that soil water retention was higher in soils under no till than conventional tillage however haramoto and brainard 2012 found sws was highest in soils under strip till in 2010 and in soils under conventional tillage in 2011 although research suggests that conservation tillage in semi arid environments may increase sws and improves crop yields de vita et al 2007 more research is needed to determine the effects of tillage type on soil moisture it is important to measure sws in semi arid regions because future models predict severe droughts and a decrease in rainfall events by up to 40 rossato et al 2017 in idaho there is up to a 45 chance of a multi year snow drought by 2050 2079 abatzoglou et al 2021 the effects of management practices such as reduced tillage using winter forage crops in double cropping systems and manure application have not been evaluated in the semi arid and irrigated crop production area of southern idaho in the present study we investigated the effects of winter forage crops dairy manure and tillage on soil physical characteristics sws infiltration runoff saturated hydraulic conductivity bulk density and silage corn yield in silty loam soils the objectives of this research were to i determine if winter forage crops and dairy manure increase sws or if the winter forage crops were depriving the cash crop of water ii determine if infiltration runoff saturated hydraulic conductivity and bulk density were influenced by winter forage crops and dairy manure iii determine if silage corn yield is affected by winter forage crops and dairy manure and iv determine if there were differences between tillage types 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site and

significant treatment differences were found for rbr p 0 004 rainfall before runoff is the amount of water that can infiltrate through the soil before runoff starts to occur the control had a

control had the lowest s 1 94 cm min0 5 and wfc sdm had the highest 2 47 cm min0 5 there were no differences between tillage types for any of the measurements 3 3 soil bulk density soil bulk density

yield iwue followed a similar trend fig 5 irrigation water use efficiency was the lowest between 2018 and 2020 and highest in 2016 likewise iwue increased when silage corn yield increased total dry biomass yields silage corn triticale showed significant differences between treatments in 2017 2019 and 2020 p 0 001 table 5 fig 6 in 2017 wfc sdm had the highest yields followed by wfc only and the control the control wfc only and sdm only were similar in 2019 and 2020 and total yield was highest for wfc sdm 4 discussion 4 1 soil water storage and physical properties few differences were observed in sws in this study and the control was only significantly higher than wfc sdm in the top 30 and 150 cm in 2020 in 2021 sws was higher for sdm only compared to the control in the top 60 cm most studies have shown that the addition of manure increases the overall sws due to higher amounts of organic matter present in the manure bierer et al 2021 however there was no correlation between sws and soc in this study data not shown cabrera et al 2009 found that when a heavy amount of dairy manure 493 kg p ha 1 was applied to a sandy loam soil sws increased from 3 1 control to 4 3 during year three of the study similarly wang et al 2013 found higher sws for soils that received manure compared to the control during the third year of the study in the present study sdm only and wfc sdm had twice as much soil organic matter compared to wfc only and the control in 2019 bierer et al 2021 however this did not result in higher sws winter forage crops did not improve sws in the present study and research has shown that winter forage crops may not improve sws because the winter forage crops use more water than fallow soil for example fouli et al 2012 found higher soil water content under single cropping corn or soybean compared to double cropping corn or soybean with barley or rye at the time of planting in a three year study soil moisture was also lower in a silage corn rye double cropping compared to silage corn only when the rye was harvested however no differences were observed when the rye was treated as a winter cover crop and terminated prior to silage corn planting krueger et al 2011 unlike some other studies the present study showed no difference in sws by tillage type likely because of minimal runoff due to low precipitation and low irrigation application rate at the study site acharya et al 2019 and kováč et al 2005 found that no till systems had lower sws than under conventional tillage blevins et al 1971 found opposite results stating that no till systems have higher sws than conventional tillage due to decreased evapotranspiration these findings suggest that tillage influences multiple processes that can impact sws in the present study silage corn and triticale were harvested for forage leaving little surface residue to reduce evaporation although we are unsure why tillage did not influence sws it might have to do with the calcareous nature of the soils as well as soil physical crusting soil crusts occur in arid and semi arid regions and decrease irrigation efficiency by reducing infiltration and increasing runoff potentially leading to lower sws throughout the soil profile jiang et al 2018 crusting is a common issue in southern idaho and is physically visible regardless of tillage type due to the low application rate of the solid set sprinkler system during the silage corn growing season there was a low chance of runoff due to irrigation in this study no differences were observed in runoff or infiltration rate by tillage or treatment however wfc sdm was able to infiltrate more rainfall before runoff occurred compared to the control in southern idaho runoff may occur depending on the irrigation system e g wheel line irrigation application rate e g high slope of the field and crop type field saturated hydraulic conductivity and infiltration rate were not affected by treatment or tillage although field saturated hydraulic conductivity was not affected in the present study liesch et al 2011 found an increase in saturated hydraulic conductivity when rye was used as a winter forage crop compared to silage corn only saturated hydraulic conductivity was also significantly higher under no till compared to conventional tillage practices nouri et al 2019 unlike nouri et al 2019 khan et al 2010 found that saturated hydraulic conductivity was lower under minimum tillage and was highest under deep tillage this suggests that more research is needed to determine the effect of tillage and winter forage crops on saturated hydraulic conductivity although manure did not increase saturated hydraulic conductivity in the present study research has shown that saturated hydraulic conductivity tends to increase with the addition of manure hati et al 2006 khan et al 2010 infiltration rate was not affected in the present study however other research suggests that infiltration rates increase when winter forage crops are used siller et al 2016 found a 67 decrease in runoff when rye was planted after corn compared to monocrop corn similarly chalise et al 2018 saw much higher infiltration rates when winter forage crops rye and vetch were used under no till compared to the control these findings suggest that winter forage crops increase infiltration rates due to winter forage crops promoting higher organic matter content and porosity infiltration rate has also been shown to increase when manure is applied to the soil bhattacharyya et al 2007 found that cumulative infiltration increased from 3 67 cm with no amendments to 7 73 cm when farmyard manure was incorporated into the topsoil cumulative infiltration was the highest when inorganic fertilizer and farmyard manure were applied 9 93 cm bhattacharyya et al 2007 similarly butler and muir 2006 saw increases in infiltration rate when the compost rate increased finding that the infiltration rate increased 550 when comparing 179 2 mg compost ha 1 to no compost these findings have been linked to the increase in organic matter due to manure additions between 2015 year before present study started and 2020 year five of present study bulk density decreased likely due to changes in management practices prior to 2016 the field was furrow irrigated and much of the topsoil washed away due to the position of the study site upslope side leading to high bulk density values research has shown that bulk density tends to be higher under furrow and flood irrigation compared to lower intensity irrigation types such as sprinkler and drip irrigation hondebrink et al 2017 bulk density was lower for sdm only and wfc sdm and higher for the control from 0 to 5 cm likely due to the increase in organic matter which increases porosity and decreases bulk density this finding is supported by many studies hati et al 2006 bhattacharyya et al 2007 and khan et al 2010 found decreases in bulk density when manure was applied to the soil in the present study bulk density was higher in the control compared to the other treatments from 5 to 10 cm however mixed results have been found in the literature simon et al 2021 found no differences in bulk density between fallow and winter wheat patrick et al 1957 determined that winter cover crops common and hairy vetch that were incorporated into the soil before planting cotton decreases the bulk density of the soil due to increased aggregate stability creating better soil structure in the present study soc for wfc only and the control were similar suggesting that harvesting the triticale does not increase soc in the topsoil data not shown this may also be partly due to the fact that inorganic fertilizer was not applied in the fall and therefore the triticale yields were poor especially compared to wfc sdm unlike other studies tillage had no impact on bulk density in the present study khan et al 2010 found that bulk density was lowest under deep tillage 1 32 mg m 3 compared to conventional and minimal tillage 1 39 mg m 3 osunbitan et al 2005 found that soils under no till had a higher bulk density than plow harrow tillage the lack of differences in the present study could be due to harvesting silage corn and triticale for forage the timing of measurements and the small plot size little surface residue remained after forage harvest which minimized soil surface conditions between tillage treatments soil physical properties were evaluated approximately one month prior to silage corn harvest this decision was partially made so that the tilled plots had time to settle as measurements of saturated hydraulic conductivity and bulk density in these silt loam soils were difficult to accurately evaluate in loose soil thus the effect of the winter forage crop on soil structure may be less evident furthermore due to the small plot size and the number of field activities that occur every year planting silage corn and triticale manure application tillage harvest of silage corn and triticale these plots may have been overly trafficked 4 2 water use efficiency and dry biomass yield irrigation water use efficiency is typically used to determine how efficient crops are at utilizing irrigation water çetin and uygan 2008 in the present study iwue tended to increase when silage corn yield increased however research has shown mixed results el hendawy et al 2011 found that grain yield increased by 10 when iwue increased by 8 kg m 3 likewise çetin and uygan 2008 found higher tomato yield with higher iwue although the results from this study were linear djaman and irmak 2012 and aissaoui and fenni 2020 used quadratic and cubic functions to show the relationship between iwue and crop yield in both cases an increase in crop yield did not always relate to an increase in iwue djaman and irmak 2012 ridha and fenni 2020 more research is needed to determine the relationship between crop yield and iwue in arid and semi arid regions manure did not increase silage corn yield as anticipated in the present study silage corn yield was significantly higher for sdm only compared to the control in 2017 only inorganic fertilizer was applied to meet recommended silage corn needs based on spring soil tests regardless of treatment resulting in few differences in silage corn yield inorganic fertilizer was only applied to sdm only and wfc sdm if the spring soil test showed low levels of nutrients a similar result was found in zebarth et al 1996 suggesting that corn yield was slightly higher when liquid dairy manure was applied compared to the control corn yield was the highest when liquid dairy manure was applied in the fall and spring or when inorganic fertilizer and spring applied manure were combined zebarthl et al 1996 likewise higher silage corn yields were found when the manure was applied based on the crop nitrogen requirement compared to inorganic fertilizer ferguson et al 2005 in the present study wfc only had a higher total biomass yield compared to the control in 2017 and wfc sdm had the highest total biomass yield in 2017 2019 and 2020 this is likely due to the lack of nitrogen for triticale in the non manured plots since fertilizer was only applied for the silage corn the triticale was used in the present study to determine if it could capture excess nutrients that were already present in the soil siller et al 2016 found that silage corn yields were higher when forage crops were not used and suggested that winter forage crops reduced sws at silage corn planting in the present study sws was reduced at silage corn planting due to the use of winter forage crops resulting in fewer growing degree days and reduced silage corn yields although the sws decreased for wfc sdm in 2020 compared to the control the overall total dry biomass production increased the use of winter forage crops and dairy manure allowed the soil to infiltrate more water prior to runoff allowing more water to be used by the crops this suggests that winter forage crops may be beneficial to increase total dry biomass yields in dairy systems that would like to increase their forage production the use of winter forage crops is not advised if a producer is only looking to increase silage production silage corn yield tended to be lowest for wfc sdm suggesting that the winter forage crop is possibly taking water from the silage corn also the silage corn is planted later due to the winter forage crop resulting in fewer growing degree days after six years of the present study winter forage crops do not appear to be beneficial at increasing the sws and silage corn yield in the semi arid soils of southern idaho it is worth noting that the silage corn growing season was shorter in the present study since silage corn was planted after the winter forage crop was harvested regardless of treatment winter forage crops in southern idaho tend to be harvested in late april to early may potentially resulting in a late planting of short season silage corn if winter forage crops are not planted a longer season silage corn can be planted in early may possibly resulting in higher yields research has shown that winter forage crops may reduce overall silage corn yield west et al 2020 for example silage corn yield was higher when rye was used as a cover crop and lower when rye was harvested as a forage crop west et al 2020 although silage corn yield tends to decrease when winter forage crops are planted following silage corn the total forage yield increased siller et al 2016 west et al 2020 based on our results winter forage crops may not improve silage corn production in southern idaho 5 conclusions from this research we can conclude the following the use of winter forage crops and fall applied solid dairy manure did not improve sws in the semi arid and calcareous soils in southern idaho soil water storage tended to be lower for wfc sdm due to additional water used by the winter forage crop triticale infiltration runoff and saturated hydraulic conductivity did not improve with the treatments and remained similar to the control higher infiltration before runoff was observed for wfc sdm compared to the control suggesting that the soil was drier for wfc sdm reduced tillage did not improve sws soil physical properties or dry biomass yield silage corn triticale or total silage corn yields tended to be highest for sdm only and lowest for wfc sdm however there were no treatment differences in three of the six years of the study corn triticale double cropping may increase total dry biomass yields in dairy systems however it is not advised if a producer is only looking to increase silage corn production due to potential water quality issues inversion tillage was performed at the study site in the spring of 2022 to incorporate the manure into the topsoil solid dairy manure will not be applied to the field for at least

9114,quantifying soil water storage by changes in management practices such as double cropping manure application and reduced tillage in semi arid and irrigated crop production areas is important for agricultural production we investigated the effects of winter forage crops triticale dairy manure and tillage on soil physical characteristics soil water storage infiltration runoff saturated hydraulic conductivity and bulk density and silage corn yield in calcareous silty loam soils in southern idaho for six years from 2016 to 2021 soil water storage was measured every 15 cm using a neutron probe down to 150 cm and infiltration and runoff were measured using a cornell sprinkle infiltrometer soil water storage tended to be lower for winter forage crop plus solid dairy manure likely due to increased crop water use infiltration rate runoff and saturated hydraulic conductivity did not improve with winter forage crops or solid dairy manure rainfall before runoff was highest for winter forage crop plus solid dairy manure suggesting that those plots were drier compared to the control during the six years of the study only three of those years saw treatment differences in silage corn yields with yields being the highest for solid dairy manure only combined triticale and silage corn yield was higher in three years for winter forage crop plus solid dairy manure reduced tillage practices did not improve soil water storage soil physical properties or dry biomass yield silage corn or silage corn plus winter forage crop based on these findings using winter forage crops

efficiency data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction a very small portion of the total water available on the planet is present in the soil daly and porporato 2005 yost and hartemink 2019 but it is essential for crop production soil water storage sws is defined as the water present in the vadose zone also known as the unsaturated soil zone seneviratne et al 2010 the measurement of sws can provide valuable information for land and water managers especially in arid and semi arid regions and can be measured using a variety of sensors such as neutron probes gardner and kirkham 1952 and time domain reflectometry topp and davis 1985 however confounding the ability to manage sws for crop production is the fact that moisture is impacted by several soil properties and management practices the amount of moisture present in the soil is not only influenced by soil organic carbon soc and soil texture yost and hartemink 2019 but is also affected by the use of winter forage crops in double cropping systems application of dairy manure and tillage practices the usage of winter forage crops such as triticale may reduce the amount of water available to cash crops at planting in a double cropping system fouli et al 2012 krueger et al 2011 krueger et al 2011 found that soil moisture was lower in a double cropping system compared to a single cropping system after the winter forage crop was harvested no change in soil moisture was found when the winter forage crop was terminated instead of harvested for forage krueger et al 2011 winter forage crops may also decrease cash crop yield however the total biomass yields increased cash crop winter forage crop siller et al 2016 west et al 2020 for instance kahimba et al 2008 concluded that total water content in soils with winter forage crops was much lower than in soils without a winter forage crop in the top one meter of soil leading to a reduction in cash crop yield this suggests that although the amount of water available for the cash crop to use at planting is lower winter forage crops may increase the overall biomass yield profitability of the field studies have shown that applying dairy manure to the soil improves sws and soil physical properties butler and muir 2006 cabrera et al 2009 mellek and dieckow 2010 cabrera et al 2009 found that sws improved when dairy manure was applied to the soil during the second and third year of the study compared to the control soils that received dairy manure had lower runoff rates implying that more water infiltrated through the soil cabrera et al 2009 improvements to saturated hydraulic conductivity and infiltration rate have also been observed when dairy manure is applied to the soil butler and muir 2006 mellek and dieckow 2010 this may be due to the increase in organic matter in the topsoil which improves the soil structure by reducing bulk density and increasing water holding capacity and water infiltration rates butler and muir 2006 fares et al 2008 mellek and dieckow 2010 tillage influences the amount of water and nutrients a soil can hold for example it has been thought that conservation tillage practices such as no till and strip till systems may reduce the amount of nutrients lost improve soil physical properties and reduce erosion acharya et al 2019 blevins et al 1977 de vita et al 2007 studies have shown conflicting results when measuring sws in soils under different tillage types de vita et al 2007 found that soil water retention was higher in soils under no till than conventional tillage however haramoto and brainard 2012 found sws was highest in soils under strip till in 2010 and in soils under conventional tillage in 2011 although research suggests that conservation tillage in semi arid environments may increase sws and improves crop yields de vita et al 2007 more research is needed to determine the effects of tillage type on soil moisture it is important to measure sws in semi arid regions because future models predict severe droughts and a decrease in rainfall events by up to 40 rossato et al 2017 in idaho there is up to a 45 chance of a multi year snow drought by 2050 2079 abatzoglou et al 2021 the effects of management practices such as reduced tillage using winter forage crops in double cropping systems and manure application have not been evaluated in the semi arid and irrigated crop production area of southern idaho in the present study we investigated the effects of winter forage crops dairy manure and tillage on soil physical characteristics sws infiltration runoff saturated hydraulic conductivity bulk density and silage corn yield in silty loam soils the objectives of this research were to i determine if winter forage crops and dairy manure increase sws or if the winter forage crops were depriving the cash crop of water ii determine if infiltration runoff saturated hydraulic conductivity and bulk density were influenced by winter forage crops and dairy manure iii determine if silage corn yield is affected by winter forage crops and dairy manure and iv determine if there were differences between tillage types 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site and

mean precipitation was 284 mm the soil was classified as portneuf silt loam coarse silty mixed mesic durixerollic calciorthids in the western half of the field and rad silt loam coarse silty mixed mesic durixerollic camborthids in the eastern half prior to starting the present study the field was furrow irrigated much of the topsoil washed away due to the position of the study site upslope side leading to high bulk density values after removing the furrows and leveling the field soil samples were collected from five locations at each plot and composited in 2015 and the average soil properties by depth are found in table 1 from 2016 2021 the field was cropped with continuous silage corn zea mays l triticale x triticosecale wittmack was used as a winter forage crop and was planted directly after solid dairy manure application both the silage corn and the triticale were irrigated with a solid set sprinkler system during the irrigation season which generally occurs from mid april through mid october and the entire field was uniformly irrigated regardless of treatment during the silage corn growing season the field was irrigated 11 13 times max of 58 mm of water at a rate of 5

runoff water was collected and tro is the time to runoff dual head infiltrometers saturo meter group inc pullman wa usa were used to measure field saturated hydraulic conductivity kfs field saturated hydraulic conductivity is defined as the ability of soil pores to transmit water under field saturated conditions a 10 cm insertion ring was used due to the poor structure of the soils used in the present study the settings used for the measurements were as follows 5 cm for pressure head one 15 cm for pressure head two 20 min soak time 20 min hold time and 2 or 3 pressure cycles for a run to be deemed good the error needed to be at least one magnitude smaller than the computed kfs 2 4 soil bulk density soil bulk density cores inner diameter 47 mm height 50 mm volume 88 cm3 were collected

and bulk harvested on 6 may 2019 and 27 may 2020 silage corn and triticale plant samples were collected and weighed prior drying at 60 c samples were checked daily and dried until they reached a constant weight the dried samples were then reweighed to determine the percent dry matter dry biomass yields were calculated by multiplying the weight harvested by the percent dry matter irrigation water use efficiency iwue was calculated by dividing the silage corn dry biomass yield by the amount of irrigation applied throughout the growing season according to nilahyane et al 2018 2 6 data

irrigation water use efficiency silage corn yields were statistically similar among the treatments in 2016 2018 2019 and 2021 table 5 fig 4 although the tukey test showed treatment differences in 2019

yield iwue followed a similar trend fig 5 irrigation water use efficiency was the lowest between 2018 and 2020 and highest in 2016 likewise iwue increased when silage corn yield increased total dry biomass yields silage corn triticale showed significant differences between treatments in 2017 2019 and 2020 p 0 001 table 5 fig 6 in 2017 wfc sdm had the highest yields followed by wfc only and the control the control wfc only and sdm only were similar in 2019 and 2020 and total yield was highest for wfc sdm 4 discussion 4 1 soil water storage and physical properties few differences were observed in sws in this study and the control was only significantly higher than wfc sdm in the top 30 and 150 cm in 2020 in 2021 sws was higher for sdm only compared to the control in the top 60 cm most studies have shown that the addition of manure increases the overall sws due to higher amounts of organic matter present in the manure bierer et al 2021 however there was no correlation between sws and soc in this study data not shown cabrera et al 2009 found that when a heavy amount of dairy manure 493 kg p ha 1 was applied to a sandy loam soil sws increased from 3 1 control to 4 3 during year three of the study similarly wang et al 2013 found higher sws for soils that received manure compared to the control during the third year of the study in the present study sdm only and wfc sdm had twice as much soil organic matter compared to wfc only and the control in 2019 bierer et al 2021 however this did not result in higher sws winter forage crops did not improve sws in the present study and research has shown that winter forage crops may not improve sws because the winter forage crops use more water than fallow soil for example fouli et al 2012 found higher soil water content under single cropping corn or soybean compared to double cropping corn or soybean with barley or rye at the time of planting in a three year study soil moisture was also lower in a silage corn rye double cropping compared to silage corn only when the rye was harvested however no differences were observed when the rye was treated as a winter cover crop and terminated prior to silage corn planting krueger et al 2011 unlike some other studies the present study showed no difference in sws by tillage type likely because of minimal runoff due to low precipitation and low irrigation application rate at the study site acharya et al 2019 and kováč et al 2005 found that no till systems had lower sws than under conventional tillage blevins et al 1971 found opposite results stating that no till systems have higher sws than conventional tillage due to decreased evapotranspiration these findings suggest that tillage influences multiple processes that can impact sws in the present study silage corn and triticale were harvested for forage leaving little surface residue to reduce evaporation although we are unsure why tillage did not influence sws it might have to do with the calcareous nature of the soils as well as soil physical crusting soil crusts occur in arid and semi arid regions and decrease irrigation efficiency by reducing infiltration and increasing runoff potentially leading to lower sws throughout the soil profile jiang et al 2018 crusting is a common issue in southern idaho and is physically visible regardless of tillage type due to the low application rate of the solid set sprinkler system during the silage corn growing season there was a low chance of runoff due to irrigation in this study no differences were observed in runoff or infiltration rate by tillage or treatment however wfc sdm was able to infiltrate more rainfall before runoff occurred compared to the control in southern idaho runoff may occur depending on the irrigation system e g wheel line irrigation application rate e g high slope of the field and crop type field saturated hydraulic conductivity and infiltration rate were not affected by treatment or tillage although field saturated hydraulic conductivity was not affected in the present study liesch et al 2011 found an increase in saturated hydraulic conductivity when rye was used as a winter forage crop compared to silage corn only saturated hydraulic conductivity was also significantly higher under no till compared to conventional tillage practices nouri et al 2019 unlike nouri et al 2019 khan et al 2010 found that saturated hydraulic conductivity was lower under minimum tillage and was highest under deep tillage this suggests that more research is needed to determine the effect of tillage and winter forage crops on saturated hydraulic conductivity although manure did not increase saturated hydraulic conductivity in the present study research has shown that saturated hydraulic conductivity tends to increase with the addition of manure hati et al 2006 khan et al 2010 infiltration rate was not affected in the present study however other research suggests that infiltration rates increase when winter forage crops are used siller et al 2016 found a 67 decrease in runoff when rye was planted after corn compared to monocrop corn similarly chalise et al 2018 saw much higher infiltration rates when winter forage crops rye and vetch were used under no till compared to the control these findings suggest that winter forage crops increase infiltration rates due to winter forage crops promoting higher organic matter content and porosity infiltration rate has also been shown to increase when manure is applied to the soil bhattacharyya et al 2007 found that cumulative infiltration increased from 3 67 cm with no amendments to 7 73 cm when farmyard manure was incorporated into the topsoil cumulative infiltration was the highest when inorganic fertilizer and farmyard manure were applied 9 93 cm bhattacharyya et al 2007 similarly butler and muir 2006 saw increases in infiltration rate when the compost rate increased finding that the infiltration rate increased 550 when comparing 179 2 mg compost ha 1 to no compost these findings have been linked to the increase in organic matter due to manure additions between 2015 year before present study started and 2020 year five of present study bulk density decreased likely due to changes in management practices prior to 2016 the field was furrow irrigated and much of the topsoil washed away due to the position of the study site upslope side leading to high bulk density values research has shown that bulk density tends to be higher under furrow and flood irrigation compared to lower intensity irrigation types such as sprinkler and drip irrigation hondebrink et al 2017 bulk density was lower for sdm only and wfc sdm and higher for the control from 0 to 5 cm likely due to the increase in organic matter which increases porosity and decreases bulk density this finding is supported by many studies hati et al 2006 bhattacharyya et al 2007 and khan et al 2010 found decreases in bulk density when manure was applied to the soil in the present study bulk density was higher in the control compared to the other treatments from 5 to 10 cm however mixed results have been found in the literature simon et al 2021 found no differences in bulk density between fallow and winter wheat patrick et al 1957 determined that winter cover crops common and hairy vetch that were incorporated into the soil before planting cotton decreases the bulk density of the soil due to increased aggregate stability creating better soil structure in the present study soc for wfc only and the control were similar suggesting that harvesting the triticale does not increase soc in the topsoil data not shown this may also be partly due to the fact that inorganic fertilizer was not applied in the fall and therefore the triticale yields were poor especially compared to wfc sdm unlike other studies tillage had no impact on bulk density in the present study khan et al 2010 found that bulk density was lowest under deep tillage 1 32 mg m 3 compared to conventional and minimal tillage 1 39 mg m 3 osunbitan et al 2005 found that soils under no till had a higher bulk density than plow harrow tillage the lack of differences in the present study could be due to harvesting silage corn and triticale for forage the timing of measurements and the small plot size little surface residue remained after forage harvest which minimized soil surface conditions between tillage treatments soil physical properties were evaluated approximately one month prior to silage corn harvest this decision was partially made so that the tilled plots had time to settle as measurements of saturated hydraulic conductivity and bulk density in these silt loam soils were difficult to accurately evaluate in loose soil thus the effect of the winter forage crop on soil structure may be less evident furthermore due to the small plot size and the number of field activities that occur every year planting silage corn and triticale manure application tillage harvest of silage corn and triticale these plots may have been overly trafficked 4 2 water use efficiency and dry biomass yield irrigation water use efficiency is typically used to determine how efficient crops are at utilizing irrigation water çetin and uygan 2008 in the present study iwue tended to increase when silage corn yield increased however research has shown mixed results el hendawy et al 2011 found that grain yield increased by 10 when iwue increased by 8 kg m 3 likewise çetin and uygan 2008 found higher tomato yield with higher iwue although the results from this study were linear djaman and irmak 2012 and aissaoui and fenni 2020 used quadratic and cubic functions to show the relationship between iwue and crop yield in both cases an increase in crop yield did not always relate to an increase in iwue djaman and irmak 2012 ridha and fenni 2020 more research is needed to determine the relationship between crop yield and iwue in arid and semi arid regions manure did not increase silage corn yield as anticipated in the present study silage corn yield was significantly higher for sdm only compared to the control in 2017 only inorganic fertilizer was applied to meet recommended silage corn needs based on spring soil tests regardless of treatment resulting in few differences in silage corn yield inorganic fertilizer was only applied to sdm only and wfc sdm if the spring soil test showed low levels of nutrients a similar result was found in zebarth et al 1996 suggesting that corn yield was slightly higher when liquid dairy manure was applied compared to the control corn yield was the highest when liquid dairy manure was applied in the fall and spring or when inorganic fertilizer and spring applied manure were combined zebarthl et al 1996 likewise higher silage corn yields were found when the manure was applied based on the crop nitrogen requirement compared to inorganic fertilizer ferguson et al 2005 in the present study wfc only had a higher total biomass yield compared to the control in 2017 and wfc sdm had the highest total biomass yield in 2017 2019 and 2020 this is likely due to the lack of nitrogen for triticale in the non manured plots since fertilizer was only applied for the silage corn the triticale was used in the present study to determine if it could capture excess nutrients that were already present in the soil siller et al 2016 found that silage corn yields were higher when forage crops were not used and suggested that winter forage crops reduced sws at silage corn planting in the present study sws was reduced at silage corn planting due to the use of winter forage crops resulting in fewer growing degree days and reduced silage corn yields although the sws decreased for wfc sdm in 2020 compared to the control the overall total dry biomass production increased the use of winter forage crops and dairy manure allowed the soil to infiltrate more water prior to runoff allowing more water to be used by the crops this suggests that winter forage crops may be beneficial to increase total dry biomass yields in dairy systems that would like to increase their forage production the use of winter forage crops is not advised if a producer is only looking to increase silage production silage corn yield tended to be lowest for wfc sdm suggesting that the winter forage crop is possibly taking water from the silage corn also the silage corn is planted later due to the winter forage crop resulting in fewer growing degree days after six years of the present study winter forage crops do not appear to be beneficial at increasing the sws and silage corn yield in the semi arid soils of southern idaho it is worth noting that the silage corn growing season was shorter in the present study since silage corn was planted after the winter forage crop was harvested regardless of treatment winter forage crops in southern idaho tend to be harvested in late april to early may potentially resulting in a late planting of short season silage corn if winter forage crops are not planted a longer season silage corn can be planted in early may possibly resulting in higher yields research has shown that winter forage crops may reduce overall silage corn yield west et al 2020 for example silage corn yield was higher when rye was used as a cover crop and lower when rye was harvested as a forage crop west et al 2020 although silage corn yield tends to decrease when winter forage crops are planted following silage corn the total forage yield increased siller et al 2016 west et al 2020 based on our results winter forage crops may not improve silage corn production in southern idaho 5 conclusions from this research we can conclude the following the use of winter forage crops and fall applied solid dairy manure did not improve sws in the semi arid and calcareous soils in southern idaho soil water storage tended to be lower for wfc sdm due to additional water used by the winter forage crop triticale infiltration runoff and saturated hydraulic conductivity did not improve with the treatments and remained similar to the control higher infiltration before runoff was observed for wfc sdm compared to the control suggesting that the soil was drier for wfc sdm reduced tillage did not improve sws soil physical properties or dry biomass yield silage corn triticale or total silage corn yields tended to be highest for sdm only and lowest for wfc sdm however there were no treatment differences in three of the six years of the study corn triticale double cropping may increase total dry biomass yields in dairy systems however it is not advised if a producer is only looking to increase silage corn production due to potential water quality issues inversion tillage was performed at the study site in the spring of 2022 to incorporate the manure into the topsoil solid dairy manure will not be applied to the field for at least two years in order to track changes in soc and n2o the tillage and winter forage crop treatments will remain the same declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
