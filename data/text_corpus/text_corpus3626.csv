18130,iopamidol ipm is a potential source of toxic iodinated byproducts i dbps during water disinfection in this work we determined the kinetics and mechanism of degradation of ipm by a combination of ozone o3 and peroxymonosulfate pms hso5 and assessed its effect on the formation of iodinated trihalomethanes i thms during chlorination treatment the degradation of ipm was accelerated by the o3 pms process and the hydroxyl ho and sulfate so4 radicals were major contributors to the degradation using identification of the second order reaction rate between so4 and ipm k so4 ipm 1 6 109 m 1 s 1 the contribution of ho to the degradation was determined to be 78 3 the degradation of ipm was facilitated by ph 7 and natural organic matter nom and alkalinity had limited effects on the degradation of ipm in the o3 pms process the transformation products of ipm were determined and inferred by qtof ms ms and the degradation pathways were elucidated these include amide hydrolysis amino oxidation hydrogen abstraction deiodination and hydroxyl radical addition interestingly oxidation of ipm by o3 pms also decreased its potential for formation of i thms after oxidation of ipm the i thms formed from 5 μμ ipm decreased from 14 7 μg l 1 to 3 3 μg l 1 during chlorination although the presence of nom provided the precursor of i thms during chlorination of ipm the o3 pms process decreased i thms formation by 71 because oxidation of released iodide into iodate effectively inhibited i thms formation this study provides a new approach for the accelerated degradation of ipm and control of the formation of i dbps keywords iodinated disinfection by products iopamidol ozone peroxymonosulfate 1 introduction iodinated disinfection by products i dbps in drinking water are more genotoxic and cytotoxic than chlorinated and brominated dbps plewa et al 2004 2008 richardson et al 2008 and the formation of i dbps has been investigated extensively in iodine containing waters bichsel and von gunten 1999 richardson et al 2008 iodinated x ray contrast media icm which are widely used in medical imaging technology duirk et al 2011 perez et al 2006 are potential sources of iodine for the formation of toxic i dbps during water disinfection due to their low removal efficiency in wastewater treatment plants wwtps icm have been detected in their effluents surface water and even drinking water ternes and hirsch 2000 iopamidol ipm a representative icm compound has been detected at concentrations as high as 2 7 μg l 1 in raw water duirk et al 2011 16 μg l 1 in effluents of wwtps kormos et al 2011 and 1 9 μg l 1 in sources of drinking water simazaki et al 2015 the presence of ipm in filtered water increases the i dbp formation potential and duirk et al 2011 found that 5 mm ipm in source water could form 44 7 μg l 1 iodinated trihalomethane i thms the transformation of ipm may impact the formation of i dbps during the treatment of source water for example tian et al 2014 found that uv irradiation could effectively deiodinate ipm and this increased the formation of i dbps during the disinfection processes also iodide released during the transformation of ipm by zero valent iron increased the formation of i dbps significantly dong et al 2018 thus transformation of ipm during water treatment does not indicate the simultaneous abatement of the formation potential of i dbps and further evaluation of factors that influence the formation of i dbps formation is warranted for the effective control of water quality in recent years considerable attention has been given to the use of the sulfate radical so4 for reducing concentrations of micro pollutants its oxidizing capacity is stronger than that of ho at ph 7 redox potential 2 5 3 1 v neta et al 1988 and the mechanism for the reaction between so4 and micro pollutants includes a one electron transfer and decarboxylation of carboxylic acids lutze et al 2015 hori et al 2005 antoniou et al 2010 compared with ho reactions of so4 are less influenced by alkalinity and natural organic matter nom in natural waters the so4 radical can be formed by activation of persulfate pds and peroxymonosulfate pms by ozone o3 uv radiation transition metal ions and or heat anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 arslan alaton et al 2017 yang et al 2017 guan et al 2011 hu et al 2017 oncu et al 2015 ren et al 2015 o3 is widely used for removing recalcitrant micro pollutants from drinking water and wastewater and exhibits selective oxidation of electron rich organic compounds with high reaction rate constants k o3 ph 105 m 1s 1 the reaction of o3 with hydrogen peroxide h2o2 in water generates ho which is a strong oxidant that reacts non selectively with pollutants with similar diffusion controlled reaction rates rosenfeldt et al 2006 activation of pms by o3 usually induces the formation of so4 and ho radicals yang et al 2015 and provides a new option for the effective abatement of recalcitrant micro pollutants eqs 1 8

formation of i dbps during subsequent disinfection treatment jones et al 2011 consequently the kinetics and mechanism of ipm degradation by the o3 pms process were first investigated in the present study and the effect of the o3 pms process on i dbps formation was then evaluated by combining identification of products and pathways for ipm degradation by the o3 pms process we provide a thorough evaluation of the impact of ipm on the formation of i dbps in the o3 pms process 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all chemicals were of analytical grade or higher and reaction solutions for all

glass bottles with polytetrafluoroethylene lined septum screw caps under headspace free conditions were used to perform the chlorination experiments at ambient temperature 25 c after pre oxidation of 1 μm ipm naocl 1 5 mg l 1 free chlorine was added to initiate the chlorination reaction the effects of pms dose 0 100 μm and doc 0 5 mg l 1 on the formation of i dbps were investigated by withdrawing 20 ml suspension after 72 h the reaction was quenched using excess na2s2o3 before liquid liquid extraction lle and analysis 2 3 analysis ipm was detected with an agilent 1200 series hplc system equipped with an atlantis c18 column 4 6 250 mm 5 0 μm and a flow rate of 0 5 ml min 1 was used its concentration was quantified by absorption at 242 nm the mobile phase was initially a 5 methanol and 95 water mixture but was changed linearly to 30 methanol and 70 water over 5 min and then held at this ratio for 10 min the concentration of nb was quantified by absorption at 260 nm using 70 methanol and 30 water as the mobile phase and a flow rate of 0 5 ml min 1 the injection volume was 100 μl and the column temperature was maintained at 25 c io3 concentrations were determined by ion chromatography ics 2000 dionex ca usa with an as19 column 4 250 mm and an eluent of 10 mm koh at a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 degradation of ipm by uv pds was used to determine the reaction rate of so4 the methods for determining average uv fluence and atrazine are shown in text s1 and the determination of the concentrations of co3 2 and hco3 are shown in text s2 the oxidation products from the reaction of ipm with o3 pms were identified with ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry uplc qtof ms ms acquity lc xevo g2 qtof ms waters usa

equipped with an hp 5 capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm j w usa and an electronic capture detector methyl tert butyl ether mtbe was used in the lle extraction and the gc method was based on a modification of the usepa method 551 1 usepa method 551 1 1995 the loqs of i thms were in the range of 0 1 1 0 μg l 1 as in our previous study liu et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 accelerated degradation of ipm by o3 pms fig 1 shows the kinetics of degradation of 1 μm ipm by o3 pms and o3 pms degradation of ipm by o3 or pms alone was limited 5 after 10 min which is in accordance with previous studies huber et al 2003 hollender et al 2009 hu et al 2017 iodine inhibits electrophilic substitution reactions on the benzene ring lines and parker 1980 and there is consequently limited removal of ipm from water by pms or o3 alone in contrast the effective removal of ipm from water by the o3 pms process 41 7 μm o3 and 10 μm pms within 4 min indicates that the formation of reactive oxygen species e g so4 and ho in the o3 pms process accelerates the degradation of ipm the pseudo first order rate constant for ipm degradation by o3 pms was 7 5 0 5 10 1 s 1 the degradation rate of ipm was positively associated with the doses of pms and o3 figs s1 and s2 although there was no further increase for initial concentrations of pms 30 μm because of reaction between reactive oxygen species i e so4 and ho and pms thus pms also acts as a radical scavenger for so4 and ho eqs c1 c5 table s1 moreover the recombination of so4 or ho radicals eqs c4 c6 also leads to their consumption table s1 o3 plays a key role in the activation of pms by transforming so5 2 to so8 2 which then decomposes to so5 and so4 eqs 1 8 thus both so4 and ho contribute to the accelerated degradation of ipm in the o3 pms process 3 2 contributions of so4 and ho meoh and tba are widely used to investigate the roles of so4 and ho radicals in the degradation of micro pollutants meoh is an effective quencher for both so4 k so4 meoh 1 1 107 m 1 s 1 and ho k ho meoh 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 whereas tba is an effective quencher for ho k ho tba 6 108 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 but not for so4 k so4 tba 4 105 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 consequently the difference in degradation of target compounds in the presence of tba or meoh can be used to distinguish the contributions of so4 and ho as shown in fig s3 the degradation rate of ipm significantly decreased in the presence of either 10 mm meoh or tba however in contrast to the complete inhibition of ipm degradation in the presence of meoh ipm was degraded to a limited extent in the presence of tba thus both the so4 and ho play roles in the accelerated degradation of ipm by the o3 pms process using the competitive kinetics method text s3 the reaction rate constant between ipm and so4 was determined with benzoic acid ba as the probe compound and the uv pds system for formation of so4 in the absence of pds kd ipm and kd ba are the rates of direct photolysis of ipm and ba respectively figs s4 s6 s16 as shown in fig 2 the k so4 ipm k so4 ba ratio was calculated to be 1 36 0 1 by using the value of 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 for the rate constant for the reaction of ba with so4 k so4 ba neta et al 1988 we were able for the first time to determine the reaction rate constant for the reaction of ipm with so4 1 6 109 m 1 s 1 as shown in fig s7 the observed first order degradation rate of ipm increased with increasing ph between 5 5 and 8 5 removal rates were respectively 8 3 0 3 10 1 s 1 and 1 8 0 03 s 1 at ph 7 and ph 8 5 but only 0 1 s 1 at ph 5 5 however the removal rate at ph 7 5 1 6 0 3 s 1 was not significantly different from that at ph 8 5 this is because increased consumption of o3 with increasing ph yang et al 2015 eventually leads to a decrease in the rate of formation of the two radicals overall the o3 pms process is dependent on ph for degradation of pollutants yang et al 2015 yuan et al 2017 on one hand the increase in ph increases the decomposition of o3 as reported by yang et al 2015 who found that when the ph was increased from 7 to 8 the consumption rate constant k obs of o3 increased from 1 8 0 1 10 3 s 1 to 6 0 0 5 10 3 s 1 and r ct ho and r ct so4 increased from 1 2 0 1 10 8 and 1 4 0 2 10 8 to 8 5 0 9 10 8 and 9 5 1 2 10 8 respectively also the formation of ho was enhanced by o3 under basic conditions westerhoff et al 1997 eqs c15 c16 and c21 on the other hand ph can affect the half life of o3 via reaction with oh to form ho2 and ho eqs c7 and c8 ho reacts with so5 2 to form so5 and oh and so5 is an important intermediate radical for the formation of so4 by self reaction and reaction with o3 eqs 3 5 thus both the direct and indirect reactions of so5 2 with o3 can induce the formation of so4 eqs 1 7 the contributions of so4 and ho to the degradation of ipm in the o3 pms process can be calculated from the observed first order degradation rate of ipm in the presence of nb fig s8 fig 3 shows the contributions of so4 and ho on the degradation of ipm at different ph values the contribution of ho increased from 0 1 0 03 s 1 to 1 2 0 02 s 1 as the ph was increased from 5 5 to 8 5 however the relative contribution of ho to ipm degradation decreased from 98 3 at ph 5 5 68 8 at ph 8 5 indicating that the contribution of so4 increased significantly more than that of ho when the ph was greater than 7 overall the contribution of ho to the degradation of ipm in the o3 pms process was 68 8 in the ph range 5 5 8 5 indicating that ho was the dominant oxidizing agent in the o3 pms process 3 3 effect of water matrix on the degradation of ipm by o3 pms the water matrix plays a vital role in the activation of pms and this may further impact the degradation of target pollutants in the o3 pms process fig 4 and fig s9 show the impact of water matrices including alkalinity and nom on the degradation of ipm by the o3 pms process the effect of bicarbonate was investigated at ph 7 0 fig 4 and the removal rate of ipm 1 μm decreased from 7 5 0 2 10 1 s 1 to 1 3 0 5 10 1 s 1 when the bicarbonate concentration was increased from 0 to 3 mm these results indicate that hco3 could be a free radical scavenger for so4 and ho which is consistent with the previous studies of buxton et al 1988 and zuo et al 1999 k ho hco3 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 and k so4 hco3 1 6 106 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 and hoigne 1998 also found that so4 and ho could react with hco3 and co3 2 to produce the carbonate radical eqs c31 c36 which is weakly oxidizing buxton et al 1988 zuo et al 1999 the removal rate of ipm 1 μm in the o3 pms process decreased from 7 5 0 2 10 1 s 1 to 3 9 0 8 10 3 s 1 when the nom concentration was increased from 0 to 10 mg l 1 fig s9 these results indicate that nom is a stronger scavenger for so4 and ho than bicarbonate and are consistent with the reports of hoigne 1998 and xie et al 2015 k ho nom 3 108 m 1 s 1 and k so4 nom 2 35 107 m 1 s 1 3 4 transformation products and pathways for ipm degradation by o3 pms ipm oxidation products were identified by uplc qtof ms to illustrate its degradation pathways in the o3 pms process and their ion spectra chemical formulae and proposed structures are shown in fig s10 and table s2 overall 19 oxidation products ops were identified and four degradation pathways are tentatively proposed fig 5 a amide hydrolysis and further oxidation of amino groups in side chain a and sequential amide hydrolysis of side chains b and b op 705 was generated from ipm by cleavage of the c n bond in the amide moiety of the carboxamide side chains op 735 was formed from op 705 through amino oxidation and further transformed to op 661 and op 587 through amide hydrolysis at another amide c n bond as reported previously wendel et al 2014 hu et al 2017 b hydrogen abstraction from side chains b and b and sequential amide hydrolysis and amino oxidation in side chain a electrophilic attack of so4 on either n or o in side chain a by rapid transfer of one electron from so4 to the organic compound produces a radical cation hu et al 2017 ding et al 2013 op 775 was generated from ipm by the transformation of a hydroxyl group to a carbonyl group and further transformed through oxidation of a second hydroxyl group to generate op 773 op 701 was generated from op 773 by hydrolysis at another amide c n bond and this was further transformed to op 731 through amino oxidation also op 775 could transform to op 703 through amide hydrolysis at a c n bond with this amino group being further oxidized to yield op 733 which was then transformed to op 659 through hydrolysis at another amide c n bond op 703 op 733 and op 659 were also produced respectively from op 705 op 735 and op 661 by hydrogen abstraction c deiodination reactions previous investigations have provided evidence for deiodination in the degradation of icms by advanced oxidation processes jeong et al 2010 hu et al 2017 in this study op 651 op 525 and op 399 were verified as deiodination products from ipm also op 541 and op 426 were respectively generated from op 667 and op 541 through deiodination d hydroxyl radical addition op 667 op 557 and op 447 were formed from op 651 op 541 and op 426 via hydroxyl radical addition which provides an alternative route for the production of op 541 from op 525 thus deiodination of ipm is accompanied by hydroxyl radical addition at the iodo site of the aromatic ring and provides evidence for the important role played by ho in ipm degradation in the o3 pms process although previous experimental results using cuo and δ mno2 to activate pms also found four similar degradation processes hu et al 2017 o3 activation has a higher ho yield than transition metal activated pms yang et al 2015 and results in greater amounts of hydroxyl addition and deiodination reactions also deiodination of ipm by uv irradiation has been reported to increase the formation of i thms during subsequent water disinfection tian et al 2014 therefore the variation of i thms after ipm degradation by the o3 pms process were considered further in the following section 3 5 formation of i thms from ipm nom is usually considered to be an important precursor of i thms during the formation of i dbps in the water disinfection process and the formation of i thms was observed to increase when the initial concentration of doc was increased from 0 to 5 mg l 1 fig s11 in the chlorination treatment of ipm dcim and cdim increased from 14 0 μg l 1 and 0 7 μg l 1 to 20 2 μg l 1 and 0 7 μg l 1 respectively only dcim was formed as a result of chlorination after the o3 pms treatment of ipm and its concentration increased from 3 2 μg l 1 to 6 1 μg l 1 thus compared to chlorination treatment alone the o3 pms process effectively inhibited the formation of i thms this may be attributed to the formation of powerful oxidants including so4 and ho and the subsequent oxidation of released i to io3 eqs 21 34 due to the similarity of the chemistry of halide ions the reactions of so4 with i are equivalent to those of so4 with br thomas 1965 hart and henglein 1985 taurog et al 1966 lutze et al 2014 at 0 mg l 1 nom i thms were also formed after disinfection of ipm indicating that ipm can also be used as a precursor of i thms during disinfection as described by duirk et al 2011 the impact of the o3 pms process on the formation of i thms is shown in fig s12 chlorination of 5 μm ipm resulted in the formation of 14 0 μg l 1 dcim which was the dominant i thm as was also reported by duirk et al 2011 for the chlorination of ipm containing water the formation of tim as a result of the degradation of 50 μm ipm indicates that the initial concentration of ipm governs the species formed and the concentration of i thms after chlorination fig s13 both the species and concentration of i thms formed were obviously changed after oxidation of ipm by the o3 pms process fig s12 which decreased the concentrations of dcim and cdim by 76 4 and 100 respectively a similar decreasing trend in the formation of i thms at high ipm concentration 50 μm was also observed fig s13 indicating that oxidation of ipm by the o3 pms effectively inhibits the formation of i thms 21 i ho i oh 22 i ho hoi 23 3 hoi io 3 3 h 2 i 24 i so 4 i so 4 2 25 i i i 2 26 i 2 i 2 i 3 i 27 i 3 i 2 i 28 i 2 h 2 o hoi i h 29 io i 2 io 2 i 30 io i io i 31 2 io h 2 o io io 2 h 32 io 2 io io io 2 33 io 2 i 2 i io io 34 2 io 2 i 2 o 4 35 2 io 2 h 2 o io 2 io 3 h the effect of the initial o3 and pms molar ratio on the formation of i thms is shown in fig 6 at 41 7 μm o3 the formation of i thms decreased from 42 9 μg l 1 to 3 3 μg l 1 removal rate was 92 4 when the doses of pms were increased from 0 to 100 μm compared with chlorination alone the formation of i thms increased by 2 9 fold with o3 pretreatment 41 7 μm indicating that o3 alone does not completely oxidize ipm to io3 and more likely forms hoi the reactions between pms and o3 and the interactions between hocl i and pms are shown in eqs 1 8 and c14 c31 fig s14 shows the formation of io3 after chlorination with different pms concentrations and io3 concentrations of 1 0 1 1 1 7 and 1 9 mg l 1 were obtained for initial ratios of o3 pms of 0 0 41 7 0 41 7 50 and 41 7 100 respectively fig s14 overall incomplete oxidation of ipm by ozone alone may increase the formation of i thms whereas the o3 pms process can completely oxidize ipm and reduce the formation of i thms by oxidizing i into io3 by reaction with ho and so4 radicals 3 6 inhibition of the formation of i thms with natural waters to investigate the reduction in formation of i thms in natural water samples two filtered water samples i e rw1 and rw2 from the sand filtration process of two drinking water treatment plants were individually spiked with 5 μm ipm water quality details in table s3 compared to the control group o3 pretreatment increased the formation of i thms in rw1 by 2 7 fold whereas the o3 pms pretreatment decreased the formation of i thms by 91 4 and 66 1 in rw1 and rw2 respectively fig 7 overall o3 enhanced the formation of i thms from ipm containing water whereas the o3 pms process effectively depressed its formation as a result of the formation of so4 and ho the combination of o3 and pms 41 7 μm 100 μm not only accelerated the degradation of ipm 5 μm but also reduced the formation of toxic i thms thus indicating that the o3 pms process is a more suitable pretreatment for ipm containing water than the o3 alone 4 conclusions based on the experimental results from the current work the following conclusions can be drawn the o3 pms process significantly accelerates the degradation of ipm as a result of the formation of so4 and ho radicals the second order rate constant of ipm with so4 was determined to be 1 6 109 m 1 s 1 via competition kinetics oxidation of ipm by the o3 pms process decreases greatly the concentration of i dbps formed the formation of io3 during the oxidation of ipm by the o3 pms process contributes to the decrease of i dbps declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

18130,iopamidol ipm is a potential source of toxic iodinated byproducts i dbps during water disinfection in this work we determined the kinetics and mechanism of degradation of ipm by a combination of ozone o3 and peroxymonosulfate pms hso5 and assessed its effect on the formation of iodinated trihalomethanes i thms during chlorination treatment the degradation of ipm was accelerated by the o3 pms process and the hydroxyl ho and sulfate so4 radicals were major contributors to the degradation using identification of the second order reaction rate between so4 and ipm k so4 ipm 1 6 109 m 1 s 1 the contribution of ho to the degradation was determined to be 78 3 the degradation of ipm was facilitated by ph 7 and natural organic matter nom and alkalinity had limited effects on the degradation of ipm in the o3 pms process the transformation products of ipm were determined and inferred by qtof ms ms and the degradation pathways were elucidated these include amide hydrolysis amino oxidation hydrogen abstraction deiodination and hydroxyl radical addition interestingly oxidation of ipm by o3 pms also decreased its potential for formation of i thms after oxidation of ipm the i thms formed from 5 μμ ipm decreased from 14 7 μg l 1 to 3 3 μg l 1 during chlorination although the presence of nom provided the precursor of i thms during chlorination of ipm the o3 pms process decreased i thms formation by 71 because oxidation of released iodide into iodate effectively inhibited i thms formation this study provides a new approach for the accelerated degradation of ipm and control of the formation of i dbps keywords iodinated disinfection by products iopamidol ozone peroxymonosulfate 1 introduction iodinated disinfection by products i dbps in drinking water are more genotoxic and cytotoxic than chlorinated and brominated dbps plewa et al 2004 2008 richardson et al 2008 and the formation of i dbps has been investigated extensively in iodine containing waters bichsel and von gunten 1999 richardson et al 2008 iodinated x ray contrast media icm which are widely used in medical imaging technology duirk et al 2011 perez et al 2006 are potential sources of iodine for the formation of toxic i dbps during water disinfection due to their low removal efficiency in wastewater treatment plants wwtps icm have been detected in their effluents surface water and even drinking water ternes and hirsch 2000 iopamidol ipm a representative icm compound has been detected at concentrations as high as 2 7 μg l 1 in raw water duirk et al 2011 16 μg l 1 in effluents of wwtps kormos et al 2011 and 1 9 μg l 1 in sources of drinking water simazaki et al 2015 the presence of ipm in filtered water increases the i dbp formation potential and duirk et al 2011 found that 5 mm ipm in source water could form 44 7 μg l 1 iodinated trihalomethane i thms the transformation of ipm may impact the formation of i dbps during the treatment of source water for example tian et al 2014 found that uv irradiation could effectively deiodinate ipm and this increased the formation of i dbps during the disinfection processes also iodide released during the transformation of ipm by zero valent iron increased the formation of i dbps significantly dong et al 2018 thus transformation of ipm during water treatment does not indicate the simultaneous abatement of the formation potential of i dbps and further evaluation of factors that influence the formation of i dbps formation is warranted for the effective control of water quality in recent years considerable attention has been given to the use of the sulfate radical so4 for reducing concentrations of micro pollutants its oxidizing capacity is stronger than that of ho at ph 7 redox potential 2 5 3 1 v neta et al 1988 and the mechanism for the reaction between so4 and micro pollutants includes a one electron transfer and decarboxylation of carboxylic acids lutze et al 2015 hori et al 2005 antoniou et al 2010 compared with ho reactions of so4 are less influenced by alkalinity and natural organic matter nom in natural waters the so4 radical can be formed by activation of persulfate pds and peroxymonosulfate pms by ozone o3 uv radiation transition metal ions and or heat anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 arslan alaton et al 2017 yang et al 2017 guan et al 2011 hu et al 2017 oncu et al 2015 ren et al 2015 o3 is widely used for removing recalcitrant micro pollutants from drinking water and wastewater and exhibits selective oxidation of electron rich organic compounds with high reaction rate constants k o3 ph 105 m 1s 1 the reaction of o3 with hydrogen peroxide h2o2 in water generates ho which is a strong oxidant that reacts non selectively with pollutants with similar diffusion controlled reaction rates rosenfeldt et al 2006 activation of pms by o3 usually induces the formation of so4 and ho radicals yang et al 2015 and provides a new option for the effective abatement of recalcitrant micro pollutants eqs 1 8

formation of i dbps during subsequent disinfection treatment jones et al 2011 consequently the kinetics and mechanism of ipm degradation by the o3 pms process were first investigated in the present study and the effect of the o3 pms process on i dbps formation was then evaluated by combining identification of products and pathways for ipm degradation by the o3 pms process we provide a thorough evaluation of the impact of ipm on the formation of i dbps in the o3 pms process 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all chemicals were of analytical grade or higher and reaction solutions for all

glass bottles with polytetrafluoroethylene lined septum screw caps under headspace free conditions were used to perform the chlorination experiments at ambient temperature 25 c after pre oxidation of 1 μm ipm naocl 1 5 mg l 1 free chlorine was added to initiate the chlorination reaction the effects of pms dose 0 100 μm and doc 0 5 mg l 1 on the formation of i dbps were investigated by withdrawing 20 ml suspension after 72 h the reaction was quenched using excess na2s2o3 before liquid liquid extraction lle and analysis 2 3 analysis ipm was detected with an agilent 1200 series hplc system equipped with an atlantis c18 column 4 6 250 mm 5 0 μm and a flow rate of 0 5 ml min 1 was used its concentration was quantified by absorption at 242 nm the mobile phase was initially a 5 methanol and 95 water mixture but was changed linearly to 30 methanol and 70 water over 5 min and then held at this ratio for 10 min the concentration of nb was quantified by absorption at 260 nm using 70 methanol and 30 water as the mobile phase and a flow rate of 0 5 ml min 1 the injection volume was 100 μl and the column temperature was maintained at 25 c io3 concentrations were determined by ion chromatography ics 2000 dionex ca usa with an as19 column 4 250 mm and an eluent of 10 mm koh at a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 degradation of ipm by uv pds was used to determine the reaction rate of so4 the methods for determining average uv fluence and atrazine are shown in text s1 and the determination of the concentrations of co3 2 and hco3 are shown in text s2 the oxidation products from the

equipped with an hp 5 capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm j w usa and an electronic capture detector methyl tert butyl ether mtbe was used in the lle extraction and the gc method was based on a modification of the usepa method 551 1 usepa method 551 1 1995 the loqs of i thms were in the range of 0 1 1 0 μg l 1 as in our previous study liu et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 accelerated degradation of ipm by o3 pms fig 1 shows the kinetics of degradation of 1 μm ipm by o3 pms and o3 pms degradation of ipm by o3 or pms alone was limited 5 after 10 min which is in accordance with previous studies huber et al 2003 hollender et al 2009 hu et al 2017 iodine inhibits electrophilic substitution reactions on the benzene ring lines and parker 1980 and there is consequently limited removal of ipm from water by pms or o3 alone in contrast the effective removal of ipm from water by the o3 pms process 41 7 μm o3 and 10 μm pms within 4 min indicates that the formation of reactive oxygen species e g so4 and ho in the o3 pms process accelerates the degradation of ipm the pseudo first order rate constant for ipm degradation by o3 pms was 7 5 0 5 10 1 s 1 the degradation rate of ipm was positively associated with the doses of pms and o3 figs s1 and s2 although there was no further increase for initial concentrations of pms 30 μm because of reaction between reactive oxygen species i e so4 and ho and pms thus pms also acts as a radical scavenger for so4 and ho eqs c1 c5 table s1 moreover the recombination of so4 or ho radicals eqs c4 c6 also leads to their consumption table s1 o3 plays a key role in the activation of pms by transforming so5 2 to so8 2 which then decomposes to so5 and so4 eqs 1 8 thus both so4 and ho contribute to the accelerated degradation of ipm in the o3 pms process 3 2 contributions of so4 and ho meoh and tba are widely used to investigate the roles of so4 and ho radicals in the degradation of micro pollutants meoh is an effective quencher for both so4 k so4 meoh 1 1 107 m 1 s 1 and ho k ho meoh 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 whereas tba is an effective quencher for ho k ho tba 6 108 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 but not for so4 k so4 tba 4 105 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 consequently the difference in degradation of target compounds in the presence of tba or meoh can be used to distinguish the contributions of so4 and ho as shown in fig s3 the degradation rate of ipm significantly decreased in the presence of either 10 mm meoh or tba however in contrast to the complete inhibition of ipm degradation in the presence of meoh ipm was degraded to a limited extent in the presence of tba thus both the so4 and ho play roles in the accelerated degradation of ipm by the o3 pms process using the competitive kinetics method text s3 the reaction rate constant between ipm and so4 was determined with benzoic acid ba as the probe compound and the uv pds system for formation of so4 in the absence of pds kd ipm and kd ba are the rates of direct photolysis of ipm and ba respectively figs s4 s6 s16 as shown in fig 2 the k so4 ipm k so4 ba ratio was calculated to be 1 36 0 1 by using the value of 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 for the rate constant for the reaction of ba with so4 k so4 ba neta et al 1988 we were able for the first time to determine the reaction rate constant for the reaction of ipm with so4 1 6 109 m 1 s 1 as shown in fig s7 the observed first order degradation rate of ipm increased with increasing ph between 5 5 and 8 5 removal rates were respectively 8 3 0 3 10 1 s 1 and 1 8 0 03 s 1 at ph 7 and ph 8 5 but only 0 1 s 1 at ph 5 5 however the removal rate at ph 7 5 1 6 0 3 s 1 was not significantly different from that at ph 8 5 this is because increased consumption of o3 with increasing ph yang et al 2015 eventually leads to a decrease in the rate of formation of the two radicals overall the o3 pms process is dependent on ph for degradation of pollutants yang et al 2015 yuan et al 2017 on one hand the increase in ph increases the decomposition of o3 as reported by yang et al 2015 who found that when the ph was increased from 7 to 8 the consumption rate constant k obs of o3 increased from 1 8 0 1 10 3 s 1 to 6 0 0 5 10 3 s 1 and r ct ho and r ct so4 increased from 1 2 0 1 10 8 and 1 4 0 2 10 8 to 8 5 0 9 10 8 and 9 5 1 2 10 8 respectively also the formation of ho was enhanced by o3 under basic conditions westerhoff et al 1997 eqs c15 c16 and c21 on the other hand ph can affect the half life of o3 via reaction with oh to form ho2 and ho eqs c7 and c8 ho reacts with so5 2 to form so5 and oh and so5 is an important intermediate radical for the formation of so4 by self reaction and reaction with o3 eqs 3 5 thus both the direct and indirect reactions of so5 2 with o3 can induce the formation of so4 eqs 1 7 the contributions of so4 and ho to the degradation of ipm in the o3 pms process can be calculated from the observed first order degradation rate of ipm in the presence of nb fig s8 fig 3 shows the contributions of so4 and ho on the degradation of ipm at different ph values the contribution of ho increased from 0 1 0 03 s 1 to 1 2 0 02 s 1 as the ph was increased from 5 5 to 8 5 however the relative contribution of ho to ipm degradation decreased from 98 3 at ph 5 5 68 8 at ph 8 5 indicating that the contribution of so4 increased significantly more than that of ho when the ph was greater than 7 overall the contribution of ho to the degradation of ipm in the o3 pms process was 68 8 in the ph range 5 5 8 5 indicating that ho was the dominant oxidizing agent in the o3 pms process 3 3 effect of water matrix on the degradation of ipm by o3 pms the water matrix plays a vital role in the activation of pms and this may further impact the degradation of target pollutants in the o3 pms process fig 4 and fig s9 show the impact of water matrices including alkalinity and nom on the degradation of ipm by the o3 pms process the effect of bicarbonate was investigated at ph 7 0 fig 4 and the removal rate of ipm 1 μm decreased from 7 5 0 2 10 1 s 1 to 1 3 0 5 10 1 s 1 when the bicarbonate concentration was increased from 0 to 3 mm these results indicate that hco3 could be a free radical scavenger for so4 and ho which is consistent with the previous studies of buxton et al 1988 and zuo et al 1999 k ho hco3 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 and k so4 hco3 1 6 106 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 and hoigne 1998 also found that so4 and ho could react with hco3 and co3 2 to produce the carbonate radical eqs c31 c36 which is weakly oxidizing buxton et al 1988 zuo et al 1999 the removal rate of ipm 1 μm in the o3 pms process decreased from 7 5 0 2 10 1 s 1 to 3 9 0 8 10 3 s 1 when the nom concentration was increased from 0 to 10 mg l 1 fig s9 these results indicate that nom is a stronger scavenger for so4 and ho than bicarbonate and are consistent with the reports of hoigne 1998 and xie et al 2015 k ho nom 3 108 m 1 s 1 and k so4 nom 2 35 107 m 1 s 1 3 4 transformation products and pathways for ipm degradation by o3 pms ipm oxidation products were identified by uplc qtof ms to illustrate its degradation pathways in the o3 pms process and their ion spectra chemical formulae and proposed structures are shown in fig s10 and table s2 overall 19 oxidation products ops were identified and four degradation pathways are tentatively proposed fig 5 a amide hydrolysis and further oxidation of amino groups in side chain a and sequential amide hydrolysis of side chains b and b op 705 was generated from ipm by cleavage of the c n bond in the amide moiety of the carboxamide side chains op 735 was formed from op 705 through amino oxidation and further transformed to op 661 and op 587 through amide hydrolysis at another amide c n bond as reported previously wendel et al 2014 hu et al 2017 b hydrogen abstraction from side chains b and b and sequential amide hydrolysis and amino oxidation in side chain a electrophilic attack of so4 on either n or o in side chain a by rapid transfer of one electron from so4 to the organic compound produces a radical cation hu et al 2017 ding et al 2013 op 775 was generated from ipm by the transformation of a hydroxyl group to a carbonyl group and further transformed through oxidation of a second hydroxyl group to generate op 773 op 701 was generated from op 773 by hydrolysis at another amide c n bond and this was further transformed to op 731 through amino oxidation also op 775 could transform to op 703 through amide hydrolysis at a c n bond with this amino group being further oxidized to yield op 733 which was then transformed to op 659 through hydrolysis at another amide c n bond op 703 op 733 and op 659 were also produced respectively from op 705 op 735 and op 661 by hydrogen abstraction c deiodination reactions previous investigations have provided evidence for deiodination in the degradation of icms by advanced oxidation processes jeong et al 2010 hu et al 2017 in this study op 651 op 525 and op 399 were verified as deiodination products from ipm also op 541 and op 426 were respectively generated from op 667 and op 541 through deiodination d hydroxyl radical addition op 667 op 557 and op 447 were formed from op 651 op 541 and op 426 via hydroxyl radical addition which provides an alternative route for the production of op 541 from op 525 thus deiodination of ipm is accompanied by hydroxyl radical addition at the iodo site of the aromatic ring and provides evidence for the important role played by ho in ipm degradation in the o3 pms process although previous experimental results using cuo and δ mno2 to activate pms also found four similar degradation processes hu et al 2017 o3 activation has a higher ho yield than transition metal activated pms yang et al 2015 and results in greater amounts of hydroxyl addition and deiodination reactions also deiodination of ipm by uv irradiation has been reported to increase the formation of i thms during subsequent water disinfection tian et al 2014 therefore the variation of i thms after ipm degradation by the o3 pms process were considered further in the following section 3 5 formation of i thms from ipm nom is usually considered to be an important precursor of i thms during the formation of i dbps in the water disinfection process and the formation of i thms was observed to increase when the initial concentration of doc was increased from 0 to 5 mg l 1 fig s11 in the chlorination treatment of ipm dcim and cdim increased from 14 0 μg l 1 and 0 7 μg l 1 to 20 2 μg l 1 and 0 7 μg l 1 respectively only dcim was formed as a result of chlorination after the o3 pms treatment of ipm and its concentration increased from 3 2 μg l 1 to 6 1 μg l 1 thus compared to chlorination treatment alone the o3 pms process effectively inhibited the formation of i thms this may be attributed to the formation of powerful oxidants including so4 and ho and the subsequent oxidation of released i to io3 eqs 21 34 due to the similarity of the chemistry of halide ions the reactions of so4 with i are equivalent to those of so4 with br thomas 1965 hart and henglein 1985 taurog et al 1966 lutze et al 2014 at 0 mg l 1 nom i thms were also formed after disinfection of ipm indicating that ipm can also be used as a precursor of i thms during disinfection as described by duirk et al 2011 the impact of the o3 pms process on the formation of i thms is shown in fig s12 chlorination of 5 μm ipm resulted in the formation of 14 0 μg l 1 dcim which was the dominant i thm as was also reported by duirk et al 2011 for the chlorination of ipm containing water the formation of tim as a result of the degradation of 50 μm ipm indicates that the initial concentration of ipm governs the species formed and the concentration of i thms after chlorination fig s13 both the species and concentration of i thms formed were obviously changed after oxidation of ipm by the o3 pms process fig s12 which decreased the concentrations of dcim and cdim by 76 4 and 100 respectively a similar decreasing trend in the formation of i thms at high ipm concentration 50 μm was also observed fig s13 indicating that oxidation of ipm by the o3 pms effectively inhibits the formation of i thms 21 i ho i oh 22 i ho hoi 23 3 hoi io 3 3 h 2 i 24 i so 4 i so 4 2 25 i i i 2 26 i 2 i 2 i 3 i 27 i 3 i 2 i 28 i 2 h 2 o hoi i h 29 io i 2 io 2 i 30 io i io i 31 2 io h 2 o io io 2 h 32 io 2 io io io 2 33 io 2 i 2 i io io 34 2 io 2 i 2 o 4 35 2 io 2 h 2 o io 2 io 3 h the effect of the initial o3 and pms molar ratio on the formation of i thms is shown in fig 6 at 41 7 μm o3 the formation of i thms decreased from 42 9 μg l 1 to 3 3 μg l 1 removal rate was 92 4 when the doses of pms were increased from 0 to 100 μm compared with chlorination alone the formation of i thms increased by 2 9 fold with o3 pretreatment 41 7 μm indicating that o3 alone does not completely oxidize ipm to io3 and more likely forms hoi the reactions between pms and o3 and the interactions between hocl i and pms are shown in eqs 1 8 and c14 c31 fig s14 shows the formation of io3 after chlorination with different pms concentrations and io3 concentrations of 1 0 1 1 1 7 and 1 9 mg l 1 were obtained for initial ratios of o3 pms of 0 0 41 7 0 41 7 50 and 41 7 100 respectively fig s14 overall incomplete oxidation of ipm by ozone alone may increase the formation of i thms whereas the o3 pms process can completely oxidize ipm and reduce the formation of i thms by oxidizing i into io3 by reaction with ho and so4 radicals 3 6 inhibition of the formation of i thms with natural waters to investigate the reduction in formation of i thms in natural water samples two filtered water samples i e rw1 and rw2 from the sand filtration process of two drinking water treatment plants were individually spiked with 5 μm ipm water quality details in table s3 compared to the control group o3 pretreatment increased the formation of i thms in rw1 by 2 7 fold whereas the o3 pms pretreatment decreased the formation of i thms by 91 4 and 66 1 in rw1 and rw2 respectively fig 7 overall o3 enhanced the formation of i thms from ipm containing water whereas the o3 pms process effectively depressed its formation as a result of the formation of so4 and ho the combination of o3 and pms 41 7 μm 100 μm not only accelerated the degradation of ipm 5 μm but also reduced the formation of toxic i thms thus indicating that the o3 pms process is a more suitable pretreatment for ipm containing water than the o3 alone 4 conclusions based on the experimental results from the current work the following conclusions can be drawn the o3 pms process significantly accelerates the degradation of ipm as a result of the formation of so4 and ho radicals the second order rate constant of ipm with so4 was determined to be 1 6 109 m 1 s 1 via competition kinetics oxidation of ipm by the o3 pms process decreases greatly the concentration of i dbps formed the formation of io3 during the oxidation

18131,coastal lagoons deliver a wide range of valuable ecosystem goods and services these ecosystems that are often maintained by direct or indirect groundwater supplies are collectively known as groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes the importance of groundwater supplies is greatly exacerbated in coastal mediterranean regions where the lack of surface water and the over development of anthropogenic activities critically threaten the sustainability of coastal gdes and associated ecosystem services yet coastal gdes do not benefit from a legal or managerial recognition to take into account their specificity particular attention should be paid to the characterization of environmental and ecological water requirements the hydrogeological knowledge about the management and behavior of coastal aquifers and gdes must be strengthened these investigations must be supplemented by a stronger assessment of potential contaminations to develop local land uses and human activities according to the groundwater vulnerability the quantitative management of water resources must also be better supervised and or more constrained in order to ensure the water needs necessary to maintain coastal gdes the transdisciplinary approach between hydrogeology hydrology social sciences and law is essential to fully understand the socio economic and environmental complexity of coastal gdes priority must now be given to the development of an appropriate definition of coastal gdes based on a consensus between scientists and lawyers it is a necessary first step to develop and implement specific protective legislation and to define an appropriate management scale the investment and collaboration of local water users stakeholders and decision makers need to be strengthened through actions to favor exchanges and discussions all water resources in the coastal areas should be managed collectively and strategically in order to maximize use efficiency reduce water use conflicts and avoid over exploitation it is important to continue to raise public awareness of coastal aquifers at the regional level and to integrate their specificities into coastal zone management strategies and plans in the global context of unprecedented anthropogenic pressures hydro food crises and climate change environmental protection and preservation of coastal gdes represents a major challenge for the sustainable socio economic and environmental development of mediterranean coastal zones graphical abstract image 1 keywords coastal aquifer coastal hydrosystems mediterranean climate groundwater management anthropogenic impact 1 introduction coastal lagoons cover about 13 of the coastlines from arid to humid environments kjerfve 1994 being transitional areas from land to sea the water balance of coastal lagoons is resulting from both terrestrial fresh groundwater and surface water and marine water influences this dual influence allows the development of specific ecosystems that provide a wide range of ecosystem goods and services newton et al 2014 2018 over the past few decades several studies have highlighted the importance of groundwater in maintaining the physico chemical conditions of these sensitive ecosystems coastal lagoons and surrounding wetlands may then constitute groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes krogulec 2016 menció et al 2017 and are referred in the document as coastal gdes the importance of groundwater is further exacerbated in regions suffering from water stress when surface water is chronically unavailable groundwater inputs support or compensate for surface water inputs and play a vital role in maintaining coastal gdes this problem is encountered in a majority of coastal regions with an arid or semi arid mediterranean climate fig 1 köppen 1936 such as the mediterranean basin european union eu and non eu countries but also on the southwestern coasts of australia chile and the state of california united states and on the southern coast of south africa in these regions referred to throughout this document as mediterranean regions the lack of surface water is combined with a high anthropogenic pressure unep map 2012 population growth proceed together with the development and expansion of human activities such as urbanization agriculture tourism and industrial activities lotze et al 2006 increasing human water needs often lead to overexploitation of aquifers and or degradation of groundwater quality which present a risk both to the well being of human activities and to the freshwater needs of coastal gdes these degradations are expected to be worsen under the effects of climate change climatic disturbance in terms of increasing temperatures bille et al 2009 hallegatte et al 2009 global hydrological cycle ipcc 2014 and sea level rise fitzgerald et al 2008 carrasco et al 2016 benjamin et al 2017 should greatly affect the groundwater and coastal gdes this is true not only for the mediterranean basin considered as a hot spot of climate change but also for all the mediterranean regions since the 1990s and the rio de janeiro earth summit the conservation the maintenance of potentialities and the improvement of the ecological status of the coastal water bodies constitute a major concern nowadays a first statement can be made on the progress and limitations of groundwater management strategies and consideration given to coastal gdes in coastal mediterranean regions to this aim this review proposes to expose the specificities of coastal gdes and the key role of groundwater in their sustainable development highlight the vulnerability of coastal gdes to the socio economic development and climate conditions of mediterranean regions revise the consideration given to gdes and particularly to coastal gdes in the management policies of mediterranean regions and discuss their implication for the sustainability of coastal gdes 2 specificities and importance of coastal gdes 2 1 the wide diversity and essential functions of coastal gdes gdes are defined as ecosystems that require access to groundwater on a permanent or intermittent basis to meet all or some of their water requirement so as to maintain their communities of plants and animals ecological processes and ecosystem services richardson et al 2011 this definition clearly expresses the crucial role of groundwater in the functioning of gdes however the multitude of processes and services grouped under the terms ecological processes and ecosystem services does not necessarily make it possible to understand all the specificities and complexity inherent to certain types of gdes such as coastal gdes table 1 summarizes the morphologic and hydrological characteristics the hydrological knowledge and the protection and conservation status of 14 of the most studied lagoons present in mediterranean regions subject to mediterranean climate fig 1 newton et al 2018 pérez ruzafa and marcos 2008 the coastal gdes are distinguished by their diversity making each of them a special case this diversity is expressed on several levels from a morphological point of view water bodies of coastal gdes are separated from the sea ocean by a barrier connected at least intermittently to the ocean by one or more restricted inlets kjerfve 1994 according to the most widely used classification these coastal lagoons can be classified into three categories including i choked ii restricted and iii leaky lagoons kjerfve 1994 these categories reflect the importance of interactions between coastal lagoons and seawater choked lagoon are connected to the sea by a single or few narrow and shallow entrances resulting in delayed and dampened tidal oscillation or low water exchange with the open sea leaky lagoons are connected by many entrances to the adjacent sea and are therefore characterized by almost unimpaired water exchange the stretch of coastal lagoon can greatly vary from 0 01 km2 to more than 10 000 km2 as is the size of the hydrological watersheds without an obvious proportionality relationship between the two table 1 if the mean depth can also vary coastal lagoons still remain shallow water environments generally characterized by shallow mean depth 2 m table 1 although rainfall pounding of surface flows or flooding are an important source of water for most of coastal gdes groundwater plays also a role in many coastal wetlands le maitre et al 1999 coastal gdes can be completely dependent on groundwater discharge whilst others may have limited dependence such as only under dry conditions howe et al 2007 thus depending on the hydrologic balance water bodies of coastal gdes could vary from coastal fresh water lake to a hypersaline lagoon the fauna and flora that make up coastal gdes are also very diverse the type of vegetation and wildlife is mainly defined by the salinity of the water and the moisture level of the environment permanent semi permanent or ephemeral wetlands but also the location and climate several thousand plant species grow in coastal wetlands such as reeds grasses and shrubs frieswyk and zedler 2007 lemein et al 2017 ramírez and álvarez 2017 hundreds of animal species can also be listed including fish reptiles mammals frogs and birds the degree of dependence of wildlife on coastal gdes ranges from those who need wetlands for part of their life cycle to those who are totally dependent on them the environmental importance of coastal gdes is greatly recognized for most of them as evidenced by the establishment of various protection or conservation status table 1 because of their relatively low flushing rates the important availability of nutrients allows high rates of primary production phytoplankton and aquatic plants thereby supporting high rate of secondary production fisheries nurseries compared to other aquatic ecosystems nixon 1995 coastal gdes contribute to the overall productivity of coastal waters by supporting a variety of habitats including salt marshes seagrasses or mangroves these habitats host specific and sensitive ecosystems and provide a rich support for biodiversity including vital habitats for many fish shellfish and bivalves basset et al 2013 they constitute also refuge from predation nursery and feeding habitats for estuarine marines and terrestrial species heck and thoman 1984 harris et al 2004 many coastal gdes support a variety of migratory water bird and shore bird species some birds depend on coastal gdes almost totally for breeding nesting feeding or shelter during their annual cycles the main migratory birds utilizing the coastal gdes are ducks shorebirds gulls terns and flamingos 2 2 ecosystem services and coastal gdes coastal gdes harbor a large part of the human population that depends directly on these ecosystems and provide not only livelihoods but also numerous benefits to human health and welfare newton et al 2014 2018 coastal gdes have therefore a socio economic interest which makes them complex social ecological systems newton et al 2014 wit et al 2017 since the 1970s and more particularly in the 2000s the concept of ecosystem services has attempted to express the complex relationship between human communities their environment and the non human living beings to which they are linked sartre et al 2014 the ecosystem services can be defined as the full range of benefits that humans derive from the functioning of ecosystems ecosystem services include 4 major types of services blanchart et al 2017 provisioning services correspond to direct products provided or produced by ecosystems such as water food construction materials regulating services include benefits from regulation of ecosystem processes such as carbon storage climate regulation flood and erosion protection cultural services include nonmaterial benefits from ecosystems such as recreation aesthetic or educational benefits supporting services are related to necessary factors for producing ecosystem services photosynthesis nutrient cycle refuge areas ecosystem services are linked to the ecological structure and functions of the environment in coastal gdes many ecosystem services are derived or supported by the presence of groundwater inflow because of its role in regulating the hydrology of wetlands and lagoons unep map unesco ihp 2015 one of the main ecosystem services provided by coastal gdes is related to provisioning services livestock fishing aquaculture unep map unesco ihp 2015 coastal gdes are highly productive and food provisioning can often be key for regional economy newton et al 2014 for example the ria formosa in portugal provided up to 90 of the national production of clams newton et al 2003 coastal gdes also have a very important place in the hydrological cycle they contribute to water flow regulation and control and therefore help to flood protection they also participate to water retention quality salinity regulation and purification finally cultural services e g cultural heritage tourism or aesthetics are also very profitable for several coastal gdes in some specific case such as the venice lagoon italy cultural services can exceed 5 108 euros year newton et al 2018 the various protection and or conservation status applied to coastal gdes table 1 does not necessarily involve a high level of knowledge of the hydrosystems behavior for a large majority the role and the dependence on groundwater is largely under studied even if it is suspected table 1 very few coastal lagoons have a sufficient level of knowledge to understand their level of dependence to groundwater table 1 and then developed sustainable methods policies to ensure their conservation moreover even in the case of good knowledge of hydrological functioning and establishment of a conservation protection status it does not seem to guarantee the good state of these environments leterme et al 2015 leruste et al 2019 the lack of hydrological knowledge then appears to be as much a problem as the lack of specific protection status adapted to the particular cases of the gdes 2 3 understanding the dependence on groundwater supplies under natural conditions without pumping fresh groundwater flows from recharge to discharge areas fig 2 local groundwater flow is mostly near the surface and over short distances i e from a higher elevation recharge area to an adjacent discharge area in this case the discharge of the aquifer fig 2 occurs as diffuse outflow as for coastal gdes coastal gdes are thus relying on the surface expression of groundwater richardson et al 2011 on a larger scale over long distances groundwater flow is preferentially at greater depths and fresh groundwater meets salt marine water at depth in the transition zone the discharge of groundwater is composed by two processes i the discharge of fresh groundwater fresh submarine groundwater discharge fsgd toward the sea and the discharge of saline groundwater recirculated submarine groundwater discharge rsgd fig 2 groundwater supplies to coastal gdes can originate from one or several aquifer formations of variable nature and extension table 1 this dependence on groundwater can be variable ranging from partial and infrequent dependence seasonal or episodic to total continual dependence hatton and evans 1998 groundwater and surface water are the most often characterized by strong interactions fig 2 these interactions result in groundwater discharge to the river groundwater discharge fig 2 or conversely in aquifer recharge through river and lake water infiltration fig 2 rivers and streams that flow all year perennially flowing are often groundwater dependent because a significant proportion of their daily flow is supported by the groundwater flow discharging into the river course acuña et al 2005 bonada and resh 2013 datry et al 2014 groundwater is particularly important in arid and semi arid regions and in case of extended dry periods during which evaporation markedly exceeds precipitation and surface water is scarce or even disappeared eamus et al 2006 both groundwater and surface water flow toward the lagoon which constitute the last collector of the watershed fig 2 the discharge of groundwater toward coastal gdes can be either directly into the wetland or indirectly via the river fig 2 for a long time groundwater studies in coastal areas focused mainly on seawater intrusion impacting coastal aquifers the groundwater has only recently been recognized as important contributors to hydrological and biogeochemical budgets of coastal environments such as coastal gdes table 1 johannes 1980 burnett et al 2001 2006 slomp and van cappellen 2004 moore 2006 2010 rodellas et al 2015 luo and jiao 2016 malta et al 2017 correa et al 2019 david et al 2019 the presence of groundwater drives the evolution persistence and resilience of coastal gdes and their ecosystems on at least two aspects including i physical characteristics such as the quantity location timing frequency and duration of groundwater supply jolly et al 2008 rodríguez rodríguez et al 2008 bertrand et al 2012 2014 and ii chemical characteristics burnett et al 2006 moore 2010 such as water quality ganguli et al 2012 salinity menció et al 2017 nutrient concentrations szymczycha et al 2012 ji et al 2013 rodellas et al 2015 hugman et al 2017 and temperature brown et al 2007 richardson et al 2011 although recognized as essential the characterization of coastal hydrosystems behavior still remains under studied in many cases table 1 due to the important monitoring and financial resources required to improve their understanding 2 4 groundwater dependence monitoring the groundwater dependence clearly expresses that the prolonged absence of groundwater as well as its quality degradation have a negative impact on the growth health composition structure and function of the ecosystem potential threats to groundwater inflow toward the coastal gdes can be assessed through the study of the groundwater flow paths the spatial and temporal variability of groundwater discharge and surface ground water interactions kløve et al 2011 yet the groundwater dependence of coastal gdes remains still difficult to characterize this difficulty is exacerbated by the thinness of the unsaturated zone i e the thickness of the soil between the soil surface and the top of the saturated zone which allows important mixing between surface and ground waters differentiating and quantifying the contribution of these end members is highly complex a wide range of methodologies have been developed to improve the understanding of coastal gdes sophocleous 2002 kalbus et al 2006 howe et al 2007 first of all the monitoring of groundwater levels and the establishment of piezometric map are often the first steps to highlight the groundwater dependence of coastal gdes sena and teresa condesso de melo 2012 then in the particular case of coastal gdes the two main approaches commonly used to assess surface ground water interaction are i temperature geochemical and isotopic tracers mudge et al 2008 santos et al 2008 schubert et al 2011 sánchez martos et al 2014 duque et al 2016 sadat noori et al 2016 dimova et al 2017 and ii numerical modeling de pascalis et al 2009 martínez alvarez et al 2011 sena and condesso de melo 2012 read et al 2014 menció et al 2017 less common approaches such as geophysical method can also be carried out to obtain information on the spatial scales and dynamics of the fresh water seawater interface the rates of coastal groundwater exchange and the total fresh water discharge dimova et al 2012 3 dominant human and climatic stressors on groundwater and consequences for coastal gdes in mediterranean regions although essential coastal gdes are one of the most threatened ecosystems in the world human activities are exerting increasing pressure on these sensitive systems or on the resources on which they depend such as groundwater water withdrawal drying pollution habitat destruction or overexploitation constitute the main causes of their degradation millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 more than 50 of wetlands have disappeared during the 20th century in some regions of australia and europe millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 only in the mediterranean basin national or sub national datasets suggest a probable loss of 50 of its wetlands perennou et al 2012 in the specific case of coastal wetlands global losses are estimated at between 64 and 71 during the 20th century gardner et al 2015 the characteristic overdevelopment of coastal mediterranean regions has already led for several decades to a significant pressure on groundwater resources the growing drinking industrial or agricultural water requirements tend to the overexploitation of the coastal aquifers coastal aquifers are threatened by both horizontal exchanges with seawater and vertical infiltrations of pollutants the development of human activities often constitutes an important source of pollutants and groundwater can constitute an important vector of pollution towards the coastal gdes moore 2006 3 1 the harmful human overdevelopment of coastal mediterranean regions the strong and increasing urbanization as well as fast growing demography represent the two main pressures for example in australia more than 85 of the population is living within 50 km of the sea the population density of australian s coastal areas increased by 14 between 2001 and 2009 from 3 75 hab km2 to 4 27 hab km2 fig 3 a a very important difference is observed for the urban coastal population the population density measured in coastal capital cities is 94 times higher than the average population density of coastal areas fig 3a in the mediterranean basin the coastal population grew from 95 million in 1979 to 143 million in 2000 and could reach 174 million by 2025 unep map 2012 table 2 in the mediterranean basin population france is the 3rd most populated country after turkey and egypt unep map 2012 and allows for a good observation of the attractiveness of the mediterranean coastline insee soes 2009 indeed among the 3 french coasts mediterranean atlantic and channel coasts the mediterranean coast is clearly distinguished by a rapid population growth fig 4 insee soes 2009 between 1960 and 2010 the french mediterranean coast recorded the highest population increase with 56 although it is the least extensive coastline fig 4 the highest growth of population rate is recorded in the mediterranean island of corsica with an annual increase of 1 3 between 2006 and 2010 the coastal municipalities accounting for 80 of the corsican population and 30 of the urbanization is concentrated within 1 km of the shoreline sdage 2015 in usa california tops the coastal populations chart currently of the total population of 39 6 million in california 69 is living in coastal areas u s census bureau 2019 and 95 is living in urban areas coastal population density is 3 times higher than the state population density fig 3b in less than 60 years coastal population density went up by a factor of 2 5 from 135 6 hab km2 in 1960 to 278 4 hab km2 in 2017 u s census bureau 2019 fig 3b in the major coastal cities such as san francisco and los angeles population density exceeds several thousand inhabitants per km2 in 2018 population density was 7003 hab km2 and 3230 hab km2 respectively this demographic growth is accompanied by a very fast development of urban infrastructure in the mediterranean basin the urbanization increased from 54 in 1970 to 66 in 2010 table 2 and the urban coastal population could increase by 33 million between 2000 and 2025 unep map 2012 the south and the east mediterranean countries non eu countries are urbanizing more rapidly than the rest of the world these that were essentially rural countries with average urbanization of 41 in 1970 will become urban countries with 66 urbanization by 2025 unep map 2012 this tendency is also observed in australia peri urban and rural cadastral parcels are progressively replaced by urban areas leading to an increased artificialization of coastal areas clark and johnston 2017 3 2 perturbations induced by groundwater degradation 3 2 1 reduction of groundwater inputs and coastal gdes dewatering the modification of fresh groundwater flowing to the lagoons disrupts the fragile balance of the coastal gdes ecosystems as surface water is limited and increasingly affected by pollution and eutrophication the exploitation of groundwater from coastal aquifers as a source of freshwater has become more intense bocanegra et al 2013 liu et al 2017 the number of groundwater abstraction infrastructures have drastically increased this process is the one most frequently exacerbated by unsuitable water resource management plans and or poor control of water extraction facilities unregulated but also illegal pumping draws a high and unreasoned amount of water which is uncountable in the water management policies and leads to groundwater depletion and reduce river spring and wetland flows the progressive lowering of the groundwater level reduces or removes the connections between the aquifer and the coastal gdes as a result aquatic vegetation in these transitional wetlands is gradually being replaced by terrestrial vegetation this process leads to the drying reduction and disappearance of coastal gdes in the worst case changes in the structure and the functioning of the ecosystem balasuriya 2018 pérez ruzafa et al 2019 results in a partial or total loss of ecosystem services provided by coastal gdes anthropogenic activities require a growing demand for space for agricultural production housing or industrial land use the land gain can be achieved by the conversion of natural lands or by partially or totally draining wetlands el asmar et al 2013 the construction of artificial drainage network in order to control the humidity is an old and relatively common practice gerakis and kalburtji 1998 avramidis et al 2014 these practices are highly constraining for the hydrosystems they drastically alter the natural flow of surface groundwater and greatly affect the coastal gdes which are relying on the surface expression of groundwater changes in land use can have a significant impact on aquifer recharge processes and thus on fresh groundwater supplies to coastal gdes infiltration is increasing with the proportion of bare soil and evapotranspiration s patterns are conditioned by the type and the stages of crops development soil compaction by urbanization or intensive agriculture may reduce the infiltration and enhance the surface runoff van den akker and soane 2005 gregory et al 2006 nawaz et al 2013 in addition the urban pavement of the shore el asmar et al 2013 makes the soil impermeable and drastically reduces infiltration and recharge into the aquifer 40 of the 46 000 km of mediterranean coast were already artificialized in 2000 and it is expected to exceed 50 by 2025 avitem 2018 if groundwater extraction is clearly the main threat in coastal mediterranean regions it is important to underline that increasing groundwater flow is also problematic some activities such as irrigation terracing land clearing or managed artificial recharge of aquifers can appreciably increase the permeability of upper soils and then lead to the increase of the aquifer recharge baudron et al 2014 in urban areas tap water leaks can also constitute a significant source of groundwater recharge minnig et al 2018 vystavna et al 2019 the flow of fresh water to the coastal gdes can therefore be significantly increased the physical and chemical disturbances can disturb and modify bio community structure of the coastal gdes 3 2 2 the role of groundwater as a vector of pollution coastal gdes often represent the last collector of water and their quality degradation results and reflects human activities over the watershed anthropogenic activities such as the demographic economic industrial and commercial development often introduce new potential contamination sources appelo and postma 2005 which infiltrate towards the aquifer in the coastal mediterranean regions the main problem is related to the sewage inputs the fast growing of urbanization is not always accompanied by the development of sewage infrastructures that results in less efficient treatment of urban wastewater and sewer leaks michael et al 2013 in the mediterranean basin almost 40 of coastal settlements with more than 2000 inhabitants do not have any wastewater treatment plant unep map 2012 this problem is especially exacerbated on the southern mediterranean basin due to the rapid growth of many coastal cities and towns in addition coastal mediterranean regions are privileged tourism destinations unep map 2012 the touristic flow picks lead to higher rates of sewage inputs in urban sewerage networks that are often aged and failing wastewater and associated pollutants from domestic and industrial sources consequently infiltrate towards the aquifer or through the interaction between groundwater and river water mccance et al 2018 erostate et al 2019 koelmans et al 2019 vystavna et al 2019 nitrogen pollutants phosphorus but also organic compounds and heavy metals are the most frequent contaminant affecting the groundwater resources wakida and lerner 2005 petrie et al 2015 xu et al 2019 the second main source of groundwater quality degradation is the agricultural activity the excess of nutrients from fertilizers nitrogen and phosphorus pesticides emerging compounds and less frequently pathogenic microorganisms related to agricultural activities contribute to the degradation of both ground and surface water quality symonds et al 2018 xin et al 2019 once infiltrated the pollutants follow the groundwater flow and can migrate to coastal gdes rapaglia 2005 knee and paytan 2011 jimenez martinez et al 2016 david et al 2019 according to the temporal dynamic of the aquifer groundwater can represent a direct short and or long term vector of pollution for coastal gdes groundwater with short residence times a few years into the aquifer will rapidly flow towards the lagoons carrying pollutants along its way in case of groundwater with long residence time several decades and if no remediation process occurs pollutants can be accumulated into the aquifer for several decades the currently observed groundwater contamination can therefore be the result of the legacy of pollution related to human activities previously developed over the watershed erostate et al 2018 this groundwater archiving capacity allows the storage of pollutants that will reach the coastal gdes in the future once the pollutants are in the coastal gdes prolonged groundwater residence times favor the accumulation of pollutants in water but also in aquatic organisms the progressive accumulation of pollutants especially heavy metals along the food chain can pose serious human health issues and greatly impact economical profit by deteriorating ecosystems services such as aquaculture and fisheries the most frequent impact of exceed in nutrients sediments and organic maters is the eutrophication which can lead to important degradation or loss of seagrass beds community structure and biodiversity national research council 2000 pasqualini et al 2017 more than 400 coastal areas have been identified worldwide as experiencing some form of eutrophication selman et al 2008 3 2 3 impacts of climate change on aquifer recharge and implications for coastal gdes important changes regarding the aquifer recharge in terms of timing duration and magnitude mccallum et al 2010 hiscock et al 2012 taylor et al 2013 as well as the storage and the quality of groundwater are expected in a context of climate variability these modifications will be more pronounced in arid regions and especially in the mediterranean basin considered as a hot spot of climate change ipcc 2014 by the middle to the end of the century the southern european regions as well as australia are expected to suffer from increasing arid conditions with longer and more frequent droughts stigter et al 2014 due to the increase in the temperature ducci and tranfaglia 2008 mccallum et al 2010 in evapotranspiration hiscock et al 2012 modification of seasonal patterns of precipitation polemio and casarano 2008 stigter et al 2009 barron et al 2011 and of average effective infiltration ducci and tranfaglia 2008 an amplification in the frequency and intensity of drought is also expected in the southern mediterranean basin such as in morocco stigter et al 2014 the results of predictive models to assess the impact of the climate change on aquifer recharge are often highly variable the main tendency highlights a decrease in the groundwater recharge in mediterranean regions leading to a significant loss of groundwater resources ipcc 2007 barron et al 2011 in the mediterranean basin the decrease of the recharge can reach 30 to up to 80 ducci and tranfaglia 2008 döll 2009 moseki 2017 modification in coastal aquifer recharge as well as the expected sea level rise hertig and jacobeit 2008 somot et al 2008 mastrandrea and luers 2012 can lead to the inland migration of the mixing zone between fresh and saline water climate change will exacerbate existing pressures rather than bring a new set of threats with the water requirements that are projected to increase under a drier climate severe water shortages can occur the outflow into the coastal gdes can be strongly reduced by the end of the century which could accelerate their drying up groundwater degradation by salinization could also greatly affect the physico chemical conditions and thus the ecosystem balance of the gdes lagoons in response to these treats a decrease in groundwater abstraction and an appropriate management appear as the principal way to ensure the preservation and sustainability of coastal gdes candela et al 2009 stigter et al 2014 there may be exceptions to this general trend at the local level in some cases the modification of rainfall patterns and or land uses modification can favor the recharge of the aquifer and improve the groundwater quality cartwright and simmonds 2008 crosbie et al 2010 santoni et al 2018 for example in the murray darling basin in australia the clearing of the native vegetation is likely to favor the infiltration and increase the recharge of 5 for future climate around 2030 crosbie et al 2010 if land clearing could favor the recharge the strong alteration of the hydrological cycle by vegetation cutting also has strong negative aspects which should be underlined among others things land clearing can increase runoff and streamflow favor soil erosion massive drainage of natural nutrients and salinization of soils and waters koivusalo et al 2006 cowie et al 2007 peña arancibia et al 2012 kaushal et al 2018 cheng and yu 2019 the consequences of these practices are often irreversible yet for watersheds severely degraded by salinization this increase in recharge could help the dilution and potentially improve quality of groundwater cartwright and simmonds 2008 the existence of local specificities shows the importance of establishing adaptive case by case water management strategies water resource management requires the definition of appropriate management scale which makes it possible to manage the hydrosystem as a whole taking into account the complexity of interactions between water bodies but also between humans and their environment 4 management strategies and current considerations for coastal gdes 4 1 from international environmental awareness to integrated water resource management the definition and establishment of water resources management strategies and policies result from an awareness of environmental issues initiated in the 1970s with in particular the stockholm earth summit in 1972 fig 5 a this ecological awakening then continued in the 1980s with a collective awareness of the existence of pollution and harmful disruption on a global scale it is in this context that the bruntland report define for the first time in 1987 the concept of sustainable development the sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs this report requires the management of water resources as a common heritage and lays the foundations for integrated natural resource management only 5 years later the rio earth summit marked a turning point in the sustainable management of water resources with the rediscovery of the concept of integrated water resource management iwrm petit 2006 and integrated coastal zone management iczm deboudt 2005 these two concepts which appeared in the 1970s deboudt 2005 petit 2006 were then highlighted in the 1990s through the media coverage of the rio earth summit and became a key concept in the 2000s thanks to the launch of the concept of sustainable development on the international political scene in 2000 the global water partnership an international network created to advance governance and management of water resources published its first s report on iwrm and clearly define the concept as a process which promotes the coordinated development and management of water land and related resources in order to maximize the resultant economic and social welfare in an equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems gwp 2000 the iwrm was and remains widely promoted by many international organizations or donor agencies rahaman and varis 2005 biswas 2008 as a strategic approach to water management meublat and le lourd 2001 the johannesburg earth summit in 2002 even recommended its implementation in all countries by 2005 this summit also insists on the establishment of iczm sharing the same precepts as iwrm iczm is nevertheless committed to taking into account the specific risks associated with water on the coast morel et al 2004 iczm is developing rapidly particularly in europe thanks to its institutionalization and recommendation of the council and the european parliament in 2002 ghézali 2009 although coastal gdes are in theory elements in their own right in integrated management strategies they are still too often forgotten and do not benefit from legal or managerial recognition to take their specificity into account cizel 2017 4 2 integrated groundwater management without specific regards for coastal gdes since the 2000s we have seen an acceleration of sustainable resource management measures at the global regional and national levels fig 5a gdes have been partially propagated in water management policies developed over the past two decades that recognize a link between groundwater and surface water some countries or group of countries particularly vulnerable to shortage of water and repeated severe droughts e g australia countries of the eu the united states california and south africa have yet incorporated specific reference to general gdes into the legislation even if the protection of gdes is included under water management policies the implementation of an appropriate management policy is often lacking rohde et al 2017 countries of the eu and australia are the first to have included gdes in their legislative framework rohde et al 2017 the french model of water management by water agencies created by the law of 1964 and the australian model derived from the experience of the murray darling basin murray darling basin authority created in 1987 are often considered as a reference model in terms of river basin management gwp riob 2009 brun and lasserre 2018 legislative framework and groundwater managerial strategies set up by the eu and australia however have shortcomings that undermine their effectiveness in protecting the resource fig 6 australia provides the most comprehensive groundwater governance ross 2016 as early as 1994 the agreement of the council of australian governments coag fig 5c required the development of a comprehensive system of water allocations and rights to ensure better more sustainable water management the water reform program initiated by the coag agreements was then updated in 2004 by developing a new national water initiative nwi fig 5c the nwi currently signed by all states and territories has been recognized as the national blueprint for water sector reform to improve the state of industry and provide long term environmental benefits willett 2009 the annually adjustable water entitlements and related water market provide a great flexibility and a better adaptability to the state of the resource ross 2016 however monitoring of groundwater quality is limited except for drinking water and is often carried out on a short term basis without consistent national program geoscience australia 2010 in europe on the other hand both the quantitative and qualitative aspects benefit theoretically from an equivalent level of attention the legislative framework implemented by the water framework directive of 2000 wfd fig 5b provides thus the most comprehensive groundwater protection european commission 2008 ross 2016 member states are required to preserved the groundwater quantity and quality based on threshold values established to prevent any significant diminution of the ecological or chemical quality of surface water nor in any significant damage to terrestrial ecosystems which depend directly on the groundwater body european directive 2000 60 ce the degree of freedom given to the member states to define groundwater and gdes management plans and the wide disparity between them can yet reduce the enforcement of eu recommendations liefferink et al 2011 while some countries are considered as models for their efficiency in water management such as france spain or germany rahaman and varis 2005 fig 5b and c others are experiencing significant delays in the transposition of the eu recommendations ghiotti 2011 in eu frameworks an important point of divergence is the concept of water bodies that supports the wfd this concept requires precise identification delimitation and definition however the scientific knowledge is often incomplete or inaccurate and fails to provide the appropriate level of precision bartout 2015 the lack of knowledge represents a significant bias for the definition of priority actions and the implementation of effective public policies to achieve the good qualitative and quantitative status set by the european recommendations maillet 2015 these two management models one based on strong qualitative regulation of the resource australia and the other on the monitoring of threshold values eu lead to significant disparities in gdes management in australia management decisions are based on an ongoing monitoring and research which help to establish an adaptive gdes management richardson et al 2011 rohde et al 2017 the great adaptability of annual water allocation allows a better consideration to the vulnerability of gdes particularly in a case of severe drought however the poor water quality monitoring exposes lagoons to high risks of undetected contamination efforts made for the qualitative management of the water resource clearly need to be completed and reinforced by an improvement of groundwater quality management to ensure the preservation of gdes ross 2016 in eu monitoring threshold values allows a better understanding and thus a better prevention of qualitative and quantitative degradation risks for gdes the groundwater allocation is often included in river basin plans of member states but the adaptability of water withdrawals particularly in the event of drought can lack reactivity and damage the gdes sommer et al 2013 stein et al 2016 to really benefit from the european directives particular attention must be paid to their concrete application in all member countries in addition the concept of water bodies must be better defined in order to enable the implementation of truly effective public policies in the particular case of coastal lagoons considered by the wfd as transitional water bodies the lack of knowledge and data in the early 2000s has triggered the development of monitoring networks implementation indeed the monitoring programs developed for freshwater ecosystems are not relevant for coastal gdes these transition environments are subject to many influences that induce a large variation in physical parameters including salinity the consideration of biological indicators and the evaluation of shifts in the species presence on coastal ecosystems has emerged as a valid strategy to characterize ecological status delpech et al 2010 pérez domínguez et al 2012 this approach followed in the same way by several eu countries has led to the creation of indicators validated by the eu to improve the assessment of the status of transitional water bodies in the north east atlantic le pape et al 2015 for the mediterranean region this work has yet to be completed currently only greece italy and france have developed classification tools but further developments are still needed to properly assess the ecological status of coastal lagoons le pape et al 2015 even if the groundwater resource management plans help to manage gdes specifics on gdes management are often lacking rohde et al 2017 coastal gdes form part of a continuum between continental and marine ecosystems and share common characteristics species and ecological functions pérez ruzafa et al 2010 inland and coastal waters must be managed as a whole and coordination at river basin and coastal sea levels is required pérez ruzafa and marcos 2008 the iwrm is generally focused on the inland watersheds but likely neglects coastal specificity conversely iczm focuses exceptionally on coastal areas however the coastal area rarely extends to the entire watershed which influences the quality and quantity of water resources that reach the coast the link between iwrm and iczm appears essential to respect the physical ecological and social continuum of watersheds and their coastal zones 4 3 limitations of the project based approach the iwrm does not automatically lead to the sustainability of resource uses although it is a prerequisite aubin 2007 the project based approach often applied in environmental protection makes it difficult to develop a coherent policy encouraged by cooperation projects several countries have tried to initiate the iwrm garnaud and rochette 2012 this is particularly the case in non eu countries such as morocco and algeria vecchio and barone 2018 the coastal gdes of nador morocco fig 5b constitutes a representative example garnaud and rochette 2012 since the 1970s coastal development has been announced as a priority by the moroccan government but there is no national public policy for coastal areas the growing development exerts a strong pressure on the coastal gdes classified as ramsar site nakhli 2010 the nador lagoon is thus the subject of a succession of projects fig 5b whose objective is to establish a sustainable management of this area garnaud and rochette 2012 to be sustainable resource management must yet be both based on previous actions and forward looking most often projects follow one another without taking into account previous results the standardized procedures proposed by donors do not sufficiently take into account the specificities of the territories the multiplicity of projects is often counterproductive and compromises the effectiveness of this environmental development assistance the succession of projects without convincing results ends up reducing the mobilization of local actors and users this generally too short term approach limits the involvement and appropriation of target actors this problem of appropriation is in addition to the problem of the limited funding period which threatens the sustainability of the actions undertaken garnaud and rochette 2012 by the end morocco s commitment to integrated coastal zone management advocated by the too short cap nador project from 2006 to 2008 finally found little support in these international collaborations garnaud and rochette 2012 5 better global understanding for a better management of gdes due to their complexity the development of management strategies adapted to coastal gdes is particularly complex because it requires a strong transdisciplinary approach scientists in the technical sciences at least hydrology ecology hydrogeology oceanography need to develop collaborative approach between them but also with social and legal scientists although difficult and slow to implement this transdisciplinary approach has two major advantages firstly it allows scientists to question their own discipline in particular by putting into perspective the relevance of their own concepts and methods then the development and construction of common methods and concepts results from a shared reflection these new concepts are thus more relevant because they come from a collaboration work and not from the interweaving of specificities borrowed from each discipline 5 1 improving the understanding of gdes the improvement of gdes management inevitably involves an increasing knowledge of their hydrogeological and ecological condition and processes iah 2016 this information is the most often unavailable and gaps at the intersection of groundwater hydrology and ecology do not facilitate the study of gdes tomlinson 2011 these gaps are even more important in the case of coastal gdes which require collaboration between terrestrial hydrology and marine sciences two epistemic communities that are not necessarily or very rarely used to working together in addition the implementation of the necessary monitoring systems to improve the understanding of gdes is often financially and technically expensive and or difficult to implement bowmer 2003 roll and halden 2016 improving the management of coastal gdes inevitably requires the management and understanding of hydraulic processes throughout the water cycle fresh and salt water to overcome the lack of knowledge about gdes eu countries and australian government and the scientific community have been working together to establish practical guides these gde practical guides can in theory assist state agencies in the identification and management of gdes for water management plans clifton 2007 richardson et al 2011 hinsby et al 2015 they offer a range of methods for determining ecosystem reliance to groundwater and help water managers conducting the necessary technical investigations and monitoring protocols to define ecological water requirements for gdes in practice these often complex guides seek data keys to understand all types of systems but each gde is an individual case having specific characteristics and behavior that prohibit any generalization of diagnoses and solutions the identification of appropriate study tools requires significant scientific support and the evaluation and monitoring of the relevance of the tools used is yet another debate generally the improving of knowledge depends on the strategic and economic interest of gdes assessed by the costs and benefits related to their protection millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 the ecosystem services approach of the united nations millennium ecosystem assessment project thus recommend to complete the technical approach of gdes by a relevant assessment of the gdes valuation and relationship between ecosystems and human well being while the evaluation of ecosystem services tends to highlight man s dependence on his environment this economist approach to nature raises two concerns firstly this new way of thinking about nature conservation places nature at the service of mankind dufour et al 2016 gdes are then considered as providers of valuable goods and services the diversity and complexity of the relationship between humans and nature cannot be summarized as a monetary evaluation exercise sartre et al 2014 moreover human societies had already understood the importance of coastal gdes and how to benefit from them well before the concept of ecosystem services was adopted secondly the economic assessment of gdes requires a clear definition of the benefits of these ecosystem services including direct fish and plant production water storage and purification and indirect values cultural aesthetic social reasons to the human population iah 2016 estimating the economic values of ecosystem services is far from easy recreation and tourism are the most easily quantifiable services firstly because the direct revenue they generate are easily quantifiable but also because they receive special attention due to the attractiveness of coastal gdes rolfe and dyack 2011 clara et al 2018 on the other hand essential services such as protection against erosion climate regulation or pollution control are neglected largely underestimated and or under studied due to the lack of available data barbier et al 2011 5 2 determining the appropriate management scale the watershed is considered as the most environmentally and politically relevant management unit this watershed based approach can contribute to reinforce the lack of consideration given to hidden groundwater resources while they are essential to establish an integrated management of gdes an appropriate management scale is a necessary first step for the sustainable management of supporting aquifers and of the coastal gdes vieillard coffre 2001 bertrand et al 2014 firstly surface and ground water are not constrained by the same geological boundaries the hydrogeological and hydrological watershed do not necessarily or rarely overlap affeltranger and lasserre 2003 the extension of an aquifer and the drained groundwater can extend well out of the boundaries defined by the hydrological basin human activities developed outside the hydrological basin can impact qualitatively and or quantitatively the groundwater resources flowing within the basin and or hydraulically connected a significant water supply demand gap can therefore be induced a broader consideration of a water supply area would allow a better assessment of the water resources actually available this approach would ensure a better allocation of water between human and ecosystem needs surface and groundwater have very different flow dynamics groundwater flow takes on average several years even centuries compared to a few days or a few weeks for river water fetter 2018 the capacity of recharge and renew is much longer their inertial behavior supports their capacity to accumulate the pollutants and to record the degradation caused by human activities over several decades section 3 2 2 the positive or negative effects of the land use planning made over the hydrological basin can take several decades or even centuries before being noticeable on groundwater quality and quantity boulton 2005 the notion of sustainability preached by iwrm can then be strongly questioned if the groundwater dynamics are not enough understood and or not considered by management strategies the existing hydraulic exchanges between the different water bodies and the vertical linkages are not always fully appreciated boulton 2000 part of the problem relates to the difficulties of assessing groundwater volumes recharge rates and sources but also to the low recognition of the linkages between groundwater and many surface water ecosystems boulton 2005 the qualitative and quantitative status of a water body has an impact positive or negative on all the water bodies connected it is then important to understand the existing relationships between the aquifer and all the other water bodies which means neighboring aquifers fresh surface water and brackish surface water more and more water resources managers are becoming familiar with the necessity of considering large spatial areas to establish a relevant water management boulton 2005 even if their perceptions of hydrologic interactions are often restricted to lateral and longitudinal flows pringle 2003 the importance of vertical connectivity is slowly being appreciated boulton 2000 a greater consideration of the ecological processes that support the proper functioning of the gdes is being given the study of the proper functioning areas of gdes would define the extension of the surrounding area that supports the ecological processes that ensure the sustainability and resilience of the wetland chambaud and simonnot 2018 it would take into account all the factors that contribute to the functioning of the gde i e water qualitative and quantitative supply but also animal species for which all or part of the life cycle occurs near the gde and the connectivity of the gde with other biodiversity reservoirs animal and plant populations 5 3 partnership appropriation and relevant definition of coastal gdes the efforts required to establish effective multi scale governance are not often sufficient to ensure the sustainable management of groundwater and gdes molle et al 2007 fig 7 several shortcomings already mentioned above partially explain these difficulties fig 7 the development of regional guidelines based on too approximate or minimalist knowledge of gdes inevitably leads to inconsistencies in management strategies at the local level coastal gdes often suffer from incomplete inappropriate or even contradictory definitions scientific definitions are sometimes in conflict with legal definitions and make the recognition and conservation of these environments more complex cizel and groupe d histoire des zones humides 2010 cizel 2017 coastal gdes are often recognized and grouped into the large family of wetlands a simplification that does not take into account their specificity consisting of a wetland a water body and an aquifer all hydraulically connected which must be recognized and managed as an inseparable whole improving the definition of coastal gdes is essential both to better understand and to delimit them but also to develop and to apply specific and appropriate protective legislative acts while the advancement of scientific knowledge and its better consideration at the regional level could be a way to improve the management of gdes a large part of the solution also seems to come from the local level at the local scale collaboration between water stakeholders for integrated resource management can be complicated mostert 2003 chanya et al 2014 the initial appropriation by state entities water agencies or basin organizations of the recommendations formulated by regional and national institutions often appears insufficient for the local implementation of adapted and sustainable management strategies fig 7 a real appropriation of existing regulations on coastal gdes by all local stakeholders decision makers and actors in the territory appears essential for the preparation of relevant planning or development documents and the implementation of appropriate action programs the elements required to define the challenges and perspectives related to gdes must not be a local adaptation of regional recommendations but rather a collective elaboration by all the actors concerned efforts must be made to develop a framework for effective public participation at six levels information education consultation involvement collaboration and capacity building das et al 2019 coastal aquifers are particularly vulnerable to water users conflicts zepeda quintana et al 2018 all water users want to be able to benefit from the quality and quantity of water resources they need no user can be abandoned in favor of another nor can the need for environmental waters environmental water needs cannot be forgotten and must be taken into account in management strategies sustainable water management thus requires water demand management which must be achieved through agreements and collaboration at an appropriate scale the establishment of a strong collaborative processes appears as the only way to guarantee the essential groundwater supply to coastal gdes and their sustainability boulton 2005 the management of coastal gdes must take into account its hydrological basin as well as its territorial water management unit and all territorial units important for its management i e tourist unit geographical unit air of influence of neighboring cities or migratory bird management mermet and treyer 2001 6 conclusion nowadays coastal mediterranean regions suffer from an over development of anthropogenic activities which strongly impact the groundwater resources and depending coastal gdes although some mediterranean regions have included the protection of gdes in their water management policies the implementation of an appropriate intergraded and collaborative management is often lacking and coastal gdes do not benefit from a particular status due to their complexity the preservation of coastal gdes is subject to the stability over time of fresh water supplies ground and surface water in sufficient quantity and quality however the determination of the qualitative and quantitative needs of coastal gdes is difficult to evaluate and each coastal gde is a unique case particular attention should therefore be paid to the characterization of environmental and ecological water requirements the hydrogeological knowledge about the management and behavior of coastal aquifers and gdes must be strengthened hydrogeology must be considered as an integral component of the coastal gdes and not a sub discipline of hydrology as is too often the case at present the inventory and characterization of coastal gdes must be improved through in depth systemic approaches to this end the coupling of hydrogeochemical and geophysical techniques which are inexpensive seem to constitute a relevant strategy these investigations must be supplemented by the identification and evolution of the sources of contamination present in the catchment areas in order to better understand the role of groundwater as a vector of pollution particular attention should be paid to the identification of the main groundwater discharge areas and the assessment of contaminant flows and loads the systematic mapping of groundwater vulnerability in the coastal areas must be promoted using methods accounting for both the intrinsic and specific vulnerability of groundwater this kind of data must help to develop land uses and human activities according to the groundwater vulnerability finally in the case of effective degradation processes restoration plans should be considered a reflection must be carried out for the definition of relevant indicators of the ecological coastal gdes status for these environments subject to high variabilities particularly in terms of salinity there is a necessity of developing sensitive indicators for monitoring ecological status biological indicators seem to be helpful but needs to be further and widely developed from a qualitative point of view the estimation of groundwater withdrawals is often very approximate because of the poor knowledge of the extraction points it seems essential to carry out an exhaustive inventory of wells and boreholes in the coastal gde watershed the implementation of retroactive measures for reporting private wells would also allow a better knowledge of the existing structures which are currently not recorded regularly monitored water quotas for private individuals could also be helpful for the qualitative management of the resource at present the lack of an appropriate definition for coastal gdes is a huge problem lack of discussion and consensus between lawyers and scientists does not facilitate the establishment of management strategies to be efficient this definition needs to be the result of a joint reflection between several disciplines as showed in this synthesis the transdisciplinary approach between hydrogeology hydrology social sciences and law is essential to fully understand the socio economic and environmental complexity of coastal gdes the inventory of coastal gdes characteristics could help to establish a complete and relevant definition of coastal gdes in addition to involve several discipline thoughts about coastal gdes definition need to be based on the mobilization of scientist lawyers but also water users and stakeholders information appropriation and collaboration are clearly strategic interdependent points to be developed local water users and managers must feel concerned by the problems related to coastal gdes to build appropriate and sustainable management plans without this process all possible efforts can be taken but their chances of achieving successful results will remain low the creation of permanent mechanisms such as water user groups or groundwater forums could be useful these moments of exchange and discussion would also allow managers and decision makers to better understand the role and benefits of coastal gdes indeed evaluation of the ecosystem services is essential for valuing the coastal gdes and decision makers at many levels are unaware of the connection between wetland condition and the provision of wetland services and consequent benefits for people all water resources in the coastal areas should be managed collectively and strategically in order to maximize use efficiency reduce water use conflicts and avoid over exploitation in other words the management strategy must consider the lagoon water body the surrounding wetland and groundwater as an inseparable set of communicating vessels whose nature of exchanges is subject to temporal and spatial variations in the global context of unprecedented anthropogenic pressures hydro food crises and climate change the consideration given to coastal gdes represents a key issue for the socio economic and environmental sustainable development of many coastal mediterranean areas integrated water management strategies that consider environmental needs on an equal footing with socio economic constraints within the coastal hydrosystem need to be improved the iczm is the management strategy that most considers water resources in the coastal zone and refers to coastal aquifers as such and specifies a monitoring requirement however despite the growing consideration for coastal aquifers there are still gaps it is important to continue to raise public awareness of coastal aquifers at the regional level and to integrate their specificities into coastal zone management strategies and plans collaboration between states or countries sharing of knowledge and technology facilitated by the creation of exchange material could also contribute to improving the integration of coastal aquifers into local guidelines and policies these practical suggestions could help for improving the management of coastal aquifers and coastal gdes in this way groundwater and coastal water gdes could really benefit from the optimal environmental conditions required to ensure their sustainability declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

18131,coastal lagoons deliver a wide range of valuable ecosystem goods and services these ecosystems that are often maintained by direct or indirect groundwater supplies are collectively known as groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes the importance of groundwater supplies is greatly exacerbated in coastal mediterranean regions where the lack of surface water and the over development of anthropogenic activities critically threaten the sustainability of coastal gdes and associated ecosystem services yet coastal gdes do not benefit from a legal or managerial recognition to take into account their specificity particular attention should be paid to the characterization of environmental and ecological water requirements the hydrogeological knowledge about the management and behavior of coastal aquifers and gdes must be strengthened these investigations must be supplemented by a stronger assessment of potential contaminations to develop local land uses and human activities according to the groundwater vulnerability the quantitative management of water resources must also be better supervised and or more constrained in order to ensure the water needs necessary to maintain coastal gdes the transdisciplinary approach between hydrogeology hydrology social sciences and law is essential to fully understand the socio economic and environmental complexity of coastal gdes priority must now be given to the development of an appropriate definition of coastal gdes based on a consensus between scientists and lawyers it is a necessary first step to develop and implement specific protective legislation and to define an appropriate management scale the investment and collaboration of local water users stakeholders and decision makers need to be strengthened through actions to favor exchanges and discussions all water resources in the coastal areas should be managed collectively and strategically in order to maximize use efficiency reduce water use conflicts and avoid over exploitation it is important to continue to raise public awareness of coastal aquifers at the regional level and to integrate their specificities into coastal zone management strategies and plans in the global context of unprecedented anthropogenic pressures hydro food crises and climate change environmental protection and preservation of coastal gdes represents a major challenge for the sustainable socio economic and environmental development of mediterranean coastal zones graphical abstract image 1 keywords coastal aquifer coastal hydrosystems mediterranean climate groundwater management anthropogenic impact 1 introduction coastal lagoons cover about 13 of the coastlines from arid to humid environments kjerfve 1994 being transitional areas from land to sea the water balance of coastal lagoons is resulting from both terrestrial fresh groundwater and surface water and marine water influences this dual influence allows the development of specific ecosystems that provide a wide range of ecosystem goods and services newton et al 2014 2018 over the past few decades several studies have highlighted the importance of groundwater in maintaining the physico chemical conditions of these sensitive ecosystems coastal lagoons and surrounding wetlands may then constitute groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes krogulec 2016 menció et al 2017 and are referred in the document as coastal gdes the importance of groundwater is further exacerbated in regions suffering from water stress when surface water is chronically unavailable groundwater inputs support or compensate for surface water inputs and play a vital role in maintaining coastal gdes this problem is encountered in a majority of coastal regions with an arid or semi arid mediterranean climate fig 1 köppen 1936 such as the mediterranean basin european union eu and non eu countries but also on the southwestern coasts of australia chile and the state of california united states and on the southern coast of south africa in these regions referred to throughout this document as mediterranean regions the lack of surface water is combined with a high anthropogenic pressure unep map 2012 population growth proceed together with the development and expansion of human activities such as urbanization agriculture tourism and industrial activities lotze et al 2006 increasing human water needs often lead to overexploitation of aquifers and or degradation of groundwater quality which present a risk both to the well being of human activities and to the freshwater needs of coastal gdes these degradations are expected to be worsen under the effects of climate change climatic disturbance in terms of increasing temperatures bille et al 2009 hallegatte et al 2009 global hydrological cycle ipcc 2014 and sea level rise fitzgerald et al 2008 carrasco et al 2016 benjamin et al 2017 should greatly affect the groundwater and coastal gdes this is true not only for the mediterranean basin considered as a hot spot of climate change but also for all the mediterranean regions since the 1990s and the rio de janeiro earth summit the conservation the maintenance of potentialities and the improvement of the ecological status of the coastal water bodies constitute a major concern nowadays a first statement can be made on the progress and limitations of groundwater management strategies and consideration given to coastal gdes in coastal mediterranean regions to this aim this review proposes to expose the specificities of coastal gdes and the key role of groundwater in their sustainable development highlight the vulnerability of coastal gdes to the socio economic development and climate conditions of mediterranean regions revise the consideration given to gdes and particularly to coastal gdes in the management policies of mediterranean regions and discuss their implication for the sustainability of coastal gdes 2 specificities and importance of coastal gdes 2 1 the wide diversity and essential functions of coastal gdes gdes are defined as ecosystems that require access to groundwater on a permanent or intermittent basis to meet all or some of their water requirement so as to maintain their communities of plants and animals ecological processes and ecosystem services richardson et al 2011 this definition clearly expresses the crucial role of groundwater in the functioning of gdes however the multitude of processes and services grouped under the terms ecological processes and ecosystem services does not necessarily make it possible to understand all the specificities and complexity inherent to certain types of gdes such as coastal gdes table 1 summarizes the morphologic and hydrological characteristics the hydrological knowledge and the protection and conservation status of 14 of the most studied lagoons present in mediterranean regions subject to mediterranean climate fig 1 newton et al 2018 pérez ruzafa and marcos 2008 the coastal gdes are distinguished by their diversity making each of them a special case this diversity is expressed on several levels from a morphological point of view water bodies of coastal gdes are separated from the sea ocean by a barrier connected at least intermittently to the ocean by one or more restricted inlets kjerfve 1994 according to the most widely used classification these coastal lagoons can be classified into three categories including i choked ii restricted and iii leaky lagoons kjerfve 1994 these categories reflect the importance of interactions between coastal lagoons and seawater choked lagoon are connected to the sea by a single or few narrow and shallow entrances resulting in delayed and dampened tidal oscillation or low water exchange with the open sea leaky lagoons are connected by many entrances to the adjacent sea and are therefore characterized by almost unimpaired water exchange the stretch of coastal lagoon can greatly vary from 0 01 km2 to more than 10 000 km2 as is the size of the hydrological watersheds without an obvious proportionality relationship between the two table 1 if the mean depth can also vary coastal lagoons still remain shallow water environments generally characterized by shallow mean depth 2 m table 1 although rainfall pounding of surface flows or flooding are an important source of water for most of coastal gdes groundwater plays also a role in many coastal wetlands le maitre et al 1999 coastal gdes can be completely dependent on groundwater discharge whilst others may have limited dependence such as only under dry conditions howe et al 2007 thus depending on the hydrologic balance water bodies of coastal gdes could vary from coastal fresh water lake to a hypersaline lagoon the fauna and flora that make up coastal gdes are also very diverse the type of vegetation and wildlife is mainly defined by the salinity of the water and the moisture level of the environment permanent semi permanent or ephemeral wetlands but also the location and climate several thousand plant species grow in coastal wetlands such as reeds grasses and shrubs frieswyk and zedler 2007 lemein et al 2017 ramírez and álvarez 2017 hundreds of animal species can also be listed including fish reptiles mammals frogs and birds the degree of dependence of wildlife on coastal gdes ranges from those who need wetlands for part of their life cycle to those who are totally dependent on them the environmental importance of coastal gdes is greatly recognized for most of them as evidenced by the establishment of various protection or conservation status table 1 because of their relatively low flushing rates the important availability of nutrients allows high rates of primary production phytoplankton and aquatic plants thereby supporting high rate of secondary production fisheries nurseries compared to other aquatic ecosystems nixon 1995 coastal gdes contribute to the overall productivity of coastal waters by supporting a variety of habitats including salt marshes seagrasses or mangroves these habitats host specific and sensitive ecosystems and provide a rich support for biodiversity including vital habitats for many fish shellfish and bivalves basset et al 2013 they constitute also refuge from predation nursery and feeding habitats for estuarine marines and terrestrial species heck and thoman 1984 harris et al 2004 many coastal gdes support a variety of migratory water bird and shore bird species some birds depend on coastal gdes almost totally for breeding nesting feeding or shelter during their annual cycles the main migratory birds utilizing the coastal gdes are ducks shorebirds gulls terns and flamingos 2 2 ecosystem services and coastal gdes coastal gdes harbor a large part of the human population that depends directly on these ecosystems and provide not only livelihoods but also numerous benefits to human health and welfare newton et al 2014 2018 coastal gdes have therefore a socio economic interest which makes them complex social ecological systems newton et al 2014 wit et al 2017 since the 1970s and more particularly in the 2000s the concept of ecosystem services has attempted to express the complex relationship between human communities their environment and the non human living beings to which they are linked sartre et al 2014 the ecosystem services can be defined as the full range of benefits that humans derive from the functioning of ecosystems ecosystem services include 4 major types of services blanchart et al 2017 provisioning services correspond to direct products provided or produced by ecosystems such as water food construction materials regulating services include benefits from regulation of ecosystem processes such as carbon storage climate regulation flood and erosion protection cultural services include nonmaterial benefits from ecosystems such as recreation aesthetic or educational benefits supporting services are related to necessary factors for producing ecosystem services photosynthesis nutrient cycle refuge areas ecosystem services are linked to the ecological structure and functions of the environment in coastal gdes many ecosystem services are derived or supported by the presence of groundwater inflow because of its role in regulating the hydrology of wetlands and lagoons unep map unesco ihp 2015 one of the main ecosystem services provided by coastal gdes is related to provisioning services livestock fishing aquaculture unep map unesco ihp 2015 coastal gdes are highly productive and food provisioning can often be key for regional economy newton et al 2014 for example the ria formosa in portugal provided up to 90 of the national production of clams newton et al 2003 coastal gdes also have a very important place in the hydrological cycle they contribute to water flow regulation and control and therefore help to flood protection they also participate to water retention quality salinity regulation and purification finally cultural services e g cultural heritage tourism or aesthetics are also very profitable for several coastal gdes in some specific case such as the venice lagoon italy cultural services can exceed 5 108 euros year newton et al 2018 the various protection and or conservation status applied to coastal gdes table 1 does not necessarily involve a high level of knowledge of the hydrosystems behavior for a large majority the role and the dependence on groundwater is largely under studied even if it is suspected table 1 very few coastal lagoons have a sufficient level of knowledge to understand their level of dependence to groundwater table 1 and then developed sustainable methods policies to ensure their conservation moreover even in the case of good knowledge of hydrological functioning and establishment of a conservation protection status it does not seem to guarantee the good state of these environments leterme et al 2015 leruste et al 2019 the lack of hydrological knowledge then appears to be as much a problem as the lack of specific protection status adapted to the particular cases of the gdes 2 3 understanding the dependence on groundwater supplies under natural conditions without pumping fresh groundwater flows from recharge to discharge areas fig 2 local groundwater flow is mostly near the surface and over short distances i e from a higher elevation recharge area to an adjacent discharge area in this case the discharge of the aquifer fig 2 occurs as diffuse outflow as for coastal gdes coastal gdes are thus relying on the surface expression of groundwater richardson et al 2011 on a larger scale over long distances groundwater flow is preferentially at greater depths and fresh groundwater meets salt marine water at depth in the transition zone the discharge of groundwater is composed by two processes i the discharge of fresh groundwater fresh submarine groundwater discharge fsgd toward the sea and the discharge of saline groundwater recirculated submarine groundwater discharge rsgd fig 2 groundwater supplies to coastal gdes can originate from one or several aquifer formations of variable nature and extension table 1 this dependence on groundwater can be variable ranging from partial and infrequent dependence seasonal or episodic to total continual dependence hatton and evans 1998 groundwater and surface water are the most often characterized by strong interactions fig 2 these interactions result in groundwater discharge to the river groundwater discharge fig 2 or conversely in aquifer recharge through river and lake water infiltration fig 2 rivers and streams that flow all year perennially flowing are often groundwater dependent because a significant proportion of their daily flow is supported by the groundwater flow discharging into the river course acuña et al 2005 bonada and resh 2013 datry et al 2014 groundwater is particularly important in arid and semi arid regions and in case of extended dry periods during which evaporation markedly exceeds precipitation and surface water is scarce or even disappeared eamus et al 2006 both groundwater and surface water flow toward the lagoon which constitute the last collector of the watershed fig 2 the discharge of groundwater toward coastal gdes can be either directly into the wetland or indirectly via the river fig 2 for a long time groundwater studies in coastal areas focused mainly on seawater intrusion impacting coastal aquifers the groundwater has only recently been recognized as important contributors to hydrological and biogeochemical budgets of coastal environments such as coastal gdes table 1 johannes 1980 burnett et al 2001 2006 slomp and van cappellen 2004 moore 2006 2010 rodellas et al 2015 luo and jiao 2016 malta et al 2017 correa et al 2019 david et al 2019 the presence of groundwater drives the evolution persistence and resilience of coastal gdes and their ecosystems on at least two aspects including i physical characteristics such as the quantity location timing frequency and duration of groundwater supply jolly et al 2008 rodríguez rodríguez et al 2008 bertrand et al 2012 2014 and ii chemical characteristics burnett et al 2006 moore 2010 such as water quality ganguli et al 2012 salinity menció et al 2017 nutrient concentrations szymczycha et al 2012 ji et al 2013 rodellas et al 2015 hugman et al 2017 and temperature brown et al 2007 richardson et al 2011 although recognized as essential the characterization of coastal hydrosystems behavior still remains under studied in many cases table 1 due to the important monitoring and financial resources required to improve their understanding 2 4 groundwater dependence monitoring the groundwater dependence clearly expresses that the prolonged absence of groundwater as well as its quality degradation have a negative impact on the growth health composition structure and function of the ecosystem potential threats to groundwater inflow toward the coastal gdes can be assessed through the study of the groundwater flow paths the spatial and temporal variability of groundwater discharge and surface ground water interactions kløve et al 2011 yet the groundwater dependence of coastal gdes remains still difficult to characterize this difficulty is exacerbated by the thinness of the unsaturated zone i e the thickness of the soil between the soil surface and the top of the saturated zone which allows important mixing between surface and ground waters differentiating and quantifying the contribution of these end members is highly complex a wide range of methodologies have been developed to improve the understanding of coastal gdes sophocleous 2002 kalbus et al 2006 howe et al 2007 first of all the monitoring of groundwater levels and the establishment of piezometric map are often the first steps to highlight the groundwater dependence of coastal gdes sena and teresa condesso de melo 2012 then in the particular case of coastal gdes the two main approaches commonly used to assess surface ground water interaction are i temperature geochemical and isotopic tracers mudge et al 2008 santos et al 2008 schubert et al 2011 sánchez martos et al 2014 duque et al 2016 sadat noori et al 2016 dimova et al 2017 and ii numerical modeling de pascalis et al 2009 martínez alvarez et al 2011 sena and condesso de melo 2012 read et al 2014 menció et al 2017 less common approaches such as geophysical method can also be carried out to obtain information on the spatial scales and dynamics of the fresh water seawater interface the rates of coastal groundwater exchange and the total fresh water discharge dimova et al 2012 3 dominant human and climatic stressors on groundwater and consequences for coastal gdes in mediterranean regions although essential coastal gdes are one of the most threatened ecosystems in the world human activities are exerting increasing pressure on these sensitive systems or on the resources on which they depend such as groundwater water withdrawal drying pollution habitat destruction or overexploitation constitute the main causes of their degradation millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 more than 50 of wetlands have disappeared during the 20th century in some regions of australia and europe millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 only in the mediterranean basin national or sub national datasets suggest a probable loss of 50 of its wetlands perennou et al 2012 in the specific case of coastal wetlands global losses are estimated at between 64 and 71 during the 20th century gardner et al 2015 the characteristic overdevelopment of coastal mediterranean regions has already led for several decades to a significant pressure on groundwater resources the growing drinking industrial or agricultural water requirements tend to the overexploitation of the coastal aquifers coastal aquifers are threatened by both horizontal exchanges with seawater and vertical infiltrations of pollutants the development of human activities often constitutes an important source of pollutants and groundwater can constitute an important vector of pollution towards the coastal gdes moore 2006 3 1 the harmful human overdevelopment of coastal mediterranean regions the strong and increasing urbanization as well as fast growing demography represent the two main pressures for example in australia more than 85 of the population is living within 50 km of the sea the population density of australian s coastal areas increased by 14 between 2001 and 2009 from 3 75 hab km2 to 4 27 hab km2 fig 3 a a very important difference is observed for the urban coastal population the population density measured in coastal capital cities is 94 times higher than the average population density of coastal areas fig 3a in the mediterranean basin the coastal population grew from 95 million in 1979 to 143 million in 2000 and could reach 174 million by 2025 unep map 2012 table 2 in the mediterranean basin population france is the 3rd most populated country after turkey and egypt unep map 2012 and allows for a good observation of the attractiveness of the mediterranean coastline insee soes 2009 indeed among the 3 french coasts mediterranean atlantic and channel coasts the mediterranean coast is clearly distinguished by a rapid population growth fig 4 insee soes 2009 between 1960 and 2010 the french mediterranean coast recorded the highest population increase with 56 although it is the least extensive coastline fig 4 the highest growth of population rate is recorded in the mediterranean island of corsica with an annual increase of 1 3 between 2006 and 2010 the coastal municipalities accounting for 80 of the corsican population and 30 of the urbanization is concentrated within 1 km of the shoreline sdage 2015 in usa california tops the coastal populations chart currently of the total population of 39 6 million in california 69 is living in coastal areas u s census bureau 2019 and 95 is living in urban areas coastal population density is 3 times higher than the state population density fig 3b in less than 60 years coastal population density went up by a factor of 2 5 from 135 6 hab km2 in 1960 to 278 4 hab km2 in 2017 u s census bureau 2019 fig 3b in the major coastal cities such as san francisco and los angeles population density exceeds several thousand inhabitants per km2 in 2018 population density was 7003 hab km2 and 3230 hab km2 respectively this demographic growth is accompanied by a very fast development of urban infrastructure in the mediterranean basin the urbanization increased from 54 in 1970 to 66 in 2010 table 2 and the urban coastal population could increase by 33 million between 2000 and 2025 unep map 2012 the south and the east mediterranean countries non eu countries are urbanizing more rapidly than the rest of the world these that were essentially rural countries with average urbanization of 41 in 1970 will become urban countries with 66 urbanization by 2025 unep map 2012 this tendency is also observed in australia peri urban and rural cadastral parcels are progressively replaced by urban areas leading to an increased artificialization of coastal areas clark and johnston 2017 3 2 perturbations induced by groundwater degradation 3 2 1 reduction of groundwater inputs and coastal gdes dewatering the modification of fresh groundwater flowing to the lagoons disrupts the fragile balance of the coastal gdes ecosystems as surface water is limited and increasingly affected by pollution and eutrophication the exploitation of groundwater from coastal aquifers as a source of freshwater has become more intense bocanegra et al 2013 liu et al 2017 the number of groundwater abstraction infrastructures have drastically increased this process is the one most frequently exacerbated by unsuitable water resource management plans and or poor control of water extraction facilities unregulated but also illegal pumping draws a high and unreasoned amount of water which is uncountable in the water management policies and leads to groundwater depletion and reduce river spring and wetland flows the progressive lowering of the groundwater level reduces or removes the connections between the aquifer and the coastal gdes as a result aquatic vegetation in these transitional wetlands is gradually being replaced by terrestrial vegetation this process leads to the drying reduction and disappearance of coastal gdes in the worst case changes in the structure and the functioning of the ecosystem balasuriya 2018 pérez ruzafa et al 2019 results in a partial or total loss of ecosystem services provided by coastal gdes anthropogenic activities require a growing demand for space for agricultural production housing or industrial land use the land gain can be achieved by the conversion of natural lands or by partially or totally draining wetlands el asmar et al 2013 the construction of artificial drainage network in order to control the humidity is an old and relatively common practice gerakis and kalburtji 1998 avramidis et al 2014 these practices are highly constraining for the hydrosystems they drastically alter the natural flow of surface groundwater and greatly affect the coastal gdes which are relying on the surface expression of groundwater changes in land use can have a significant impact on aquifer recharge processes and thus on fresh groundwater supplies to coastal gdes infiltration is increasing with the proportion of bare soil and evapotranspiration s patterns are conditioned by the type and the stages of crops development soil compaction by urbanization or intensive agriculture may reduce the infiltration and enhance the surface runoff van den akker and soane 2005 gregory et al 2006 nawaz et al 2013 in addition the urban pavement of the shore el asmar et al 2013 makes the soil impermeable and drastically reduces infiltration and recharge into the aquifer 40 of the 46 000 km of mediterranean coast were already artificialized in 2000 and it is expected to exceed 50 by 2025 avitem 2018 if groundwater extraction is clearly the main threat in coastal mediterranean regions it is important to underline that increasing groundwater flow is also problematic some activities such as irrigation terracing land clearing or managed artificial recharge of aquifers can appreciably increase the permeability of upper soils and then lead to the increase of the aquifer recharge baudron et al 2014 in urban areas tap water leaks can also constitute a significant source of groundwater recharge minnig et al 2018 vystavna et al 2019 the flow of fresh water to the coastal gdes can therefore be significantly increased the physical and chemical disturbances can disturb and modify bio community structure of the coastal gdes 3 2 2 the role of groundwater as a vector of pollution coastal gdes often represent the last collector of water and their quality degradation results and reflects human activities over the watershed anthropogenic activities such as the demographic economic industrial and commercial development often introduce new potential contamination sources appelo and postma 2005 which infiltrate towards the aquifer in the coastal mediterranean regions the main problem is related to the sewage inputs the fast growing of urbanization is not always accompanied by the development of sewage infrastructures that results in less efficient treatment of urban wastewater and sewer leaks michael et al 2013 in the mediterranean basin almost 40 of coastal settlements with more than 2000 inhabitants do not have any wastewater treatment plant unep map 2012 this problem is especially exacerbated on the southern mediterranean basin due to the rapid growth of many coastal cities and towns in addition coastal mediterranean regions are privileged tourism destinations unep map 2012 the touristic flow picks lead to higher rates of sewage inputs in urban sewerage networks that are often aged and failing wastewater and associated pollutants from domestic and industrial sources consequently infiltrate towards the aquifer or through the interaction between groundwater and river water mccance et al 2018 erostate et al 2019 koelmans et al 2019 vystavna et al 2019 nitrogen pollutants phosphorus but also organic compounds and heavy metals are the most frequent contaminant affecting the groundwater resources wakida and lerner 2005 petrie et al 2015 xu et al 2019 the second main source of groundwater quality degradation is the agricultural activity the excess of nutrients from fertilizers nitrogen and phosphorus pesticides emerging compounds and less frequently pathogenic microorganisms related to agricultural activities contribute to the degradation of both ground and surface water quality symonds et al 2018 xin et al 2019 once infiltrated the pollutants follow the groundwater flow and can migrate to coastal gdes rapaglia 2005 knee and paytan 2011 jimenez martinez et al 2016 david et al 2019 according to the temporal dynamic of the aquifer groundwater can represent a direct short and or long term vector of pollution for coastal gdes groundwater with short residence times a few years into the aquifer will rapidly flow towards the lagoons carrying pollutants along its way in case of groundwater with long residence time several decades and if no remediation process occurs pollutants can be accumulated into the aquifer for several decades the currently observed groundwater contamination can therefore be the result of the legacy of pollution related to human activities previously developed over the watershed erostate et al 2018 this groundwater archiving capacity allows the storage of pollutants that will reach the coastal gdes in the future once the pollutants are in the coastal gdes prolonged groundwater residence times favor the accumulation of pollutants in water but also in aquatic organisms the progressive accumulation of pollutants especially heavy metals along the food chain can pose serious human health issues and greatly impact economical profit by deteriorating ecosystems services such as aquaculture and fisheries the most frequent impact of exceed in nutrients sediments and organic maters is the eutrophication which can lead to important degradation or loss of seagrass beds community structure and biodiversity national research council 2000 pasqualini et al 2017 more than 400 coastal areas have been identified worldwide as experiencing some form of eutrophication selman et al 2008 3 2 3 impacts of climate change on aquifer recharge and implications for coastal gdes important changes regarding the aquifer recharge in terms of timing duration and magnitude mccallum et al 2010 hiscock et al 2012 taylor et al 2013 as well as the storage and the quality of groundwater are expected in a context of climate variability these modifications will be more pronounced in arid regions and especially in the mediterranean basin considered as a hot spot of climate change ipcc 2014 by the middle to the end of the century the southern european regions as well as australia are expected to suffer from increasing arid conditions with longer and more frequent droughts stigter et al 2014 due to the increase in the temperature ducci and tranfaglia 2008 mccallum et al 2010 in evapotranspiration hiscock et al 2012 modification of seasonal patterns of precipitation polemio and casarano 2008 stigter et al 2009 barron et al 2011 and of average effective infiltration ducci and tranfaglia 2008 an amplification in the frequency and intensity of drought is also expected in the southern mediterranean basin such as in morocco stigter et al 2014 the results of predictive models to assess the impact of the climate change on aquifer recharge are often highly variable the main tendency highlights a decrease in the groundwater recharge in mediterranean regions leading to a significant loss of groundwater resources ipcc 2007 barron et al 2011 in the mediterranean basin the decrease of the recharge can reach 30 to up to 80 ducci and tranfaglia 2008 döll 2009 moseki 2017 modification in coastal aquifer recharge as well as the expected sea level rise hertig and jacobeit 2008 somot et al 2008 mastrandrea and luers 2012 can lead to the inland migration of the mixing zone between fresh and saline water climate change will exacerbate existing pressures rather than bring a new set of threats with the water requirements that are projected to increase under a drier climate severe water shortages can occur the outflow into the coastal gdes can be strongly reduced by the end of the century which could accelerate their drying up groundwater degradation by salinization could also greatly affect the physico chemical conditions and thus the ecosystem balance of the gdes lagoons in response to these treats a decrease in groundwater abstraction and an appropriate management appear as the principal way to ensure the preservation and sustainability of coastal gdes candela et al 2009 stigter et al 2014 there may be exceptions to this general trend at the local level in some cases the modification of rainfall patterns and or land uses modification can favor the recharge of the aquifer and improve the groundwater quality cartwright and simmonds 2008 crosbie et al 2010 santoni et al 2018 for example in the murray darling basin in australia the clearing of the native vegetation is likely to favor the infiltration and increase the recharge of 5 for future climate around 2030 crosbie et al 2010 if land clearing could favor the recharge the strong alteration of the hydrological cycle by vegetation cutting also has strong negative aspects which should be underlined among others things land clearing can increase runoff and streamflow favor soil erosion massive drainage of natural nutrients and salinization of soils and waters koivusalo et al 2006 cowie et al 2007 peña arancibia et al 2012 kaushal et al 2018 cheng and yu 2019 the consequences of these practices are often irreversible yet for watersheds severely degraded by salinization this increase in recharge could help the dilution and potentially improve quality of groundwater cartwright and simmonds 2008 the existence of local specificities shows the importance of establishing adaptive case by case water management strategies water resource management requires the definition of appropriate management scale which makes it possible to manage the hydrosystem as a whole taking into account the complexity of interactions between water bodies but also between humans and their environment 4 management strategies and current considerations for coastal gdes 4 1 from international environmental awareness to integrated water resource management the definition and establishment of water resources management strategies and policies result from an awareness of environmental issues initiated in the 1970s with in particular the stockholm earth summit in 1972 fig 5 a this ecological awakening then continued in the 1980s with a collective awareness of the existence of pollution and harmful disruption on a global scale it is in this context that the bruntland report define for the first time in 1987 the concept of sustainable development the sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs this report requires the management of water resources as a common heritage and lays the foundations for integrated natural resource management only 5 years later the rio earth summit marked a turning point in the sustainable management of water resources with the rediscovery of the concept of integrated water resource management iwrm petit 2006 and integrated coastal zone management iczm deboudt 2005 these two concepts which appeared in the 1970s deboudt 2005 petit 2006 were then highlighted in the 1990s through the media coverage of the rio earth summit and became a key concept in the 2000s thanks to the launch of the concept of sustainable development on the international political scene in 2000 the global water partnership an international network created to advance governance and management of water resources published its first s report on iwrm and clearly define the concept as a process which promotes the coordinated development and management of water land and related resources in order to maximize the resultant economic and social welfare in an equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems gwp 2000 the iwrm was and remains widely promoted by many international organizations or donor agencies rahaman and varis 2005 biswas 2008 as a strategic approach to water management meublat and le lourd 2001 the johannesburg earth summit in 2002 even recommended its implementation in all countries by 2005 this summit also insists on the establishment of iczm sharing the same precepts as iwrm iczm is nevertheless committed to taking into account the specific risks associated with water on the coast morel et al 2004 iczm is developing rapidly particularly in europe thanks to its institutionalization and recommendation of the council and the european parliament in 2002 ghézali 2009 although coastal gdes are in theory elements in their own right in integrated management strategies they are still too often forgotten and do not benefit from legal or managerial recognition to take their specificity into account cizel 2017 4 2 integrated groundwater management without specific regards for coastal gdes since the 2000s we have seen an acceleration of sustainable resource management measures at the global regional and national levels fig 5a gdes have been partially propagated in water management policies developed over the past two decades that recognize a link between groundwater and surface water some countries or group of countries particularly vulnerable to shortage of water and repeated severe droughts e g australia countries of the eu the united states california and south africa have yet incorporated specific reference to general gdes into the legislation even if the protection of gdes is included under water management policies the implementation of an appropriate management policy is often lacking rohde et al 2017 countries of the eu and australia are the first to have included gdes in their legislative framework rohde et al 2017 the french model of water management by water agencies created by the law of 1964 and the australian model derived from the experience of the murray darling basin murray darling basin authority created in 1987 are often considered as a reference model in terms of river basin management gwp riob 2009 brun and lasserre 2018 legislative framework and groundwater managerial strategies set up by the eu and australia however have shortcomings that undermine their effectiveness in protecting the resource fig 6 australia provides the most comprehensive groundwater governance ross 2016 as early as 1994 the agreement of the council of australian governments coag fig 5c required the development of a comprehensive system of water allocations and rights to ensure better more sustainable water management the water reform program initiated by the coag agreements was then updated in 2004 by developing a new national water initiative nwi fig 5c the nwi currently signed by all states and territories has been recognized as the national blueprint for water sector reform to improve the state of industry and provide long term environmental benefits willett 2009 the annually adjustable water entitlements and related water market provide a great flexibility and a better adaptability to the state of the resource ross 2016 however monitoring of groundwater quality is limited except for drinking water and is often carried out on a short term basis without consistent national program geoscience australia 2010 in europe on the other hand both the quantitative and qualitative aspects benefit theoretically from an equivalent level of attention the legislative framework implemented by the water framework directive of 2000 wfd fig 5b provides thus the most comprehensive groundwater protection european commission 2008 ross 2016 member states are required to preserved the groundwater quantity and quality based on threshold values established to prevent any significant diminution of the ecological or chemical quality of surface water nor in any significant damage to terrestrial ecosystems which depend directly on the groundwater body european directive 2000 60 ce the degree of freedom given to the member states to define groundwater and gdes management plans and the wide disparity between them can yet reduce the enforcement of eu recommendations liefferink et al 2011 while some countries are considered as models for their efficiency in water management such as france spain or germany rahaman and varis 2005 fig 5b and c others are experiencing significant delays in the transposition of the eu recommendations ghiotti 2011 in eu frameworks an important point of divergence is the concept of water bodies that supports the wfd this concept requires precise identification delimitation and definition however the scientific knowledge is often incomplete or inaccurate and fails to provide the appropriate level of precision bartout 2015 the lack of knowledge represents a significant bias for the definition of priority actions and the implementation of effective public policies to achieve the good qualitative and quantitative status set by the european recommendations maillet 2015 these two management models one based on strong qualitative regulation of the resource australia and the other on the monitoring of threshold values eu lead to significant disparities in gdes management in australia management decisions are based on an ongoing monitoring and research which help to establish an adaptive gdes management richardson et al 2011 rohde et al 2017 the great adaptability of annual water allocation allows a better consideration to the vulnerability of gdes particularly in a case of severe drought however the poor water quality monitoring exposes lagoons to high risks of undetected contamination efforts made for the qualitative management of the water resource clearly need to be completed and reinforced by an improvement of groundwater quality management to ensure the preservation of gdes ross 2016 in eu monitoring threshold values allows a better understanding and thus a better prevention of qualitative and quantitative degradation risks for gdes the groundwater allocation is often included in river basin plans of member states but the adaptability of water withdrawals particularly in the event of drought can lack reactivity and damage the gdes sommer et al 2013 stein et al 2016 to really benefit from the european directives particular attention must be paid to their concrete application in all member countries in addition the concept of water bodies must be better defined in order to enable the implementation of truly effective public policies in the particular case of coastal lagoons considered by the wfd as transitional water bodies the lack of knowledge and data in the early 2000s has triggered the development of monitoring networks implementation indeed the monitoring programs developed for freshwater ecosystems are not relevant for coastal gdes these transition environments are subject to many influences that induce a large variation in physical parameters including salinity the consideration of biological indicators and the evaluation of shifts in the species presence on coastal ecosystems has emerged as a valid strategy to characterize ecological status delpech et al 2010 pérez domínguez et al 2012 this approach followed in the same way by several eu countries has led to the creation of indicators validated by the eu to improve the assessment of the status of transitional water bodies in the north east atlantic le pape et al 2015 for the mediterranean region this work has yet to be completed currently only greece italy and france have developed classification tools but further developments are still needed to properly assess the ecological status of coastal lagoons le pape et al 2015 even if the groundwater resource management plans help to manage gdes specifics on gdes management are often lacking rohde et al 2017 coastal gdes form part of a continuum between continental and marine ecosystems and share common characteristics species and ecological functions pérez ruzafa et al 2010 inland and coastal waters must be managed as a whole and coordination at river basin and coastal sea levels is required pérez ruzafa and marcos 2008 the iwrm is generally focused on the inland watersheds but likely neglects coastal specificity conversely iczm focuses exceptionally on coastal areas however the coastal area rarely extends to the entire watershed which influences the quality and quantity of water resources that reach the coast the link between iwrm and iczm appears essential to respect the physical ecological and social continuum of watersheds and their coastal zones 4 3 limitations of the project based approach the iwrm does not automatically lead to the sustainability of resource uses although it is a prerequisite aubin 2007 the project based approach often applied in environmental protection makes it difficult to develop a coherent policy encouraged by cooperation projects several countries have tried to initiate the iwrm garnaud and rochette 2012 this is particularly the case in non eu countries such as morocco and algeria vecchio and barone 2018 the coastal gdes of nador morocco fig 5b constitutes a representative example garnaud and rochette 2012 since the 1970s coastal development has been announced as a priority by the moroccan government but there is no national public policy for coastal areas the growing development exerts a strong pressure on the coastal gdes classified as ramsar site nakhli 2010 the nador lagoon is thus the subject of a succession of projects fig 5b whose objective is to establish a sustainable management of this area garnaud and rochette 2012 to be sustainable resource management must yet be both based on previous actions and forward looking most often projects follow one another without taking into account previous results the standardized procedures proposed by donors do not sufficiently take into account the specificities of the territories the multiplicity of projects is often counterproductive and compromises the effectiveness of this environmental development assistance the succession of projects without convincing results ends up reducing the mobilization of local actors and users this generally too short term approach limits the involvement and appropriation of target actors this problem of appropriation is in addition to the problem of the limited funding period which threatens the sustainability of the actions undertaken garnaud and rochette 2012 by the end morocco s commitment to integrated coastal zone management advocated by the too short cap nador project from 2006 to 2008 finally found little support in these international collaborations garnaud and rochette 2012 5 better global understanding for a better management of gdes due to their complexity the development of management strategies adapted to coastal gdes is particularly complex because it requires a strong transdisciplinary approach scientists in the technical sciences at least hydrology ecology hydrogeology oceanography need to develop collaborative approach between them but also with social and legal scientists although difficult and slow to implement this transdisciplinary approach has two major advantages firstly it allows scientists to question their own discipline in particular by putting into perspective the relevance of their own concepts and methods then the development and construction of common methods and concepts results from a shared reflection these new concepts are thus more relevant because they come from a collaboration work and not from the interweaving of specificities borrowed from each discipline 5 1 improving the understanding of gdes the improvement of gdes management inevitably involves an increasing knowledge of their hydrogeological and ecological condition and processes iah 2016 this information is the most often unavailable and gaps at the intersection of groundwater hydrology and ecology do not facilitate the study of gdes tomlinson 2011 these gaps are even more important in the case of coastal gdes which require collaboration between terrestrial hydrology and marine sciences two epistemic communities that are not necessarily or very rarely used to working together in addition the implementation of the necessary monitoring systems to improve the understanding of gdes is often financially and technically expensive and or difficult to implement bowmer 2003 roll and halden 2016 improving the management of coastal gdes inevitably requires the management and understanding of hydraulic processes throughout the water cycle fresh and salt water to overcome the lack of knowledge about gdes eu countries and australian government and the scientific community have been working together to establish practical guides these gde practical guides can in theory assist state agencies in the identification and management of gdes for water management plans clifton 2007 richardson et al 2011 hinsby et al 2015 they offer a range of methods for determining ecosystem reliance to groundwater and help water managers conducting the necessary technical investigations and monitoring protocols to define ecological water requirements for gdes in practice these often complex guides seek data keys to understand all types of systems but each gde is an individual case having specific characteristics and behavior that prohibit any generalization of diagnoses and solutions the identification of appropriate study tools requires significant scientific support and the evaluation and monitoring of the relevance of the tools used is yet another debate generally the improving of knowledge depends on the strategic and economic interest of gdes assessed by the costs and benefits related to their protection millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 the ecosystem services approach of the united nations millennium ecosystem assessment project thus recommend to complete the technical approach of gdes by a relevant assessment of the gdes valuation and relationship between ecosystems and human well being while the evaluation of ecosystem services tends to highlight man s dependence on his environment this economist approach to nature raises two concerns firstly this new way of thinking about nature conservation places nature at the service of mankind dufour et al 2016 gdes are then considered as providers of valuable goods and services the diversity and complexity of the relationship between humans and nature cannot be summarized as a monetary evaluation exercise sartre et al 2014 moreover human societies had already understood the importance of coastal gdes and how to benefit from them well before the concept of ecosystem services was adopted secondly the economic assessment of gdes requires a clear definition of the benefits of these ecosystem services including direct fish and plant production water storage and purification and indirect values cultural aesthetic social reasons to the human population iah 2016 estimating the economic values of ecosystem services is far from easy recreation and tourism are the most easily quantifiable services firstly because the direct revenue they generate are easily quantifiable but also because they receive special attention due to the attractiveness of coastal gdes rolfe and dyack 2011 clara et al 2018 on the other hand essential services such as protection against erosion climate regulation or pollution control are neglected largely underestimated and or under studied due to the lack of available data barbier et al 2011 5 2 determining the appropriate management scale the watershed is considered as the most environmentally and politically relevant management unit this watershed based approach can contribute to reinforce the lack of consideration given to hidden groundwater resources while they are essential to establish an integrated management of gdes an appropriate management scale is a necessary first step for the sustainable management of supporting aquifers and of the coastal gdes vieillard coffre 2001 bertrand et al 2014 firstly surface and ground water are not constrained by the same geological boundaries the hydrogeological and hydrological watershed do not necessarily or rarely overlap affeltranger and lasserre 2003 the extension of an aquifer and the drained groundwater can extend well out of the boundaries defined by the hydrological basin human activities developed outside the hydrological basin can impact qualitatively and or quantitatively the groundwater resources flowing within the basin and or hydraulically connected a significant water supply demand gap can therefore be induced a broader consideration of a water supply area would allow a better assessment of the water resources actually available this approach would ensure a better allocation of water between human and ecosystem needs surface and groundwater have very different flow dynamics groundwater flow takes on average several years even centuries compared to a few days or a few weeks for river water fetter 2018 the capacity of recharge and renew is much longer their inertial behavior supports their capacity to accumulate the pollutants and to record the degradation caused by human activities over several decades section 3 2 2 the positive or negative effects of the land use planning made over the hydrological basin can take several decades or even centuries before being noticeable on groundwater quality and quantity boulton 2005 the notion of sustainability preached by iwrm can then be strongly questioned if the groundwater dynamics are not enough understood and or not considered by management strategies the existing hydraulic exchanges between the different water bodies and the vertical linkages are not always fully appreciated boulton 2000 part of the problem relates to the difficulties of assessing groundwater volumes recharge rates and sources but also to the low recognition of the linkages between groundwater and many surface water ecosystems boulton 2005 the qualitative and quantitative status of a water body has an impact positive or negative on all the water bodies connected it is then important to understand the existing relationships between the aquifer and all the other water bodies which means neighboring aquifers fresh surface water and brackish surface water more and more water resources managers are becoming familiar with the necessity of considering large spatial areas to establish a relevant water management boulton 2005 even if their perceptions of hydrologic interactions are often restricted to lateral and longitudinal flows pringle 2003 the importance of vertical connectivity is slowly being appreciated boulton 2000 a greater consideration of the ecological processes that support the proper functioning of the gdes is being given the study of the proper functioning areas of gdes would define the extension of the surrounding area that supports the ecological processes that ensure the sustainability and resilience of the wetland chambaud and simonnot 2018 it would take into account all the factors that contribute to the functioning of the gde i e water qualitative and quantitative supply but also animal species for which all or part of the life cycle occurs near the gde and the connectivity of the gde with other biodiversity reservoirs animal and plant populations 5 3 partnership appropriation and relevant definition of coastal gdes the efforts required to establish effective multi scale governance are not often sufficient to ensure the sustainable management of groundwater and gdes molle et al 2007 fig 7 several shortcomings already mentioned above partially explain these difficulties fig 7 the development of regional guidelines based on too approximate or minimalist knowledge of gdes inevitably leads to inconsistencies in management strategies at the local level coastal gdes often suffer from incomplete inappropriate or even contradictory definitions scientific definitions are sometimes in conflict with legal definitions and make the recognition and conservation of these environments more complex cizel and groupe d histoire des zones humides 2010 cizel 2017 coastal gdes are often recognized and grouped into the large family of wetlands a simplification that does not take into account their specificity consisting of a wetland a water body and an aquifer all hydraulically connected which must be recognized and managed as an inseparable whole improving the definition of coastal gdes is essential both to better understand and to delimit them but also to develop and to apply specific and appropriate protective legislative acts while the advancement of scientific knowledge and its better consideration at the regional level could be a way to improve the management of gdes a large part of the solution also seems to come from the local level at the local scale collaboration between water stakeholders for integrated resource management can be complicated mostert 2003 chanya et al 2014 the initial appropriation by state entities water agencies or basin organizations of the recommendations formulated by regional and national institutions often appears insufficient for the local implementation of adapted and sustainable management strategies fig 7 a real appropriation of existing regulations on coastal gdes by all local stakeholders decision makers and actors in the territory appears essential for the preparation of relevant planning or development documents and the implementation of appropriate action programs the elements required to define the challenges and perspectives related to gdes must not be a local adaptation of regional recommendations but rather a collective elaboration by all the actors concerned efforts must be made to develop a framework for effective public participation at six levels information education consultation involvement collaboration and capacity building das et al 2019 coastal aquifers are particularly vulnerable to water users conflicts zepeda quintana et al 2018 all water users want to be able to benefit from the quality and quantity of water resources they need no user can be abandoned in favor of another nor can the need for environmental waters environmental water needs cannot be forgotten and must be taken into account in management strategies sustainable water management thus requires water demand management which must be achieved through agreements and collaboration at an appropriate scale the establishment of a strong collaborative processes appears as the only way to guarantee the essential groundwater supply to coastal gdes and their sustainability boulton 2005 the management of coastal gdes must take into account its hydrological basin as well as its territorial water management unit and all territorial units important for its management i e tourist unit geographical unit air of influence of neighboring cities or migratory bird management mermet and treyer 2001 6 conclusion nowadays coastal mediterranean regions suffer from an over development of anthropogenic activities which strongly impact the groundwater resources and depending coastal gdes although some mediterranean regions have included the protection of gdes in their water management policies the implementation of an appropriate intergraded and collaborative management is often lacking and coastal gdes do not benefit from a particular status due to their complexity the preservation of coastal gdes is subject to the stability over time of fresh water supplies ground and surface water in sufficient quantity and quality however the determination of the qualitative and quantitative needs of coastal gdes is difficult to evaluate and each coastal gde is a unique case particular attention should therefore be paid to the characterization of environmental and ecological water requirements the hydrogeological knowledge about the management and behavior of coastal aquifers and gdes must be strengthened hydrogeology must be considered as an integral component of the coastal gdes and not a sub discipline of hydrology as is too often the case at present the inventory and characterization of coastal gdes must be improved through in depth systemic approaches to this end the coupling of hydrogeochemical and geophysical techniques which are inexpensive seem to constitute a relevant strategy these investigations must be supplemented by the identification and evolution of the sources of contamination present in the catchment areas in order to better understand the role of groundwater as a vector of pollution particular attention should be paid to the identification of the main groundwater discharge areas and the assessment of contaminant flows and loads the systematic mapping of groundwater vulnerability in the coastal areas must be promoted using methods accounting for both the intrinsic and specific vulnerability of groundwater this kind of data must help to develop land uses and human activities according to the groundwater vulnerability finally in the case of effective degradation processes restoration plans should be considered a reflection must be carried out for the definition of relevant indicators of the ecological coastal gdes status for these environments subject to high variabilities particularly in terms of salinity there is a necessity of developing sensitive indicators for monitoring ecological status biological indicators seem to be helpful but needs to be further and widely developed from a qualitative point of view the estimation of groundwater withdrawals is often very approximate because of the poor knowledge of the extraction points it seems essential to carry out an exhaustive inventory of wells and boreholes in the coastal gde watershed the implementation of retroactive measures for reporting private wells would also allow a better knowledge of the existing structures which are currently not recorded regularly monitored water quotas for private individuals could also be helpful for the qualitative management of the resource at present the lack of an appropriate definition for coastal gdes is a huge problem lack of discussion and consensus between lawyers and scientists does not facilitate the establishment of management strategies to be efficient this definition needs to be the result of a joint reflection between several disciplines as showed in this synthesis the transdisciplinary approach between hydrogeology hydrology social sciences and law is essential to fully understand the socio economic and environmental complexity of coastal gdes the inventory of coastal gdes characteristics could help to establish a complete and relevant definition of coastal gdes in addition to involve several discipline thoughts about coastal gdes definition need to be based on the mobilization of scientist lawyers but also water users and stakeholders information appropriation and collaboration are clearly strategic interdependent points to be developed local water users and managers must feel concerned by the problems related to coastal gdes to build appropriate and sustainable management plans without this process all possible efforts can be taken but their chances of achieving successful results will remain low the creation of permanent mechanisms such as water user groups or groundwater forums could be useful these moments of exchange and discussion would also allow managers and decision makers to better understand the role and benefits of coastal gdes indeed evaluation of the ecosystem services is essential for valuing the coastal gdes and decision makers at many levels are unaware of the connection between wetland condition and the provision of wetland services and consequent benefits for people all water resources in the coastal areas should be managed collectively and strategically in order to maximize use efficiency reduce water use conflicts and avoid over exploitation in other words the management strategy must consider the lagoon water body the surrounding wetland and groundwater as an inseparable set of communicating vessels whose nature of exchanges is subject to temporal and spatial variations in the global context of unprecedented anthropogenic pressures hydro food crises and climate change the consideration given to coastal gdes represents a key issue for the socio economic and environmental sustainable development of many coastal mediterranean areas integrated water management strategies that consider environmental needs on an equal footing with socio economic constraints within the coastal hydrosystem need to be improved the iczm is the management strategy that most considers water resources in the coastal zone and refers to coastal aquifers as such and specifies a monitoring requirement however despite the growing consideration for coastal aquifers there are still gaps it is important to continue to raise public awareness of coastal aquifers at the regional level and to integrate their specificities into coastal zone management strategies and plans collaboration between states or countries sharing of knowledge and technology facilitated by the creation of exchange material could also contribute to improving the integration of coastal aquifers into local guidelines and policies these practical suggestions could help for improving the management of coastal aquifers and coastal gdes in this way groundwater and coastal water gdes could really benefit from the optimal environmental conditions required to ensure their sustainability declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

18132,high pressure membrane filtration reverse osmosis and nanofiltration is used to purify different water sources including wastewater surface water groundwater and seawater a major concern in membrane filtration is the accumulation and growth of micro organisms and their secreted polymeric substances leading to reduced membrane performance and membrane biofouling the fundamental understanding of membrane biofouling is limited despite years of research as the means of microbial interactions and response to the conditions on the membrane surface are complicated here we discuss studies that investigated the microbial diversity of fouled high pressure membranes high throughput amplicon sequencing of the 16s rrna gene have shown that burkholderiales pseudomonadales rhizobiales sphingomonadales and xanthomonadales frequently obtain a high relative abundance on fouled membranes the bacterial communities present in the diverse feed water types and in pre treatment compartments are different from the communities on the membrane because high pressure membrane filtration provides a selective environment for certain bacterial groups the biofilms that form within the pre treatment compartments do not commonly serve as an inoculum for the subsequent high pressure membranes besides bacteria also fungi are detected in the water treatment compartments in contrast to bacteria the fungal community does not change much throughout membrane cleaning the stable fungal diversity indicates that they are more significant in membrane biofouling than previously thought by reviewing the biodiversity and ecology of microbes in the whole high pressure membrane filtration water chain we have been able to identify potentials to improve biofouling control these include modulation of hydrodynamic conditions nutrient limitation and the combination of cleaning agents to target the entire membrane microbiome graphical abstract image 1 keywords membrane biofouling

index t rflp terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms uf ultrafiltration 1 introduction the amount of water that can be obtained from natural sources is sufficient to satisfy the global freshwater demand but water scarcity exists due to mismanagement and spatial and temporal inequalities in the amount of natural supplied water mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 the global demand for freshwater has been growing due to urbanisation changing consumption patterns pollution and population increase and poses an important challenge today and in the future mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 savenije 2000 assessment of water availability at high temporal and spatial resolution shows that two thirds of the global population suffers from water scarcity at least one month per year mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 water scarcity prevails in areas with high population density or in highly irrigated districts or in areas with a combination of these the global increase in temperature will substantially increase the challenge to provide sufficient fresh water to the worldwide population postel et al 1996 schewe et al 2014 high pressure membranes including nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro remove most solutes producing clean and biological stable water as well as a waste stream called concentrate high pressure membrane filtration has become attractive for water purification improved material design has led to progress in membrane functionality permeability and selectivity and applicability mechanical and chemical stability lee et al 2011 high pressure membrane filtration now provides the option to remove most impurities such as hardness colour and disinfection products in a single purification step warsinger et al 2018 werber et al 2016 other advantages include low purchase costs and low space requirements membrane units can easily be scaled up and can be operated continuously and automatically bartels et al 2005 guo et al 2012 lin and elimelech 2015 this explains why membrane filtration has become the most important technology for seawater desalination caldera and breyer 2017 the use of high pressure membranes for purification of water sources other than seawater is growing and is stimulated by tightened discharge standards and concerns for micropollutants barbosa et al 2016 fu and wang 2011 sahinkaya et al 2018 a major challenge in membrane water filtration is to tackle fouling which decreases membrane performance due to the accumulation of particles and growth of microbes at the membrane surface peña et al 2013 a general classification of membrane fouling includes colloidal fouling suspended particles such as silica organic fouling natural organic matter inorganic fouling salts and biofouling microorganisms peña et al 2013 colloidal fouling can be reduced by e g sand bed filtration or by low pressure membrane filtration such as microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf voutchkov 2010 for inorganic scalants several removal possibilities exist such as acid precipitation lime softening or addition of scale inhibitors antiscalants badruzzaman et al 2019 organic fouling of high pressure membranes can be reduced by implementation of low pressure membrane filtration or by fluctuating the ph of the feed water to stimulate solubilisation high ph followed by low ph or vice versa preferably combined with a surfactant voutchkov 2010 biofouling is difficult to prevent and control flemming et al 1997 pre treatment systems including mf and uf membranes are unable to remove all micro organisms and those that pass may colonize the membrane badruzzaman et al 2019 greenlee et al 2009 as a consequence frequent membrane cleaning in place cip is required for most membrane installations to remove recalcitrant biofilms and safeguard product quantity beyer et al 2014 membrane cleaning is unwanted because it leads to operational costs and labour for maintenance membrane downtime and membrane damage greenlee et al 2009 shirazi et al 2010 membrane damage decreases selectivity and reduces product quality ultimately the membrane has to be replaced to certify consumers safety judd 2017 to better understand membrane biofouling many studies have described the microbiota present on membranes the focus of this review is to outline the membrane surface as selective microbial environment and the strategies that microbes use to survive grow and profit in this ecosystem 2 the membrane surface ecosystem the conditions at the membrane surface result from operational parameters and processes inherent to membrane filtration radu et al 2012 these include feed water characteristics such as nutritional levels and temperature hydrodynamic changes due to the feed spacer geometry and the arrangement of membrane modules in pressure vessels dreszer et al 2014 farhat et al 2016 radu et al 2014 shirazi et al 2010 suwarno et al 2012 in addition the local conditions on the membrane surface change during membrane operation and membrane cleaning nagaraj et al 2017a hence a broad range of conditions exist in a membrane module providing biotic and abiotic differences this complexity makes it difficult to link shifts in microbial composition to particular process parameters 2 1 a broad range of conditions can be encountered in membrane pressure vessels most high pressure membranes are spirally wound around a permeate tube to obtain a high membrane area to volume ratio and are arranged in membrane modules to increase the volume of produced water per volume of feed water multiple membrane modules are serially connected membrane modules are surrounded by a pressure vessel to provide mechanical stability within a pressure vessel the feed water enters at the lead module passes through the following modules and ultimately leaves the tail module as concentrate the flow rate and flow velocity of the feed water inherently decrease along the membrane module as water is pressed through the membrane while the concentration of inorganics and other solutes in the feed stream increases radu et al 2010 shirazi et al 2010 inorganic fouling for the latter reason commonly disrupts filtration of the tail modules khan et al 2014 peña et al 2013 in addition fluid friction decreases the feed pressure and velocity along all the membrane modules farias et al 2014 membrane permeation also creates a drag force that moves organics inorganics and microbes to the membrane surface fig 1 eshed et al 2008 subramani and hoek 2008 this results in the accumulation of solutes nutrients and microbes at the membrane surface semião et al 2014 song and elimelech 1995 commonly biofilm embedded bacteria grow slower than free floating bacteria because the extracellular polymeric substances eps embedded cells are limited of nutrients and oxygen due to diffusion limitation stewart 2003 permeation of the feed water across the membrane overcomes this limitation and biofilm embedded cells therefore grow faster at the membrane surface compared to free floating bacteria herzberg and elimelech 2007 in spite of enhanced cell attachment and stimulated growth biofilm formation is not initiated on the entire membrane picioreanu et al 2009 vrouwenvelder et al 2009 when membranes are operated under cross flow filtration the flow also moves parallel to the membrane surface fig 1 in contrast to the drag force high shear stress restricts biofilm growth on the membrane surface ying et al 2013 biofilm growth is therefore initially preserved to locations close to the feed spacer where shear stress is lower radu et al 2014 membrane shear forces which can be modulated by changing the cross flow velocity have a strong effect on the membrane microbiota al ashhab et al 2014a bacteria that produce eps or appendages that prevent membrane removal by frictional fluid forces will maintain themselves at the membrane or in the membrane associated biofilms de vries et al 2019 rehman et al 2019 differences in physiochemical conditions can therefore be found between different membrane plants as well as between different membrane modules within the same pressure vessel nagaraj et al 2017a 2 2 feed water quality plays a significant role in the progression of membrane biofouling to colonize synthetic membranes bacteria have to obtain nutrients and withstand the challenges that are present on the membrane surface under filtration conditions such as high shear stress and changes in ph chen et al 2013 radu et al 2014 yu et al 2017 the feed water quality plays a significant role in the progression of membrane biofouling but the ability to control membrane biofouling by modulating this factor has remained largely unexplored beyer et al 2014 a cip interval of once a month is generally considered as imperative for stable membrane operation to purify surface water or seawater warsinger et al 2018 by exception the performance of membranes that are fed with anoxic groundwater is stable for extended time periods due to the low concentration of dissolved oxygen and nutrients cip frequencies of less than once a year are common practice for membranes filtering anoxic groundwater beyer et al 2014 in most source water types the availability of oxygen and nutrients mainly in the form of natural organic matter nom is sufficient for bacteria to rapidly colonize and grow on the membranes and as a consequence deteriorate membrane performance park et al 2018 lakes and rivers and their discharge locations in seas and oceans are rich in nom that originates from terrestrial inflow matilainen et al 2011 marine environments are rich in nom that originates from primary production arndt et al 2013 fabris et al 2008 high molecular weight hmw compounds such as phenols lignins tannins and humic substances are readily available in surface and marine water because due to their insolubility and size a limit number of micro organisms are able to degrade these molecules matilainen et al 2011 simon et al 2013 although these compounds are usually rather efficiently removed by pre treatment systems they still can cause organic fouling lee et al 2004 seidel and elimelech 2002 hence feed water quality determines to a great extend which nutrients accumulate at the membrane surface irrespectively of the pre treatment system proteins and carbohydrates are readily biodegradable and are except during algal blooms generally present at low concentrations compared to hmw compounds guastalli et al 2013 jeong et al 2016 simon et al 2013 micro organisms that are able to degrade hmw compounds therefore have a profound advantage on the membrane surface corvini et al 2006 kurzbaum et al 2017 pandit et al 2016 vashi et al 2018 3 the microbiomes of synthetic membranes the diversity and abundance of bacterial groups on high pressure membranes has been investigated and confirmed using different techniques fig 2 most of these studies have used molecular techniques such as quantitative pcr pcr gradient gel electrophoresis gge and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms t rflp in recent years next generation sequencing ngs has greatly expanded the ability to uncover microbial community compositions of diverse environments studies using ngs have shown that certain bacterial taxa frequently occur in membrane biofouling and that membrane surfaces often have their own microbiome the number of studies using culture dependent techniques aiming to understand the physiological traits of bacteria involved in membrane fouling is limited de vries et al 2019 nagaraj et al 2019 pang et al 2005 from those studies it was not well feasible to reveal how bacteria interact and respond to conditions on the membrane surface how the membrane surface behaves as ecosystem a community together with its environment functioning as a unit remains enigmatic 3 1 bacterial identification techniques the recognition of ribosomal rna rrna as phylogenetic marker by carl r woese and george e fox led to a paradigm shift to evolutionary biology woese and fox 1977 identification of bacteria archaea and fungi was conventionally based on phenotypical characteristics and was laborious and time consuming but less valuable for reliable identification amann et al 1995 woese et al 1990 cultivability however is the only secure and operational definition of viability and enables direct biochemical phylogenetic and physiological characterisation of a single strain 16s rrna gene sequences provide an objective tool to delineate bacteria and archaea rational taxonomic boundaries have been described to distinguish their taxonomical ranks such as species 98 65 gene sequence similarity and genus 94 5 gene sequence similarity stackebrandt 2006 stackebrandt and goebel 1994 yarza et al 2017 taxonomic classification of the fungal kingdom has conventionally been hampered by the large physiological diversity of its members and by the morphological transitions of many fungal species berbee et al 2017 geiser et al 2006 hibbett et al 2007 the fungus kingdom includes moulds mushrooms lichens rusts smuts and yeasts stajich et al 2009 unlike bacteria and archaea selection of the most appropriate genetic marker for taxonomic classification is still under debate for the fungal kingdom schoch et al 2012 the use of marker genes such as the 16s and 18s rrna gene has led to development of quantitative and semi quantitative molecular identification techniques including the polymerase chain reaction pcr fluorescent in situ hybridisation fish and next generation sequencing ngs delong et al 1989 metzker 2010 white et al 1989 pcr revolutionized biological science because it enabled to amplify preselected segments of dna or rna to quantities which permit sequencing white et al 1989 standard pcr alone is unreliable for dna quantification but in combination with other techniques it can be used for quantitative or semi quantitative identification examples of such technologies are quantitative pcr qpcr pcr gradient gel electrophoresis gge and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms t rflp marsh 1999 nakatsu 2007 tabit 2016 thies 2007 t rflp qpcr and gge are laborious time consuming and have low resolving power hence many low abundant microbes will remain undetected using these identification methods ngs platforms provide the ability to study bacterial community compositions in a culture independent and high throughput manner metzker 2010 shokralla et al 2012 these techniques identify microorganisms via comparative analysis which enables to study the relationship between micro organisms and their environment in an expeditious manner many ngs platforms are available launched by roche 454 pyrosequencing from 2013 this platform stopped illumina including miseq hiseq and nextseq oxford nanopore techniques with nanopore sequencing pacific biosystems with pacbio sequencing and ion torrents with the ion proton sequencer claesson et al 2010 glenn 2011 goodwin et al 2016 metzker 2010 each platform has its advantages and disadvantages that are outside the scope of this review but have been reviewed by metzker 2010 the microbiota of high pressure membranes have been investigated using pyrosequencing illumina sequencing and the ion proton sequencer table 2 disadvantages of ngs techniques is that analysis is time consuming and the purchase costs are still rather high although prices get lower without additional sample preparation ngs platforms cannot provide information about the spatial organization of the microorganisms present fluorescent in situ hybridisation fish is based on hybridisation of a fluorescently labelled probe to its target rna and is therefore linked to metabolic activity amann et al 1995 frickmann et al 2017 fish probes commonly target rna of ribosomal marker genes but also the rna of key functional genes have been used frickmann et al 2017 wagner et al 2003 fish provides the major advantage that expression of multiple functional genes can simultaneously be investigated in situ frickmann et al 2017 wagner et al 2003 a disadvantage is that this method is laborious time consuming and its applicability is limited to organisms from which sequence data is available amann et al 1995 frickmann et al 2017 technological advances and method optimization provide opportunities to further increase the understanding of fouled membranes as microbial environment although 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing delivers high throughput output it is limited to characterise microbial diversity instead by sequencing all available genomes or available rna transcripts metagenomic and metatranscriptomics approaches reveal the functional potential and the functional activity of the microbiome respectively simon and daniel 2011 in the first and hitherto only study applying a metagenomic approach to characterise the microbial community in a full scale ro plant 25 metagenome assembled genomes mags were recently recovered from a fouled membrane rehman et al 2019 comparison of these 25 mags to the 6 mags recovered from the intake seawater and brine revealed that the bacterial membrane microbiome carries quorum quenching genes but no quorum sensing genes hence implying that quorum quenching is a successful bacterial strategy to outcompete bacteria that use signalling molecules to regulate biofilm formation and membrane colonization rehman et al 2019 metatransciptomics has so far not been used to analyse fouled membranes but provide the ability to characterise the functional activity of the membrane microbiome and hence its response to different selection pressures in high spatial and temporal resolution moran et al 2013 one general disadvantage of molecular techniques is that identification of the identified genes is always limited by the reference database 3 2 the orders burkholderiales pseudomonadales rhizobiales sphingomonadales and xanthomonadales are frequently dominant on fouled membranes within the bacterial domain six taxonomic levels are defined from high to low taxonomic level these include phylum class order family genus and species the lowest taxonomic level that can be determined by molecular techniques is dependent on the identification method and has changed over time due to technical innovations glenn 2011 goodwin et al 2016 metzker 2010 published studies therefore do not uniformly present the bacterial community composition at the same taxonomic level and this makes comparison of bacterial diversity between different studies cumbersome for this review we compared 33 studies that investigated bacterial communities on fouled high pressure membranes and we have classified the identified bacteria at the order level table 1 and supplementary table s1 when possible the lower taxonomic levels are also discussed in total 35 bacterial orders were documented from these fouled high pressure membranes these orders were used as benchmark to compare the microbial diversity of feed water pre treatment compartments and fouled membranes and disclose the role of particular selection pressures on the microbial composition bacteria belonging to the orders burkholderiales pseudomonadales rhizobiales and sphingomonadales and xanthomonadales are most frequently detected on fouled membranes burkholderiales and xanthomonadales were not detected in earlier studies but ngs studies have frequently detected these orders on fouled membranes in this review we refer to the burkholderiales pseudomonadales rhizobiales sphingomonadales and xanthomonadales orders as frequently detected taxa many of the early studies used methods that were biased in their identification ability for instance towards cultivable organisms more recent studies using ngs commonly describe the taxa with the highest relative abundance but do not report on the rare taxa hence the actual bacterial community composition of fouled high pressure membranes is more diverse than will be possible to describe here 3 3 biofilm formation a strategy to grow and increase resilience biofilm formation constitutes a lifestyle in which microorganisms adopt a multicellular behavior and has been acknowledged to be the main cause of membrane biofouling flemming et al 1996 stewart et al 2001 the self produced matrix progresses biofilm embedded cells into sophisticated spatial organizations that vary in oxygen and nutrient concentration ph values and viscosities costerton et al 1994 1995 glud et al 1998 the ecological organization of biofilms is complex and facilitates bacterial survival in a variety of environmental niches flemming et al 2016 because the eps layer acts as a physical barrier it alleviates the embedded cells to for instance the perturbing effects of cleaning agents containing chlorine and strong ph changes chen and stewart 1996 jang et al 2006 nadell et al 2016 the versatile binding sites within the eps matrix provide biofilm embedded cells advantages under oligotrophic conditions as different substrates become entrapped battin et al 2016 a part of the biofilm population called the persister cells is tolerant for biocides because they are metabolically inactive spoering and lewis 2001 persisters are a small part of the whole community but their offspring may become abundant after they shift to an actively growing state when most of the other cells of the biofilm have been killed during for instance membrane cleaning hall stoodley et al 2004 synergistic interactions and metabolic dependency generally increase the overall biomass produced in multispecies biofilms burmølle et al 2014 giaouris et al 2013 liu et al 2018 ren et al 2015 van der veen and abee 2011 due to their multispecies composition natural biofilms are composed of phenotypically distinct bacteria that can either cooperate or compete for resources nadell et al 2016 a regulatory network is therefore important for each cell to fine tune its investment costs in profitable cooperative traits while antagonistic competitors are opposed quorum sensing qs the secretion and response to signal molecules called autoinducers provide bacteria the tool to assess local cell densities and act accordingly by expressing the most suitable set of genes this signaling circuit is used by clonal clusters of genetically identical cells to limit exploitation within multispecies biofilms bacteria within clonal clusters secrete and sense the same qs signals and respond uniformly so that exploitation by competitors is avoided nadell et al 2016 qs has shown to effectively reduce biofilm formation under laboratory conditions but metagenomic analysis of indicates that genes involved in quenching qs signals rather than genes required for qs are identified in biofilms on fouled ro membranes how survival strategies simultaneously mediate community assembly on the membrane and whether such strategies are conserved within certain bacterial taxa is not understood moreover a limited number of studies has investigated the molecular changes in eps composition during the membrane operation nagaraj et al 2017b bereschenko et al 2011 investigated the effect of conventional cleaning treatment and occurrence and development of biofouling in ro membrane units bereschenko et al 2011 over a period of 6 months membrane surfaces were cleaned once a week with a conventional acid cleaner only sphingomonas species that are typically localized at the biofilm base were able to survive the chemical cleaning procedures bereschenko et al 2011 members of the sphingomonas genus are versatile bacteria that are widely spread in natural water environments and man made water systems balkwill et al 2006 glaeser and kämpfer 2014 amongst the bacterial community they are strong competitors in scavenging a variety of nutrients under oligotrophic conditions and they contribute to cleaning associated stability of bacterial biofilms bereschenko et al 2010 2011 lal et al 2006 stolz 2014 waigi et al 2017 moreover they secrete sphingans a group of structurally closely related eps that effectively protect bacteria against extreme ph temperature salinity and pressure garcía et al 2018 pollock 1993 xu et al 2015 this provides a further explanation for the selection of eps producing bacteria by membrane cleaning agents therefore eps quality and not quantity could be a determining factor in occurrence of cleaning associated biofilms nagaraj et al 2017b the long search for alternative membrane cleaning strategies is just one example that illustrates the difficulty of controlling biofilms flemming et al 1996 examples of alternative strategies to alleviate membrane biofouling include nutrient limitation surface modification quorum quenching and biological control via bacteriophages and microfaunal predators based on the current knowledge it appears that membrane surface modifications are in fact incompatible to control biofilm formation in full scale membrane operations due to drag force that transferrers bacteria and nutrients to the membrane surface as different components are transferred by the drag force to the membrane surface it is swiftly covered and membrane surface modifications are rendered less effective governing bacterial communication by quenching qs signals could switch the biofilm condition in aquatic environments in terms of controlling and replacing the microbes hong et al 2012 wood et al 2016 qs permits bacteria to effectively regulate biofilm formation under static conditions but this process becomes less efficient when the signal molecules are removed by the flow under turbulent settings purevdorj et al 2002 hence the use of quorum quenching natural agents is a promising approach to control biofouling although it remains to be established which role qs circuits plays in membrane biofouling kalia and purohit 2011 in that context the development of less or selectively toxic antibacterial agents capable of clearing biofilms would be timely here the use of bacteriophages that effect phage mediated biocontrol of bacteria phage therapy purified phage encoded enzymes that digest bacterial cell wall material endolysins or phage encoded enzymes that digest the eps eps depolymerases chan and abedon 2015 these agents have been shown to reduce the bacterial density of a diversity of biofilms and in many cases tend to be non toxic chan and abedon 2015 although reports on such alternatives provide promising perspectives their success to alleviate membrane biofouling over prolonged periods still has to be established on multispecies models this is a particularly important quest due to the potential selective pressure they microfaunal predators and bacteriophages exert on the bacterial community jousset 2012 scanlan and buckling 2012 bacteria producing filaments and aggregates but also small bacteria have a strong selective advantage and higher survival rate in the presence of bacterial grazers such as nematodes jousset 2012 similarly lytic phages select for bacteria to develop mucoid biofilms that are difficult to control scanlan and buckling 2012 the naturally high abundant bacteriophages in marine water raises question about their infection rates and how their success in alleviating membrane biofouling can be increased scanlan and buckling 2012 4 colonization of high pressure membranes the membrane surface can be colonized by microbes transported by the feed water comparison of the bacterial community composition of pristine unused membranes to fouled membranes has shown that most bacteria causing membrane fouling have a feed water origin and are absent on the pristine membranes nagaraj et al 2017a the frequently detected taxa are commonly present at low relative abundance in the different feed water types and in the different pre treatment compartments 4 1 the bacterial diversity on the membrane and in the feed water is different high pressure membranes are operated using a variety of feed water types including seawater surface water groundwater and wastewater effluents in marine environments the relative abundance of bacterial taxa is affected by seasonal changes such as temperature differences day length nutrient composition and concentration fuhrman et al 2015 in the upper marine layers where light and oxygen easily penetrate the phototrophic sar11 e g pelagibacterales sar86 sar116 clusters and the cyanobacteria prochlorococcus and synechococcus are dominant during spring blooms fuhrman et al 2015 morris et al 2002 table 2 shows the bacteria in marine environments that are typically abundant in the feed waters of high pressure membranes the relative abundance of these microbes however is low at the surface of high pressure membranes table 2 khan et al 2013a 2013b levi et al 2016 manes et al 2011b zodrow et al 2014 these differences in occupancy suggest that the conditions at the membrane surface are selective for certain bacterial phenotypic traits the dominant bacteria in secondary and tertiary effluent streams that originate from wastewater sources do not become dominant members of the biofilm community at the membrane surface table 2 al ashhab et al 2014a ferrera et al 2015 al ashhab et al 2014a compared the bacterial diversity of an ro membrane biofilm with the artificial tertiary wastewater that was used as feed water and showed that the bacterial community on the ro membrane clustered separately from the feed water communities the orders that were abundant in the feed waters burkholderiales rhizobiales and sphingomonadales with a cumulative relative abundance of 45 6 were also present on the membrane although at a much lower relative abundance 17 5 al ashhab et al 2014a in feed water originating from surface and groundwater burkholderiales janthinobacterium sphingomonadales were dominant table 2 el chakhtoura et al 2015 forbes et al 2016 lin et al 2014 liu et al 2014 navarro noya et al 2013 shaw et al 2015 these orders correspond to those found on fouled membranes that are fed with these water types suggesting that ground water and surface water serve as inoculum for membrane biofilms bereschenko et al 2008 2010 2011 chiellini et al 2012 bereschenko et al 2008 compared the bacterial diversity of the surface water and the membrane community and it was concluded that that the biofilm was actively formed on the membrane surface rather than being a concentration effect of bacteria overall the composition of the bacterial community on the membrane is generally different from the feed water as only a fraction of the bacterial feed water diversity accumulates at the membrane surface indicating that the membrane surface provides bacterial selection pressures bereschenko et al 2008 however hörsch et al 2005 found that the bacterial composition of a mature fouling layer was similar to the composition of the feed water and concluded that in contrast to the study of bereschenko et al 2008 growth played a minor role in the biofouling process hörsch et al 2005 the difference between these studies is the identification technique and the resolution to which the bacterial community composition was delineated hörsch used fish to distinguish bacteria at the at the phylum level while bereschenko identified bacteria at the species level via clone libraries of the 16s rrna gene sequence this exemplifies that the microbial diversity should be targeted and delineated to lower taxonomic levels such as to species or at least family level to understand ongoing microbial processes 4 2 feed water pre treatment strategies and their effect on bacterial communities the composition of the feed water determines which pre treatment strategy is most appropriate to control membrane fouling voutchkov 2010 two parameters that are commonly reported to assess the feed water quality are the silt density index sdi used as a measure for the amount of submicron particulates and turbidity to measure water clarity badruzzaman et al 2019 conventionally feed water pre treatment for high pressure membrane filtration is typically performed by a combination of processes coagulation and flocculation followed by granular media filtration e g anthracite coal silica sand or garnet and cartridge filtration fig 3 voutchkov 2010 biocides such as chlorine and peracetic acid but also ozone or uv can be applied when biofouling is a concern bucs et al 2018 pre treatment strategies are designed to remove the microbial load on high pressure membranes but could scavenge nutrients and potentially provide a suitable environment for microbial growth comparison of the bacterial community composition can therefore answer whether pre treatment compartments serve as inoculum for high pressure membranes in conventional pre treatment systems cartridge filters cf are commonly used as final step to remove suspended solids fig 3 alawadhi 1997 commonly cartridge filters with micron ratings between 1 and 10 μm are used these filters remove bacteria incompletely but depending on the feed water quality and the micron rating cartridge filtration may remove suspended solids chua et al 2003 leparc et al 2007 the bacterial community of cf is commonly different from that of the succeeding ro membrane at least in in full scale facilities bereschenko et al 2008 chun et al 2012 levi et al 2016 zhang et al 2011 comparison of the bacterial community composition between different compartments of fourteen full scale water desalination plants has shown that the dominant bacteria on the ro membrane are absent from or are a minor component of the bacterial community of the preceding cartridge filters zhang et al 2011 similarly chun et al 2012 detected that members of the ruegeria pseudoruegeria parvularcula legionella and shigella are the only bacterial groups shared between the cf and ro membrane table 3 phaeobacter leisingera kangiella and bacillales are abundant on the cf while haliangium and limnobacter are abundant on the ro membrane on the cartridge filters the presence of bacteria belonging to taxa harbouring facultative and obligate chemolithotrophs such as geobacter desulfuromusa and thioalkalivibrio seems to indicate that the pre treatment compartments effectively removed certain nutritional compounds such as ferrous iron or sulfur chun et al 2012 this removal can account for the different bacterial community composition between the cf and the ro community members of the sar11 cluster have been found in high relative abundance on both the cartridge filter and the ro membrane table 3 the relative abundance of this cluster varied seasonally between 10 to 30 and 64 77 on the cf and ro membrane respectively levi et al 2016 because the relative abundance of the sar11 cluster was low in the compartments that preceded the cf membrane rapid sand filtration relative abundance of 0 4 8 4 the cf might have stimulated growth of members of the sar11 cluster and as such function as inoculum for the high pressure membranes sar11 is ubiquitous in marine environments and found in near shore waters to depths of 3 000 m hanson et al 2012 morris et al 2002 sunagawa et al 2015 physiological traits of these bacteria are largely unknown because despite being ubiquitous members of the sar11 cluster have rarely been isolated henson et al 2018 giovannoni and vergin 2012 rappé et al 2002 the sar11 bacteria are among the smallest free living cells in culture with cell length of 0 37 0 89 μm and have limited metabolic flexibility henson et al 2018 giovannoni and vergin 2012 rappé et al 2002 based on these morphological traits it was concluded that the size of these bacteria might have provided them a benefit to access the high pressure membranes as they might more easily pass the cf compared to larger bacteria levi et al 2016 dual media dm filters are conventionally used to remove soluble organics and are typically composed of a 1 0 2 0 m layer of sand covered by 0 4 0 8 m of anthracite badruzzaman et al 2019 granular activated carbon can be used instead of anthracite to reduce high levels of organics naidu et al 2013 anis et al 2019 dm filters and ro membranes harbour different biofilm communities jeong et al 2017 on the dm filter phototrophic and nitrite oxidizing bacteria such as trichodesmium and nitrospira are abundant but their relative abundance is below detection level on the ro membrane table 3 the bacterial community composition of dm and ro filter becomes more similar when they are continuously cleaned by chlorination under these conditions erythrobacter and sphingomonas and hyphomonas increase in relative abundance and become dominant on dm filters and downstream ro membranes whether the dm filters served in this case as inoculum is unknown but these results indicate that the selection pressure on the bacterial diversity caused by continuous chlorination overcomes the selection pressures imposed by the different media types e g dm filters and ro filters jeong et al 2017 low pressure membranes mf and uf are applied as pre treatment systems for high pressure membranes and their use has increased in recent years due to capital cost reductions huang et al 2009 wolf et al 2005 typically low pressure membranes filtration systems remove particles at 0 1 μm mf membranes or 0 01 μm uf membranes and may reduce sdi values to below 2 anis et al 2019 low pressure membranes remove bacteria with log reduction values of 4 and biofouling is therefore reduced but not prevented ghayeni et al 1999 jacangelo et al 1989 molelekwa et al 2014 the communities of mf and uf compartments have a different bacterial composition compared to the downstream high pressure membranes table 3 chen et al 2004 ghayeni et al 1998 herzberg et al 2010 lee et al 2010 manes et al 2011a similarly to the cf community the mf filter harbours facultative and obligate chemolithotrophs including the iron reducing geothrix fermentans and the homoacetogen holophaga foetida chen et al 2004 this suggests that nutritional conditions are a determining factor for the bacterial community compositions of the mf and ro when uf is used as pre treatment step the genera erythrobacter planctomycete and ruegeria become dominant on downstream ro membranes table 3 members of these genera are below detection limit on the uf membrane and in the uf effluent confirming that the relative abundance of bacterial groups in the uf effluent does not correlate with the microbial community of the downstream ro membranes chen et al 2004 chlorine is the most widely used disinfectant due to its ease of use and low cost du et al 2017 in this review we distinguish between continuous dosing of chlorine as pre treatment process and intermitted chlorination as membrane cleaning process chlorination effectively kills biomass on the ro membrane but based on molecular analysis some bacterial groups appear to tolerate this biocide bacterial classes that are well known to resist chlorine due to their ability to sporulate are bacilli and clostridia wyatt and waites 1975 these classes and in particular bacilli have been identified on fouled membranes that in many cases used chlorination as pre treatment step baker and dudley 1998 belila et al 2016 chen et al 2004 chiellini et al 2012 ivnitsky et al 2007 khan et al 2015 lee et al 2009 ridgway et al 1983 zodrow et al 2014 the use of the biocides k5030 isothiazoline based and fr110 inorganic base type of combined chlorine agent to uf effluent led to major bacterial community shifts on the downstream ro membrane tan et al 2017 the alcaligenaceae family cyclobacteriaceae family and the rhizobiales order are dominant when biocide dosing is not part of the pre treatment process are effectively removed when k5030 and fr110 are dosed table 3 instead pseudoxanthomonas stenotrophomonas and thermomonas pseudomonas and sphingopyxis increase in relative abundance when biocides are dosed table 3 4 3 different membrane cleaning agents select for distinct bacterial communities membrane biofouling layers can be removed using alkaline or acid solutions metal chelating agents surfactants enzymes and oxidizing agents li and elimelech 2004 base acid cleaning removes organic foulants on membranes and destroys the microbial cell walls ang et al 2006 metal chelating agents and surfactants can be used to disintegrate eps layers by removal of divalent cations and solubilisation of macromolecules respectively al amoudi and lovitt 2007 the efficiency of cleaning agents to remove biofouling is limited because the eps layer is recalcitrant against cleaning agents improvement of cleaning efficiency is difficult particularly for aged biofilms membrane cleaning frequently removes only part of the fouling layer and cleaned membranes therefore provide a suitable environment for swift microbial colonization beyer et al 2017 membranes used in full scale operation therefore have to be cleaned frequently after the membrane is cleaned the bacterial diversity of the membrane more closely resembles the feed water community compared to the membrane community before cleaning yu et al 2017 from this point onwards the bacterial diversity at the membrane surface increases till it is moderately fouled but then declines till the membrane is cleaned again al ashhab et al 2017 these fluctuations in bacterial diversity indicate that the conditions on the membrane surface change during membrane fouling khan et al 2015 initially nutrients are abundantly present on cleaned membranes but when the biofilm matures community members have to compete for resources as nutrients become limiting leading to overgrowth of well adapted bacteria kim et al 2014 availability and depletion of nutrients could together with the membrane cleaning events therefore provide an explanation for the changes in species richness of fouling membranes different bacterial groups have shown to succeed and thrive when membranes are cleaned intermitted with different cleaning agents al ashhab et al 2017 bereschenko et al 2011 chun et al 2012 jeong et al 2017 khan et al 2015 oh et al 2018 tan et al 2017 yu et al 2017 inclusion of citric acid led to a different community composition compared to when chlorine was used alone khan et al 2015 acinetobacter ralstonia comamonadaceae and diaphorobacter stenotrophomonas and enterobacteriaceae are dominant on membranes that are cleaned by chlorination when chlorination is combined with citric acid cleaning silicibacter and rhodobacteraceae pseudomonas pedobacter and janthinobacterium became abundant based on physiological features assigned to taxonomically related bacteria and atp concentrations it was suggested that spore formers gram positive bacteria and acidophiles better resist citric acid treatment khan et al 2015 these suggestions have to be regarded with caution as no evidence was provided that any of identified bacteria is recalcitrant against citric acid khan et al 2015 5 eukaryotic and archaeal diversity most studies investigating the membrane microbiota of fouled high pressure membranes have focussed on bacteria and neglected the archaeal and eukaryotic diversity al ashhab et al 2017 baker and dudley 1998 belgini et al 2018 chiellini et al 2012 those studies that did investigate the archaeal diversity show that it is similar to the bacterial diversity high in the feed water and decreases within the high pressure membranes al ashhab et al 2014b archaeal communities on the ro membrane are dominated by the phyla crenarchaeota and euryarchaeota al ashhab et al 2014b terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the 18s rrna gene sequences has shown that the eukaryotic community of a ro membrane used for river water purification was composed for 34 of fungal and 53 of amoebozoa chiellini et al 2012 unlike the bacterial and archaeal community the fungal community composition of fouled ro membranes is comparable to that of the feed water community and remains the same during membrane cleaning al ashhab et al 2017 this evenness in fungal diversity indicates either that the membrane surface after cleaning is rapidly colonized by the same fungal taxa or that membrane cleaning removes fungi less effectively compared to bacteria 5 1 members of interkingdom biofilms benefit from cross protection studies investigating the microbial community composition using ngs have shown that when tertiary wastewater is used as feed water the fungal community of the high pressure membrane is dominated by ascomycota basidiomycota and glomeromycota al ashhab et al 2014b in a study that used clone libraries which identified fungi to the genus level the identified genera belong to the phylum ascomycota belgini et al 2018 during membrane cleaning the relative abundance of ascomycota increases at the expense of basidiomycota abundant fungal ascomycota classes on cleaned membranes include eurotiomycetes saccharomycetes and dothideomycetes al ashhab et al 2017 diverse fungi are capable of biofilm growth or develop biofilm like communities blankenship and mitchell 2006 inter kingdom biofilms containing both fungi and bacteria are ubiquitously present in nature and lead to close interactions which can either be mutualistic or symbiotic hogan and kolter 2002 romano and kolter 2005 bacteria and fungi become highly recalcitrant for most of the antibiotics in inter kingdom biofilms and are recognized as a serious problem especially in clinical settings due to cross protection adam et al 2002 shirtliff et al 2009 whether inter kingdom biofilms also provide cross protection for biocides is not well studied but it is known that microbial susceptibility towards biocides differs greatly per kingdom russell 2003 many bactericidal biocides including chlorine are less effective against fungi pereira et al 2013 this is in line with the culturable microbial diversity obtained from more than a hundred membrane autopsies which showed that problematic membranes biofilms which were ineffectively removed using chlorine had a higher fungal incidence baker and dudley 1998 recalcitrant fungi pose a potential problem for the food industry medical centres pharmaceutical cleanrooms and for drinking water facilities as they increase the chance for recalcitrant infections and biofouling al gabr et al 2014 cauda 2009 sandle et al 2014 videla 2002 in clinical settings inter kingdom biofilms are frequently composed of the fungal genus albicans and the bacterial genus pseudomonas cauda 2009 harriott and noverr 2011 it appears that inter kingdom biofilms on fouled membranes are composed of the same genera al ashhab et al 2014b 2017 the interactions between fungi and bacteria might affect membrane cleaning efficiency and consequently biofouling control however studies investigating these interactions are lacking the role that fungi play in membrane biofouling may have been underestimated due to their relative low number compared to bacteria al ashhab et al 2017 this has recently been shown for ro membranes used in the food industry vitzilaiou et al 2019 the relationship between relative abundance and contribution to community ecology has at least for bacteria been questioned liu et al 2017 low abundant bacterial species may shift the relative abundance of other bacteria substantially and play therefore an important role in the fate of the multispecies biofilm liu et al 2017 cell count is an ambivalent measure to express contribution to membrane biofouling when comparing bacteria with fungi particularly due to the typical differences in cell volume between members of these kingdoms bloem et al 1995 besides tolerance towards chlorine other physiological traits will most likely provide fungi advantages on the membrane surface members of the saccharomycetes produce melanins cell wall pigments that confer resistance against multiple stressors including extreme temperatures desiccation and radiation muggia et al 2016 one member of the saccharomycetes aureobasidium pullulans thrives in a wide range of conditions and is able to attach to moisturized plasticized surfaces using its hyphae which might aid in membrane colonization webb et al 1999 a pullulans has the ability to form biofilms and grows under hypersaline acidic and alkaline conditions and at different nutrient concentrations muggia and grube 2018 but the large number of unclassified fungi and the high physiological diversity between order members makes physiological predictions prone to inaccuracies stajich et al 2009 yarza et al 2017 6 conclusions the role of bacteria in membrane biofouling of high pressure membranes is unequivocal and has been confirmed using a variety of techniques ngs platforms have been fundamental for determining the composition of the membrane bacterial biota a broad range of conditions can be found within a single pressure vessel and the effect of these abiotic and biotic variations is reflected by the abundance of many different bacteria taxa along membrane elements as biofilm formation on membrane surfaces is complex it is important for future studies to include a description about the cleaning agent cleaning frequency feed water temperature location of the membrane element in the pressure vessel and on the sampling location at the membrane because molecular techniques are limited by the reference database taxonomical features of the detected microbes will only lead to accurate prediction of physiological features once representative members have been functionally characterized the low number of physiologically characterized bacteria isolated from fouled membranes therefore provides a major limitation to understand how they interact and respond to the conditions at the membrane surface reference genomes are important for capturing information on metabolic properties the use of metagenome assembled genomes could therefor generate valuable physiological information from uncultivated bacteria this approach was only recently used for the first time to characterise the microbial community in a full scale ro plant rehman et al 2019 most studies so far have neglected the archaeal and fungal community present on fouled membranes as interkingdom biofilms commonly benefit cross protection the understanding of the complete collection of microbial interactions at the membrane surface may be important for the design of more efficient cleaning strategies particularly fungi might contribute more to the membrane biofouling problem than previously anticipated as they are more recalcitrant against bacterial biocides the cleaning frequency of fouled membranes can be reduced by using anoxic groundwater seawater below the epipelagic zone is poor in nom and the lower temperature and oxygen concentrations might in analogy to anoxic groundwater pose an opportunity for desalination purposes but although oxygen is limited sulphide provides bacteria an electron donor and alternative energy source and biofouling is therefore to be expected this review made clear that different cleaning agents select for distinct bacterial communities further research is required to determine whether cocktails with different antimicrobial activities can be designed that effectively remove all microbes and their eps that prevent swift microbial regrowth besides illustrating that the fundamental understanding of membrane biofouling has remained limited despite years of research this review highlights that opportunities exists that may provide universal answers to the biofouling problem of high pressure membranes and demand further investigation the hydrodynamic conditions have repeatedly been shown to have a strong effect on the bacterial community composition and membrane biofouling improved material design has led to progress in membrane functionality and applicability but development of improved spacer design is lacking behind the effect of nutrient levels and possible manners to control membrane biofouling via nutrient limitation poses another potential solution for many membrane installation and should be further investigated 7 outlook although written records of the treatment of fouled ship bottoms as early as the 5th century b c have been found the search for biofouling control strategies undoubtedly began with even earlier ships about which there is little information since the initial exploration of ro membranes in the 1950s membrane biofouling mechanisms and control strategies have been investigated in multiple momentous articles hans curt fleming recognized in the 1990s the importance of biofilm formation in membrane fouling and suggested several options to circumvent it flemming et al 1996 flemming et al 1997 flemming 1997 the major concerns on biofouling mitigation in high pressure membrane filtration have since then been shifted from optimization of operating conditions to regulation of microbial and in particular bacterial behaviour especially a combination of emerging advanced analytical tools and developing molecular microbiology allows us to better resolve the characteristics of microbial relevant foulants hitherto ngs tools have mainly been used to decipher bacterial communities the role of bacteriophages nematodes and other eukaryotes in the ecology of fouled membranes has remained elusive such information would bring insights into the applicability of dosing such organisms to control biofouling other examples include membrane surface modifications to mitigate microbial attachment or growth nutrient limitation or the use of bacterial predators such as bacterial grazers but reports of successful implementation of these alternative strategies in full scale operations are scarce although the understanding of membrane biofouling has substantially improved biofilm formation remains the main obstacle for high pressure membrane filtration hitherto cleaning in place lingers the only universal method to effectively reduce membrane biofouling of high pressure membranes although several alternatives have for many years been pursued to replace it a critical literature evaluation leads to the conclusion that a thorough understanding of the complete ecological organization of membrane biofilms that focusses on inter kingdom interactions is required to predict the effectiveness of alternative biofouling control strategies this illustrates the need for multidisciplinary approaches and collaboration to advance biofouling research an important factor that might explain the slow integration of prospective biofouling control strategies is the incomprehension to predict the effectiveness of alternative biofouling control strategies in full scale installations this might have hampered the decision making process for implementation of alternative cleaning strategies a standard method to grow and quantify membrane biofouling under reproducible conditions is therefore required to compare the effectiveness of different strategies between different laboratories the membrane fouling simulator approaches such a reference method most closely but lacks so far intra laboratory reproducibility author contributions section hendrik j de vries drafted the manuscript all

18132,high pressure membrane filtration reverse osmosis and nanofiltration is used to purify different water sources including wastewater surface water groundwater and seawater a major concern in membrane filtration is the accumulation and growth of micro organisms and their secreted polymeric substances leading to reduced membrane performance and membrane biofouling the fundamental understanding of membrane biofouling is limited despite years of research as the means of microbial interactions and response to the conditions on the membrane surface are complicated here we discuss studies that investigated the microbial diversity of fouled high pressure membranes high throughput amplicon sequencing of the 16s rrna gene have shown that burkholderiales pseudomonadales rhizobiales sphingomonadales and xanthomonadales frequently obtain a high relative abundance on fouled membranes the bacterial communities present in the diverse feed water types and in pre treatment compartments are different from the communities on the membrane because high pressure membrane filtration provides a selective environment for certain bacterial groups the biofilms that form within the pre treatment compartments do not commonly serve as an inoculum for the subsequent high pressure membranes besides bacteria also fungi are detected in the water treatment compartments in contrast to bacteria the fungal community does not change much throughout membrane cleaning the stable fungal diversity indicates that they are more significant in membrane biofouling than previously thought by reviewing the biodiversity and ecology of microbes in the whole high pressure membrane filtration water chain we have been able to identify potentials to improve biofouling control these include modulation of hydrodynamic conditions nutrient limitation and the combination of cleaning agents to target the entire membrane microbiome graphical abstract image 1 keywords membrane biofouling

freshwater demand but water scarcity exists due to mismanagement and spatial and temporal inequalities in the amount of natural supplied water mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 the global demand for freshwater has been growing due to urbanisation changing consumption patterns pollution and population increase and poses an important challenge today and in the future mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 savenije 2000 assessment of water availability at high temporal and spatial resolution shows that two thirds of the global population suffers from water scarcity at least one month per year mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 water scarcity prevails in areas with high population density or in highly irrigated districts or in areas with a combination of these the global increase in temperature will substantially increase the challenge to provide sufficient fresh water to the worldwide population postel et al 1996 schewe et al 2014 high pressure membranes including nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro remove most solutes producing clean and biological stable water as well as a waste stream called concentrate high pressure membrane filtration has become attractive for water purification improved material design has led to progress in membrane functionality permeability and selectivity and applicability mechanical and chemical stability lee et al 2011 high pressure membrane filtration now provides the option to remove most impurities such as hardness colour and disinfection products in a single purification step warsinger et al 2018 werber et al 2016 other advantages include low purchase costs and low space requirements membrane units can easily be scaled up and can be operated continuously and automatically bartels et al 2005 guo et al 2012 lin and elimelech 2015 this explains why membrane filtration has become the most important technology for seawater desalination caldera and breyer 2017 the use of high pressure membranes for purification of water sources other than seawater is growing and is stimulated by tightened discharge standards and concerns for micropollutants barbosa et al 2016 fu and wang 2011 sahinkaya et al 2018 a major challenge in membrane water filtration is to tackle fouling which decreases membrane performance due to the accumulation of particles and growth of microbes at the membrane surface peña et al 2013 a general classification of membrane fouling includes colloidal fouling suspended particles such as silica organic fouling natural organic matter inorganic fouling salts and biofouling microorganisms peña et al 2013 colloidal fouling can be reduced by e g sand bed filtration or by low pressure membrane filtration such as microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf voutchkov 2010 for inorganic scalants several removal possibilities exist such as acid precipitation lime softening or addition of scale inhibitors antiscalants badruzzaman et al 2019 organic fouling of high pressure membranes can be reduced by implementation of low pressure membrane filtration or by fluctuating the ph of the feed water to stimulate solubilisation high ph followed by low ph or vice versa preferably combined with a surfactant voutchkov 2010 biofouling is difficult to prevent and control flemming et al 1997 pre treatment systems including mf and uf membranes are unable to remove all micro organisms and those that pass may colonize the membrane badruzzaman et al 2019 greenlee et al 2009 as a consequence frequent membrane cleaning in place cip is required for most membrane installations to remove recalcitrant biofilms and safeguard product quantity beyer et al 2014 membrane cleaning is unwanted because it leads to operational costs and labour for maintenance membrane downtime and membrane damage greenlee et al 2009 shirazi et al 2010 membrane damage decreases selectivity and reduces product quality ultimately the membrane has to be replaced to certify consumers safety judd 2017 to better understand membrane biofouling many studies have described the microbiota present on membranes the focus of this review is to outline the membrane surface as selective microbial environment and the strategies that microbes use to survive grow and profit in this ecosystem 2 the membrane surface ecosystem the conditions at the membrane surface result from operational parameters and processes inherent to membrane filtration radu et al 2012 these include feed water characteristics such as nutritional levels and temperature hydrodynamic changes due to the feed spacer geometry and the arrangement of membrane modules in pressure vessels dreszer et al 2014 farhat et al 2016 radu et al 2014 shirazi et al 2010 suwarno et al 2012 in addition the local conditions on the membrane surface change during membrane operation and membrane cleaning nagaraj et al 2017a hence a broad range of conditions exist in a membrane module providing biotic and abiotic differences this complexity makes it difficult to link shifts in microbial composition to particular process parameters 2 1 a broad range of conditions can be encountered in membrane pressure vessels most high pressure membranes are spirally wound around a permeate tube to obtain a high membrane area to volume ratio and are arranged in membrane modules to increase the volume of produced water per volume of feed water multiple membrane modules are serially connected membrane modules are surrounded by a pressure vessel to provide mechanical stability within a pressure vessel the feed water enters at the lead module passes through the following modules and ultimately leaves the tail module as concentrate the flow rate and flow velocity of the feed water inherently decrease along the membrane module as water is pressed through the membrane while the concentration of inorganics and other solutes in the feed stream increases radu et al 2010 shirazi et al 2010 inorganic fouling for the latter reason commonly disrupts filtration of the tail modules khan et al 2014 peña et al 2013 in addition fluid friction decreases the feed pressure and velocity along all the membrane modules farias et al 2014 membrane permeation also creates a drag force that moves organics inorganics and microbes to the membrane surface fig 1 eshed et al 2008 subramani and hoek 2008 this results in the accumulation of solutes nutrients and microbes at the membrane surface semião et al 2014 song and elimelech 1995 commonly biofilm embedded bacteria grow slower than free floating bacteria because the extracellular polymeric substances eps embedded cells are limited of nutrients and oxygen due to diffusion limitation stewart 2003 permeation of the feed water across the membrane overcomes this limitation and biofilm embedded cells therefore grow faster at the membrane surface compared to free floating bacteria herzberg and elimelech 2007 in spite of enhanced cell attachment and stimulated growth biofilm formation is not initiated on the entire membrane picioreanu et al 2009 vrouwenvelder et al 2009 when membranes are operated under cross flow filtration the flow also moves parallel to the membrane surface fig 1 in contrast to the drag force high shear stress restricts biofilm growth on the membrane surface ying et al 2013 biofilm growth is therefore initially preserved to locations close to the feed spacer where shear stress is lower radu et al 2014 membrane shear forces which can be modulated by changing the cross flow velocity have a strong effect on the membrane microbiota al ashhab et al 2014a bacteria that produce eps or appendages that prevent membrane removal by frictional fluid forces will maintain themselves at the membrane or in the membrane associated biofilms de vries et al 2019 rehman et al 2019 differences in physiochemical conditions can therefore be found between different membrane plants as well as between different membrane modules within the same pressure vessel nagaraj et al 2017a 2 2 feed water quality plays a significant role in the progression of membrane biofouling to colonize synthetic membranes bacteria have to obtain nutrients and withstand the challenges that are present on the membrane surface under filtration conditions such as high shear stress and changes in ph chen et al 2013 radu et al 2014 yu et al 2017 the feed water quality plays a significant role in the progression of membrane biofouling but the ability to control membrane biofouling by modulating this factor has remained largely unexplored beyer et al 2014 a cip interval of once a month is generally considered as imperative for stable membrane operation to purify surface water or seawater warsinger et al 2018 by exception the performance of membranes that are fed with anoxic groundwater is stable for extended time periods due to the low concentration of dissolved oxygen and nutrients cip frequencies of less than once a year are common practice for membranes filtering anoxic groundwater beyer et al 2014 in most source water types the availability of oxygen and nutrients mainly in the form of natural organic matter nom is sufficient for bacteria to rapidly colonize and grow on the membranes and as a consequence deteriorate membrane performance park et al 2018 lakes and rivers and their discharge locations in seas and oceans are rich in nom that originates from terrestrial inflow matilainen et al 2011 marine environments are rich in nom that originates from primary production arndt et al 2013 fabris et al 2008 high molecular weight hmw compounds such as phenols lignins tannins and humic substances are readily available in surface and marine water because due to their insolubility and size a limit number of micro organisms are able to degrade these molecules matilainen et al 2011 simon et al 2013 although these compounds are usually rather efficiently removed by pre treatment systems they still can cause organic fouling lee et al 2004 seidel and elimelech 2002 hence feed water quality determines to a great extend which nutrients accumulate at the membrane surface irrespectively of the pre treatment system proteins and carbohydrates are readily biodegradable and are except during algal blooms generally present at low concentrations compared to hmw compounds guastalli et al 2013 jeong et al 2016 simon et al 2013 micro organisms that are able to degrade hmw compounds therefore have a profound advantage on the membrane surface corvini et al 2006 kurzbaum et al 2017 pandit et al 2016 vashi et al 2018 3 the microbiomes of synthetic membranes the diversity and abundance of bacterial groups on high pressure membranes has been investigated and confirmed using different techniques fig 2 most of these studies have used molecular techniques such as quantitative pcr pcr gradient gel electrophoresis gge and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms t rflp in recent years next generation sequencing ngs has greatly expanded the ability to uncover microbial community compositions of diverse environments studies using ngs have shown that certain bacterial taxa frequently occur in membrane biofouling and that membrane surfaces often have their own microbiome the number of studies using culture dependent techniques aiming to understand the physiological traits of bacteria involved in membrane fouling is limited de vries et al 2019 nagaraj et al 2019 pang et al 2005 from those studies it was not well feasible to reveal how bacteria interact and respond to conditions on the membrane surface how the membrane surface behaves as ecosystem a community together with its environment functioning as a unit remains enigmatic 3 1 bacterial identification techniques the recognition of ribosomal rna rrna as phylogenetic marker by carl r woese and george e fox led to a paradigm shift to evolutionary biology woese and fox 1977 identification of bacteria archaea and fungi was conventionally based on phenotypical characteristics and was laborious and time consuming but less valuable for reliable identification amann et al 1995 woese et al 1990 cultivability however is the only secure and operational definition of viability and enables direct biochemical phylogenetic and physiological characterisation of a single strain 16s rrna gene sequences provide an objective tool to delineate bacteria and archaea rational taxonomic boundaries have been described to distinguish their taxonomical ranks such as species 98 65 gene sequence similarity and genus 94 5 gene sequence similarity stackebrandt 2006 stackebrandt and goebel 1994 yarza et al 2017 taxonomic classification of the fungal kingdom has conventionally been hampered by the large physiological diversity of its members and by the morphological transitions of many fungal species berbee et al 2017 geiser et al 2006 hibbett et al 2007 the fungus kingdom includes moulds mushrooms lichens rusts smuts and yeasts stajich et al 2009 unlike bacteria and archaea selection of the most appropriate genetic marker for taxonomic classification is still under debate for the fungal kingdom schoch et al 2012 the use of marker genes such as the 16s and 18s rrna gene has led to development of quantitative and semi quantitative molecular identification techniques including the polymerase chain reaction pcr fluorescent in situ hybridisation fish and next generation sequencing ngs delong et al 1989 metzker 2010 white et al 1989 pcr revolutionized biological science because it enabled to amplify preselected segments of dna or rna to quantities which permit sequencing white et al 1989 standard pcr alone is unreliable for dna quantification but in combination with other techniques it can be used for quantitative or semi quantitative identification examples of such technologies are quantitative pcr qpcr pcr gradient gel electrophoresis gge and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms t rflp marsh 1999 nakatsu 2007 tabit 2016 thies 2007 t rflp qpcr and gge are laborious time consuming and have low resolving power hence many low abundant microbes will remain undetected using these identification methods ngs platforms provide the ability to study bacterial community compositions in a culture independent and high throughput manner metzker 2010 shokralla et al 2012 these techniques identify microorganisms via comparative analysis which enables to study the relationship between micro organisms and their environment in an expeditious manner many ngs platforms are available launched by roche 454 pyrosequencing from 2013 this platform stopped illumina including miseq hiseq and nextseq oxford nanopore techniques with nanopore sequencing pacific biosystems with pacbio sequencing and ion torrents with the ion proton sequencer claesson et al 2010 glenn 2011 goodwin et al 2016 metzker 2010 each platform has its advantages and disadvantages that are outside the scope of this review but have been reviewed by metzker 2010 the microbiota of high pressure membranes have been investigated using pyrosequencing illumina sequencing and the ion proton sequencer table 2 disadvantages of ngs techniques is that analysis is time consuming and the purchase costs are still rather high although prices get lower without additional sample preparation ngs platforms cannot provide information about the spatial organization of the microorganisms present fluorescent in situ hybridisation fish is based on hybridisation of a fluorescently labelled probe to its target rna and is therefore linked to metabolic activity amann et al 1995 frickmann et al 2017 fish probes commonly target rna of ribosomal marker genes but also the rna of key functional genes have been used frickmann et al 2017 wagner et al 2003 fish provides the major advantage that expression of multiple functional genes can simultaneously be investigated in situ frickmann et al 2017 wagner et al 2003 a disadvantage is that this method is laborious time consuming and its applicability is limited to organisms from which sequence data is available amann et al 1995 frickmann et al 2017 technological advances and method optimization provide opportunities to further increase the understanding of fouled membranes as microbial environment although 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing delivers high throughput output it is limited to characterise microbial diversity instead by sequencing all available genomes or available rna transcripts metagenomic and metatranscriptomics approaches reveal the functional potential and the functional activity of the microbiome respectively simon and daniel 2011 in the first and hitherto only study applying a metagenomic approach to characterise the microbial community in a full scale ro plant 25 metagenome assembled genomes mags were recently recovered from a fouled membrane rehman et al 2019 comparison of these 25 mags to the 6 mags recovered from the intake seawater and brine revealed that the bacterial membrane microbiome carries quorum quenching genes but no quorum sensing genes hence implying that quorum quenching is a successful bacterial strategy to outcompete bacteria that use signalling molecules to regulate biofilm formation and membrane colonization rehman et al 2019 metatransciptomics has so far not been used to analyse fouled membranes but provide the ability to characterise the functional activity of the membrane microbiome and hence its response to different selection pressures in high spatial and temporal resolution moran et al 2013 one general disadvantage of molecular techniques is that identification of the identified genes is always limited by the reference database 3 2 the orders burkholderiales pseudomonadales rhizobiales sphingomonadales and xanthomonadales are frequently dominant on fouled membranes within the bacterial domain six taxonomic levels are defined from high to low taxonomic level these include phylum class order family genus and species the lowest taxonomic level that can be determined by molecular techniques is dependent on the identification method and has changed over time due to technical innovations glenn 2011 goodwin et al 2016 metzker 2010 published studies therefore do not uniformly present the bacterial community composition at the same taxonomic level and this makes comparison of bacterial diversity between different studies cumbersome for this review we compared 33 studies that investigated bacterial communities on fouled high pressure membranes and we have classified the identified bacteria at the order level table 1 and supplementary table s1 when possible the lower taxonomic levels are also discussed in total 35 bacterial orders were documented from these fouled high pressure membranes these orders were used as benchmark to compare the microbial diversity of feed water pre treatment compartments and fouled membranes and disclose the role of particular selection pressures on the microbial composition bacteria belonging to the orders burkholderiales pseudomonadales rhizobiales and sphingomonadales and xanthomonadales are most frequently detected on fouled membranes burkholderiales and xanthomonadales were not detected in earlier studies but ngs studies have frequently detected these orders on fouled membranes in this review we refer to the burkholderiales pseudomonadales rhizobiales sphingomonadales and xanthomonadales orders as frequently detected taxa many of the early studies used methods that were biased in their identification ability for instance towards cultivable organisms more recent studies using ngs commonly describe the taxa with the highest relative abundance but do not report on the rare taxa hence the actual bacterial community composition of fouled high pressure membranes is more diverse than will be possible to describe here 3 3 biofilm formation a strategy to grow and increase resilience biofilm formation constitutes a lifestyle in which microorganisms adopt a multicellular behavior and has been acknowledged to be the main cause of membrane biofouling flemming et al 1996 stewart et al 2001 the self produced matrix progresses biofilm embedded cells into sophisticated spatial organizations that vary in oxygen and nutrient concentration ph values and viscosities costerton et al 1994 1995 glud et al 1998 the ecological organization of biofilms is complex and facilitates bacterial survival in a variety of environmental niches flemming et al 2016 because the eps layer acts as a physical barrier it alleviates the embedded cells to for instance the perturbing effects of cleaning agents containing chlorine and strong ph changes chen and stewart 1996 jang et al 2006 nadell et al 2016 the versatile binding sites within the eps matrix provide biofilm embedded cells advantages under oligotrophic conditions as different substrates become entrapped battin et al 2016 a part of the biofilm population called the persister cells is tolerant for biocides because they are metabolically inactive spoering and lewis 2001 persisters are a small part of the whole community but their offspring may become abundant after they shift to an actively growing state when most of the other cells of the biofilm have been killed during for instance membrane cleaning hall stoodley et al 2004 synergistic interactions and metabolic dependency generally increase the overall biomass produced in multispecies biofilms burmølle et al 2014 giaouris et al 2013 liu et al 2018 ren et al 2015 van der veen and abee 2011 due to their multispecies composition natural biofilms are composed of phenotypically distinct bacteria that can either cooperate or compete for resources nadell et al 2016 a regulatory network is therefore important for each cell to fine tune its investment costs in profitable cooperative traits while antagonistic competitors are opposed quorum sensing qs the secretion and response to signal molecules called autoinducers provide bacteria the tool to assess local cell densities and act accordingly by expressing the most suitable set of genes this signaling circuit is used by clonal clusters of genetically identical cells to limit exploitation within multispecies biofilms bacteria within clonal clusters secrete and sense the same qs signals and respond uniformly so that exploitation by competitors is avoided nadell et al 2016 qs has shown to effectively reduce biofilm formation under laboratory conditions but metagenomic analysis of indicates that genes involved in quenching qs signals rather than genes required for qs are identified in biofilms on fouled ro membranes how survival strategies simultaneously mediate community assembly on the membrane and whether such strategies are conserved within certain bacterial taxa is not understood moreover a limited number of studies has investigated the molecular changes in eps composition during the membrane operation nagaraj et al 2017b bereschenko et al 2011 investigated the effect of conventional cleaning treatment and occurrence and development of biofouling in ro membrane units bereschenko et al 2011 over a period of 6 months membrane surfaces were cleaned once a week with a conventional acid cleaner only sphingomonas species that are typically localized at the biofilm base were able to survive the chemical cleaning procedures bereschenko et al 2011 members of the sphingomonas genus are versatile bacteria that are widely spread in natural water environments and man made water systems balkwill et al 2006 glaeser and kämpfer 2014 amongst the bacterial community they are strong competitors in scavenging a variety of nutrients under oligotrophic conditions and they contribute to cleaning associated stability of bacterial biofilms bereschenko et al 2010 2011 lal et al 2006 stolz 2014 waigi et al 2017 moreover they secrete sphingans a group of structurally closely related eps that effectively protect bacteria against extreme ph temperature salinity and pressure garcía et al 2018 pollock 1993 xu et al 2015 this provides a further explanation for the selection of eps producing bacteria by membrane cleaning agents therefore eps quality and not quantity could be a determining factor in occurrence of cleaning associated biofilms nagaraj et al 2017b the long search for alternative membrane cleaning strategies is just one example that illustrates the difficulty of controlling biofilms flemming et al 1996 examples of alternative strategies to alleviate membrane biofouling include nutrient limitation surface modification quorum quenching and biological control via bacteriophages and microfaunal predators based on the current knowledge it appears that membrane surface modifications are in fact incompatible to control biofilm formation in full scale membrane operations due to drag force that transferrers bacteria and nutrients to the membrane surface as different components are transferred by the drag force to the membrane surface it is swiftly covered and membrane surface modifications are rendered less effective governing bacterial communication by quenching qs signals could switch the biofilm condition in aquatic environments in terms of controlling and replacing the microbes hong et al 2012 wood et al 2016 qs permits bacteria to effectively regulate biofilm formation under static conditions but this process becomes less efficient when the signal molecules are removed by the flow under turbulent settings purevdorj et al 2002 hence the use of quorum quenching natural agents is a promising approach to control biofouling although it remains to be established which role qs circuits plays in membrane biofouling kalia and purohit 2011 in that context the development of less or selectively toxic antibacterial agents capable of clearing biofilms would be timely here the use of bacteriophages that effect phage mediated biocontrol of bacteria phage therapy purified phage encoded enzymes that digest bacterial cell wall material endolysins or phage encoded enzymes that digest the eps eps depolymerases chan and abedon 2015 these agents have been shown to reduce the bacterial density of a diversity of biofilms and in many cases tend to be non toxic chan and abedon 2015 although reports on such alternatives provide promising perspectives their success to alleviate membrane biofouling over prolonged periods still has to be established on multispecies models this is a particularly important quest due to the potential selective pressure they microfaunal predators and bacteriophages exert on the bacterial community jousset 2012 scanlan and buckling 2012 bacteria producing filaments and aggregates but also small bacteria have a strong selective advantage and higher survival rate in the presence of bacterial grazers such as nematodes jousset 2012 similarly lytic phages select for bacteria to develop mucoid biofilms that are difficult to control scanlan and buckling 2012 the naturally high abundant bacteriophages in marine water raises question about their infection rates and how their success in alleviating membrane biofouling can be increased scanlan and buckling 2012 4 colonization of high pressure membranes the membrane surface can be colonized by microbes transported by the feed water comparison of the bacterial community composition of pristine unused membranes to fouled membranes has shown that most bacteria causing membrane fouling have a feed water origin and are absent on the pristine membranes nagaraj et al 2017a the frequently detected taxa are commonly present at low relative abundance in the different feed water types and in the different pre treatment compartments 4 1 the bacterial diversity on the membrane and in the feed water is different high pressure membranes are operated using a variety of feed water types including seawater surface water groundwater and wastewater effluents in marine environments the relative abundance of bacterial taxa is affected by seasonal changes such as temperature differences day length nutrient composition and concentration fuhrman et al 2015 in the upper marine layers where light and oxygen easily penetrate the phototrophic sar11 e g pelagibacterales sar86 sar116 clusters and the cyanobacteria prochlorococcus and synechococcus are dominant during spring blooms fuhrman et al 2015 morris et al 2002 table 2 shows the bacteria in marine environments that are typically abundant in the feed waters of high pressure membranes the relative abundance of these microbes however is low at the surface of high pressure membranes table 2 khan et al 2013a 2013b levi et al 2016 manes et al 2011b zodrow et al 2014 these differences in occupancy suggest that the conditions at the membrane surface are selective for certain bacterial phenotypic traits the dominant bacteria in secondary and tertiary effluent streams that originate from wastewater sources do not become dominant members of the biofilm community at the membrane surface table 2 al ashhab et al 2014a ferrera et al 2015 al ashhab et al 2014a compared the bacterial diversity of an ro membrane biofilm with the artificial tertiary wastewater that was used as feed water and showed that the bacterial community on the ro membrane clustered separately from the feed water communities the orders that were abundant in the feed waters burkholderiales rhizobiales and sphingomonadales with a cumulative relative abundance of 45 6 were also present on the membrane although at a much lower relative abundance 17 5 al ashhab et al 2014a in feed water originating from surface and groundwater burkholderiales janthinobacterium sphingomonadales were dominant table 2 el chakhtoura et al 2015 forbes et al 2016 lin et al 2014 liu et al 2014 navarro noya et al 2013 shaw et al 2015 these orders correspond to those found on fouled membranes that are fed with these water types suggesting that ground water and surface water serve as inoculum for membrane biofilms bereschenko et al 2008 2010 2011 chiellini et al 2012 bereschenko et al 2008 compared the bacterial diversity of the surface water and the membrane community and it was concluded that that the biofilm was actively formed on the membrane surface rather than being a concentration effect of bacteria overall the composition of the bacterial community on the membrane is generally different from the feed water as only a fraction of the bacterial feed water diversity accumulates at the membrane surface indicating that the membrane surface provides bacterial selection pressures bereschenko et al 2008 however hörsch et al 2005 found that the bacterial composition of a mature fouling layer was similar to the composition of the feed water and concluded that in contrast to the study of bereschenko et al 2008 growth played a minor role in the biofouling process hörsch et al 2005 the difference between these studies is the identification technique and the resolution to which the bacterial community composition was delineated hörsch used fish to distinguish bacteria at the at the phylum level while bereschenko identified bacteria at the species level via clone libraries of the 16s rrna gene sequence this exemplifies that the microbial diversity should be targeted and delineated to lower taxonomic levels such as to species or at least family level to understand ongoing microbial processes 4 2 feed water pre treatment strategies and their effect on bacterial communities the composition of the feed water determines which pre treatment strategy is most appropriate to control membrane fouling voutchkov 2010 two parameters that are commonly reported to assess the feed water quality are the silt density index sdi used as a measure for the amount of submicron particulates and turbidity to measure water clarity badruzzaman et al 2019 conventionally feed water pre treatment for high pressure membrane filtration is typically performed by a combination of processes coagulation and flocculation followed by granular media filtration e g anthracite coal silica sand or garnet and cartridge filtration fig 3 voutchkov 2010 biocides such as chlorine and peracetic acid but also ozone or uv can be applied when biofouling is a concern bucs et al 2018 pre treatment strategies are designed to remove the microbial load on high pressure membranes but could scavenge nutrients and potentially provide a suitable environment for microbial growth comparison of the bacterial community composition can therefore answer whether pre treatment compartments serve as inoculum for high pressure membranes in conventional pre treatment systems cartridge filters cf are commonly used as final step to remove suspended solids fig 3 alawadhi 1997 commonly cartridge filters with micron ratings between 1 and 10 μm are used these filters remove bacteria incompletely but depending on the feed water quality and the micron rating cartridge filtration may remove suspended solids chua et al 2003 leparc et al 2007 the bacterial community of cf is commonly different from that of the succeeding ro membrane at least in in full scale facilities bereschenko et al 2008 chun et al 2012 levi et al 2016 zhang et al 2011 comparison of the bacterial community composition between different compartments of fourteen full scale water desalination plants has shown that the dominant bacteria on the ro membrane are absent from or are a minor component of the bacterial community of the preceding cartridge filters zhang et al 2011 similarly chun et al 2012 detected that members of the ruegeria pseudoruegeria parvularcula legionella and shigella are the only bacterial groups shared between the cf and ro membrane table 3 phaeobacter leisingera kangiella and bacillales are abundant on the cf while haliangium and limnobacter are abundant on the ro membrane on the cartridge filters the presence of bacteria belonging to taxa harbouring facultative and obligate chemolithotrophs such as geobacter desulfuromusa and thioalkalivibrio seems to indicate that the pre treatment compartments effectively removed certain nutritional compounds such as ferrous iron or sulfur chun et al 2012 this removal can account for the different bacterial community composition between the cf and the ro community members of the sar11 cluster have been found in high relative abundance on both the cartridge filter and the ro membrane table 3 the relative abundance of this cluster varied seasonally between 10 to 30 and 64 77 on the cf and ro membrane respectively levi et al 2016 because the relative abundance of the sar11 cluster was low in the compartments that preceded the cf membrane rapid sand filtration relative abundance of 0 4 8 4 the cf might have stimulated growth of members of the sar11 cluster and as such function as inoculum for the high pressure membranes sar11 is ubiquitous in marine environments and found in near shore waters to depths of 3 000 m hanson et al 2012 morris et al 2002 sunagawa et al 2015 physiological traits of these bacteria are largely unknown because despite being ubiquitous members of the sar11 cluster have rarely been isolated henson et al 2018 giovannoni and vergin 2012 rappé et al 2002 the sar11 bacteria are among the smallest free living cells in culture with cell length of 0 37 0 89 μm and have limited metabolic flexibility henson et al 2018 giovannoni and vergin 2012 rappé et al 2002 based on these morphological traits it was concluded that the size of these bacteria might have provided them a benefit to access the high pressure membranes as they might more easily pass the cf compared to larger bacteria levi et al 2016 dual media dm filters are conventionally used to remove soluble organics and are typically composed of a 1 0 2 0 m layer of sand covered by 0 4 0 8 m of anthracite badruzzaman et al 2019 granular activated carbon can be used instead of anthracite to reduce high levels of organics naidu et al 2013 anis et al 2019 dm filters and ro membranes harbour different biofilm communities jeong et al 2017 on the dm filter phototrophic and nitrite oxidizing bacteria such as trichodesmium and nitrospira are abundant but their relative abundance is below detection level on the ro membrane table 3 the bacterial community composition of dm and ro filter becomes more similar when they are continuously cleaned by chlorination under these conditions erythrobacter and sphingomonas and hyphomonas increase in relative abundance and become dominant on dm filters and downstream ro membranes whether the dm filters served in this case as inoculum is unknown but these results indicate that the selection pressure on the bacterial diversity caused by continuous chlorination overcomes the selection pressures imposed by the different media types e g dm filters and ro filters jeong et al 2017 low pressure membranes mf and uf are applied as pre treatment systems for high pressure membranes and their use has increased in recent years due to capital cost reductions huang et al 2009 wolf et al 2005 typically low pressure membranes filtration systems remove particles at 0 1 μm mf membranes or 0 01 μm uf membranes and may reduce sdi values to below 2 anis et al 2019 low pressure membranes remove bacteria with log reduction values of 4 and biofouling is therefore reduced but not prevented ghayeni et al 1999 jacangelo et al 1989 molelekwa et al 2014 the communities of mf and uf compartments have a different bacterial composition compared to the downstream high pressure membranes table 3 chen et al 2004 ghayeni et al 1998 herzberg et al 2010 lee et al 2010 manes et al 2011a similarly to the cf community the mf filter harbours facultative and obligate chemolithotrophs including the iron reducing geothrix fermentans and the homoacetogen holophaga foetida chen et al 2004 this suggests that nutritional conditions are a determining factor for the bacterial community compositions of the mf and ro when uf is used as pre treatment step the genera erythrobacter planctomycete and ruegeria become dominant on downstream ro membranes table 3 members of these genera are below detection limit on the uf membrane and in the uf effluent confirming that the relative abundance of bacterial groups in the uf effluent does not correlate with the microbial community of the downstream ro membranes chen et al 2004 chlorine is the most widely used disinfectant due to its ease of use and low cost du et al 2017 in this review we distinguish between continuous dosing of chlorine as pre treatment process and intermitted chlorination as membrane cleaning process chlorination effectively kills biomass on the ro membrane but based on molecular analysis some bacterial groups appear to tolerate this biocide bacterial classes that are well known to resist chlorine due to their ability to sporulate are bacilli and clostridia wyatt and waites 1975 these classes and in particular bacilli have been identified on fouled membranes that in many cases used chlorination as pre treatment step baker and dudley 1998 belila et al 2016 chen et al 2004 chiellini et al 2012 ivnitsky et al 2007 khan et al 2015 lee et al 2009 ridgway et al 1983 zodrow et al 2014 the use of the biocides k5030 isothiazoline based and fr110 inorganic base type of combined chlorine agent to uf effluent led to major bacterial community shifts on the downstream ro membrane tan et al 2017 the alcaligenaceae family cyclobacteriaceae family and the rhizobiales order are dominant when biocide dosing is not part of the pre treatment process are effectively removed when k5030 and fr110 are dosed table 3 instead pseudoxanthomonas stenotrophomonas and thermomonas pseudomonas and sphingopyxis increase in relative abundance when biocides are dosed table 3 4 3 different membrane cleaning agents select for distinct bacterial communities membrane biofouling layers can be removed using alkaline or acid solutions metal chelating agents surfactants enzymes and oxidizing agents li and elimelech 2004 base acid cleaning removes organic foulants on membranes and destroys the microbial cell walls ang et al 2006 metal chelating agents and surfactants can be used to disintegrate eps layers by removal of divalent cations and solubilisation of macromolecules respectively al amoudi and lovitt 2007 the efficiency of cleaning agents to remove biofouling is limited because the eps layer is recalcitrant against cleaning agents improvement of cleaning efficiency is difficult particularly for aged biofilms membrane cleaning frequently removes only part of the fouling layer and cleaned membranes therefore provide a suitable environment for swift microbial colonization beyer et al 2017 membranes used in full scale operation therefore have to be cleaned frequently after the membrane is cleaned the bacterial diversity of the membrane more closely resembles the feed water community compared to the membrane community before cleaning yu et al 2017 from this point onwards the bacterial diversity at the membrane surface increases till it is moderately fouled but then declines till the membrane is cleaned again al ashhab et al 2017 these fluctuations in bacterial diversity indicate that the conditions on the membrane surface change during membrane fouling khan et al 2015 initially nutrients are abundantly present on cleaned membranes but when the biofilm matures community members have to compete for resources as nutrients become limiting leading to overgrowth of well adapted bacteria kim et al 2014 availability and depletion of nutrients could together with the membrane cleaning events therefore provide an explanation for the changes in species richness of fouling membranes different bacterial groups have shown to succeed and thrive when membranes are cleaned intermitted with different cleaning agents al ashhab et al 2017 bereschenko et al 2011 chun et al 2012 jeong et al 2017 khan et al 2015 oh et al 2018 tan et al 2017 yu et al 2017 inclusion of citric acid led to a different community composition compared to when chlorine was used alone khan et al 2015 acinetobacter ralstonia comamonadaceae and diaphorobacter stenotrophomonas and enterobacteriaceae are dominant on membranes that are cleaned by chlorination when chlorination is combined with citric acid cleaning silicibacter and rhodobacteraceae pseudomonas pedobacter and janthinobacterium became abundant based on physiological features assigned to taxonomically related bacteria and atp concentrations it was suggested that spore formers gram positive bacteria and acidophiles better resist citric acid treatment khan et al 2015 these suggestions have to be regarded with caution as no evidence was provided that any of identified bacteria is recalcitrant against citric acid khan et al 2015 5 eukaryotic and archaeal diversity most studies investigating the membrane microbiota of fouled high pressure membranes have focussed on bacteria and neglected the archaeal and eukaryotic diversity al ashhab et al 2017 baker and dudley 1998 belgini et al 2018 chiellini et al 2012 those studies that did investigate the archaeal diversity show that it is similar to the bacterial diversity high in the feed water and decreases within the high pressure membranes al ashhab et al 2014b archaeal communities on the ro membrane are dominated by the phyla crenarchaeota and euryarchaeota al ashhab et al 2014b terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the 18s rrna gene sequences has shown that the eukaryotic community of a ro membrane used for river water purification was composed for 34 of fungal and 53 of amoebozoa chiellini et al 2012 unlike the bacterial and archaeal community the fungal community composition of fouled ro membranes is comparable to that of the feed water community and remains the same during membrane cleaning al ashhab et al 2017 this evenness in fungal diversity indicates either that the membrane surface after cleaning is rapidly colonized by the same fungal taxa or that membrane cleaning removes fungi less effectively compared to bacteria 5 1 members of interkingdom biofilms benefit from cross protection studies investigating the microbial community composition using ngs have shown that when tertiary wastewater is used as feed water the fungal community of the high pressure membrane is dominated by ascomycota basidiomycota and glomeromycota al ashhab et al 2014b in a study that used clone libraries which identified fungi to the genus level the identified genera belong to the phylum ascomycota belgini et al 2018 during membrane cleaning the relative abundance of ascomycota increases at the expense of basidiomycota abundant fungal ascomycota classes on cleaned membranes include eurotiomycetes saccharomycetes and dothideomycetes al ashhab et al 2017 diverse fungi are capable of biofilm growth or develop biofilm like communities blankenship and mitchell 2006 inter kingdom biofilms containing both fungi and bacteria are ubiquitously present in nature and lead to close interactions which can either be mutualistic or symbiotic hogan and kolter 2002 romano and kolter 2005 bacteria and fungi become highly recalcitrant for most of the antibiotics in inter kingdom biofilms and are recognized as a serious problem especially in clinical settings due to cross protection adam et al 2002 shirtliff et al 2009 whether inter kingdom biofilms also provide cross protection for biocides is not well studied but it is known that microbial susceptibility towards biocides differs greatly per kingdom russell 2003 many bactericidal biocides including chlorine are less effective against fungi pereira et al 2013 this is in line with the culturable microbial diversity obtained from more than a hundred membrane autopsies which showed that problematic membranes biofilms which were ineffectively removed using chlorine had a higher fungal incidence baker and dudley 1998 recalcitrant fungi pose a potential problem for the food industry medical centres pharmaceutical cleanrooms and for drinking water facilities as they increase the chance for recalcitrant infections and biofouling al gabr et al 2014 cauda 2009 sandle et al 2014 videla 2002 in clinical settings inter kingdom biofilms are frequently composed of the fungal genus albicans and the bacterial genus pseudomonas cauda 2009 harriott and noverr 2011 it appears that inter kingdom biofilms on fouled membranes are composed of the same genera al ashhab et al 2014b 2017 the interactions between fungi and bacteria might affect membrane cleaning efficiency and consequently biofouling control however studies investigating these interactions are lacking the role that fungi play in membrane biofouling may have been underestimated due to their relative low number compared to bacteria al ashhab et al 2017 this has recently been shown for ro membranes used in the food industry vitzilaiou et al 2019 the relationship between relative abundance and contribution to community ecology has at least for bacteria been questioned liu et al 2017 low abundant bacterial species may shift the relative abundance of other bacteria substantially and play therefore an important role in the fate of the multispecies biofilm liu et al 2017 cell count is an ambivalent measure to express contribution to membrane biofouling when comparing bacteria with fungi particularly due to the typical differences in cell volume between members of these kingdoms bloem et al 1995 besides tolerance towards chlorine other physiological traits will most likely provide fungi advantages on the membrane surface members of the saccharomycetes produce melanins cell wall pigments that confer resistance against multiple stressors including extreme temperatures desiccation and radiation muggia et al 2016 one member of the saccharomycetes aureobasidium pullulans thrives in a wide range of conditions and is able to attach to moisturized plasticized surfaces using its hyphae which might aid in membrane colonization webb et al 1999 a pullulans has the ability to form biofilms and grows under hypersaline acidic and alkaline conditions and at different nutrient concentrations muggia and grube 2018 but the large number of unclassified fungi and the high physiological diversity between order members makes physiological predictions prone to inaccuracies stajich et al 2009 yarza et al 2017 6 conclusions the role of bacteria in membrane biofouling of high pressure membranes is unequivocal and has been confirmed using a variety of techniques ngs platforms have been fundamental for determining the composition of the membrane bacterial biota a broad range of conditions can be found within a single pressure vessel and the effect of these abiotic and biotic variations is reflected by the abundance of many different bacteria taxa along membrane elements as biofilm formation on membrane surfaces is complex it is important for future studies to include a description about the cleaning agent cleaning frequency feed water temperature location of the membrane element in the pressure vessel and on the sampling location at the membrane because molecular techniques are limited by the reference database taxonomical features of the detected microbes will only lead to accurate prediction of physiological features once representative members have been functionally characterized the low number of physiologically characterized bacteria isolated from fouled membranes therefore provides a major limitation to understand how they interact and respond to the conditions at the membrane surface reference genomes are important for capturing information on metabolic properties the use of metagenome assembled genomes could therefor generate valuable physiological information from uncultivated bacteria this approach was only recently used for the first time to characterise the microbial community in a full scale ro plant rehman et al 2019 most studies so far have neglected the archaeal and fungal community present on fouled membranes as interkingdom biofilms commonly benefit cross protection the understanding of the complete collection of microbial interactions at the membrane surface may be important for the design of more efficient cleaning strategies particularly fungi might contribute more to the membrane biofouling problem than previously anticipated as they are more recalcitrant against bacterial biocides the cleaning frequency of fouled membranes can be reduced by using anoxic groundwater seawater below the epipelagic zone is poor in nom and the lower temperature and oxygen concentrations might in analogy to anoxic groundwater pose an opportunity for desalination purposes but although oxygen is limited sulphide provides bacteria an electron donor and alternative energy source and biofouling is therefore to be expected this review made clear that different cleaning agents select for distinct bacterial communities further research is required to determine whether cocktails with different antimicrobial activities can be designed that effectively remove all microbes and their eps that prevent swift microbial regrowth besides illustrating that the fundamental understanding of membrane biofouling has remained limited despite years of research this review highlights that opportunities exists that may provide universal answers to the biofouling problem of high pressure membranes and demand further investigation the hydrodynamic conditions have repeatedly been shown to have a strong effect on the bacterial community composition and membrane biofouling improved material design has led to progress in membrane functionality and applicability but development of improved spacer design is lacking behind the effect of nutrient levels and possible manners to control membrane biofouling via nutrient limitation poses another potential solution for many membrane installation and should be further investigated 7 outlook although written records of the treatment of fouled ship bottoms as early as the 5th century b c have been found the search for biofouling control strategies undoubtedly began with even earlier ships about which there is little information since the initial exploration of ro membranes in the 1950s membrane biofouling mechanisms and control strategies have been investigated in multiple momentous articles hans curt fleming recognized in the 1990s the importance of biofilm formation in membrane fouling and suggested several options to circumvent it flemming et al 1996 flemming et al 1997 flemming 1997 the major concerns on biofouling mitigation in high pressure membrane filtration have since then been shifted from optimization of operating conditions to regulation of microbial and in particular bacterial behaviour especially a combination of emerging advanced analytical tools and developing molecular microbiology allows us to better resolve the characteristics of microbial relevant foulants hitherto ngs tools have mainly been used to decipher bacterial communities the role of bacteriophages nematodes and other eukaryotes in the ecology of fouled membranes has remained elusive such information would bring insights into the applicability of dosing such organisms to control biofouling other examples include membrane surface modifications to mitigate microbial attachment or growth nutrient limitation or the use of bacterial predators such as bacterial grazers but reports of successful implementation of these alternative strategies in full scale operations are scarce although the understanding of membrane biofouling has substantially improved biofilm formation remains the main obstacle for high pressure membrane filtration hitherto cleaning in place lingers the only universal method to effectively reduce membrane biofouling of high pressure membranes although several alternatives have for many years been pursued to replace it a critical literature evaluation leads to the conclusion that a thorough understanding of the complete ecological organization of membrane biofilms that focusses on inter kingdom interactions is required to predict the effectiveness of alternative biofouling control strategies this illustrates the need for multidisciplinary approaches and collaboration to advance biofouling research an important factor that might explain the slow integration of prospective biofouling control strategies is the incomprehension to predict the effectiveness of alternative biofouling control strategies in full scale installations this might have hampered the decision making process for implementation of alternative cleaning strategies a standard method to grow and quantify membrane biofouling under reproducible conditions is therefore required to compare the effectiveness of different strategies between different laboratories the membrane fouling simulator approaches such a reference method most closely but lacks so far intra laboratory reproducibility author contributions section hendrik j de vries drafted the manuscript all

18133,pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps are increasingly being scrutinized by the scientific community due to their environmental persistence therefore the development of novel environmentally compatible and energy efficient technologies for their removal is highly anticipated in this work a novel metal free photocatalytic nanoreactor was successfully synthesized by anchoring carbon dots to hollow carbon nitride nanospheres hcns cds the unique structure of these hollow nanospherical hcns cds hybrids endowed them with a high population of reactive sites while enhancing optical absorption due to internal light reflection simultaneously the cds served as artificial antennas to absorb and convert photons with low energy due to their superior up converting properties consequently the hcns cds demonstrated excellent photodegradation activities for the degradation of ppcps under broad spectrum irradiation remarkedly 10 mg l of naproxen npx was completely degraded following 5 min of natural solar irradiation it was further revealed that the o2 played a significant role during the photocatalytic process which could lead to the decomposition of npx the effects of natural water matrices and the degradation of trace ppcps further supported that this photocatalytic system may be efficaciously applied for the remediation of ppcps contamination in ambient waterways graphical abstract image 1 keywords pharmaceutical and personal care products carbon dots graphitic carbon nitride hollow sphere photocatalytic 1 introduction in recent years the increasing presence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps in ambient waterways has raised serious concerns evgenidou et al 2015 guo et al 2018 due to the extensive use and pseudo persistence of ppcps their presence in the ambient environment has continually increased which can convey a range of potentially adverse effects on human health and natural ecosystems wang et al 2017a the removal of ppcps through conventional wastewater treatment technologies has been shown to be ineffective additionally there are inherent disadvantages associated with most of these processes including high energy consumption e g conventional activated sludge process etc carballa et al 2004 wang et al 2015 chen et al 2016 therefore the development of novel environmentally compatible and energy efficient technologies for the removal of ppcps is urgently required the photocatalytic degradation of organic contaminants using semiconductor based catalysts are recognized as a promising approach for curbing environmental contamination xie et al 2018 as a model photocatalyst tio2 has been widely employed for the remediation of environmental pollutants however its inherently broad energy gap 3 1 ev limits its capacity to absorb visible light dong et al 2015 given that uv light accounts for only 4 of the solar energy spectrum the development of broad spectrum light responsive nanomaterials that utilize photonic energy from uv to near infrared nir frequencies are required graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 is a metal free polymeric photocatalyst that has recently garnered significant attention due to its visible light response and favorable chemical stability wang et al 2009 2018a due to its superior properties g c3n4 has been applied to environmental remediation water splitting and co2 reduction hernandez uresti et al 2016 lv et al 2017 teng et al 2017 however the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron hole pairs poor visible light utilization and low specific surface area sbet 6 09 m2 g has limited its practical application wang et al 2012 to improve the photocatalytic activity of g c3n4 various strategies have been investigated including morphological control sun et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 modification with carbon materials zhao et al 2014 fang et al 2016 doping with metal non metal ions zhou et al 2015 yan et al 2016 and compositing with other semiconductors zhao et al 2015 liu et al 2015b among these techniques morphological control is considered to be the simplest and most effective strategy for improving photocatalytic activity as recognized through previous studies the structural tuning of g c3n4 may greatly enhance its specific surface area and reactive sites thereby improving its photocatalytic performance ma et al 2018 wang et al 2018c for example zheng et al successfully synthesized hollow carbon nitride nanospheres hcns they found that the interconnected inner and outer domains of the hollow hcns nanostructures could enhance optical absorption via the multiple photonic reflections thereby improving photocatalytic performance zheng et al 2015 although this hollow architecture obviously augmented visible light harvesting long wavelength visible and near infrared light could not be utilized due to the intrinsic g c3n4 band gap 2 7 ev as an ecofriendly carbon based nanomaterial carbon dots cds have recently been widely utilized in biosensing bioimaging and chemical sensing due to their low toxicity easy synthesis and high chemical stability xia et al 2016 niu et al 2016 wang et al 2019 significantly cds cannot only inhibit the recombination of charge carriers through the transfer of photogenerated electrons but can also expand the optical absorption range via its superior up conversion fluorescent properties zhang et al 2016 wu et al 2016 therefore cds have been frequently applied to optimize photocatalytic performance liu et al initially reported that the anchoring of cds to the surfaces of g c3n4 led to impressive photocatalytic water splitting activities liu et al 2015a our previous research demonstrated that the introduction of cds led to excellent performance for the photocatalytic degradation of ppcps under broad spectrum light irradiation from uv light to nir light wang et al 2017a further investigation revealed that the cds served as electron acceptors and energy conversion units however to the best of our knowledge the anchoring of cds on hollow porous graphitic carbon nitride nanospheres to form metal free photocatalytic nanoreactors in conjunction with up converted fluorescent properties and structural advantages has never been attempted herein for the first time a hybrid cds decorated hollow porous carbon nitride nanosphere hcns cds photocatalyst was successfully synthesized via a hard template method and applied to the degradation of a series of ppcps under visible light and natural sunlight exposure the photocatalytic degradation kinetics and mechanism of a representative of ppcp npx was investigated among ppcps naproxen npx a best selling non steroidal anti inflammatory drug is extensively employed to treat fever and rheumatoid arthritis li et al 2020 due to the poor removal efficiencies of contemporary wastewater treatment technologies npx has been frequently detected in ambient waterways at fairly high concentrations ranging from 0 1 ng l to 7 69 μg l luo et al 2018 previous studies have demonstrated that the presence of npx might lead to harmful toxicological consequences and adverse impacts on microbiological aquatic ecosystems the dominant reactive species and potential pathways involved in the photodegradation of npx were investigated via scavenger quenching experiments electron paramagnetic resonance epr and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry uhplc hrms analyses further a series of environmental experiments were conducted to demonstrate the photocatalytic superiority of the hcns cds this study provides a promising strategy for the exploration of responsive broad spectrum photocatalysts with structural advantages while demonstrating excellent potential for water purification applications 2 experimental methods 2 1 preparation of photocatalysts a mesoporous core shell silica nanosphere template was synthesized according to the stöber method sun et al 2012 carbon dots cds were synthesized via a hydrothermal method according to our previous work wang et al 2017a details of these techniques may be found in the supplementary information for the synthesis of hcns cds 2 g of the silica nanosphere template and specific quantities of cds 0 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 7 and 1 0 wt were combined with 10 g cyanamide alfa aesar and held under vacuum for 2 h at 60 c subsequently the mixture was stirred overnight following sonication for 2 h at 60 c the resulting products were centrifuged dried in air and calcined at 550 c in n2 for 4 h the obtained powder was added to 4 m nh4hf2 for 12 h to remove the silica sphere template after which it was centrifuged and rinsed three times with ultrapure water and once with ethanol the final hollow porous carbon nitride sphere carbon dots hcns cds powder was collected by drying at 80 c overnight the hcns was synthesized using the identical procedure except for the addition of the cds the bulk g c3n4 was prepared by calcinating 1 g cyanamide at 550 c for 4 h under n2 flow 2 2 photocatalytic tests the performance of the polymeric photocatalysts was evaluated through the photodegradation of ppcps under visible light irradiation as depicted in fig s1 the photocatalytic experiments were conducted using a photoreactor xpa 7 nanjing xuj co ltd which was illuminated by a 350 w xenon lamp with a 420 nm cutoff filter as the visible light source moreover the responses of the hcns cds photocatalyst on broad spectrum light were also detected by irradiating it with 365 nm 450 nm 520 nm 660 nm and 750 nm led monochromatic light which were used as the uv light blue light green light red light and near infrared light respectively the details of light sources are shown in table s3 the temperature of the reaction system was maintained at 25 0 0 2 c by circulating water between a double walled quartz cooling jacket for each test 25 mg of the hcns cds was added into 50 ml of a 10 mg l ppcp aqueous solution and stirred with a magnetic stirrer at 300 r min for 30 min in darkness to achieve adsorption equilibrium prior to being exposed to light preliminary experiments revealed that adsorption desorption equilibrium can be achieved in 30 min fig s7 subsequently a 1 0 ml suspension was periodically extracted and filtered through 0 22 μm millipore filters for analysis the ph of the reacted solution was 7 0 0 2 and each test was performed in triplicate the concentration of ppcps was determined through high performance liquid chromatography hplc 20a shimadzu for the determination of trace concentrations of npx a c18 solid phase extraction spe cartridge 6 cc 200 mg waters oasis was applied to concentrate the reaction solution the photocatalytic degradation intermediates of npx were investigated using ultimate 3000 rslc high resolution liquid chromatography equipped with q exactive orbitrap accurate mass spectrometry uhplc hrms thermo scientific the total organic carbon toc of the solution was quantified with a toc analyzer toc v cph e200v shimadzu details of the detection method can be found in the supplementary data text s6 for hplc 20a and spe method text s7 for uhplc hrms method 2 3 scavenger quenching experiments scavenger quenching experiments were initially carried out through the addition of different compounds including p benzoquinone bq isopropanol ipa and na2c2o4 which were employed as superoxide o2 hydroxyl radical oh and hole h scavengers respectively to identify the roles of reactive species during the photocatalytic degradation of npx during the experiments 10 mm scavengers were added to the samples prior to irradiation subsequently each suspension sample was collected for further analysis as described above 2 4 cycling run experiments after each cycle the samples were collected by centrifugation followed by rinsing several times with ultrapure water and ethyl alcohol and then drying at 60 c overnight the obtained powders were utilized for the subsequent cycle runs to ensure that the catalyst concentrations remained constant throughout the cycles the volumes of the added reaction solutions were continually reduced to match the decreasing mass of the catalyst a control experiment was set up to replace the npx solution with ultrapure water 2 5 natural light photocatalytic experiments ambient light experiments were conducted under natural sunlight exposure using quartz tubes wherein both high and low concentration tests were set up the high concentration tests could be conducive to exploring the possible degradation mechanism while low concentration tests could be closer to the actual concentration of pollutants in the environment for the high concentration tests certain quantities of hcns cds 25 250 500 mg were added into 50 ml 500 ml and 1000 ml of a 10 mg l npx aqueous solution respectively catalysts 0 50 g l for the low concentration tests 2 5 mg of hcns cds was added into 50 ml of a 50 μg l npx aqueous solution catalysts 0 05 g l the light intensity was determined to be 19 8 mw cm2 and the other experiment details were consistent with section 2 2 2 6 statistical analysis the measured variables were tested by a one way analysis of variance anova the comparisons among the means were made using tukey s test p 0 05 all statistical analyses were conducted using the spss software package 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization for this study hollow porous spherical carbon nitride nanoreactors loaded with carbon dots hcns cds were synthesized via a hard template method fig s1a the morphologies of the hcns cds were investigated using scanning electron microscopy sem and transmission electron microscopy tem as illustrated in fig 1 a and b the as prepared hcns cds exhibited hollow spherical nanostructures with diameters of 380 nm and 80 nm thick walls the hrtem images as shown in fig 1b inset demonstrated that the cds with graphite lattice planes d spacings of 0 25 nm were successfully deposited on the hcns bai et al 2016 powder x ray diffraction xrd patterns revealed that both the hcns cds and hcns possessed graphitic stacking structures with 100 diffraction peaks at 13 4 and 002 peaks at 27 3 fig 1c which corresponded to the in plane structural repeat units of tri s triazine and interlayer stacking of aromatic structures respectively from the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms fig 1d the specific surface area sbet of the hcns cds was calculated to be 42 5 m2 g which was much larger than the bulk g c3n4 sbet 6 09 m2 g subsequently the optical properties of the as prepared samples were investigated using uv vis spectra fig 1e following the modification of the cds the absorption edge significantly red shifted from 460 nm to 495 nm and showed intense absorption in the visible to near infrared light regions which suggested that the cds could broaden the visible light spectral response the up converted property of cds was then investigated by the photoluminescence pl spectra as presented in fig 1f the cds could absorb long wavelength light 600 900 nm and then emit short wavelength light 440 500 nm this indicated that the cds could serve as unique artificial antennas for the conversion and transmission of photonic energy further the hcns cds revealed much weaker pl emission peak intensities far shorter fluorescence lifetimes more robust photocurrent intensities and lower resistance values for charge migration than did hcns and bulk g c3n4 this indicated that the synthesis of both the hollow nanostructures and cds might efficiently promote charge separation while inhibiting recombination the detailed characterization results are summarized in table s6 of the supplementary data in summary the hollow hcns cds nanostructures were observed to effectively expand the specific surface area while improving photonic absorption which served to enhance the photocatalytic activities 3 2 photocatalytic performance the adsorption capacity of the hcns cds was initially investigated in the dark as shown in fig s7a the adsorption desorption equilibrium was achieved within 30 min suspension was extracted at 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 min the average removal rates of various types of ppcps e g indomethacin naproxen ciprofloxacin norfloxacin diclofenac and bisphenol a were calculated to be 4 8 17 2 47 2 41 7 10 9 and 20 9 respectively to further investigate the adsorption mechanism of ppcps the chemisorption rate of adsorption process was studied via a pseudo second order adsorption kinetics model hao et al 2019 1 t q t 1 k q e 2 t q e where t is the adsorption time qt is the adsorption capacity at time t qe is the adsorption capacity at equilibrium and k is the pseudo second order rate constant g mg 1 min 1 as depicted in fig s7b and table s7 the linear correlation coefficient r2 of these ppcps were 0 99 which suggested that the sorption between the hcns cds and ppcps was governed by the chemical bonds at the catalyst surfaces to assess the potential performance of the polymer photocatalysts the degradation of various types of ppcps proceeded under visible light irradiation as shown in fig 2 a the hcns cds exhibited a much higher degradation rate for all ppcps than did hcns which suggested that the photocatalytic process involved in the hcns cds had good efficiency and a non selective oxidative capacity for the photocatalytic degradation of ppcps to further investigate the photocatalytic performance and potential kinetics of the hcns cds npx was selected as a representative ppcp as presented in fig 2b without the addition of hcns cds no appreciable changes in the concentrations of npx were observed following 25 min of visible light irradiation this indicated that the self photolysis of npx could be neglected under visible light irradiation only 8 83 and 44 5 of the npx could be degraded after 25 min of visible light irradiation when bulk g c3n4 and hcns were employed as the photocatalysts respectively by contrast the hcns cds exhibited outstanding photocatalytic activity with 98 6 of npx removal rate under the same conditions the photocatalytic npx degradation effects at different initial concentrations are presented in fig 2c with an increase of the initial npx concentrations from 5 0 to 25 0 mg l the degradation rate constants decreased from 0 2079 to 0 1603 min 1 the inhibition of the degradation rate at high npx concentrations might have been due to the competitive effects of photons by npx molecules the langmuir hinshelwood l h model was employed to investigate the relationships between the photocatalytic degradation rate and the initial concentrations of heterogeneous organic pollutants 2 r k r θ d c d t k r k α c 1 k α c where r is the reaction rate kr is the reaction rate constant c is the adsorption equilibrium concentration and kα is the adsorption constant from fig 2c a satisfactory linear correlation coefficient r2 0 99 was obtained between 1 kr and the npx concentration which indicated that the npx degradation primarily occurred at the surfaces of the hcns cds due to the low initial concentrations of ppcps used in the photocatalytic process the term kαc in the denominator can be neglected bilgin simsek 2017 therefore the initial degradation rate of ppcps conformed to pseudo first order kinetics 3 r d c d t k r k α t k o b s t 4 l n c c 0 k o b s t where kobs is the kinetic rate constant min 1 as anticipated the hcns cds exhibited optimal photocatalytic performance specifically the kobs of the npx degraded by the hcns cds was determined to be 0 1603 min 1 which was 66 8 and 8 5 times higher than the bulk g c3n4 and hcns respectively further the effects of the cds loading amounts on the photocatalytic activity was investigated as shown in fig s6 the kobs of the npx was increased from 0 0188 to 0 1603 min 1 when the amount of cds was increased from 0 0 to 0 5 wt nevertheless the photocatalytic activity of the nanocomposites gradually decreased with higher quantities of cds which might have been initiated by the photo shielding effect caused by excessive cds fig 2d illustrates the impacts of the hcns cds concentrations on the photocatalytic degradation of npx as the hcns cds loading amount was increased from 0 05 to 0 50 g l the pseudo first order rate constants of npx increasing from 0 0319 to 0 1603 min 1 however further increases in the catalyst loading led to an obvious reduction in the degradation efficiency this might have been due to the excess catalyst which acted to scatter or reflect photons thereby hindering the excitation of the photocatalyst the optimal dosage was observed to be 0 5 g l through which the npx was almost completely degraded in 25 min to study the broad spectrum responses of the hcns cds the degradation of npx was carried out under exposure to different monochromatic led light wavelengths e g 365 nm 450 nm 520 nm 660 nm and 750 nm as illustrated in fig 3 a the hcns cds exhibited an obvious enhancement in the npx photodegradation rate over the hcns under all tested wavelengths these results revealed that the multiple incident reflections within the unique hollow nanostructures combined with the up converted fluorescent properties of the cds yielded responsive broad spectrum photocatalysts to assess the feasibility of applying the hcns cds photocatalytic process for the degradation of ppcps under ambient conditions the experiments were also conducted under natural sunlight fig 3b surprisingly almost all the npx molecules were completely decomposed within 5 min of natural sunlight irradiation which confirmed that the hcns cds photocatalytic process could be applied for the remediation of ppcps under natural ambient sunlight in addition we found that the degradation efficiency of npx was slightly decreased when the volume of the npx solution was increased from 50 ml to 1000 ml according to beer lambert s law the increase of light penetration distance d would result in a decrease in transmitted light intensity 5 i d e k c d i 0 where id is transmitted light intensity i0 is the incident light intensity k is the light absorption coefficient c is the absorbent concentration huesemann et al 2013 therefore the inhibition of photocatalytic performance might have been due to the insufficient photon absorption of the internal photocatalysts however almost all of the npx molecules were degraded following 15 min of sunlight irradiation therefore longer irradiation times or the use of fluidized beds are likely necessary for practical applications it should be noted that the photocatalytic activity of the natural sunlight hcns cds process was far superior than that of other photocatalytic processes table s8 ye et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 jallouli et al 2016 wang et al 2018b begum and ahmaruzzaman 2018 regmi et al 2018 ray et al 2018 this outstanding performance was the result of synergistic light absorption effects between the up converted pl properties of the artificial antenna cds and the hollow nanostructures 3 3 photocatalysis mechanism 3 3 1 role of reactive species to analyze the impacts of reactive species on the degradation on npx scavenger quenching experiments were conducted as shown in fig 4 a and table s9 following the addition of bq ipa and na2c2o4 the photocatalytic efficiency of the hcns cds decreased to 4 71 6 and 33 7 respectively these results suggested that o2 played a primary role in the photocatalytic degradation of npx it is notable that o2 may be generated by dissolved oxygen trapped by e in solution to investigate the role of o2 the photocatalytic degradation was performed by aerating with nitrogen n2 or oxygen o2 in the n2 aerated system a dramatic inhibition of the photocatalytic efficiency was observed conversely the photocatalytic efficacy improved slightly in the presence of o2 the above results implied that o2 played a key role in the photocatalytic degradation reaction through the generation of o2 consequently oxygen temperature programmed desorption o2 tpd was applied to further investigate the oxygen absorption capacity of the as synthesized nanomaterials as depicted in fig 4b a desorption peak assigned to the physical adsorption of o2 within the desorption temperature range of from 120 to 160 c was observed for the bulk g c3n4 hcns and hcns cds luo et al 2016 both the hcns and hcns cds exhibited an evidently stronger o2 desorption peak than the bulk g c3n4 which verified an augmented capacity for o2 absorption moreover compared to the g c3n4 and hcns the desorption peaks of the hcns cds revealed an obvious positive shift which suggested a more potent interaction between the hcns cds and o2 the shift in the tpd signal implied a lower energy barrier for o2 activation which could generate additional o2 radicals zhou et al 2017 electron paramagnetic resonance epr using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo as the spin trapping agent was conducted to further confirm the presence of o2 and oh as shown in fig 4c and d both the hcns and hcns cds showed negligible epr signals in the dark in contrast obvious o2 and oh radicals signals were observed for the polymer photocatalysts under 10 min of visible light irradiation further the hcns cds revealed distinctly stronger epr signals than the hcns which suggested that additional o2 and oh radicals could be generated through the introduction of cds 3 3 2 npx degradation pathways initially uhplc hrms analysis was conducted to detect the photocatalytic npx transformation intermediates a total of seven intermediates were detected with their tentative structures and mass spectra shown in table s10 and fig s9 respectively among these the m z 185 0959 187 1261 201 0907 and 219 0311 were identified as decarboxylation products the m z 135 0320 and 149 9719 were assigned as the npx ring opening products the degree of npx mineralization in the hcns cds photocatalytic process was revealed via the toc removal rate fig s11 the attained toc removal rate was 63 1 under visible light irradiation for 90 min which suggested that most of the npx and its photocatalytic transformation intermediates were degraded during the hcns cds photocatalytic process according to the above results two primary npx degradation pathways were involved fig 5 specifically the npx was initially attacked by valence band holes to produce hco2 radicals which then lost carbon dioxide to give m z 187 1261 and was further oxidized by oh or o2 to form m z 219 0311 and 1 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl ethanol respectively kim et al 2016 romeiro et al 2018 6 rco2h h rco2 h 7 rco2 r co2 the m z 201 0907 and 185 0959 might have been respectively formed by eliminating the hydrogen and h2o molecules from 1 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl ethanol furthermore the m z 187 1261 could have generated the intermediate with m z 171 1489 through demethylate the second npx degradation pathway was initiated by photolysis oxidative decarboxylation on the photocatalyst surfaces with further attacked by oh leading to the generation of m z 185 0959 coria et al 2016 romeiro et al 2018 finally all of these intermediates underwent additional attacks by series of reactive species to generate ring opening products m z 135 0320 and m z 149 9719 and were finally completely oxidized to co2 and h2o wang et al 2018b 3 3 3 photocatalytic mechanism of hcns cds based on the results of the analyses above a potential mechanism of the hcns cds was proposed which is schematically illustrated in fig 6 under broad spectrum light irradiation 495 nm wavelengths could be directly absorbed or refracted within the hollow hcns nanostructures leading to the formation of photogenerated electron hole pairs meanwhile long wavelength visible and nir light could be efficiently transformed by the artificial antennas of the cds to short light wavelengths to excite the photocatalyst due to the hollow nanostructures and the low work functions of the cds the photogenerated electrons in the hcns could be effectively transferred to the cds leading to the segregation of photogenerated electron hole pairs since the cb edge potential of the cds 1 99 ev was more negative than that of the reduction potential of o2 o2 0 33 ev o2 could be spontaneously trapped by photogenerated electrons to give rise to o2 zhang et al 2015 since the photogenerated holes of the valence band vb of the hcns cds 1 89 ev were more negative than the standard redox potential of oh oh 1 99 ev the h were unable to oxidize oh to oh 1 99 ev wang et al 2018b therefore the generation of oh in the hcns cds system might be interpreted by equations 8 and 9 zhai et al 2011 8 o2 h2o ooh oh 9 h2o ooh e oh oh subsequently the extensive surface area of the hollow hcns cds nanoreactors enabled it to absorb additional ppcps molecules these adsorbed ppcps contaminants were subsequently attacked by reactive species such as o2 h and oh which resulted in the decomposition of both parent molecule and their intermediates 3 4 environmental applications the stability of a given material is a critical prerequisite for its practical application herein the stability of the optimized hcns cds 0 5 wt samples was verified by bench scale cycling runs as shown in fig 7 a the photocatalytic activity of the hcns cds was fairly consistent even after four cycles which suggested that the nanocomposite was recyclable and actively stable to further investigate the chemical and mechanical stability of the hcns cds the filtrate was collected from the control experiment and the total organic carbon content was quantified via a toc analyzer no total organic carbon was detected which suggesting that the hcns cds possessed excellent chemical and mechanical stability moreover the xrd and ft ir of the cycled samples figs s9a and b revealed no obvious alterations in these characteristic lines which indicated that the structures and chemical surface properties of the hybrid photocatalysts remained stable the influence of natural water constituents in the degradation of npx using the hcns cds was further investigated as shown in fig 7b the effects of cl and so4 2 on the photocatalytic degradation process were not obvious wang et al 2017b while a clear restraint on degradation could be observed with the addition of hco3 this inhibition might have been due to the scavenging ability for oh interestingly the npx degradation efficiency could be improved in the presence of no3 which might have been attributed to the generation of oh and no2 during the photocatalytic process zhang et al 2011 conversely as an electron scavenger cu2 significantly inhibited the degradation process krishnakumar and swaminathan 2011 humic acid ha also obviously restrained the degradation of npx which could be explained by the competitive absorption of actinic photons ge et al 2010 the technical feasibility of the hcns cds was then investigated through the photodegradation of npx in different types of water including ultrapure water tap water zhujiang river water sea water and wwtp effluent water as depicted in fig 7c compared to ultrapure water 98 2 a slight inhibition was observed for tap water 89 3 zhujiang river water 90 3 wwtp effluent water 86 2 and sea water 97 8 in tap water the presence of interfering anions i e sulfate and chloride ions might have served as a reactive species scavenger and photon competitors leading to the inhibition of npx degradation table s4 jiang et al 2016 the reduced npx removal rate in the zhujiang river water and wwtp effluent water might have been due to the presence of natural organic matter and suspended solids which could decrease the light absorption of photocatalyst due to their shading effect the negligible degradation inhibition in seawater was correlated with the combined effects of water constituents on one hand the presence of natural organic matter and suspended solids in the seawater played negative roles in the photocatalytic degradation process in addition other constituents such as soluble silicate and divalent cations etc might have contributed to the absorption of npx laera et al 2011 consequently a slight change of the npx removal rate was observed in seawater overall the exceptional npx removal performance in different water media implied that the hcns cds possessed the potential to efficaciously treat npx containing wastewater 4 conclusions in summary a newly designed hybrid metal free hcns cds photocatalyst was successfully prepared via a hard templating method the hcns cds exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance for the degradation of ppcps under visible light irradiation compared with bulk g c3n4 and hcns the hcns cds demonstrated optimal photocatalytic activity for the degradation of npx which was 66 8 and 8 5 times higher than bulk g c3n4 and hcns respectively furthermore the hcns cds possessed favorable technical feasibility reusability and environmental compatibility these advantages were likely attributed to the specific hollow mesoporous spherical structures and modification by the artificial antennas of cds which not only increased the population of available reaction sites and enhanced photonic absorption but also inhibited the recombination of electron hole pairs and enabled the capacity to utilize broad spectrum light overall this work demonstrated a novel metal free photocatalyst that combined up converted fluorescent properties with nanostructural advantages which demonstrated excellent potential for the remediation of ppcps in practical wastewater treatment applications declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

18133,pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps are increasingly being scrutinized by the scientific community due to their environmental persistence therefore the development of novel environmentally compatible and energy efficient technologies for their removal is highly anticipated in this work a novel metal free photocatalytic nanoreactor was successfully synthesized by anchoring carbon dots to hollow carbon nitride nanospheres hcns cds the unique structure of these hollow nanospherical hcns cds hybrids endowed them with a high population of reactive sites while enhancing optical absorption due to internal light reflection simultaneously the cds served as artificial antennas to absorb and convert photons with low energy due to their superior up converting properties consequently the hcns cds demonstrated excellent photodegradation activities for the degradation of ppcps under broad spectrum irradiation remarkedly 10 mg l of naproxen npx was completely degraded following 5 min of natural solar irradiation it was further revealed that the o2 played a significant role during the photocatalytic process which could lead to the decomposition of npx the effects of natural water matrices and the degradation of trace ppcps further supported that this photocatalytic system may be efficaciously applied for the remediation of ppcps contamination in ambient waterways graphical abstract image 1 keywords pharmaceutical and personal care products carbon dots graphitic carbon nitride hollow sphere photocatalytic 1 introduction in recent years the increasing presence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps in ambient waterways has raised serious concerns evgenidou et al 2015 guo et al 2018 due to the extensive use and pseudo persistence of ppcps their presence in the ambient environment has continually increased which can convey a range of potentially adverse effects on human health and natural ecosystems wang et al 2017a the removal of ppcps through conventional wastewater treatment technologies has been shown to be ineffective additionally there are inherent disadvantages associated with most of these processes including high energy consumption e g conventional activated sludge process etc carballa et al 2004 wang et al 2015 chen et al 2016 therefore the development of novel environmentally compatible and energy efficient technologies for the removal of ppcps is urgently required the photocatalytic degradation of organic contaminants using semiconductor based catalysts are recognized as a promising approach for curbing environmental contamination xie et al 2018 as a model photocatalyst tio2 has been widely employed for the remediation of environmental pollutants however its inherently broad energy gap 3 1 ev limits its capacity to absorb visible light dong et al 2015 given that uv light accounts for only 4 of the solar energy spectrum the development of broad spectrum light responsive nanomaterials that utilize photonic energy from uv to near infrared nir frequencies are required graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 is a metal free polymeric photocatalyst that has recently garnered significant attention due to its visible light response and favorable chemical stability wang et al 2009 2018a due to its superior properties g c3n4 has been applied to environmental remediation water splitting and co2 reduction hernandez uresti et al 2016 lv et al 2017 teng et al 2017 however the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron hole pairs poor visible light utilization and low specific surface area sbet 6 09 m2 g has limited its practical application wang et al 2012 to improve the photocatalytic activity of g c3n4 various strategies have been investigated including morphological control sun et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 modification with carbon materials zhao et al 2014 fang et al 2016 doping with metal non metal ions zhou et al 2015 yan et al 2016 and compositing with other semiconductors zhao et al 2015 liu et al 2015b among these techniques morphological control is considered to be the simplest and most effective strategy for improving photocatalytic activity as recognized through previous studies the structural tuning of g c3n4 may greatly enhance its specific surface area and reactive sites thereby improving its photocatalytic performance ma et al 2018 wang et al 2018c for example zheng et al successfully synthesized hollow carbon nitride nanospheres hcns they found that the interconnected inner and outer domains of the hollow hcns nanostructures could enhance optical absorption via the multiple photonic reflections thereby improving photocatalytic performance zheng et al 2015 although this hollow architecture obviously augmented visible light harvesting long wavelength visible and near infrared light could not be utilized due to the intrinsic g c3n4 band gap 2 7 ev as an ecofriendly carbon based nanomaterial carbon dots cds have recently been widely utilized in biosensing bioimaging and chemical sensing due to their low toxicity easy synthesis and high chemical stability xia et al 2016 niu et al 2016 wang et al 2019 significantly cds cannot only inhibit the recombination of charge carriers through the transfer of photogenerated electrons but can also expand the optical absorption range via its superior up conversion fluorescent properties zhang et al 2016 wu et al 2016 therefore cds have been frequently applied to optimize photocatalytic performance liu et al initially reported that the anchoring of cds to the surfaces of g c3n4 led to impressive photocatalytic water splitting activities liu et al 2015a our previous research demonstrated that the introduction of cds led to excellent performance for the photocatalytic degradation of ppcps under broad spectrum light irradiation from uv light to nir light wang et al 2017a further investigation revealed that the cds served as electron acceptors and energy conversion units however to the best of our knowledge the anchoring of cds on hollow porous graphitic carbon nitride nanospheres to form metal free photocatalytic nanoreactors in conjunction with up converted fluorescent properties and structural advantages has never been attempted herein for the first time a hybrid cds decorated hollow porous carbon nitride nanosphere hcns cds photocatalyst was successfully synthesized via a hard template method and applied to the degradation of a series of ppcps under visible light and natural sunlight exposure the photocatalytic degradation kinetics and mechanism of a representative of ppcp npx was investigated among ppcps naproxen npx a best selling non steroidal anti inflammatory drug is extensively employed to treat fever and rheumatoid arthritis li et al 2020 due to the poor removal efficiencies of contemporary wastewater treatment technologies npx has been frequently detected in ambient waterways at fairly high concentrations ranging from 0 1 ng l to 7 69 μg l luo et al 2018 previous studies have demonstrated that the presence of npx might lead to harmful toxicological consequences and adverse impacts on microbiological aquatic ecosystems the dominant reactive species and potential pathways involved in the photodegradation of npx were investigated via scavenger quenching experiments electron paramagnetic resonance epr and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry uhplc hrms analyses further a series of environmental experiments were conducted to demonstrate the photocatalytic superiority of the hcns cds this study provides a promising strategy for the exploration of responsive broad spectrum photocatalysts with structural advantages while demonstrating excellent potential for water purification applications 2 experimental methods 2 1 preparation of photocatalysts a mesoporous core shell silica nanosphere template was synthesized according to the stöber method sun et al 2012 carbon dots cds were synthesized via a hydrothermal method according to our previous work wang et al 2017a details of these techniques may be found in the supplementary information for the synthesis of hcns cds 2 g of the silica nanosphere template and specific quantities of cds 0 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 7 and 1 0 wt were combined with 10 g cyanamide alfa aesar and held under vacuum for 2 h at 60 c subsequently the mixture was stirred overnight following sonication for 2 h at 60 c the resulting products were centrifuged dried in air and calcined at 550 c in n2 for 4 h the obtained powder was added to 4 m nh4hf2 for 12 h to remove the silica sphere template after which it was centrifuged and rinsed three times with ultrapure water and once with ethanol the final hollow porous carbon nitride sphere carbon dots hcns cds powder was collected by drying at 80 c overnight the hcns was synthesized using the identical procedure except for the addition of the cds the bulk g c3n4 was prepared by calcinating 1 g cyanamide at 550 c for 4 h under n2 flow 2 2 photocatalytic tests the performance of the polymeric photocatalysts was evaluated through the photodegradation of ppcps under visible light irradiation as depicted in fig s1 the photocatalytic experiments were conducted using a photoreactor xpa 7 nanjing xuj co ltd which was illuminated by a 350 w xenon lamp with a 420 nm cutoff filter as the visible light source moreover the responses of the hcns cds photocatalyst on broad spectrum light were also detected by irradiating it with 365 nm 450 nm 520 nm 660 nm and 750 nm led monochromatic light which were used as the uv light blue light green light red light and near infrared light respectively the details of light sources are shown in table s3 the temperature of the reaction system was maintained at 25 0 0 2 c by circulating water between a double walled quartz cooling jacket for each test 25 mg of the hcns cds was added into 50 ml of a 10 mg l ppcp aqueous solution and stirred with a magnetic stirrer at 300 r min for 30 min in darkness to achieve adsorption equilibrium prior to being exposed to light preliminary experiments revealed that adsorption desorption equilibrium can be achieved in 30 min fig s7 subsequently a 1 0 ml suspension was periodically extracted and filtered through 0 22 μm millipore filters for analysis the ph of the reacted solution was 7 0 0 2 and each test was performed in triplicate the concentration of ppcps was determined through high performance liquid chromatography hplc 20a shimadzu for the determination of trace concentrations of npx a c18 solid phase extraction spe cartridge 6 cc 200 mg waters oasis was applied to concentrate the reaction solution the photocatalytic degradation intermediates of npx were investigated using ultimate 3000 rslc high resolution liquid chromatography equipped with q exactive orbitrap accurate mass spectrometry uhplc hrms thermo scientific the total organic carbon toc of the solution was quantified with a toc analyzer toc v cph e200v shimadzu details of the detection method can be found in the supplementary data text s6 for hplc 20a and spe method text s7 for uhplc hrms method 2 3 scavenger quenching experiments scavenger quenching experiments were initially carried out through the addition of different compounds including p benzoquinone bq isopropanol ipa and na2c2o4 which were employed as superoxide o2 hydroxyl radical oh and hole h scavengers respectively to identify the roles of reactive species during the photocatalytic degradation of npx during the experiments 10 mm scavengers were added to the samples prior to irradiation subsequently each suspension sample was collected for further analysis as described above 2 4 cycling run experiments after each cycle the samples were collected by centrifugation followed by rinsing several times with ultrapure water and ethyl alcohol and then drying at 60 c overnight the obtained powders were utilized for the subsequent cycle runs to ensure that the catalyst concentrations remained constant throughout the cycles the volumes of the added reaction solutions were continually reduced to match the decreasing mass of the catalyst a control experiment was set up to replace the npx solution with ultrapure water 2 5 natural light photocatalytic experiments ambient light experiments were conducted under natural sunlight exposure using quartz tubes wherein both high and low concentration tests were set up the high concentration tests could be conducive to exploring the possible degradation mechanism while low concentration tests could be closer to the actual concentration of pollutants in the environment for the high concentration tests certain quantities of hcns cds 25 250 500 mg were added into 50 ml 500 ml and 1000 ml of a 10 mg l npx aqueous solution respectively catalysts 0 50 g l for the low concentration tests 2 5 mg of hcns cds was added into 50 ml of a 50 μg l npx aqueous solution catalysts 0 05 g l the light intensity was determined to be 19 8 mw cm2 and the other experiment details were consistent with section 2 2 2 6 statistical analysis the measured variables were tested by a one way analysis of variance anova the comparisons among the means were made using tukey s test p 0 05 all statistical analyses were conducted using the spss software package 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization for this study hollow porous spherical carbon nitride nanoreactors loaded with carbon dots hcns cds were synthesized via a hard template method fig s1a the morphologies of the hcns cds were investigated using scanning electron microscopy sem and transmission electron microscopy tem as illustrated in fig 1 a and b the as prepared hcns cds exhibited hollow spherical nanostructures with diameters of 380 nm and 80 nm thick walls the hrtem images as shown in fig 1b inset demonstrated that the cds with graphite lattice planes d spacings of 0 25 nm were successfully deposited on the hcns bai et al 2016 powder x ray diffraction xrd patterns revealed that both the hcns cds and hcns possessed graphitic stacking structures with 100 diffraction peaks at 13 4 and 002 peaks at 27 3 fig 1c which corresponded to the in plane structural repeat units of tri s triazine and interlayer stacking of aromatic structures respectively from the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms fig 1d the specific surface area sbet of the hcns cds was calculated to be 42 5 m2 g which was much larger than the bulk g c3n4 sbet 6 09 m2 g subsequently the optical properties of the as prepared samples were investigated using uv vis spectra fig 1e following the modification of the cds the absorption edge significantly red shifted from 460 nm to 495 nm and showed intense absorption in the visible to near infrared light regions which suggested that the cds could broaden the visible light spectral response the up converted property of cds was then investigated by the photoluminescence pl spectra as presented in fig 1f the cds could absorb long wavelength light 600 900 nm and then emit short wavelength light 440 500 nm this indicated that the cds could serve as unique artificial antennas for the conversion and transmission of photonic energy further the hcns cds revealed much weaker pl emission peak intensities far shorter fluorescence lifetimes more robust photocurrent intensities and lower resistance values for charge migration than did hcns and bulk g c3n4 this indicated that the synthesis of both the hollow nanostructures and cds might efficiently promote charge separation while inhibiting recombination the detailed characterization results are summarized in table s6 of the supplementary data in summary the hollow hcns cds nanostructures were observed to effectively expand the specific surface area while improving photonic absorption which served to enhance the photocatalytic activities 3 2 photocatalytic performance the adsorption capacity of the hcns cds was initially investigated in the dark as shown in fig s7a the adsorption desorption equilibrium was achieved within 30 min suspension was extracted at 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 min the average removal rates of various types of ppcps e g indomethacin naproxen ciprofloxacin norfloxacin diclofenac and bisphenol a were calculated to be 4 8 17 2 47 2 41 7 10 9 and 20 9 respectively to further investigate the adsorption mechanism of ppcps the chemisorption rate of adsorption process was studied via a pseudo second order adsorption kinetics model hao et al 2019 1 t q t 1 k q e 2 t q e where t is the adsorption time qt is the adsorption capacity at time t qe is the adsorption capacity at equilibrium and k is the pseudo second order rate constant g mg 1 min 1 as depicted in fig s7b and table s7 the linear correlation coefficient r2 of these ppcps were 0 99 which suggested that the sorption between the hcns cds and ppcps was governed by the chemical bonds at the catalyst surfaces to assess the potential performance of the polymer photocatalysts the degradation of various types of ppcps proceeded under visible light irradiation as shown in fig 2 a the hcns cds exhibited a much higher degradation rate for all ppcps than did hcns which suggested that the photocatalytic process involved in the hcns cds had good efficiency and a non selective oxidative capacity for the photocatalytic degradation of ppcps to further investigate the photocatalytic performance and potential kinetics of the hcns cds npx was selected as a representative ppcp as presented in fig 2b without the addition of hcns cds no appreciable changes in the concentrations of npx were observed following 25 min of visible light irradiation this indicated that the self photolysis of npx could be neglected under visible light irradiation only 8 83 and 44 5 of the npx could be degraded after 25 min of visible light irradiation when bulk g c3n4 and hcns were employed as the photocatalysts respectively by contrast the hcns cds exhibited outstanding photocatalytic activity with 98 6 of npx removal rate under the same conditions the photocatalytic npx degradation effects at different initial concentrations are presented in fig 2c with an increase of the initial npx concentrations from 5 0 to 25 0 mg l the degradation rate constants decreased from 0 2079 to 0 1603 min 1 the inhibition of the degradation rate at high npx concentrations might have been due to the competitive effects of photons by npx molecules the langmuir hinshelwood l h model was employed to investigate the relationships between the photocatalytic degradation rate and the initial concentrations of heterogeneous organic pollutants 2 r k r θ d c d t k r k α c 1 k α c where r is the reaction rate kr is the reaction rate constant c is the adsorption equilibrium concentration and kα is the adsorption constant from fig 2c a satisfactory linear correlation coefficient r2 0 99 was obtained between 1 kr and the npx concentration which indicated that the npx degradation primarily occurred at the surfaces of the hcns cds due to the low initial concentrations of ppcps used in the photocatalytic process the term kαc in the denominator can be neglected bilgin simsek 2017 therefore the initial degradation rate of ppcps conformed to pseudo first order kinetics 3 r d c d t k r k α t k o b s t 4 l n c c 0 k o b s t where kobs is the kinetic rate constant min 1 as anticipated the hcns cds exhibited optimal photocatalytic performance specifically the kobs of the npx degraded by the hcns cds was determined to be 0 1603 min 1 which was 66 8 and 8 5 times higher than the bulk g c3n4 and hcns respectively further the effects of the cds loading amounts on the photocatalytic activity was investigated as shown in fig s6 the kobs of the npx was increased from 0 0188 to 0 1603 min 1 when the amount of cds was increased from 0 0 to 0 5 wt nevertheless the photocatalytic activity of the nanocomposites gradually decreased with higher quantities of cds which might have been initiated by the photo shielding effect caused by excessive cds fig 2d illustrates the impacts of the hcns cds concentrations on the photocatalytic degradation of npx as the hcns cds loading amount was increased from 0 05 to 0 50 g l the pseudo first order rate constants of npx increasing from 0 0319 to 0 1603 min 1 however further increases in the catalyst loading led to an obvious reduction in the degradation efficiency this might have been due to the excess catalyst which acted to scatter or reflect photons thereby hindering the excitation of the photocatalyst the optimal dosage was observed to be 0 5 g l through which the npx was almost completely degraded in 25 min to study the broad spectrum responses of the hcns cds the degradation of npx was carried out under exposure to different monochromatic led light wavelengths e g 365 nm 450 nm 520 nm 660 nm and 750 nm as illustrated in fig 3 a the hcns cds exhibited an obvious enhancement in the npx photodegradation rate over the hcns under all tested wavelengths these results revealed that the multiple incident reflections within the unique hollow nanostructures combined with the up converted fluorescent properties of the cds yielded responsive broad spectrum photocatalysts to assess the feasibility of applying the hcns cds photocatalytic process for the degradation of ppcps under ambient conditions the experiments were also conducted under natural sunlight fig 3b surprisingly almost all the npx molecules were completely decomposed within 5 min of natural sunlight irradiation which confirmed that the hcns cds photocatalytic process could be applied for the remediation of ppcps under natural ambient sunlight in addition we found that the degradation efficiency of npx was slightly decreased when the volume of the npx solution was increased from 50 ml to 1000 ml according to beer lambert s law the increase of light penetration distance d would result in a decrease in transmitted light intensity 5 i d e k c d i 0 where id is transmitted light intensity i0 is the incident light intensity k is the light absorption coefficient c is the absorbent concentration huesemann et al 2013 therefore the inhibition of photocatalytic performance might have been due to the insufficient photon absorption of the internal photocatalysts however almost all of the npx molecules were degraded following 15 min of sunlight irradiation therefore longer irradiation times or the use of fluidized beds are likely necessary for practical applications it should be noted that the photocatalytic activity of the natural sunlight hcns cds process was far superior than that of other photocatalytic processes table s8 ye et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 jallouli et al 2016 wang et al 2018b begum and ahmaruzzaman 2018 regmi et al 2018 ray et al 2018 this outstanding performance was the result of synergistic light absorption effects between the up converted pl properties of the artificial antenna cds and the hollow nanostructures 3 3 photocatalysis mechanism 3 3 1 role of reactive species to analyze the impacts of reactive species on the degradation on npx scavenger quenching experiments were conducted as shown in fig 4 a and table s9 following the addition of bq ipa and na2c2o4 the photocatalytic efficiency of the hcns cds decreased to 4 71 6 and 33 7 respectively these results suggested that o2 played a primary role in the photocatalytic degradation of npx it is notable that o2 may be generated by dissolved oxygen trapped by e in solution to investigate the role of o2 the photocatalytic degradation was performed by aerating with nitrogen n2 or oxygen o2 in the n2 aerated system a dramatic inhibition of the photocatalytic efficiency was observed conversely the photocatalytic efficacy improved slightly in the presence of o2 the above results implied that o2 played a key role in the photocatalytic degradation reaction through the generation of o2 consequently oxygen temperature programmed desorption o2 tpd was applied to further investigate the oxygen absorption capacity of the as synthesized nanomaterials as depicted in fig 4b a desorption peak assigned to the physical adsorption of o2 within the desorption temperature range of from 120 to 160 c was observed for the bulk g c3n4 hcns and hcns cds luo et al 2016 both the hcns and hcns cds exhibited an evidently stronger o2 desorption peak than the bulk g c3n4 which verified an augmented capacity for o2 absorption moreover compared to the g c3n4 and hcns the desorption peaks of the hcns cds revealed an obvious positive shift which suggested a more potent interaction between the hcns cds and o2 the shift in the tpd signal implied a lower energy barrier for o2 activation which could generate additional o2 radicals zhou et al 2017 electron paramagnetic resonance epr using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo as the spin trapping agent was conducted to further confirm the presence of o2 and oh as shown in fig 4c and d both the hcns and hcns cds showed negligible epr signals in the dark in contrast obvious o2 and oh radicals signals were observed for the polymer photocatalysts under 10 min of visible light irradiation further the hcns cds revealed distinctly stronger epr signals than the hcns which suggested that additional o2 and oh radicals could be generated through the introduction of cds 3 3 2 npx degradation pathways initially uhplc hrms analysis was conducted to detect the photocatalytic npx transformation intermediates a total of seven intermediates were detected with their tentative structures and mass spectra shown in table s10 and fig s9 respectively among these the m z 185 0959 187 1261 201 0907 and 219 0311 were identified as decarboxylation products the m z 135 0320 and 149 9719 were assigned as the npx ring opening products the degree of npx mineralization in the hcns cds photocatalytic process was revealed via the toc removal rate fig s11 the attained toc removal rate was 63 1 under visible light irradiation for 90 min which suggested that most of the npx and its photocatalytic transformation intermediates were degraded during the hcns cds photocatalytic process according to the above results two primary npx degradation pathways were involved fig 5 specifically the npx was initially attacked by valence band holes to produce hco2 radicals which then lost carbon dioxide to give m z 187 1261 and was further oxidized by oh or o2 to form m z 219 0311 and 1 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl ethanol respectively kim et al 2016 romeiro et al 2018 6 rco2h h rco2 h 7 rco2 r co2 the m z 201 0907 and 185 0959 might have been respectively formed by eliminating the hydrogen and h2o molecules from 1 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl ethanol furthermore the m z 187 1261 could have generated the intermediate with m z 171 1489 through demethylate the second npx degradation pathway was initiated by photolysis oxidative decarboxylation on the photocatalyst surfaces with further attacked by oh leading to the generation of m z 185 0959 coria et al 2016 romeiro et al 2018 finally all of these intermediates underwent additional attacks by series of reactive species to generate ring opening products m z 135 0320 and m z 149 9719 and were finally completely oxidized to co2 and h2o wang et al 2018b 3 3 3 photocatalytic mechanism of hcns cds based on the results of the analyses above a potential mechanism of the hcns cds was proposed which is schematically illustrated in fig 6 under broad spectrum light irradiation 495 nm wavelengths could be directly absorbed or refracted within the hollow hcns nanostructures leading to the formation of photogenerated electron hole pairs meanwhile long wavelength visible and nir light could be efficiently transformed by the artificial antennas of the cds to short light wavelengths to excite the photocatalyst due to the hollow nanostructures and the low work functions of the cds the photogenerated electrons in the hcns could be effectively transferred to the cds leading to the segregation of photogenerated electron hole pairs since the cb edge potential of the cds 1 99 ev was more negative than that of the reduction potential of o2 o2 0 33 ev o2 could be spontaneously trapped by photogenerated electrons to give rise to o2 zhang et al 2015 since the photogenerated holes of the valence band vb of the hcns cds 1 89 ev were more negative than the standard redox potential of oh oh 1 99 ev the h were unable to oxidize oh to oh 1 99 ev wang et al 2018b therefore the generation of oh in the hcns cds system might be interpreted by equations 8 and 9 zhai et al 2011 8 o2 h2o ooh oh 9 h2o ooh e oh oh subsequently the extensive surface area of the hollow hcns cds nanoreactors enabled it to absorb additional ppcps molecules these adsorbed ppcps contaminants were subsequently attacked by reactive species such as o2 h and oh which resulted in the decomposition of both parent molecule and their intermediates 3 4 environmental applications the stability of a given material is a critical prerequisite for its practical application herein the stability of the optimized hcns cds 0 5 wt samples was verified by bench scale cycling runs as shown in fig 7 a the photocatalytic activity of the hcns cds was fairly consistent even after four cycles which suggested that the nanocomposite was recyclable and actively stable to further investigate the chemical and mechanical stability of the hcns cds the filtrate was collected from the control experiment and the total organic carbon content was quantified via a toc analyzer no total organic carbon was detected which suggesting that the hcns cds possessed excellent chemical and mechanical stability moreover the xrd and ft ir of the cycled samples figs s9a and b revealed no obvious alterations in these characteristic lines which indicated that the structures and chemical surface properties of the hybrid photocatalysts remained stable the influence of natural water constituents in the degradation of npx using the hcns cds was further investigated as shown in fig 7b the effects of cl and so4 2 on the photocatalytic degradation process were not obvious wang et al 2017b while a clear restraint on degradation could be observed with the addition of hco3 this inhibition might have been due to the scavenging ability for oh interestingly the npx degradation efficiency could be improved in the presence of no3 which might have been attributed to the generation of oh and no2 during the photocatalytic process zhang et al 2011 conversely as an electron scavenger cu2 significantly inhibited the degradation process krishnakumar and swaminathan 2011 humic acid ha also obviously restrained the degradation of npx which could be explained by the competitive absorption of actinic photons ge et al 2010 the technical feasibility of the hcns cds was then investigated through the photodegradation of npx in different types of water including ultrapure water tap water zhujiang river water sea water and wwtp effluent water as depicted in fig 7c compared to ultrapure water 98 2 a slight inhibition was observed for tap water 89 3 zhujiang river water 90 3 wwtp effluent water 86 2 and sea water 97 8 in tap water the presence of interfering anions i e sulfate and chloride ions might have served as a reactive species scavenger and photon competitors leading to the inhibition of npx degradation table s4 jiang et al 2016 the reduced npx removal rate in the zhujiang river water and wwtp effluent water might have been due to the presence of natural organic matter and suspended solids which could decrease the light absorption of photocatalyst due to their shading effect the negligible degradation inhibition in seawater was correlated with the combined effects of water constituents on one hand the presence of natural organic matter and suspended solids in the seawater played negative roles in the photocatalytic degradation process in addition other constituents such as soluble silicate and divalent cations etc might have contributed to the absorption of npx laera et al 2011 consequently a slight change of the npx removal rate was observed in seawater overall the exceptional npx removal performance in different water media implied that the hcns cds possessed the potential to efficaciously treat npx containing wastewater 4 conclusions in summary a newly designed hybrid metal free hcns cds photocatalyst was successfully prepared via a hard templating method the hcns cds exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance for the degradation of ppcps under visible light irradiation compared with bulk g c3n4 and hcns the hcns cds demonstrated optimal photocatalytic activity for the degradation of npx which was 66 8 and 8 5 times higher than bulk g c3n4 and hcns respectively furthermore the hcns cds possessed favorable technical feasibility reusability and environmental compatibility these advantages were likely attributed to the specific hollow mesoporous spherical structures and modification by the artificial antennas of cds which not only increased the population of available reaction sites and enhanced photonic absorption but also inhibited the recombination of electron hole pairs and enabled the capacity to utilize broad spectrum light overall this work demonstrated a novel metal free photocatalyst that combined up converted fluorescent properties with nanostructural advantages which demonstrated excellent potential for the remediation of ppcps in practical wastewater treatment applications declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

18134,the forward osmosis membrane distillation fo md hybrid process has shown great promise in achieving zero liquid discharge in the textile industry recovering valuable dye molecules while producing large amounts of clean water however the progress of this technology seems to have stagnated with the direct coupling of commercial asymmetric fo and md membranes because water management in the system is found to be rather complicated owing to the processing of the different membranes herein we propose for the first time an fo md hybrid process using a custom made self standing and symmetric membrane and a hydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene membrane in the fo and md units respectively three types of operation modes were investigated to systematically study the process performance in the concentration treatment of model textile wastewater two commercial fo membranes were also tested for comparison owing to its low fouling propensity and lack of an internal concentration polarization effect the water transfer rate of our symmetric fo membrane quickly reaches equilibrium with that in the md unit resulting in continuous and stable operation consequently the hybrid process using the symmetric fo membrane was found to consume the least energy as indicated by its lowest total cost in both lab and large scale systems overall our study provides a new strategy for using a symmetric fo membrane in the fo md hybrid process and highlights its great potential for use in the treatment of textile wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords fo md hybrid process textile wastewater symmetric fo membrane energy thermal efficiency economic analysis 1 introduction as the concept of minimal and zero liquid discharge mld zld has been introduced water reclamation particularly from wastewater has drawn extensive attention over the past few decades werber et al 2016 wang et al 2020 tong and elimelech 2016 some valuable resources can be recycled or reused for a sustainable purpose which may significantly reduce the production cost and extent of the environmental pollution petrinic et al 2015 lu et al 2019 conidi et al 2018 generally characterized by both high water consumption and extremely polluted effluents textile industries produce large quantities of saline wastewater containing various dyes during the dyeing process petrinic et al 2015 de vreese and van der bruggen 2007 owing to the complexity of the textile wastewater composition achieving mld zld has become highly attractive but remains significantly challenging compared with existing treatment processes e g adsorption cardoso et al 2012 biological method gupta et al 2014 advanced oxidation oller et al 2011 and coagulation flocculation verma et al 2012 which may produce undesired side products or secondary pollution membrane based technologies have demonstrated great potential and have been successfully applied recently at the lab scale li et al 2017 lin et al 2015 gillerman et al 2006 lau and ismail 2009 zhao and wang 2017 vourch et al 2008 by using typical pressure driven membranes loose nanofiltration li et al 2017 lin et al 2015 or tight ultrafiltration lin et al 2016 with appropriate pore sizes and surface charges dye molecules can be selectively retained on the concentrated side whereas most of the inorganic salts penetrate to the permeate however the subsequent dye recycling step i e the concentration process seems to be highly risky as the fouling of these membranes can easily occur becoming more severe with an increase in the concentration factor cf li et al 2017 by contrast a high water recovery ratio for the concentration process is theoretically more easily achieved through the forward osmosis fo process which is driven by osmotic pressure its inherently low fouling propensity has also been experimentally proved to be effective even in treatment with a highly concentrated feed solution li et al 2019 kim et al 2014 shaffer et al 2015 nevertheless as the water penetrates from the feed to the draw solution ds the osmotic pressure decreases accordingly owing to the dilution which inevitably results in a decline in performance thus the necessity of ds recovery reuse has remained as one of the greatest drawbacks of fo technology the integration of fo with a membrane distillation md unit seems promising the ds could be regenerated by a heat driven process even if the solution possesses an extremely high solute content osmotic pressure an et al 2019 wang et al 2015 liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 xie et al 2013 in light of this extensive efforts have been devoted to the fo md hybrid process in recent years an et al 2019 wang et al 2015 liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 xie et al 2013 ge et al 2012 kim et al 2019 including exploration of the polyelectrolyte draw solute ge et al 2012 module design kim et al 2019 and development of new membrane materials zhang et al 2014 in general the feasibility of an fo md process for continuous operation requires strict water management that is a water balance between the two separated units however fo is typically applied with asymmetric membranes including commercial ones thus most studies have focused only on their compatibility with the md process on the one hand the existing internal concentration polarization icp effect in such asymmetric membrane systems which is regarded as their achilles heel exerts great influence on the fo performance li et al 2019 the ds concentration decreases along with water penetration from the feed to the draw side however the decline trend in water flux does not have a linear relationship with the salt content owing to the icp particularly at a high concentration level in this manner the water equilibration between the fo and md components becomes rather complicated resulting in the frequent adjustment of operating temperatures in md on the other hand the initial concentrations of the feed solutions in previous studies were generally set at a low range 20 300 mg l 1 ge et al 2012 mahto et al 2017 han et al 2016 huang et al 2017 treatment with these types of model waters may not quite reflect the possible membrane characteristics for practical applications e g cake layer formation on the membrane surface when the dye concentration in the feed increases to a certain level the complex combination of the fo md hybrid process choice of fo membranes i e asymmetric or recently reported symmetric structures li et al 2018 2019 shaffer et al 2015 and corresponding economic evaluation encouraged us to systematically investigate the feasibility of this technology for textile wastewater treatment herein three different types of fo membranes commercial cellulose triacetate hti cta commercial thin film composite fo membrane csm tfc and custom made symmetric membrane and one class of md membrane polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe were employed in fo and md process respectively their effectiveness for concentrating a model dye solution up to a cf of 10 were studied and comprehensively compared in three operation modes i e an isolated fo process separated fo integrated with separated md process and fo md hybrid process their associated economic attributes including thermal energy consumption gained output ratio gor and system expense were further evaluated or estimated 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals for the fo unit a symmetric and self standing fo membrane with ultra low fouling propensity and no icp effect ptaodh 1 0 here 1 0 represents the molar ratio of 4 aminobenzoic acid to the repeating unit of podh during the synthesis thickness 8 μm was fabricated according to our previous work li et al 2018 with two commercial fo membranes i e hti cta hydration technology innovations and csm tfc toray chemical korea inc for comparison characterizations including water and salt permeability structural parameters and microscale morphologies are provided in the earlier work li et al 2018 and partially in supplementary material fig s1 for the md process a commercial flat sheet ptfe membrane was provided from sterlitech corporation ptfe0214225 washington usa detailed characterizations including pore size water contact angle liquid entry pressure porosity and morphology were measured and are summarized in fig s2 and table s1 before operation in the md unit the ptfe membrane was wetted with ethanol rinsed using deionized di water and completely dried in a vacuum oven congo red cr and sodium sulfate na2so4 were procured from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china other reagents and solvents were used as received di water with a minimum resistance of 18 mω cm millipore was used throughout the study 2 2 set up of fo md hybrid system in the current study the fo md hybrid system consists of an individual fo loop and md loop as graphically shown in fig 1 a in the fo unit di water and 1 5 m na2so4 solutions were used as the feed solution fs fo and draw solution ds fo respectively the effective area of the membrane was controlled to 10 0 cm2 while the cross flow rates on both sides fs fo and ds fo were fixed at 0 2 l min 1 10 4 cm s 1 as described previously li et al 2018 as the ds fo simultaneously served as the feed solution in the md process fs md it was heated to five different temperatures 25 35 45 55 and 65 c to optimize the associated md performance the temperature of fs fo was kept at 25 c throughout the test in the md unit the performances were evaluated in direct contact membrane distillation dcmd mode with an effective membrane area of 10 0 cm2 the cross flow rates of solutions were fixed at 0 2 l min 1 10 4 cm s 1 and 0 1 l min 1 5 2 cm s 1 for the feed fs md same as ds fo and distillate streams respectively as the most optimal temperature for fs md was found to be 55 c as discussed later the temperatures for the distillate side were set at 5 15 and 25 c respectively corresponding to temperature differences of 30 40 and 50 c respectively for each test the system would be run for at least 30 min for equilibration before the reliable performance data were collected the reverse salt flux j s fo was measured with an electric conductivity dds 307 conductivity meter china while the water fluxes j w fo or j w md were obtained by measuring the weight change in the ds fo and distillate in md respectively notably when the cr solution was employed as fs fo the reverse salt contents in the fo unit were measured by ion chromatography dionex ics 2100 u s a in terms of so4 2 and the cr concentrations were measured by uv vis spectrometry lambda 25 perkinelmer u s a detailed calculations methods are provided in the supplementary material 2 3 model textile wastewater tests in this study cr was used as a typical dye to prepare the model textile wastewater li et al 2017 2019 with an initial concentration of 1 0 g l 1 the experiments proceeded by three types of operation modes i e mode a isolated fo process mode b separated fo integrated with separated md process and mode c fo md hybrid process as mentioned earlier fig 1b in the fo unit an initial 300 ml of na2so4 solution 1 5 m and 500 ml of cr solution 1 g l 1 were used as ds fo and fs fo respectively all membranes in the fo unit were tested in fo mode active layer facing the feed solution while the active layer of the ptfe membrane faced the hot side fs md or ds fo in the md unit the concentration process of the cr solution continuously progressed until the water recovery ratio reached 90 corresponding to a cf of 10 mode a in this mode the concentration of ds fo was maintained at 1 5 m by manually adding the salt na2so4 with a conductivity monitor over a certain time period the fo process ended once the cf reached 10 as the concentration of ds fo was fixed over the entire test no further treatment was performed for ds fo regeneration however the ds fo volume would notably increase accordingly as the water permeated from the feed solution mode b in this mode the fo process operated in a continuous manner without the supplement of salt also resulting in a cf of 10 similar to mode a the volume of ds fo would also increase but with a much lower concentration to be specific the concentration of ds fo decreased to 0 6 mol l 1 at the end of the fo process such an extra amount of water 450 ml from fs fo needed to be distillated until the concentration reached 1 5 m again corresponding to a water recovery ratio of 60 for the md process mode c different than modes a and b the concentrating of the dye solution and the regeneration of ds fo or fs md proceeded simultaneously in this mode ds fo was diluted by accepting the penetrated water from fs fo whereas it would be concentrated in the md process at the same time from the internal circulation serving as fresh ds fo again specifically as the water fluxes for all three membranes ptaodh 1 0 hti cta and csm tfc in the fo process were different the temperature differences applied in their md processes were optimized separately will discuss later fully taking the water transfer rate wtr in this hybrid process into account 2 4 evaluation of energy thermal consumption in this study the total energy consumption was calculated by the summation of energy consumption in the fo loop and md loop respectively it should be mentioned that energy consumption in the fo process only comes from the pumping operation whereas it originates from both the pumping operation and heater cooler for solution heating cooling in the md process detailed calculation methods including the thermal efficiency te gor specific thermal energy consumption stec and specific energy consumption sec of the hybrid process were provided in supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of fo and md processes as ds fo also serves as the feed solution in md unit its operating temperature was initially studied and optimized separately for both units as shown in fig 2 a c the water fluxes j w fo for all three fo membranes ptaodh 1 0 hti cta and csm tfc increase with an increase in the ds fo temperature which is attributed to the elevated osmotic driving force and draw solute diffusion at higher temperatures kim et al 2019 phuntsho et al 2012 all the salt reverse fluxes j s fo increase accordingly suggesting a greater salt loss nonetheless the reverse flux selectivity j w j s a parameter that reflects the reverse flux selectivity for an fo membrane li et al 2018 shaffer et al 2015 kim et al 2019 was found to be less significant for the temperature variations fig 2d of all three membranes indicating the minor effect on temperatures that may vary their physical properties considering the energy consumption that is closely associated with the operating temperature the temperature of ds fo was finally determined to be 55 c in which j w j s for all three fo membranes were at their maximum levels i e 432 1 375 6 and 502 0 l mol 1 for ptaodh 1 0 hti cta and csm tfc membranes respectively subsequently the md unit was optimized by adjusting the temperature of the distillate stream resulting in different trans membrane temperature differences owing to the increased water vapor pressure alsaadi et al 2014 j w md of the ptfe membrane increases with an increase in the temperature difference as described in fig 3 a although the concentration of fs md or ds fo increases as the experiment proceeds no apparent changes were observed in either the water flux or the membrane permeability coefficient k m fig 3b see in supplementary material suggesting a negligible influence on the solution concentration chen et al 2020 further calculation of both the temperature polarization coefficient tpc and te revealed that the most optimal md performance occurs at a temperature difference of 50 c which indicated the lowest temperature polarization and highest utilization of heat of the md system liu et al 2019 swaminathan et al 2018 combining the above results the temperatures for fs fo ds fo or fs md and ds md were eventually determined and fixed at 25 55 and 5 c respectively for the subsequent treatment of the textile wastewaters 3 2 model textile wastewater tests 3 2 1 operation in mode a and mode b to verify the feasibility of dye concentration in the fo process and water reclamation in md process two typical modes a and b were conducted and the results are displayed in fig 4 and fig s3 through the manual supplement of the draw solute na2so4 to maintain a constant osmotic pressure mode a membrane ptaodh 1 0 maintains a stable j w fo of 18 6 0 4 l m 2 h 1 over the entire concentration process until cf reaches 10 fig 4a this could be regarded as the primary evidence of minimal fouling at the feed side as well as a negligible icp effect li et al 2019 by contrast the asymmetric hti cta and csm tfc membranes both exhibit apparent flux declines suggesting severe membrane fouling and the associated external concentration polarization ecp effect although membrane csm tfc possesses the greatest initial j w fo it decreased by 59 6 from 25 5 to 10 3 l m 2 h 1 at the end of the experiment fig s3a indicating its most inferior fo performance different than mode a the water fluxes for all three membranes decrease significantly in mode b as the driving forces continuously decrease with water penetration more specifically the j w fo of membrane ptaodh 1 0 decreases by 56 8 from 18 4 to 7 9 l m 2 h 1 fig s3b which matches the ds dilution ratio of 60 unsurprisingly the two commercial membranes both exhibit a faster flux decline which is probably attributed to the severe fouling and ecp effect as also mentioned above the calculated ecp here was found to reduce the driving force by 16 4 and 17 0 for the hti cta and csm tfc membranes respectively it is worth mentioning that the salt and dye loss were both maintained at low levels over the entire fo process regardless of the membrane type or operation mode fig 4b and d the slightly higher concentrations of salt in fs fo and dye in ds fo were only ascribed to the longer operation durations of mode b symmetric membrane ptaodh 1 0 possessing the highest running fluxes lowest solute loss and the least time consumption in both modes figs s3a and s3b displays the most superior effectiveness for the dye concentration process among the three fo membranes one possible explanation would be its ultra smooth surface roughness which was demonstrated to effectively prevent the dye molecule deposition under the hydraulic shear force li et al 2019 zhao et al 2015 mazlan et al 2016 after the experiments the dye solution could be successfully concentrated at a cf of 10 for both operation modes as ds fo was still maintained at 1 5 m for mode a no further regeneration is needed however an extra 95 9 g of na2so4 was consumed along with a much enlarged solution volume 750 ml as such the practical wastewater treatment by mode a may only be suitable for some small scale and off grid applications considering the limited room for infrastructure and expenditure on the draw solutes although no additional draw solute was required in mode b the continuously reduced osmotic driving force considerably prolonged the entire concentration process suggesting excessive energy consumption consequently a diluted 750 ml of ds fo 0 6 m was collected which required regeneration by a separate md process as graphically described in fig s4 the experiment proceeded for another 28 h until reaching a water recovery ratio of 60 1 5 m however the water flux slightly decreased from 17 0 to 14 7 l m 2 h 1 at the end of the test possibly owing to membrane fouling or scaling in terms of the fo and md performances in mode b it is suggested that practical application of this mode may not be possible as ds fo underwent overdilution resulting in a much lower time efficiency and higher energy consumption 3 2 2 operation in mode c although mode a and mode b both eventually completed the concentration process many drawbacks were involved as mentioned above therefore an fo md hybrid process mode c is highly attractive because ds fo or fs md is diluted and expected to be regenerated simultaneously maintaining its pristine concentration osmotic pressure however a critical issue remaining in this technology is the wtr balance for the fo and md components liu et al 2016 kim et al 2019 in brief if the wtr in fo is higher than that in the md process ds fo or fs md would be diluted with time until a water balance is established note that the concentration of ds fo or fs md would be lower or much lower than that in the initial state resulting in a longer treatment duration on the contrary if the wtr in fo is lower than that of md ds fo or fs md would still be steadily concentrated with time until reaching a stable state as well however such an increase in ds fo concentration may inevitably exacerbate the icp effect if asymmetric fo membranes are employed leading to an undesired and fairly slow equilibration process in addition precipitation may also occur once ds fo or fs md reaches a saturated of oversaturated state especially when na2so4 is used as the draw solute owing to solubility concerns moreover it is important to mention that membrane fouling either fo or md membrane is not considered in either of the above two situations water management should be much more complicated in view of the practical applications surprisingly csm tfc membrane shows a dramatic decline by 65 3 in wtr in the fo process fig s5a although the entire experiment was completed within 30 h fig s5b the wtr in the fo process decreases from 25 4 to 17 0 ml h 1 taking approximately 10 h to reach the same wtr level as that in the md process however the decrease continues over the rest of the test final value of 8 8 ml h 1 both of which suggesting that the severe fouling is derived from the deposition of the dye molecules on the membrane surface considering the initial water flux of the hti cta membrane the temperature difference for the md component was adjusted to 40 c to avoid the fast evaporation of fs md or ds fo forming na2so4 precipitates consequently its te may have inevitably decreased as discussed earlier fig 3c in this manner the wtr decline for the hti cta membrane is found to be more gentle but still at a high level of 31 9 from 11 6 to 7 9 ml h 1 figs s5c and s5d indicating membrane fouling as well compared with the two commercial fo membranes the fo md hybrid process by using our symmetric membrane ptaodh 1 0 proceeded quite well owing to a higher water flux of the fo part its initial wtr was found to be slightly higher than that of the md part however the dynamic water equilibration was established only after a few hours as evidenced by the identical wtr for both fo and md components fig 5 a the conductivity in the distillate was also found to be stable at a low level 5 μs cm 1 over the entire test indicating the excellent stability of the system although it was reported in many previous studies that dynamic equilibrium is not prone to being established in the fo md hybrid process an et al 2019 lu et al 2018 xie et al 2014 such an ideal operation state was eventually obtained by using our symmetric membrane in the fo part together with a common hydrophobic membrane ptfe in the md part some plausible explanations are provided as follows on the one hand as the concentration of ds fo or fs md continues to vary particularly in the early stages the water flux in the fo part varies accordingly however commercial asymmetric membranes suffer from a large icp effect as reported elsewhere li et al 2019 gray et al 2006 thus the water flux of the fo membranes does not display a linear relation with the ds fo concentration consequently the variations in wtr may be difficult to match between the fo and md parts without ending with the dynamic equilibration even after a long term procedure owing to the lack of icp effect this phenomenon could be well inhibited in the symmetric membrane system as revealed recently by both mathematical models and experimental observations li et al 2018 on the other hand the membrane fouling is non negligible and is perhaps a more critical issue although fo membranes were regarded as low fouling media kim et al 2014 shaffer et al 2015 a cake layer would still form when the cf is at a high level such molecular deposition was found more easily on the surface of the commercial membranes roughness of 3 8 46 0 nm and 30 3 65 0 nm for the cta and tfc fo membranes respectively li et al 2019 mazlan et al 2016 stillman et al 2014 resulting in the inhibition of the water transfer figs s5a and s5c by contrast the symmetric ptaodh 1 0 membrane with an ultra smooth surface nature roughness of 0 66 0 08 nm li et al 2019 was demonstrated to be effective in avoiding the dye adhesion under a crossflow hydraulic scouring and thus maintaining the wtr in an almost constant level over the entire membrane process 3 3 evaluation of energy thermal consumption with the experimental results obtained the energy and thermal consumptions for different operation modes using different membranes are further studied fig 6 shows the changes in the specific energy consumption in the fo process sec fo where the consumed energy only accounts for the water pump the calculated values of sec fo seems relatively high which is largely attributed to the low wtr caused by low water flux and limited membrane area only 10 0 cm2 eqs s 13 and s 25 however the sec fo could be significantly reduced if fo membranes with larger effective areas were employed in practical use regardless which membrane was employed mode b always displayed the largest sec fo among the three operation modes indicating that it consumes the most energy a similar trend was also found for the hti cta membrane which continuously exhibited the largest sec fo among the three fo membranes in the three operation modes as the water fluxes of both commercial fo membranes decreased considerably at the ending stage of the concentration process these results clearly reveal that the higher energy consumption is mostly derived from the reduced water fluxes and resulting longer operation durations in this manner membrane ptaodh 1 0 with the shortest treatment time undoubtedly shows the lowest energy consumption in the fo process analogously relevant performance parameters including te stec gor and sec md of all md involved processes were also calculated and analyzed in this study fig 7 in general all the obtained sec md were found to be only 7 2 17 5 higher than stec through the experiment indicating that the heat effect dominates the overall energy consumption of the md process just as the findings above the hti cta membrane showed the worst performance for all processes that is the highest stec 1859 1 2008 8 kwh m 3 and sec md 2083 3 2396 0 kwh m 3 and the corresponding lowest gor 0 30 0 26 therefore such a result further indicates the unreliability of this type of fo membrane for use in any md coupled hybrid process one possible reason is its inherently lower water flux which requires a lower temperature difference in md 40 c whereas 50 c for the csm tfc and ptaodh 1 0 membranes to balance the wtr resulting in the lowest te 60 70 again owing to the fact that it exhibits the most stable wtr and shortest operation duration among all three fo membranes symmetric membrane ptaodh 1 0 is expected to display the most superior performance in the hybrid process more specifically a significant decline in te and simultaneous increase in stec were observed for both commercial fo membranes during the second half of the experiments fig 7 note that for a long period of time wtr in md was greater than that in the fo process fig s5 thus fs md or ds fo may undergo excessive evaporation generating a saturated or oversaturated solution as discussed earlier inorganic scaling was likely to form and accumulate on the ptfe membrane surface resulting in a reduction in water productivity and an increase in the thermal conductivity coefficient consequently reducing the membrane desalination and thermal energy efficiency deshmukh et al 2018 in terms of the overall results of the energy evaluations commercial fo membranes especially the csm tfc membrane may still be applicable for the fo md hybrid process for a dye concentration treatment however a stable water recovery ratio of less than 30 is expected corresponding to a cf of 3 3 by contrast a water recovery ratio as high as 90 cf of 10 could be steadily achieved for the symmetric membrane ptaodh 1 0 without much variation in energy consumption which is highly beneficial for the subsequent dye recovery process lin et al 2015 chen et al 2015 cong and yu 2007 a further increase in the cf may be possible however the practical application should also consider the dye solubility and viscosity increase of the solution 3 4 economic analysis economic feasibility of the proposed fo md process in this study is another concern for practical application therefore we summarized the related data and calculated some key cost parameters by comparing the implementation of the three types of fo membranes and their use in the three operation modes table 1 specifically the cost of the fabricated ptaodh 1 0 membrane was estimated to be 56 usd m2 by considering the total expense of chemicals solvents purification processes etc which was further multiplied by 1 5 to consider other potential expenditures meanwhile the costs for the two commercial fo membranes were assessed by their purchase prices in the module followed by a simple calculation of the area of the membranes furthermore the electric costs only comprise the cost of pump operation solution heating cooling and heat exchange without an md unit operation in mode a shows a reasonably low electricity cost however additional chemicals draw solute significantly contributes to the total cost tc resulting in the highest tc among the three operation modes storage or treatment of the ds with the continuously increased salt amount and solution volume would be another critical issue in the consideration of the environmental impact for comparison the implementation of the md unit md membrane and md related electricity cost rendered the largest tc for both modes b and c by using the symmetric ptaodh 1 0 membrane in the fo md hybrid process the lowest tc was achieved approximately 0 17 usd for treating 500 ml textile wastewater to a cf of 10 this simultaneously produced 450 ml of pure water that could be reused in the dyeing process nevertheless it is worth mentioning that md can benefit from using low grade or waste heat from industrial sources and power plants as reported elsewhere deshmukh et al 2018 therefore by employing these heats to offer the heat energy in md process considerable reduction in the electricity cost is highly possible which may further facilitate the economic viability expanding the wastewater capacity results in a significant increase in tc largely due to the cost of fo membranes accounting for 60 8 86 2 table 2 another issue is the fo membrane fouling which greatly affects the effectiveness of the system process while the performance recovery of fo membranes was mostly ignored in the lab scale experiments recovery was critically needed on an industrial scale assuming a backwashing process using pure water together with the consideration of the water flux recovery ratios of the three fo membranes in our previous study li et al 2019 table 2 the membrane cleaning cost was estimated to be 0 030 0 025 and 0 024 usd m3 corresponding to tc values of ca 14 15 48 34 and 47 54 usd m3 for the ptaodh 1 0 hti cta and csm tfc membranes respectively according to some statistics approximately 2 1 billion ton of textile wastewater assuming an average dye content of 0 1 was discharged in china in 2015 zheng et al 2019 by using the same process presented in this study approximately 1 9 billion liters of fresh water and 2 1 million ton of dyes could be reclaimed and reused which would complete the mld zld mission while largely relieving the stress of the industrial water supply 1 usd m3 in 2015 to realize the fo md hybrid process in the textile wastewater treatment plant reducing the fo membrane cost is the paramount issue in reducing tc applying the ptaodh 1 0 membrane in the fo md hybrid process has been demonstrated to be highly promising however its performance regeneration after each treatment cycle may still need further optimization to extend the membrane lifespan moreover as dcmd was regarded as convenient but the most energy consuming process compared with the other md configurations sweeping gas md and vacuum md karanikola et al 2019 integrating fo with an appropriate md unit may be another compelling option to further strengthen the competitiveness of this technology additionally the md process may also be substituted by some novel desalination processes such as low salt rejection ro lsrro technology revealed in a very recent research by wang et al 2020 it can be used to desalinate or concentrate hyper saline brines using moderate hydraulic pressure with relatively low energy consumption therefore we re curious but highly anticipate a substantial reduction of the total energy consumption for the hybrid system if lsrro would be coupled with the symmetric fo membrane and achieve a facile water equilibration as well 4 conclusions in this work we systematically evaluated the feasibility of the concentration process of a model textile wastewater by using three different types of fo membranes under three types of operation modes although all processes could achieve a high cf of 10 for the feed solution operation in mode a requires extra draw solute consumption to maintain the osmotic driving force producing a larger ds volume without the supplement of the draw solute the water fluxes were found to be continuously decreasing over the entire process for mode b which greatly extended the treatment duration the most promising approach was determined for the fo md hybrid process where the draw solute was diluted in the fo part and was simultaneously regenerated in the md part however owing to the existence of the icp effect and membrane fouling the two commercial fo membranes did not show satisfactory performance owing to the difficulty in equilibrating wtr by contrast symmetric fo membrane showed superior performance in the fo md process as its wtrs were found to be almost identical between the fo and md process resulting in much lower energy consumption economic analysis revealed that the lowest tc of ca 0 17 usd for treating 500 ml textile wastewater to a cf of 10 was achieved by using the symmetric ptaodh 1 0 membrane in the hybrid process possible improvements including the feasibility of various dyes and the possible selection of other draw solutes need to be examined to

18134,the forward osmosis membrane distillation fo md hybrid process has shown great promise in achieving zero liquid discharge in the textile industry recovering valuable dye molecules while producing large amounts of clean water however the progress of this technology seems to have stagnated with the direct coupling of commercial asymmetric fo and md membranes because water management in the system is found to be rather complicated owing to the processing of the different membranes herein we propose for the first time an fo md hybrid process using a custom made self standing and symmetric membrane and a hydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene membrane in the fo and md units respectively three types of operation modes were investigated to systematically study the process performance in the concentration treatment of model textile wastewater two commercial fo membranes were also tested for comparison owing to its low fouling propensity and lack of an internal concentration polarization effect the water transfer rate of our symmetric fo membrane quickly reaches equilibrium with that in the md unit resulting in continuous and stable operation consequently the hybrid process using the symmetric fo membrane was found to consume the least energy as indicated by its lowest total cost in both lab and large scale systems overall our study provides a new strategy for using a symmetric fo membrane in the fo md hybrid process and highlights its great potential for use in the treatment of textile wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords fo md hybrid process textile wastewater symmetric fo membrane energy thermal efficiency economic analysis 1 introduction as the concept of minimal and zero liquid discharge mld zld has been introduced water reclamation particularly from wastewater has drawn extensive attention over the past few decades werber et al 2016 wang et al 2020 tong and elimelech 2016 some valuable resources can be recycled or reused for a sustainable purpose which may significantly reduce the production cost and extent of the environmental pollution petrinic et al 2015 lu et al 2019 conidi et al 2018 generally characterized by both high water consumption and extremely polluted effluents textile industries produce large quantities of saline wastewater containing various dyes during the dyeing process petrinic et al 2015 de vreese and van der bruggen 2007 owing to the complexity of the textile wastewater composition achieving mld zld has become highly attractive but remains significantly challenging compared with existing treatment processes e g adsorption cardoso et al 2012 biological method gupta et al 2014 advanced oxidation oller et al 2011 and coagulation flocculation verma et al 2012 which may produce undesired side products or secondary pollution membrane based technologies have demonstrated great potential and have been successfully applied recently at the lab scale li et al 2017 lin et al 2015 gillerman et al 2006 lau and ismail 2009 zhao and wang 2017 vourch et al 2008 by using typical pressure driven membranes loose nanofiltration li et al 2017 lin et al 2015 or tight ultrafiltration lin et al 2016 with appropriate pore sizes and surface charges dye molecules can be selectively retained on the concentrated side whereas most of the inorganic salts penetrate to the permeate however the subsequent dye recycling step i e the concentration process seems to be highly risky as the fouling of these membranes can easily occur becoming more severe with an increase in the concentration factor cf li et al 2017 by contrast a high water recovery ratio for the concentration process is theoretically more easily achieved through the forward osmosis fo process which is driven by osmotic pressure its inherently low fouling propensity has also been experimentally proved to be effective even in treatment with a highly concentrated feed solution li et al 2019 kim et al 2014 shaffer et al 2015 nevertheless as the water penetrates from the feed to the draw solution ds the osmotic pressure decreases accordingly owing to the dilution which inevitably results in a decline in performance thus the necessity of ds recovery reuse has remained as one of the greatest drawbacks of fo technology the integration of fo with a membrane distillation md unit seems promising the ds could be regenerated by a heat driven process even if the solution possesses an extremely high solute content osmotic pressure an et al 2019 wang et al 2015 liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 xie et al 2013 in light of this extensive efforts have been devoted to the fo md hybrid process in recent years an et al 2019 wang et al 2015 liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 xie et al 2013 ge et al 2012 kim et al 2019 including exploration of the polyelectrolyte draw solute ge et al 2012 module design kim et al 2019 and development of new membrane materials zhang et al 2014 in general the feasibility of an fo md process for continuous operation requires strict water management that is a water balance between the two separated units however fo is typically applied with asymmetric membranes including commercial ones thus most studies have focused only on their compatibility with the md process on the one hand the existing internal concentration polarization icp effect in such asymmetric membrane systems which is regarded as their achilles heel exerts great influence on the fo performance li et al 2019 the ds concentration decreases along with water penetration from the feed to the draw side however the decline trend in water flux does not have a linear relationship with the salt content owing to the icp particularly at a high concentration level in this manner the water equilibration between the fo and md components becomes rather complicated resulting in the frequent adjustment of operating temperatures in md on the other hand the initial concentrations of the feed solutions in previous studies were generally set at a low range 20 300 mg l 1 ge et al 2012 mahto et al 2017 han et al 2016 huang et al 2017 treatment with these types of model waters may not quite reflect the possible membrane characteristics for practical applications e g cake layer formation on the membrane surface when the dye concentration in the feed increases to a certain level the complex combination of the fo md hybrid process choice of fo membranes i e asymmetric or recently reported symmetric structures li et al 2018 2019 shaffer et al 2015 and corresponding economic evaluation encouraged us to systematically investigate the feasibility of this technology for textile wastewater treatment herein three different types of fo membranes commercial cellulose triacetate hti cta commercial thin film composite fo membrane csm tfc and custom made symmetric membrane and one class of md membrane polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe were employed in fo and md process respectively their effectiveness for concentrating a model dye solution up to a cf of 10 were studied and comprehensively compared in three operation modes i e an isolated fo process separated fo integrated with separated md process and fo md hybrid process their associated economic attributes including thermal energy consumption gained output ratio gor and system expense were further evaluated or estimated 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals for the fo unit a symmetric and self standing fo membrane with ultra low fouling propensity and no icp effect ptaodh 1 0 here 1 0 represents the molar ratio of 4 aminobenzoic acid to the repeating unit of podh during the synthesis thickness 8 μm was fabricated according to our previous work li et al 2018 with two commercial fo membranes i e hti cta hydration technology innovations and csm tfc toray chemical korea inc for comparison characterizations including water and salt permeability structural parameters and microscale morphologies are provided in the earlier work li et al 2018 and partially in supplementary material fig s1 for the md process a commercial flat sheet ptfe membrane was provided from sterlitech corporation ptfe0214225 washington usa detailed characterizations including pore size water contact angle liquid entry pressure porosity and morphology were measured and are summarized in fig s2 and table s1 before operation in the md unit the ptfe membrane was wetted with ethanol rinsed using deionized di water and completely dried in a vacuum oven congo red cr and sodium sulfate na2so4 were procured from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china other reagents and solvents were used as received di water with a minimum resistance of 18 mω cm millipore was used throughout the study 2 2 set up of fo md hybrid system in the current study the fo md hybrid system consists of an individual fo loop and md loop as graphically shown in fig 1 a in the fo unit di water and 1 5 m na2so4 solutions were used as the feed solution fs fo and draw solution ds fo respectively the effective area of the membrane was controlled to 10 0 cm2 while the cross flow rates on both sides fs fo and ds fo were fixed at 0 2 l min 1 10 4 cm s 1 as described previously li et al 2018 as the ds fo simultaneously served as the feed solution in the md process fs md it was heated to five different temperatures 25 35 45 55 and 65 c to optimize the associated md performance the temperature of fs fo was kept at 25 c throughout the test in the md unit the performances were evaluated in direct contact membrane distillation dcmd mode with an effective membrane area of 10 0 cm2 the cross flow rates of solutions were fixed at 0 2 l min 1 10 4 cm s 1 and 0 1 l min 1 5 2 cm s 1 for the feed fs md same as ds fo and distillate streams respectively as the most optimal temperature for fs md was found to be 55 c as discussed later the temperatures for the distillate side were set at 5 15 and 25 c respectively corresponding to temperature differences of 30 40 and 50 c respectively for each test the system would be run for at least 30 min for equilibration before the reliable performance data were collected the reverse salt flux j s fo was measured with an electric conductivity dds 307 conductivity meter china while the water fluxes j w fo or j w md were obtained by measuring the weight change in the ds fo and distillate in md respectively notably when the cr solution was employed as fs fo the reverse salt contents in the fo unit were measured by ion chromatography dionex ics 2100 u s a in terms of so4 2 and the cr concentrations were measured by uv vis spectrometry lambda 25 perkinelmer u s a detailed calculations methods are provided in the supplementary material 2 3 model textile wastewater tests in this study cr was used as a typical dye to prepare the model textile wastewater li et al 2017 2019 with an initial concentration of 1 0 g l 1 the experiments proceeded by three types of operation modes i e mode a isolated fo process mode b separated fo integrated with separated md process and mode c fo md hybrid process as mentioned earlier fig 1b in the fo unit an initial 300 ml of na2so4 solution 1 5 m and 500 ml of cr solution 1 g l 1 were used as ds fo and fs fo respectively all membranes in the fo unit were tested in fo mode active layer facing the feed solution while the active layer of the ptfe membrane faced the hot side fs md or ds fo in the md unit the concentration process of the cr solution continuously progressed until the water recovery ratio reached 90 corresponding to a cf of 10 mode a in this mode the concentration of ds fo was maintained at 1 5 m by manually adding the salt na2so4 with a conductivity monitor over a certain time period the fo process ended once the cf reached 10 as the concentration of ds fo was fixed over the entire test no further treatment was performed for ds fo regeneration however the ds fo volume would notably increase accordingly as the water permeated from the feed solution mode b in this mode the fo process operated in a continuous manner without the supplement of salt also resulting in a cf of 10 similar to mode a the volume of ds fo would also increase but with a much lower concentration to be specific the concentration of ds fo decreased to 0 6 mol l 1 at the end of the fo process such an extra amount of water 450 ml from fs fo needed to be distillated until the concentration reached 1 5 m again corresponding to a water recovery ratio of 60 for the md process mode c different than modes a and b the concentrating of the dye solution and the regeneration of ds fo or fs md proceeded simultaneously in this mode ds fo was diluted by accepting the penetrated water from fs fo whereas it would be concentrated in the md process at the same time from the internal circulation serving as fresh ds fo again specifically as the water fluxes for all three membranes ptaodh 1 0 hti cta and csm tfc in the fo process were different the temperature differences applied in their md processes were optimized separately will discuss later fully taking the water transfer rate wtr in this hybrid process into account 2 4 evaluation of energy thermal consumption in this study the total energy consumption was calculated by the summation of energy consumption in the fo loop and md loop respectively it should be mentioned that energy consumption in the fo process only comes from the pumping operation whereas it originates from both the pumping operation and heater cooler for solution heating cooling in the md process detailed calculation methods including the thermal efficiency te gor specific thermal energy consumption stec and specific energy consumption sec of the hybrid process were provided in supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of fo and md processes as ds fo also serves as the feed solution in md unit its operating temperature was initially studied and optimized separately for both units as shown in fig 2 a c the water fluxes j w fo for all three fo membranes ptaodh 1 0 hti cta and csm tfc increase with an increase in the ds fo temperature which is attributed to the elevated osmotic driving force and draw solute diffusion at higher temperatures kim et al 2019 phuntsho et al 2012 all the salt reverse fluxes j s fo increase accordingly suggesting a greater salt loss nonetheless the reverse flux selectivity j w j s a parameter that reflects the reverse flux selectivity for an fo membrane li et al 2018 shaffer et al 2015 kim et al 2019 was found to be less significant for the temperature variations fig 2d of all three membranes indicating the minor effect on temperatures that may vary their physical properties considering the energy consumption that is closely associated with the operating temperature the temperature of ds fo was finally determined to be 55 c in which j w j s for all three fo membranes were at their maximum levels i e 432 1 375 6 and 502 0 l mol 1 for ptaodh 1 0 hti cta and csm tfc membranes respectively subsequently the md unit was optimized by adjusting the temperature of the distillate stream resulting in different trans membrane temperature differences owing to the increased water vapor pressure alsaadi et al 2014 j w md of the ptfe membrane increases with an increase in the temperature difference as described in fig 3 a although the concentration of fs md or ds fo increases as the experiment proceeds no apparent changes were observed in either the water flux or the membrane permeability coefficient k m fig 3b see in supplementary material suggesting a negligible influence on the solution concentration chen et al 2020 further calculation of both the temperature polarization coefficient tpc and te revealed that the most optimal md performance occurs at a temperature difference of 50 c which indicated the lowest temperature polarization and highest utilization of heat of the md system liu et al 2019 swaminathan et al 2018 combining the above results the temperatures for fs fo ds fo or fs md and ds md were eventually determined and fixed at 25 55 and 5 c respectively for the subsequent treatment of the textile wastewaters 3 2 model textile wastewater tests 3 2 1 operation in mode a and mode b to verify the feasibility of dye concentration in the fo process and water reclamation in md process two typical modes a and b were conducted and the results are displayed in fig 4 and fig s3 through the manual supplement of the draw solute na2so4 to maintain a constant osmotic pressure mode a membrane ptaodh 1 0 maintains a stable j w fo of 18 6 0 4 l m 2 h 1 over the entire concentration process until cf reaches 10 fig 4a this could be regarded as the primary evidence of minimal fouling at the feed side as well as a negligible icp effect li et al 2019 by contrast the asymmetric hti cta and csm tfc membranes both exhibit apparent flux declines suggesting severe membrane fouling and the associated external concentration polarization ecp effect although membrane csm tfc possesses the greatest initial j w fo it decreased by 59 6 from 25 5 to 10 3 l m 2 h 1 at the end of the experiment fig s3a indicating its most inferior fo performance different than mode a the water fluxes for all three membranes decrease significantly in mode b as the driving forces continuously decrease with water penetration more specifically the j w fo of membrane ptaodh 1 0 decreases by 56 8 from 18 4 to 7 9 l m 2 h 1 fig s3b which matches the ds dilution ratio of 60 unsurprisingly the two commercial membranes both exhibit a faster flux decline which is probably attributed to the severe fouling and ecp effect as also mentioned above the calculated ecp here was found to reduce the driving force by 16 4 and 17 0 for the hti cta and csm tfc membranes respectively it is worth mentioning that the salt and dye loss were both maintained at low levels over the entire fo process regardless of the membrane type or operation mode fig 4b and d the slightly higher concentrations of salt in fs fo and dye in ds fo were only ascribed to the longer operation durations of mode b symmetric membrane ptaodh 1 0 possessing the highest running fluxes lowest solute loss and the least time consumption in both modes figs s3a and s3b displays the most superior effectiveness for the dye concentration process among the three fo membranes one possible explanation would be its ultra smooth surface roughness which was demonstrated to effectively prevent the dye molecule deposition under the hydraulic shear force li et al 2019 zhao et al 2015 mazlan et al 2016 after the experiments the dye solution could be successfully concentrated at a cf of 10 for both operation modes as ds fo was still maintained at 1 5 m for mode a no further regeneration is needed however an extra 95 9 g of na2so4 was consumed along with a much enlarged solution volume 750 ml as such the practical wastewater treatment by mode a may only be suitable for some small scale and off grid applications considering the limited room for infrastructure and expenditure on the draw solutes although no additional draw solute was required in mode b the continuously reduced osmotic driving force considerably prolonged the entire concentration process suggesting excessive energy consumption consequently a diluted 750 ml of ds fo 0 6 m was collected which required regeneration by a separate md process as graphically described in fig s4 the experiment proceeded for another 28 h until reaching a water recovery ratio of 60 1 5 m however the water flux slightly decreased from 17 0 to 14 7 l m 2 h 1 at the end of the test possibly owing to membrane fouling or scaling in terms of the fo and md performances in mode b it is suggested that practical application of this mode may not be possible as ds fo underwent overdilution resulting in a much lower time efficiency and higher energy consumption 3 2 2 operation in mode c although mode a and mode b both eventually completed the concentration process many drawbacks were involved as mentioned above therefore an fo md hybrid process mode c is highly attractive because ds fo or fs md is diluted and expected to be regenerated simultaneously maintaining its pristine concentration osmotic pressure however a critical issue remaining in this technology is the wtr balance for the fo and md components liu et al 2016 kim et al 2019 in brief if the wtr in fo is higher than that in the md process ds fo or fs md would be diluted with time until a water balance is established note that the concentration of ds fo or fs md would be lower or much lower than that in the initial state resulting in a longer treatment duration on the contrary if the wtr in fo is lower than that of md ds fo or fs md would still be steadily concentrated with time until reaching a stable state as well however such an increase in ds fo concentration may inevitably exacerbate the icp effect if asymmetric fo membranes are employed leading to an undesired and fairly slow equilibration process in addition precipitation may also occur once ds fo or fs md reaches a saturated of oversaturated state especially when na2so4 is used as the draw solute owing to solubility concerns moreover it is important to mention that membrane fouling either fo or md membrane is not considered in either of the above two situations water management should be much more complicated in view of the practical applications surprisingly csm tfc membrane shows a dramatic decline by 65 3 in wtr in the fo process fig s5a although the entire experiment was completed within 30 h fig s5b the wtr in the fo process decreases from 25 4 to 17 0 ml h 1 taking approximately 10 h to reach the same wtr level as that in the md process however the decrease continues over the rest of the test final value of 8 8 ml h 1 both of which suggesting that the severe fouling is derived from the deposition of the dye molecules on the membrane surface considering the initial water flux of the hti cta membrane the temperature difference for the md component was adjusted to 40 c to avoid the fast evaporation of fs md or ds fo forming na2so4 precipitates consequently its te may have inevitably decreased as discussed earlier fig 3c in this manner the wtr decline for the hti cta membrane is found to be more gentle but still at a high level of 31 9 from 11 6 to 7 9 ml h 1 figs s5c and s5d indicating membrane fouling as well compared with the two commercial fo membranes the fo md hybrid process by using our symmetric membrane ptaodh 1 0 proceeded quite well owing to a higher water flux of the fo part its initial wtr was found to be slightly higher than that of the md part however the dynamic water equilibration was established only after a few hours as evidenced by the identical wtr for both fo and md components fig 5 a the conductivity in the distillate was also found to be stable at a low level 5 μs cm 1 over the entire test indicating the excellent stability of the system although it was reported in many previous studies that dynamic equilibrium is not prone to being established in the fo md hybrid process an et al 2019 lu et al 2018 xie et al 2014 such an ideal operation state was eventually obtained by using our symmetric membrane in the fo part together with a common hydrophobic membrane ptfe in the md part some plausible explanations are provided as follows on the one hand as the concentration of ds fo or fs md continues to vary particularly in the early stages the water flux in the fo part varies accordingly however commercial asymmetric membranes suffer from a large icp effect as reported elsewhere li et al 2019 gray et al 2006 thus the water flux of the fo membranes does not display a linear relation with the ds fo concentration consequently the variations in wtr may be difficult to match between the fo and md parts without ending with the dynamic equilibration even after a long term procedure owing to the lack of icp effect this phenomenon could be well inhibited in the symmetric membrane system as revealed recently by both mathematical models and experimental observations li et al 2018 on the other hand the membrane fouling is non negligible and is perhaps a more critical issue although fo membranes were regarded as low fouling media kim et al 2014 shaffer et al 2015 a cake layer would still form when the cf is at a high level such molecular deposition was found more easily on the surface of the commercial membranes roughness of 3 8 46 0 nm and 30 3 65 0 nm for the cta and tfc fo membranes respectively li et al 2019 mazlan et al 2016 stillman et al 2014 resulting in the inhibition of the water transfer figs s5a and s5c by contrast the symmetric ptaodh 1 0 membrane with an ultra smooth surface nature roughness of 0 66 0 08 nm li et al 2019 was demonstrated to be effective in avoiding the dye adhesion under a crossflow hydraulic scouring and thus maintaining the wtr in an almost constant level over the entire membrane process 3 3 evaluation of energy thermal consumption with the experimental results obtained the energy and thermal consumptions for different operation modes using different membranes are further studied fig 6 shows the changes in the specific energy consumption in the fo process sec fo where the consumed energy only accounts for the water pump the calculated values of sec fo seems relatively high which is largely attributed to the low wtr caused by low water flux and limited membrane area only 10 0 cm2 eqs s 13 and s 25 however the sec fo could be significantly reduced if fo membranes with larger effective areas were employed in practical use regardless which membrane was employed mode b always displayed the largest sec fo among the three operation modes indicating that it consumes the most energy a similar trend was also found for the hti cta membrane which continuously exhibited the largest sec fo among the three fo membranes in the three operation modes as the water fluxes of both commercial fo membranes decreased considerably at the ending stage of the concentration process these results clearly reveal that the higher energy consumption is mostly derived from the reduced water fluxes and resulting longer operation durations in this manner membrane ptaodh 1 0 with the shortest treatment time undoubtedly shows the lowest energy consumption in the fo process analogously relevant performance parameters including te stec gor and sec md of all md involved processes were also calculated and analyzed in this study fig 7 in general all the obtained sec md were found to be only 7 2 17 5 higher than stec through the experiment indicating that the heat effect dominates the overall energy consumption of the md process just as the findings above the hti cta membrane showed the worst performance for all processes that is the highest stec 1859 1 2008 8 kwh m 3 and sec md 2083 3 2396 0 kwh m 3 and the corresponding lowest gor 0 30 0 26 therefore such a result further indicates the unreliability of this type of fo membrane for use in any md coupled hybrid process one possible reason is its inherently lower water flux which requires a lower temperature difference in md 40 c whereas 50 c for the csm tfc and ptaodh 1 0 membranes to balance the wtr resulting in the lowest te 60 70 again owing to the fact that it exhibits the most stable wtr and shortest operation duration among all three fo membranes symmetric membrane ptaodh 1 0 is expected to display the most superior performance in the hybrid process more specifically a significant decline in te and simultaneous increase in stec were observed for both commercial fo membranes during the second half of the experiments fig 7 note that for a long period of time wtr in md was greater than that in the fo process fig s5 thus fs md or ds fo may undergo excessive evaporation generating a saturated or oversaturated solution as discussed earlier inorganic scaling was likely to form and accumulate on the ptfe membrane surface resulting in a reduction in water productivity and an increase in the thermal conductivity coefficient consequently reducing the membrane desalination and thermal energy efficiency deshmukh et al 2018 in terms of the overall results of the energy evaluations commercial fo membranes especially the csm tfc membrane may still be applicable for the fo md hybrid process for a dye concentration treatment however a stable water recovery ratio of less than 30 is expected corresponding to a cf of 3 3 by contrast a water recovery ratio as high as 90 cf of 10 could be steadily achieved for the symmetric membrane ptaodh 1 0 without much variation in energy consumption which is highly beneficial for the subsequent dye recovery process lin et al 2015 chen et al 2015 cong and yu 2007 a further increase in the cf may be possible however the practical application should also consider the dye solubility and viscosity increase of the solution 3 4 economic analysis economic feasibility of the proposed fo md process in this study is another concern for practical application therefore we summarized the related data and calculated some key cost parameters by comparing the implementation of the three types of fo membranes and their use in the three operation modes table 1 specifically the cost of the fabricated ptaodh 1 0 membrane was estimated to be 56 usd m2 by considering the total expense of chemicals solvents purification processes etc which was further multiplied by 1 5 to consider other potential expenditures meanwhile the costs for the two commercial fo membranes were assessed by their purchase prices in the module followed by a simple calculation of the area of the membranes furthermore the electric costs only comprise the cost of pump operation solution heating cooling and heat exchange without an md unit operation in mode a shows a reasonably low electricity cost however additional chemicals draw solute significantly contributes to the total cost tc resulting in the highest tc among the three operation modes storage or treatment of the ds with the continuously increased salt amount and solution volume would be another critical issue in the consideration of the environmental impact for comparison the implementation of the md unit md membrane and md related electricity cost rendered the largest tc for both modes b and c by using the symmetric ptaodh 1 0 membrane in the fo md hybrid process the lowest tc was achieved approximately 0 17 usd for treating 500 ml textile wastewater to a cf of 10 this simultaneously produced 450 ml of pure water that could be reused in the dyeing process nevertheless it is worth mentioning that md can benefit from using low grade or waste heat from industrial sources and power plants as reported elsewhere deshmukh et al 2018 therefore by employing these heats to offer the heat energy in md process considerable reduction in the electricity cost is highly possible which may further facilitate the economic viability expanding the wastewater capacity results in a significant increase in tc largely due to the cost of fo membranes accounting for 60 8 86 2 table 2 another issue is the fo membrane fouling which greatly affects the effectiveness of the system process while the performance recovery of fo membranes was mostly ignored in the lab scale experiments recovery was critically needed on an industrial scale assuming a backwashing process using pure water together with the consideration of the water flux recovery ratios of the three fo membranes in our previous study li et al 2019 table 2 the membrane cleaning cost was estimated to be 0 030 0 025 and 0 024 usd m3 corresponding to tc values of ca 14 15 48 34 and 47 54 usd m3 for the ptaodh 1 0 hti cta and csm tfc membranes respectively according to some statistics approximately 2 1 billion ton of textile wastewater assuming an average dye content of 0 1 was discharged in china in 2015 zheng et al 2019 by using the same process presented in this study approximately 1 9 billion liters of fresh water and 2 1 million ton of dyes could be reclaimed and reused which would complete the mld zld mission while largely relieving the stress of the industrial water supply 1 usd m3 in 2015 to realize the fo md hybrid process in the textile wastewater treatment plant reducing the fo membrane cost is the paramount issue in reducing tc applying the ptaodh 1 0 membrane in the fo md hybrid process has been demonstrated to be highly promising however its performance regeneration after each treatment cycle may still need further optimization to extend the membrane lifespan moreover as dcmd was regarded as convenient but the most energy consuming process compared with the other md configurations sweeping gas md and vacuum md karanikola et al 2019 integrating fo with an appropriate md unit may be another compelling option to further strengthen the competitiveness of this technology additionally the md process may also be substituted by some novel desalination processes such as low salt rejection ro lsrro technology revealed in a very recent research by wang et al 2020 it can be used to desalinate or concentrate hyper saline brines using moderate hydraulic pressure with relatively low energy consumption therefore we re curious but highly anticipate a substantial reduction of the total energy consumption for the hybrid system if lsrro would be coupled with the symmetric fo membrane and achieve a facile water equilibration as well 4 conclusions in this work we systematically evaluated the feasibility of the concentration process of a model textile wastewater by using three different types of fo membranes under three types of operation modes although all processes could achieve a high cf of 10 for the feed solution operation in mode a requires extra draw solute consumption to maintain the osmotic driving force producing a larger ds volume without the supplement of the draw solute the water fluxes were found to be continuously decreasing over the entire process for mode b which greatly extended the treatment duration the most promising approach was determined for the fo md hybrid process where the draw solute was diluted in the fo part and was simultaneously regenerated in the md part however owing to the existence of the icp effect and membrane fouling the two commercial fo membranes did not show satisfactory performance owing to the difficulty in equilibrating wtr by contrast symmetric fo membrane showed superior performance in the fo md process as its wtrs were found to be almost identical between the fo and md process resulting in much lower energy consumption economic analysis revealed that the lowest tc of ca 0 17 usd for treating 500 ml textile wastewater to a cf of 10 was achieved by using the symmetric ptaodh 1 0 membrane in the hybrid process possible improvements including the feasibility of various dyes and the possible selection of other draw solutes need to be examined to highlight the great potential of symmetric fo membranes for use in the dye concentration and recovery of textile wastewaters declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no
