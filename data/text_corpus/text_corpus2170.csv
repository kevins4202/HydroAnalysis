10850,extensive research has been conducted over the years to investigate the diverse effects of seawater on many crop plants either by irrigation or foliar spray in an attempt to enhance the yield and quality the purpose of this study was to quantitatively determine the effects of foliar seawater application on berry quality and ion distribution of kyoho grape vineyards a ﬁeld experiment was conducted using diluted seawater starting at veraison followed by seven day intervals between the treatments while leaf contained k as much as ca2 which was at least eight times higher than mg2 and na berry displayed different profiles as shown by significant decreases in k 22 4 and mg2 30 8 with almost no changes in ca2 and na concentrations of cations were much higher than those of anions in control vineyard soil under this study foliar seawater treatment did not change the amounts of k na hco3 and no3 but significantly increased the amounts of ca2 mg2 and cl in vineyard soil declined ratios of k na and mg2 na were observed in both leaf and berry after foliar seawater application but percentages in the declined ratios were significantly higher in leaf in contrast to berry and leaf vineyard soil had significantly increased ratios of mg2 na and ca2 na along with an unchanged ratio of k na after foliar seawater application substantially decreased activities of antioxidant defensive enzymes cat pod and apx were observed in the post seawater treatment leaves foliar seawater application resulted in high accumulation of proline soluble proteins and malondialdehyde mda as well as an improved soluble solid content ssc redness and color index for red grapes cirg in berries without losing weight firmness and yield leaf spad chlorophyll value of leaf soluble sugar and starch in branch were not affected despite the elevated level of cl in soil by foliar seawater treatment taken all the results together foliar seawater treatment starting at veraison could be useful

growth of sessile plants plays a central role in biomass production biodiversity carbon pool and storing filtering and transforming nutrients and water keesstra et al 2016 given the dependence of entire life cycles of plants on soil maintaining the soil in a good condition is very important to achieve the sustainable development goals of the united nations bai et al 2018 keesstra et al 2018a obour et al 2018 this is especially true for vineyards and citrus orchard soil due to the very high rates of soil erosion in mediterranean sloping terrain rodrigo comino et al 2018 keesstra et al 2019 besides soil texture acidification and erosion salinity is one of the most important soil qualities because its elevation triggers adverse effects by coordinately interfering with many intracellular processes of plant physiology and biochemistry shabala et al 2010 two primary types of salt stress are imposed on plant tissues one is an osmotic imbalance caused by high solute concentrations and the other is an ionic imbalance resulting from altered concentrations of na and cl along with changed k na ratio typically plants under high saline soil conditions exhibit growth inhibition biomass decrease and even cell death kibria et al 2017 this is primarily due to the increased uptake and accumulation of na by plants yang et al 2013 previous reports suggested that high levels of na diminished photosynthetic activities and productivity by promoting partial closure of stomata chakraborty et al 2016 radanielson et al 2018 destruction of chlorophyll pigment system astaneh et al 2018 erel et al 2015 yue et al 2012 and or damage to the reaction center of photosystem wang et al 2016 although na and k bear high resemblance in ionic and physicochemical properties numerous physiological processes are essentially dependent on k because it interacts with ion transport proteins metabolic enzymes and membrane proteins that control a short term maintenance of membrane potentials and stomatal opening closing of plants erel et al 2015 laanemets et al 2013 wakeel et al 2011 external k application improved salinity tolerance by promoting k accumulation and osmotic adjustment in peanut cultivars chakraborty et al 2016 thus the ability to retain k and or a high k na ratio in the cytosol is more important than a simple exclusion of na this conclusion was further confirmed by improved germination and growth of cucumber by maintaining a high cytosolic k na ratio under elevated na stress alsaeedi et al 2018 this ionic ratio approach may be used as a strategy to improve soil health and functions as a nature based solution in light of the fact that there is a worldwide interest to protect soils keesstra et al 2018b 2018c a beneficial k na selectivity also was enhanced by ca2 that affects the functionality of na and k transport systems bacha et al 2015 while elevated extracellular ca2 inhibits nonselective cation channels nscc which are the main routes for toxic na inﬂux ionic imbalance caused by increased intracellular na concentration above the normal level 1 10 mm gives rise to reduced uptake of k ca2 and mg2 in tissues of growing plants resulting in disturbed cytoplasmic homeostasis reddy et al 2017 besides ionic stress plants have evolved other adaptive mechanisms in order to cope with osmotic and oxidative stresses to combat with osmotic stress plants accumulate more compatible solutes and proteins increased accumulation of proline is known to be well correlated with enhanced salt tolerance chakraborty et al 2016 hatami et al 2018 since proline brings about tolerance to oxidative stress by modulating the activities of antioxidant enzymes such as sod pod apx and cat the individual components of antioxidant defense system activated by salt stress differ depending on plants kibria et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 typically plants subject to high salinity accumulate high levels of malondialdedehyde mda a hallmark of oxidative burst lipid injury caused by reactive oxygen species ros a secondary byproduct of salt stress zhou et al 2017 a nearly 3 5 of the seawater weight comes from six major dissolved ions chloride cl sodium na sulfate so4 2 magnesium mg2 calcium ca2 and potassium k in which sodium chloride constitutes more than 85 of total ions millero et al 2008 as a result many researchers have reported that seawater treatment disturbs intracellular ion balance leading to altered metabolic contents in higher plants ferrante et al 2011 in a previous study zheng et al 2013 however we demonstrated that the proper timing of diluted seawater application to whole trees improved fruit quality therefore we employed the same foliar seawater spray regimen and studied the resultant impact on grape berry quality and ion distribution in vineyard soil berry and leaf a balanced soil ion condition is known to be important for the quality of grape berry muller 2017 but the relationship between the seawater application and the distribution of cation and anion in vineyard soil has not been studied thus far the purpose of this study was to determine if there is a causal relationship between the change in soil ion conditions and quality of kyoho grape a red fruited table grape of hybrid tetraploid cultivar as a result of foliar seawater application 2 materials and methods 2 1 vineyard condition and grapevine

all of the measurements data were analyzed by spss version 16 0 software spss il usa each sample analysis was repeated at least three times and diﬀ erences between two groups were assessed using the student t test the results were expressed as means se differences were considered to be significant when the p values were less than 0 05 3 results 3 1 cation in leaf and berry of kyoho grape contents of k ca2 na and mg2 in leaf and berry of kyoho grape under control and foliar seawater treatments were measured fig 1 irrespective of the treatments leaf had much higher k ca2 na and mg2 concentrations than berry the contents of k and ca2 in leaves were approximately similar and at least eight times higher than those of na and mg2 in leaves treated with seawater the content of k ca2 mg2 and na increased by 52 6 54 7 85 9 and 376 9 respectively the highest and lowest cation contents in the berry were k and na respectively unlike leaves berry decreased the contents of k and mg2 by 22 4 30 8 respectively whereas ca2 and na remained unchanged after foliar seawater application overall k was the most abundant ion within the grape leaf and berry in both control and seawater treatments 3 2 cation and anion in vineyard soils table 1 showed that cations were more prevalent than anions in control vineyard soil foliar seawater treatment did not change the amounts of k and na but significantly increased ca2 and mg2 by 77 2 and 24 8 respectively similar to leaf and fruit control soil contained significantly higher level of k than the other three cations and both ca2 and mg2 also accounted for a relatively large proportion in vineyard soil normally cl and no3 were dominant anions of vineyard soils the content of cl increased by 50 1 whereas hco3 and no3 levels were unchanged by foliar seawater spray although hco3 is somewhat rich 140 mg l 0 41 of total ions in natural seawater 3 3 k na ca2 na and mg2 na in leaf berry and vineyard soils the ratios of k na ca2 na and mg2 na in leaf berry and vineyard soils are shown in fig 2 after foliar seawater spray k na ca2 na and mg2 na in mature leaves significantly declined by 68 0 67 5 and 61 1 respectively similarly k na and mg2 na in berry decreased following foliar seawater treatment interestingly the percentages of decline in k na 68 0 and mg2 na 61 1 in leaf were much higher than those of berry 23 9 in k na 32 2 in mg2 na unlike leaf berry did not display any significant change in ca2 na by foliar seawater spray k ca2 ratio was about 1 in both control and seawater in leaf whereas it was about 13 in control berry and 10 in seawater berry on the contrary k na remained unchanged whereas ca2 na and mg2 na increased in vineyard soils after foliar application of seawater perhaps na may have been more easily leached out in the vineyard soil under the experiment conditions 3 4 antioxidant enzymes sod is usually considered as the ﬁrst line of defense against oxidative stress foliar seawater treatment did not make a statistically significant difference in sod activity of leaves when compared to control table 2 foliar seawater condition led to increased accumulation of proline 50 3 mda 26 8 and soluble proteins 103 7 in grape leaves table 2 in contrast to the substantially increased levels of osmo protectant proline and soluble proteins activities of three antioxidant enzymes pod apx and cat significantly declined by 21 1 29 3 and 30 1 respectively as a result of foliar seawater treatment 3 5 fruit yield quality and vegetative growth kyoho grapes exposed to foliar seawater condition contained significantly higher ssc than control berries on the other hand yield berry weight and firmness were not affected by foliar seawater spray table 3 a pericarp color is a characteristic strongly influencing consumer acceptability because cielab parameters l a b c h and the calculated colorimetric indices were successfully used to assess the visual quality of red grapes we employed the same methodology to highlight the relevant differences among treatments choi et al 2014 as shown in table 3 berry redness a value and chroma c were significantly improved yellowness b value and hue angle h decreased significantly by 37 1 and 46 8 respectively as a result of foliar seawater spray berry lightness l value was not affected by foliar seawater spray for colorful table grapes the use of color indices allows for distinguishing high quality berries that are classified in different groups based on epicarp color as reported in the oiv descriptor list for table vine varieties and vitis species oiv 2009 both cirg1 and cirg2 indices were improved by foliar seawater application as indicated by higher values of cirg that describe the color of a table grape by means of a standardized and optimized index no statistically signiﬁcant differences were found in vegetative features when diluted seawater was applied to kyoho grape trees as indicated by unaffected leaf spad soluble sugar and starch in branch table 4 4 discussion salt has a significant impact on numerous physiological and biochemical attributes of plants yang et al 2013 under salt stress most terrestrial plants undergo inhibition of growth and metabolism in actively growing plant tissues shabala and cuin 2008 wu et al 2013 it is believed that severity of abiotic damages in plants is dependent on complex multigenic agronomic traits li et al 2018 radanielson et al 2018 wang et al 2016 and thus better understanding of physiological and biochemical characteristics of individual cultivars is important for sustaining vegetative growth and reproductive development under saline conditions various ions exist at different proportions in plants in the present study significantly higher contents of k and ca2 than those of mg2 and na were observed in kyoho grape leaf despite a higher percentage of na uptake and accumulation after foliar seawater application fig 1a the percentages of the increased content of k ca2 mg2 and na in leaf after seawater treatment run a similar parallel with chemical composition of seawater 1 14 k 1 18 ca2 3 69 mg2 30 74 na as a result leaf does not appear to selectively absorb specific cations over others this is supported by the fact that all three k na ca2 na and mg2 na simultaneously declined in the leaf treated with seawater spray fig 2a exogenous high salt application is known to cause a reduced uptake of k ca2 and mg2 cambrollé et al 2011 chakraborty et al 2012 however in our study employing a diluted seawater regimen uptake of all four cations in kyoho grape leaf significantly increased in parallel with the major components of the dissolved salts in seawater in contrast to leaf berry showed a declined uptake of k and mg2 by 22 4 and 30 8 respectively after seawater treatment upon exposure to saline environment some plants inclined to reduce uptake and or retention of k in different plant parts with a concomitant build up of na level wang et al 2017 k deﬁciency caused by its leakage along with more na uptake led to growth inhibition and chlorophyll loss choi et al 2011 however this did not happen in grape leaf tissue under the conditions of this study as shown in table 4 unlike leaf grape berry had an unchanged ratio of ca2 na since contents of both cations remained unchanged regardless of seawater application figs 1 and 2 not only was the percentage of decline in k ca2 higher in berry 23 1 than leaf 0 but also the percentage of decline in k na was much lower in berry 23 9 than leaf 68 as shown in fig 2a and b along this line ca2 was shown to enhance k na selectivity by increasing k and decreasing na transport function bacha et al 2015 ca2 is known to be essential for cell wall and plasma membrane integrity in this study ca2 and mg2 levels were found to be significantly increased whereas k and na levels remained unchanged in vineyard soil after foliar seawater application table 1 despite the high uptake and accumulation of all four cations by leaves fig 1a the reason why soil retained unchanged levels of k and na after foliar seawater spray remains unknown but they could be more selectively absorbed in the vineyard rhizosphere niche rendering them inaccessible to roots under the soil conditions of this study as reported previously alsaeedi et al 2018 wu et al 2013 because vineyard soil retained a constant amount of na before and after foliar seawater treatment it was expected that when leaves do not directly absorb cations including na after foliar spray but instead roots actively take up transport ca2 and mg2 in the long distance from soil and partition within the grapevine leaves a positive correlation would occur in ca2 na and mg2 na ratios between the leaf and soil in fact this was not the case as shown in fig 2 accordingly grape leaves appear to directly absorb the seawater ions although both na and cl are the major ions responsible for salt induced physiological disorders plants are more sensitive to cl than to na for growth since cl reduces the photosynthetic capacity as a result of chlorophyll degradation caused by a structural impact of high cl concentration on photosystem ii tavakkoli et al 2010 in this study cl level in soil after foliar seawater treatment increased by 50 1 nevertheless leaf spad value soluble sugar and starch contents in branch were not significantly affected table 4 this may be due to a poor uptake of cl by roots in the terminal stage of vegetative growth at veraison during which a dramatic change in gene expression occurs decreased k na ratio under elevated na stress will restrain growth dynamic via inhibiting many cytosolic enzymes involved in detoxiﬁcation of ros alsaeedi et al 2018 in the present study k na ca2 na and mg2 na in leaves all significantly decreased after foliar application but those in berry diminished to much less percentages the latter could be attributed to the more efficient selectivity of the aforementioned ratios enhanced by ca2 in berry as reported by bacha et al 2015 following seawater treatment k na was 4 in leaf and 26 in berry fig 2a and b comparatively more efficient ion selectivity induced by ca2 affecting the functionality of k and na transport systems in berry may increase k na ratio thereby mitigating the harmful eﬀ ects of na siddiqui et al 2017 in contrast to grape fuji apple fruit showed significant increases in na concentration and k ca2 ratio along with unchanged levels of na k and mg2 in leaf as a result of foliar seawater treatments zheng et al 2013 this discrepancy could be due to the different physiological response to seawater treatment between non climacteric grape and climacteric apple fruits overall k was the most prevalent ion within the grape leaf and berry regardless of seawater treatment enabling the grape to maintain high ratios of cyotosolic k na this result agrees well with a report that grape accumulates k rapidly during ripening phase rogiers et al 2017 mda is a widely used biomarker for determining the degree of oxidative stress because it is produced by degradation of polyunsaturated lipids by ros rio et al 2005 proline is a well known osmolyte regulator that plays major detoxification roles in metal chelation anti oxidation and signaling during stress liang et al 2013 thus increases in both intracellular mda and proline contents are commonly associated with plants exposed to various biotic and abiotic stresses jdey et al 2014 li et al 2018 in this study salt stress induced by foliar seawater sprays increased both proline and mda contents in which the percentage gain of proline is almost twice that of mda and this was accompanied by decreased anti oxidant enzyme activities pod cat and apx by 26 7 on average in response to foliar seawater treatment table 2 the latter could be attributed to the highly increased content of proline that actively scavenges ros combined with the higher accumulation of k that minimizes oxidative stress via osmoregulation of water and other salts yang et al 2013 similar results were also observed in wheat whose activities of antioxidant enzymes such as cat were decreased in abiotic stress jan et al 2017 besides proline soluble proteins were increased by 103 7 as a result of foliar salt stress thus foliar seawater treatment triggered de novo synthesis of proline and soluble proteins to overcome osmotic stress occurrence of significantly decreased antioxidant enzyme activities in spite of the increased level of mda implicates the high ros scavenging activities of proline with respect to fruit quality kyoho grape berries of post seawater treatment displayed slightly better performance on ssc content and redness than control grapes without sacrificing weight and firmness similar results were previously observed from fuji apple fruit after foliar seawater treatment zheng et al 2013 there was a statistical difference between control and seawater cirg indices indicating that accumulation of anthocyanin in the epicarp cell layer of the berry after veraison is increased by foliar seawater treatment because a positive correlation exists between cirg index and anthocyanin content olivares et al 2017 this result agrees with the anthocyanin content increased by foliar seawater sprays on fuji apple tress zheng et al 2013 the results of this study point to the importance of seawater concentration and the timing of pre harvest foliar application our foliar application was initiated at veraison when the fruit begins to enter ripening phase and vegetative growth nearly stops our seawater spray regimen did not affect the leaf spad soluble sugar and starch in kyoho grape branch that are positively correlated with fruit yield and quality zang et al 2016 and thus could be used for grape trees because foliar seawater treatment resulted in a 50 1 increase of cl in vineyard soil it remains to be determined if the same seawater regimen can be consistently employed over the next several years without affecting grape fruit s yield and quality in viticulture practices 5 conclusions the foliar seawater application at veraison significantly increased the content of k ca2 mg2 and na in leaf but decreased the content of k and mg2 in berry however this led to the higher declined ratios of k na and mg2 na in leaf than berry ca2 na was also decreased in leaf but unchanged in berry as judged by post seawater treatment changes in the above three cations ratios it appears that berry has more efficient ca2 induced k na selectivity than leaf which does not selectively absorb certain cations despite the significantly elevated level of cl in the vineyard soil under this study after foliar seawater treatment leaf spad value soluble sugar and starch contents all of which are a hallmark of vegetative growth were not only unaffected but also ssc redness and cirg index were enhanced without losing weight and firmness of berry furthermore foliar seawater stress increased de novo biosynthesis of proline and soluble protein to overcome osmotic stress and this was concomitant with decreased anti oxidant enzyme activities overall k was the most abundant ion within the grape leaf and berry irrespective of foliar seawater treatment this may help to confer a moderate tolerance to salt stress on grape plant by sustaining high k na ratio that mitigates na toxicity declaration of competing interest the authors declared that they have no conflicts of interest to this work we declare that we do not have any

10850,extensive research has been conducted over the years to investigate the diverse effects of seawater on many crop plants either by irrigation or foliar spray in an attempt to enhance the yield and quality the purpose of this study was to quantitatively determine the effects of foliar seawater application on berry quality and ion distribution of kyoho grape vineyards a ﬁeld experiment was conducted using diluted seawater starting at veraison followed by seven day intervals between the treatments while leaf contained k as much as ca2 which was at least eight times higher than mg2 and na berry displayed different profiles as shown by significant decreases in k 22 4 and mg2 30 8 with almost no changes in ca2 and na concentrations of cations were much higher than those of anions in control vineyard soil under this study foliar seawater treatment did not change the amounts of k na hco3 and no3 but significantly increased the amounts of ca2 mg2 and cl in vineyard soil declined ratios of k na and mg2 na were observed in both leaf and berry after foliar seawater application but percentages in the declined ratios were significantly higher in leaf in contrast to berry and leaf vineyard soil had significantly increased ratios of mg2 na and ca2 na along with an unchanged ratio of k na after foliar seawater application substantially decreased activities of antioxidant defensive enzymes cat pod and apx were observed in the post seawater treatment leaves foliar seawater application resulted in high accumulation of proline soluble proteins and malondialdehyde mda as well as an improved soluble solid content ssc redness and color index for red grapes cirg in berries without losing weight firmness and yield leaf spad chlorophyll value of leaf soluble sugar and

diminished photosynthetic activities and productivity by promoting partial closure of stomata chakraborty et al 2016 radanielson et al 2018 destruction of chlorophyll pigment system astaneh et al 2018 erel et al 2015 yue et al 2012 and or damage to the reaction center of photosystem wang et al 2016 although na and k bear high resemblance in ionic and physicochemical properties numerous physiological processes are essentially dependent on k because it interacts with ion transport proteins metabolic enzymes and membrane proteins that control a short term maintenance of membrane potentials and stomatal opening closing of plants erel et al 2015 laanemets et al 2013 wakeel et al 2011 external k application improved salinity tolerance by promoting k accumulation and osmotic adjustment in peanut cultivars chakraborty et al 2016 thus the ability to retain k and or a high k na ratio in the cytosol is more important than a simple exclusion of na this conclusion was further confirmed by improved germination and growth of cucumber by maintaining a high cytosolic k na ratio under elevated na stress alsaeedi et al 2018 this ionic ratio approach may be used as a strategy to improve soil health and functions as a nature based solution in light of the fact that there is a worldwide interest to protect soils keesstra et al 2018b 2018c a beneficial k na selectivity also was enhanced by ca2 that affects the functionality of na and k transport systems bacha et al 2015 while elevated extracellular ca2 inhibits nonselective cation channels nscc which are the main routes for toxic na inﬂux ionic imbalance caused by increased intracellular na concentration above the normal level 1 10 mm gives rise to reduced uptake of k ca2 and mg2 in tissues of growing plants resulting in disturbed cytoplasmic homeostasis reddy et al 2017 besides ionic stress plants have evolved other adaptive mechanisms in order to cope with osmotic and oxidative stresses to combat with osmotic stress plants accumulate more compatible solutes and proteins increased accumulation of proline is known to be well correlated with enhanced salt tolerance chakraborty et al 2016 hatami et al 2018 since proline brings about tolerance to oxidative stress by modulating the activities of antioxidant enzymes such as sod pod apx and cat the individual components of antioxidant defense system activated by salt stress differ depending on plants kibria et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 typically plants subject to high salinity accumulate high levels of malondialdedehyde mda a hallmark of oxidative burst lipid injury caused by reactive oxygen species ros a secondary byproduct of salt stress zhou et al 2017 a nearly 3 5 of the seawater weight comes from six major dissolved ions chloride cl sodium na sulfate so4 2 magnesium mg2 calcium ca2 and potassium k in which sodium chloride constitutes more than 85 of total ions millero et al 2008 as a result many researchers have reported that seawater treatment disturbs intracellular ion balance leading to altered metabolic contents in higher plants ferrante et al 2011 in a previous study zheng et al 2013 however we demonstrated that the proper timing of diluted seawater application to whole trees improved fruit quality therefore we employed the same foliar seawater spray regimen and studied the resultant impact on grape berry quality and ion distribution in vineyard soil berry and leaf a balanced soil ion condition is known to be important for the quality of grape berry muller 2017 but the relationship between the seawater application and the distribution of cation and anion in vineyard soil has not been studied thus far the purpose of this study was to determine if there is a causal relationship between the change in soil ion conditions and quality of kyoho grape a red fruited table grape of hybrid tetraploid cultivar as a result of foliar seawater application 2 materials and methods 2 1 vineyard condition and grapevine

all of the measurements data were analyzed by spss version 16 0 software spss il usa each sample analysis was repeated at least three times and diﬀ erences between two groups were assessed using the student t test the results were expressed as means se differences were considered to be significant when the p values were less than 0 05 3 results 3 1 cation in leaf and berry of kyoho grape contents of k ca2 na and mg2 in leaf and berry of kyoho grape under control and foliar seawater treatments were measured fig 1 irrespective of the treatments leaf had much higher k ca2 na and mg2 concentrations than berry the contents of k and ca2 in leaves were approximately similar and at least eight times higher than those of na and mg2 in leaves treated with seawater the content of k ca2 mg2 and na increased by 52 6 54 7 85 9 and 376 9 respectively the highest and lowest cation contents in the berry were k and na respectively unlike leaves berry decreased the contents of k and mg2 by 22 4 30 8 respectively whereas ca2 and na remained unchanged after foliar seawater application overall k was the most abundant ion within the grape leaf and berry in both control and seawater treatments 3 2 cation and anion in vineyard soils table 1 showed that cations were more prevalent than anions in control vineyard soil foliar seawater treatment did not change the amounts of k and na but significantly increased ca2 and mg2 by 77 2 and 24 8 respectively similar to leaf and fruit control soil contained significantly higher level of k than the other three cations and both ca2 and mg2 also accounted for a relatively large proportion in vineyard soil normally cl and no3 were dominant anions of vineyard soils the content of cl increased by 50 1 whereas hco3 and no3 levels were unchanged by foliar seawater spray although hco3 is somewhat rich 140 mg l 0 41 of total ions in natural seawater 3 3 k na ca2 na and mg2 na in leaf berry and vineyard soils the ratios of k na ca2 na and mg2 na in leaf berry and vineyard soils are shown in fig 2 after foliar seawater spray k na ca2 na and mg2 na in mature leaves significantly declined by 68 0 67 5 and 61 1 respectively similarly k na and mg2 na in berry decreased following foliar seawater treatment interestingly the percentages of decline in k na 68 0 and mg2 na 61 1 in leaf were much higher than those of berry 23 9 in k na 32 2 in mg2 na unlike leaf berry did not display any significant change in ca2 na by foliar seawater spray k ca2 ratio was about 1 in both control and seawater in leaf whereas it was about 13 in control berry and 10 in seawater berry on the contrary k na remained unchanged whereas ca2 na and mg2 na increased in vineyard soils after foliar application of seawater perhaps na may have been more easily leached out in the vineyard soil under the experiment conditions 3 4 antioxidant enzymes sod is usually considered as the ﬁrst line of defense against oxidative stress foliar seawater treatment did not make a statistically significant difference in sod activity of leaves when compared to control table 2 foliar seawater condition led to increased accumulation of proline 50 3 mda 26 8 and soluble proteins 103 7 in grape leaves table 2 in contrast to the substantially increased levels of osmo protectant proline and soluble proteins activities of three antioxidant enzymes pod apx and cat significantly declined by 21 1 29 3 and 30 1 respectively as a result of foliar seawater treatment 3 5 fruit yield quality and vegetative growth kyoho grapes exposed to foliar seawater condition contained significantly higher ssc than control berries on the other hand yield berry weight and firmness were not affected by foliar seawater spray table 3 a pericarp color is a characteristic strongly influencing consumer acceptability because cielab parameters l a b c h and the calculated colorimetric indices were successfully used to assess the visual quality of red grapes we employed the same methodology to highlight the relevant differences among treatments choi et al 2014 as shown in table 3 berry redness a value and chroma c were significantly improved yellowness b value and hue angle h decreased significantly by 37 1 and 46 8 respectively as a result of foliar seawater spray berry lightness l value was not affected by foliar seawater spray for colorful table grapes the use of color indices allows for distinguishing high quality berries that are classified in different groups based on epicarp color as reported in the oiv descriptor list for table vine varieties and vitis species oiv 2009 both cirg1 and cirg2 indices were improved by foliar seawater application as indicated by higher values of cirg that describe the color of a table grape by means of a standardized and optimized index no statistically signiﬁcant differences were found in vegetative features when diluted seawater was applied to kyoho grape trees as indicated by unaffected leaf spad soluble sugar and starch in branch table 4 4 discussion salt has a significant impact on numerous physiological and biochemical attributes of plants yang et al 2013 under salt stress most terrestrial plants undergo inhibition of growth and metabolism in actively growing plant tissues shabala and cuin 2008 wu et al 2013 it is believed that severity of abiotic damages in plants is dependent on complex multigenic agronomic traits li et al 2018 radanielson et al 2018 wang et al 2016 and thus better understanding of physiological and biochemical characteristics of individual cultivars is important for sustaining vegetative growth and reproductive development under saline conditions various ions exist at different proportions in plants in the present study significantly higher contents of k and ca2 than those of mg2 and na were observed in kyoho grape leaf despite a higher percentage of na uptake and accumulation after foliar seawater application fig 1a the percentages of the increased content of k ca2 mg2 and na in leaf after seawater treatment run a similar parallel with chemical composition of seawater 1 14 k 1 18 ca2 3 69 mg2 30 74 na as a result leaf does not appear to selectively absorb specific cations over others this is supported by the fact that all three k na ca2 na and mg2 na simultaneously declined in the leaf treated with seawater spray fig 2a exogenous high salt application is known to cause a reduced uptake of k ca2 and mg2 cambrollé et al 2011 chakraborty et al 2012 however in our study employing a diluted seawater regimen uptake of all four cations in kyoho grape leaf significantly increased in parallel with the major components of the dissolved salts in seawater in contrast to leaf berry showed a declined uptake of k and mg2 by 22 4 and 30 8 respectively after seawater treatment upon exposure to saline environment some plants inclined to reduce uptake and or retention of k in different plant parts with a concomitant build up of na level wang et al 2017 k deﬁciency caused by its leakage along with more na uptake led to growth inhibition and chlorophyll loss choi et al 2011 however this did not happen in grape leaf tissue under the conditions of this study as shown in table 4 unlike leaf grape berry had an unchanged ratio of ca2 na since contents of both cations remained unchanged regardless of seawater application figs 1 and 2 not only was the percentage of decline in k ca2 higher in berry 23 1 than leaf 0 but also the percentage of decline in k na was much lower in berry 23 9 than leaf 68 as shown in fig 2a and b along this line ca2 was shown to enhance k na selectivity by increasing k and decreasing na transport function bacha et al 2015 ca2 is known to be essential for cell wall and plasma membrane integrity in this study ca2 and mg2 levels were found to be significantly increased whereas k and na levels remained unchanged in vineyard soil after foliar seawater application table 1 despite the high uptake and accumulation of all four cations by leaves fig 1a the reason why soil retained unchanged levels of k and na after foliar seawater spray remains unknown but they could be more selectively absorbed in the vineyard rhizosphere niche rendering them inaccessible to roots under the soil conditions of this study as reported previously alsaeedi et al 2018 wu et al 2013 because vineyard soil retained a constant amount of na before and after foliar seawater treatment it was expected that when leaves do not directly absorb cations including na after foliar spray but instead roots actively take up transport ca2 and mg2 in the long distance from soil and partition within the grapevine leaves a positive correlation would occur in ca2 na and mg2 na ratios between the leaf and soil in fact this was not the case as shown in fig 2 accordingly grape leaves appear to directly absorb the seawater ions although both na and cl are the major ions responsible for salt induced physiological disorders plants are more sensitive to cl than to na for growth since cl reduces the photosynthetic capacity as a result of chlorophyll degradation caused by a structural impact of high cl concentration on photosystem ii tavakkoli et al 2010 in this study cl level in soil after foliar seawater treatment increased by 50 1 nevertheless leaf spad value soluble sugar and starch contents in branch were not significantly affected table 4 this may be due to a poor uptake of cl by roots in the terminal stage of vegetative growth at veraison during which a dramatic change in gene expression occurs decreased k na ratio under elevated na stress will restrain growth dynamic via inhibiting many cytosolic enzymes involved in detoxiﬁcation of ros alsaeedi et al 2018 in the present study k na ca2 na and mg2 na in leaves all significantly decreased after foliar application but those in berry diminished to much less percentages the latter could be attributed to the more efficient selectivity of the aforementioned ratios enhanced by ca2 in berry as reported by bacha et al 2015 following seawater treatment k na was 4 in leaf and 26 in berry fig 2a and b comparatively more efficient ion selectivity induced by ca2 affecting the functionality of k and na transport systems in berry may increase k na ratio thereby mitigating the harmful eﬀ ects of na siddiqui et al 2017 in contrast to grape fuji apple fruit showed significant increases in na concentration and k ca2 ratio along with unchanged levels of na k and mg2 in leaf as a result of foliar seawater treatments zheng et al 2013 this discrepancy could be due to the different physiological response to seawater treatment between non climacteric grape and climacteric apple fruits overall k was the most prevalent ion within the grape leaf and berry regardless of seawater treatment enabling the grape to maintain high ratios of cyotosolic k na this result agrees well with a report that grape accumulates k rapidly during ripening phase rogiers et al 2017 mda is a widely used biomarker for determining the degree of oxidative stress because it is produced by degradation of polyunsaturated lipids by ros rio et al 2005 proline is a well known osmolyte regulator that plays major detoxification roles in metal chelation anti oxidation and signaling during stress liang et al 2013 thus increases in both intracellular mda and proline contents are commonly associated with plants exposed to various biotic and abiotic stresses jdey et al 2014 li et al 2018 in this study salt stress induced by foliar seawater sprays increased both proline and mda contents in which the percentage gain of proline is almost twice that of mda and this was accompanied by decreased anti oxidant enzyme activities pod cat and apx by 26 7 on average in response to foliar seawater treatment table 2 the latter could be attributed to the highly increased content of proline that actively scavenges ros combined with the higher accumulation of k that minimizes oxidative stress via osmoregulation of water and other salts yang et al 2013 similar results were also observed in wheat whose activities of antioxidant enzymes such as cat were decreased in abiotic stress jan et al 2017 besides proline soluble proteins were increased by 103 7 as a result of foliar salt stress thus foliar seawater treatment triggered de novo synthesis of proline and soluble proteins to overcome osmotic stress occurrence of significantly decreased antioxidant enzyme activities in spite of the increased level of mda implicates the high ros scavenging activities of proline with respect to fruit quality kyoho grape berries of post seawater treatment displayed slightly better performance on ssc content and redness than control grapes without sacrificing weight and firmness similar results were previously observed from fuji apple fruit after foliar seawater treatment zheng et al 2013 there was a statistical difference between control and seawater cirg indices indicating that accumulation of anthocyanin in the epicarp cell layer of the berry after veraison is increased by foliar seawater treatment because a positive correlation exists between cirg index and anthocyanin content olivares et al 2017 this result agrees with the anthocyanin content increased by foliar seawater sprays on fuji apple tress zheng et al 2013 the results of this study point to the importance of seawater concentration and the timing of pre harvest foliar application our foliar application was initiated at veraison when the fruit begins to enter ripening phase and vegetative growth nearly stops our seawater spray regimen did not affect the leaf spad soluble sugar and starch in kyoho grape branch that are positively correlated with fruit yield and quality zang et al 2016 and thus could be used for grape trees because foliar seawater treatment resulted in a 50 1 increase of cl in vineyard soil it remains to be determined if the same seawater regimen can be consistently employed over the next several years without affecting grape fruit s yield and quality in viticulture practices 5 conclusions the foliar seawater application at veraison significantly increased the content of k ca2 mg2 and na in leaf but decreased the content of k and mg2 in berry however this led to the higher declined ratios of k na and mg2 na in leaf than berry ca2 na was also decreased in leaf but unchanged in berry as judged by post seawater treatment changes in the above three cations ratios it appears that berry has more efficient ca2 induced k na selectivity than leaf which does not selectively absorb certain cations despite the significantly elevated level of cl in the vineyard soil under this study after foliar seawater treatment leaf spad value soluble sugar and starch contents all of which are a hallmark of vegetative growth were not only unaffected but also ssc redness and cirg index were enhanced without losing weight and firmness of berry furthermore foliar seawater stress increased de novo biosynthesis of proline and soluble protein to overcome osmotic stress and this was concomitant with decreased anti oxidant enzyme activities overall k was the most abundant ion within the grape leaf and berry irrespective of foliar seawater treatment this may help to confer a moderate tolerance to salt stress on grape plant by sustaining high k na ratio that mitigates na toxicity declaration of competing interest the authors declared that they have no conflicts of interest to this work we declare that we do not have any

fish produced e g less than 100 l in ras while several thousands of litre in conventional systems martins et al 2010 integrating aquaculture with other food production methods is under development in order to reuse the aquaculture wastes klinger and naylor 2012 turcios and papenbrock 2014 and to close the nutrient cycle the potential for more efficient use of resources through the tightening of nutrient cycles and reuse of aquaculture wastewater may explain the increasing interest in aquaponics ap love et al 2015a the ap concept is to combine ras and recirculated hydroponic systems rhs for fish and horticultural plant production the integration of ras and rhs aims to reuse the aquaculture wastewater for irrigating the crops while converting the otherwise wasted nutrients excreted by fish into valuable plant biomass hence the reuse of fish wastewater could significantly reduce the environmental impact of aquaculture and hydroponic plant production the most common design of the ap system is the integration of hydroponic beds into the water loop of a ras delaide et al 2015 rakocy 2012 and may be called single recirculating aquaponic system srap suhl et al 2016 srap can be

pioneer publications delaide et al 2016a saha et al 2016 the effects of fish water on the yields and quality of the plant products remain unknown which hinders the adoption of ap by professionals of the horticultural sector the feasibility of properly complementing the fish water with conventional commercial fertilisers needs to be investigated therefore this study aimed to compare the tomato

containing 56 protein and 16 fat skretting fontaine les vervins france the average daily water exchange rate of 15 was relatively high because the system was conducted in such a way that the water discharged to the sewage had a no3 content lower than 2 42 mmol l in order to meet the wastewater disposal regional regulations the wastewater delivered by the drum filters was decanted and the supernatant was stored in a 15 m³ tank prior to be discharged in the sewage at regular intervals part of this water was pumped to the tomato greenhouse facility this water was then filtrated with a taf filter taf 750 amiad water system chargè france and complemented in macro and micronutrients to reach the standard hydroponic concentrations the so prepared nutrient solution ns was stored in a feeding sump tank of 0 4 m³ fig 1 the water from this sump was used to irrigate the tomato plants and this treatment was called the aquaponic ap treatment the tomato production in the ap treatment was compared to a standard hydroponic hp treatment in which the plants were irrigated by a conventional standard hydroponic ns the drain water of each treatment was collected separately in a 1 m³ drain water storage tank intermittently their entire content was sand filtrated and uv disinfected the disinfected drain waters were stored in their corresponding disinfected drain water storage tank fig 1 the filtration event only happened when a disinfected drain water storage tank became empty the same sand filtration and uv disinfection device was used for ap and hp drain waters but the system automatically cleaned and flushed the filter and pipes with the new incoming solution before each use the disinfected drain solution was thus reused into its respective fertigation loop each time a batch of new feeding solution was made i e from once per week to once per day depending on daylight duration and intensity the tomato plants were cultivated in a compartment of a venlo type climate controlled greenhouse of 352 m² the greenhouse had a column height of 4 m covered with 4 mm glass and warmed by a conventional floor level pipe heating system the experiment was conducted during 3 consecutive seasons of tomato production from 06 01 2015 to 07 11 2017 the cultivar foundation bayer nunhems haelen the nederlands was used in 2015 2016 and 2017 in 2017 the cultivars axxy axia naaldwijk the netherlands and merlice de ruiter bergschenhoek the netherlands were tested also the cultivars were all grafted on rootstock maxifort de ruiter bergschenhoek the netherlands in 2015 and on dr 0141tx de ruiter bergschenhoek the netherlands in 2016 and 2017 2 2 tomato growing conditions an average temperature t of 18 0 c was targeted in the greenhouse the set points of the heating system were defined as 20 0 c and 15 5 c for day and night respectively and the ventilation was opened at 22 c to cool the greenhouse from mid may until september the ventilation was opened at 19 c to control the greenhouse climate and irrigation a computed integrated management software was used priva connect de lier the netherlands the outside light intensity was measured with a par sensor priva de lier the netherlands and a total irradiation sum of 4280 5 3970 9 and 4011 8 mj m² was measured from planting until the last harvest in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively for the experiment in 2015 and 2016 a net surface of 329 m² housed 909 tomato stems i e 180 m² for 498 stems and 149 m² for 411 stems for the hp and ap treatments respectively for 2017 a net surface of 658 m² spread over two greenhouse compartments housed 1818 tomato stems there were 2 stems per tomato plant and they were topped in early september each year the hydroponic cultivation method was the drip irrigation method as described in heuvelink 2005 the substrate used was rockwool with slabs of 1 0 20 x 0 075 m grodan vital roermond the netherlands the slabs were renewed every year two plants were set per slab and one dripper was stuck close to the foot of each plant the slabs were placed on drainage gutters meteor systems bv breda the netherlands allowing to recover the drain water for reuse the space in between plants on the gutters was 0 55 m with 0 80 m distance between gutters giving a plant density of 2 27 stems per square meter for both treatments the ph target of the ns was 5 6 the irrigation pace of the ns was regulated in function of the daily radiation by the computer climate software priva de lier the netherlands aiming a drain water quantity comprised in a range of 20 40 of the inflow for each season studied tomatoes were sown in november and inserted in the drip irrigation system upon the rockwool slabs in january when the first truss was visible the fruits were harvested from march to november the plant pruning harvesting and support were conducted as in normal tomato greenhouse professional operation as described by heuvelink 2005 2 3 determination of tomato production four randomized plots comprising ten tomato stems each were defined per treatment area in the greenhouse the production of the tomatoes from these plots was followed this gave an experimental setup of four replicates for each season of production the plots were located around the centre of the greenhouse to prevent border effects and to assure all plants were studied under the same temperature and lighting conditions the tomatoes were harvested every 3 4 days to compare the total yield the harvested fruits of each plot were counted and weighed the fruit quality was evaluated and the fruits were categorized into marketable and non marketable within the non marketable category the fruits were sub categorized into blossom end rot ber cracks due to disturbed moisture balance and other damaged during manipulation not properly ripe too small etc unlike the other sub categories ber occurred only at specific periods with a higher risk to reduce the weekly marketable yields therefore its yield percentage was calculated only based on these periods once a week the diameter of the second tomato fruit of each truss within each plot was measured the average fruit diameter was calculated per treatment for each year the stem growth of the tomato plant was followed weekly by measuring the stem length gain of three plants per plot 2 4 water quality measurement the ec and ph of the ns were monitored once a week in the feeding tank in the slabs and in the drain water ec was measured with a conductivity tester profiline cond 3110 wtw weilheim germany and ph with a ph meter profiline ph 3110 wtw weilheim germany the solution content in macronutrients i e ammonium nitrate phosphorus potassium calcium magnesium and sulphates micronutrients i e iron boron copper zinc and manganese chlorides sodium and alkalinity was monitored in the slabs and in the drain water once every two weeks for both treatments the feeding ns were controlled once per month every time a new batch of water was pumped from the ras i e supernatant from the drum filter wastewater to the fish water storage tank a new sample was taken for analysis prior to the calculation of the salt complementation the water samples were brought to the lab for proceeding analysis immediately after the sampling the concentrations of the nitrogen compounds were determined with a continuous flow analyser sfa type 4000 skalar analytical b v breda the netherlands total ammoniacal nitrogen tan was determined by the reaction with salicylate nitroprusside and dichlororisocyanurate reagents in a buffer solution the nitrite no2 was determined with the sulphanilamide and n 1 naphthyl ethylenediamine dihydrochloride reagents separately the nitrite plus nitrate no2 no3 were reduced in no2 with the cadmium reduction method and determined with the precited reagents the no3 was calculated by subtracting the no2 concentration determined with the first described method from the concentration obtained with the cadmium

1994 method 2 5 sodium monitoring the ap feeding water had a highly variable ec because nacl was intermittently inserted into the ras water to prevent fish health problems it was decided not to dilute the ras water and thus not to control the ec in the ap feeding ns leading to a different ec of that in the hp the fish water was then independently of its ec complemented with the macro and micronutrients to meet the concentration targets i e same as for the hp treatment it was aimed also to apply in both treatments the same rate of reused drain water this resulted in a higher ec in the ap treatment compared to conventional hydroponic standards occasionally when weekly growth measurements indicated a reduced growth the ap drain water was flushed and the irrigation system was rinsed with the standard solution 2 6 nutrient solution formulation the standard feeding ns for the hp treatment was formulated with 20 tap water and 80 rain water and by the addition of the following commercial fertilisers yara rotterdam the netherlands amnitra ammoniumnitrate calsal calciumnitrate magnesul magnesiumsulfate baskal potassiumhydroxyde bfk potassiumpolyphosphatehydroxyde sulfakal potassiumsulfate sz 38 nitric acid dtpa fe fervent mn manganesesulfate fervent zn zincsulfate fervent b boronpotassiumhydroxyde fervent cu coppersulfate and fervent mo molybdenumoxide the targeted nutrient concentrations for the feeding solutions were as follows in accordance to general practice in flanders for macronutrients mmol l 16 no3 1 2 tan 1 4 po4 9 5 k 5 4 ca 2 4 mg 4 4 so4 and for micronutrients μmol l 30 b 15 fe 0 75 cu 10 mn 5 zn 0 5 mo the formulation was slightly adjusted during the season according to the plant development following the recommendations of heuvelink 2005 the ns for the ap treatment was formulated with ras water and the same commercial fertilisers were added to reach concentrations in macro and micronutrients equivalent to the standard hydroponic ns prior to the experiment the content in macro and microelements of ras water was regularly measured and was found to be relatively constant table 1 every two weeks the ns in both treatments was adjusted using new measurements of the drain water based on the desired ec and the nutrient content of the ras wastewater and the drain water the amount of fertilisers needed was calculated with a specific software yarasoft dealerversie 3 0 beta yara rotterdam the netherlands in 2015 a constant ec was aimed in both objects in 2016 and 2017 a higher ec in the ap was tolerated in order to obtain a better reuse of drainwater addition of the calculated amounts of fertiliser to the mixture of new water and drain water happened automatically by the nutronic device priva de lier the netherlands in combination with the priva connect software 2 7 statistical analysis the statistical analysis was carried out with the agrova statistical package software developed and validated by inagro the experimental data were tested for the null hypothesis that the use of complemented ras wastewater for the cultivation of tomatoes did not cause any effect as compared to the hp control for growth fruit size and yield combined analysis of variance over 3 years was applied years being considered as a random variable and the effect of the treatments being tested against the interaction years x treatments multiple comparison of means was carried out with the duncan test the average nutrient concentrations in the feeding ns and in the slabs and the results of the brix measurements n 120 were compared with a duncan test in addition to anova as for each time point only one analysis was available per treatment successive time points were taken as replicates 3 results 3 1 tomato production for the 3 years studied the total yields not shown and marketable yields fig 2 of tomato fruits of the ap and the hp treatments were not significantly different duncan test p 0 05 no significant interaction was found between the ns type and the years over the overall experiment the average total yield and the average marketable yield respectively were 48 3 2 4 and 47 3 2 4 kg m² for the ap treatment 48 0 1 8 and 46 3 1 8 kg m² for the hp treatment hence in both treatments there was only a small difference 0 0 to 2 0 between total and marketable yield when ber occurred depending on the year the yields were affected more strongly fig 3 while the level of ber varied substantially i e range of 0 9 18 6 in the hp treatment it was remarkably constant and low i e range of 0 2 to 0 4 over the years in the ap treatment although in each year the incidence of ber was lowered in the ap treatment the difference between both treatments was significant in 2016 and 2017 combined anova could not detect any significant effect of the ns type because the mean square value of the interaction years x ns type used to calculate the f value was relatively large to the mean square value of ns type for the number of fruits produced and for the tomato fruit diameter no significant difference was found between both treatments results not shown the fruit diameter was remarkably constant over the years with an overall average of 67 3 mm at some point during the production seasons some wilting at the top of the tomato stems and inferior weekly growth was observed in the ap treatment this was always consistent with the sodium peaks in the ap slabs and was reflected in a lower total stem length for ap average final stem size over 3 years being 868 6 cm than for hp average final stem size of 878 64 cm although the difference was not significant 3 2 water quality the ph and macro and micronutrient concentrations in the ap feeding ns were maintained close to the targeted hp concentrations and on the average over all growing periods no significant differences were found between both treatments table 1 only a difference in na and cl was observed with on average 2 90 times more na and 5 97 times more cl in the ap na concentration in ap feeding ns variated from 1 31 to 11 84 mmol l with an average of 4 32 mmol l in the hp feeding solution na concentration variated only from 0 87 to 2 23 mmol l with an average of 1 49 mmol l cl concentrations approximately showed the same variability the higher na and cl contents in the ap feeding solution resulted in the ap slabs in 2016 and 2017 in persistently higher concentrations of these elements and a significantly higher ec fig 4 shows ec and measured na contents some high peaks of na e g up to 35 mmol l were observed in the ap slabs especially in 2016 and 2017 because of these peaks the ap drain water was flushed and the slabs were rinsed on the 28th of april and 25th of july in 2016 and on the 26th of april and 24th of september in 2017 on average na content in ap slabs was 11 48 7 32 mmol l average na concentration in hp slabs was much lower 4 44 1 71 mmol l but was quite constant over the growing period cl concentrations in the slabs showed the same variability as na concentrations high for ap and low for hp and deviated from them with a quite constant value on average 4 89 mmol l for ap and 4 25 mmol l for hp in addition analysis of the macro and micronutrients in solution in slabs revealed significant difference between both treatments only for the mn in 2016 and 2017 table 2 mn was less concentrated in the ap slabs in 2015 also mn was less concentrated in ap slabs but not significantly overall in both treatments the nutrients were more concentrated in slabs than in the feeding ns except for tan only in 2017 mg and ph were significantly higher in the ap slabs 4 discussion 4 1 tomato production in our experimental design the ap treatment differed from the hp only by its water origin we aimed to have a similar feeding regime in both treatments i e equivalent nutrient supply and ph in the respective feeding solutions this goal was achieved as no significant ph macro and micronutrient concentration differences between the ap and the hp treatment were found in the feeding ns the only detected difference was the higher concentration of na and cl for the ap treatment consequently a significantly higher ec 1 2 ds m in 2016 and 1 3 ds m in 2017 was detected in the ap than in the hp slabs table 2 and fig 4 indeed na and cl were present in substantial concentrations in the pikeperch water the reason was that nacl salt was directly added in the ras water to prevent fish health issues due to stress occurring at fish grading frequent fish grading was done for research purposes and nacl was applied directly after grading at concentrations of up to 34 mmol l cl concentrations in slabs were always lower than na ones with an approximately constant value giving some evidence for plant uptake to be the cause after correction for the difference between cl and na concentrations already present in the feeding ns the remaining difference caused by plant uptake was 4 08 mmol l for ap and 3 29 mmol l for hp while high cl and na contents can induce salt stress high na contents can induce a supplemental deleterious effect due to the antagonism with k and ca uptake indeed during two short periods in 2016 and 2017 a reduced plant growth was noticed to prevent further growth reduction the drain water was discharged it is commonly admitted that plant growth and yield are adversely influenced by salinity stress cuartero et al 1999 kanayama and kochetov 2015 soria and cuartero 1998 zhai et al 2015 or by high root zone concentrations of na cuartero and fernández muñoz 1998 in addition the stress induced by salinity is known to increase ber symptoms and so to further reduce the marketable yields kanayama and kochetov 2015 zhai et al 2015 consequently because of the higher average ec a lower fruit yield would have been expected in the ap treatment for both 2016 and 2017 some ec peaks even were higher than 9 ds m in the ap slabs although a slightly weekly lower yield has been observed after these peaks result not shown no significant reduction of the total yearly production occurred total stem length total tomato fruit yields and fruit number were not significantly different between the ap and the hp treatment slightly more marketable fruits were recorded in the ap treatment in 2015 and 2017 but this yield increase was not significant this slight yield difference is presumably linked to the incidence of ber that was always lower significantly lower in 2016 and 2017 and remarkably constant through the seasons and years i e 0 4 in the ap treatment fig 3 we only found two experiments comparing aquaponic tomato production to a hydroponic control suhl et al 2016 compared tomato production in nft with complemented ras water solution to that in hydroponic solution and also obtained similar yields in both treatments and lower ber in the complemented ras water treatment crappé et al 2017 compared complemented ras water to hydroponics with drip irrigation and obtained similar yields ber incidence was higher for the complemented ras water treatment but this was due to an excess of k leading to an unfavourable k ca ratio however these studies were based only on one season of production without succeeding to have similar i e without significant differences macro and micronutrient concentrations in the feeding solutions of both treatments making the interpretation of tomato production and ber symptoms in our opinion not sufficiently trustable regarding the statistical analysis the experimental setup of 4 replicates studied for 3 years gave only 2 degrees of freedom for the interaction years x treatment against which the effect of the treatments was tested this is quite low from a statistical point of view but increasing this number of degrees of freedom for such large scale semi practice experiment would require still more years of experiment or a higher number of treatments while the first solution was out of question a higher number of treatments would have been at the expense of the semi practice scale of the treatment a few studies have reported higher yields i e in vegetative mass in complemented ras water compared to hydroponic control for leafy vegetables as lettuce delaide et al 2016b goddek and vermeulen 2018 and basil saha et al 2016 for tomatoes however no significant increase in tomato vegetative mass has yet been reported in literature it was also not measured in our study butit is important to notice that during tomato cultivation the plants were continuously pruned to keep only two stems old leaves and suckers were thus continuously removed and this biomass has not been quantified as the observed increase of salinity and na content in the ap treatment were supposed to reduce the plant production and increase ber symptoms an important question is what can explain the absence of stress and this apparent resistance to salinity the only possible answer is that ras wastewater used in the ap treatment should contain factors that were not present in the hp water indeed ras water is charged with a variety of microorganisms bacteria fungi protozoa etc rurangwa and verdegem 2015 schmautz et al 2017 schreier et al 2010 and dissolved organic molecules dom the latter are released by physicochemical degradation of the fish feed and the fish excretions or by microorganisms e g organic molecule alteration triggering molecules for quorum sensing etc hence a broad variety of dom can be present as peptides amino acids phytohormones like humic acid like organic molecules hambly et al 2015 microorganisms and or dom may have acted as tomato plant biostimulants du jardin 2015 providing possibilities to overcome the salinity stress and keep productivity as high and sometimes higher than in the hp treatment at the end of each cultivation period slightly more roots were observed on the side of the ap slabs however for technical reasons it was not possible to weigh or score it such increase of root development is in accordance with the observations of delaide et al 2016a 2016b for lettuce in complemented ras water indeed microorganisms settled in the rhizosphere can beneficially interact with the plants bartelme et al 2018 and promote root development amin et al 2015 wienhausen et al 2017 further experiments with a close monitoring of the root mass plant biostimulating microorganisms and dom presence are needed to confirm our assumptions 4 2 blossom end rot and mn interestingly mn had a significant difference in concentration between treatments in the slabs no technical intervention i e unlike for cl could explain this difference mn was always lower in the ap slabs and this was repeated through the years table 2 on average mn was 1 9 times less concentrated in the ap than in the hp slabs compared to the feeding solution mn was slightly more concentrated in the hp slabs but 1 7 times less concentrated in the ap slabs no significant differences were found between both treatments for the concentration of mn in the feeding ns nor for the ph in the slabs thus excluding the possibility of mn loss by switching to an insoluble form e g precipitation as such the lower concentration of mn in the ap slabs indicates that ap tomato plants assimilated more mn than the hp ones this higher mn assimilation then should be due to microorganisms that colonized the rhizosphere and improved the nutrient use efficiency meena et al 2017 or increased the root mass silber et al 2009 and aktas et al 2005 demonstrated that higher mn content in fruit was correlated to reduced ber symptoms and as we observed reduced ber and high mn uptake we suspect the tomato plants to have had a higher mn content in their fruits unfortunately in our study the mn content in tomato leaves and fruits was not quantified this should be achieved in further research to verify our assumption finally as some authors claimed the low ca concentration in the fruit tip accompanying ber to be a consequence of a metabolic disorder related with an increase of reactive oxygen species de freitas et al 2011 saure 2014 it is possible that microorganisms and or dom have interacted with the tomato plant metabolism and promoted resistance against ber via other ways than by only enhancing mn uptake canellas et al 2015 mangmang et al 2015 5 conclusion in our study we compared the production of tomatoes grown in a ns based on complemented ras wastewater to tomatoes grown in conventional hydroponic ns we especially achieved for the first time to accurately complement ras water with macro and micronutrient concentrations equivalent i e no significant difference observed to the hydroponic ns and this during 3 seasons of production our results clearly indicate the suitability of complemented pikeperch ras wastewater as feeding water for professional hp tomato production using drip irrigation as similar growth and yields were obtained in ap and hp treatments while a significant higher ec was recorded in the ap treatment due to intermittent nacl addition in the ras water the tomato yields did not diminish interestingly symptoms of ber were even reduced in this treatment as ras water contains a diversity of microorganisms e g bacteria fungi protozoa etc and dom e g amino acid like phytohormones like humic acid like organic molecules etc it is presumed that some of these beneficially interacted with the plant metabolism e g by promoting the root growth and mitigated the salinity stress and the ber symptoms this study delivered also much evidence that this was achieved by the promotion of mn uptake which has been reported as a ber reducing factor further experiments with a close monitoring of the root mass the nutrient content in leaves and fruits especially mn would be needed to confirm our assumptions the simultaneous identification and count of microorganisms present in the plant root zone using advanced technology such as flow cytometry and metagenomic techniques should be envisaged methods to identify plant promoting doms should also be applied funding this research was done in the frame of the inapro project funded by the european

sector has seen a rapid expansion in these last 30 years pulvenis 2016 lately recirculating aquaculture systems ras have been developed allowing to drastically reduce the water consumption per kilo of fish produced e g less than 100 l in ras while several thousands of litre in conventional systems martins et al 2010 integrating aquaculture with other food production methods is under development in order to reuse the aquaculture wastes klinger and naylor 2012 turcios and papenbrock 2014 and to close the nutrient cycle the potential for more efficient use of resources through the tightening of nutrient cycles and reuse of aquaculture wastewater may explain the increasing interest in aquaponics ap love et al 2015a the ap concept is to combine ras and recirculated hydroponic systems rhs for fish and horticultural plant production the integration of ras and rhs aims to reuse the aquaculture wastewater for irrigating the crops while converting the otherwise wasted nutrients excreted by fish into valuable plant biomass hence the reuse of fish wastewater could significantly reduce the environmental impact of aquaculture and hydroponic plant production the most common design of the ap system is the integration of hydroponic beds into the water loop of a ras delaide et al 2015 rakocy 2012 and may be called single recirculating aquaponic system srap suhl et al 2016 srap can be complex to manage as three different biological systems fish plants and microorganisms are merged in a single water loop decoupled aquaponic systems daps goddek et al 2016 or double recirculating aquaponic systems draps suhl et al 2016 present an alternative design to overcome the disadvantages of srap in these decoupled systems the ras wastewater goes to the hydroponic part i e the rhs part and does not return to the fish the water would then leave the hydroponic part only by evaporation almost negligible and plant transpiration optimal growing conditions can then be established in each production part i e in ras and rhs parts avoiding compromises in the hydroponic part the ras wastewater is complemented with macro and micronutrients to obtain equivalent concentrations ph and ec as in the standard rhs nutrient solutions goddek et al 2016 with this design the production and some sanitary aspects e g cleaning quarantine etc can be more easily controlled making the system more adapted for commercial farming operations vermeulen and kamstra 2013 also the existing professional techniques can be easily used in the respective fish and plant parts without high technological innovations just a few ap designs have been tested and only in lab conditions or small scale delaide et al 2017 love et al 2015b suhl et al 2016 but studies on large scale systems remain scarce rakocy et al 2004 especially with daps moreover comparisons of production in ap and hydroponics under the same conditions as with the techniques used in professional operations are lacking despite a few pioneer publications delaide et al 2016a saha et al 2016 the effects of fish water on the yields and quality of the plant products remain unknown which hinders the adoption of ap by professionals of the horticultural sector the feasibility of properly complementing the fish water with conventional commercial fertilisers needs to be investigated therefore this study aimed to compare the tomato production of a decoupled aquaponic system to a conventional recirculated hydroponic system in a semi practice scale special attention was given to plant health and physiological disorders as blossom

containing 56 protein and 16 fat skretting fontaine les vervins france the average daily water exchange rate of 15 was relatively high because the system was conducted in such a way that the water discharged to the sewage had a no3 content lower than 2 42 mmol l in order to meet the wastewater disposal regional regulations the wastewater delivered by the drum filters was decanted and the supernatant was stored in a 15 m³ tank prior to be discharged in the sewage at regular intervals part of this water was pumped to the tomato greenhouse facility this water was then filtrated with a taf filter taf 750 amiad water system chargè france and complemented in macro and micronutrients to reach the standard hydroponic concentrations the so prepared nutrient solution ns was stored in a feeding sump tank of 0 4 m³ fig 1 the water from this sump was used to irrigate the tomato plants and this treatment was called the aquaponic ap treatment the tomato production in the ap treatment was compared to a standard hydroponic hp treatment in which the plants were irrigated by a conventional standard hydroponic ns the drain water of each treatment was collected separately in a 1 m³ drain water storage tank intermittently their entire content was sand filtrated and uv disinfected the disinfected drain waters were stored in their corresponding disinfected drain water storage tank fig 1 the filtration event only happened when a disinfected drain water storage tank became empty the same sand filtration and uv disinfection device was used for ap and hp drain waters but the system automatically cleaned and flushed the filter and pipes with the new incoming solution before each use the disinfected drain solution was thus reused into its respective fertigation loop each time a batch of new feeding solution was made i e from once per week to once per day depending on daylight duration and intensity the tomato plants were cultivated in a compartment of a venlo type climate

control the greenhouse climate and irrigation a computed integrated management software was used priva connect de lier the netherlands the outside light intensity was measured with a par sensor priva de lier the netherlands and a total irradiation sum of 4280 5 3970 9 and 4011 8 mj m² was measured from planting until the last harvest in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively for the experiment in 2015 and 2016 a net surface of 329 m² housed 909 tomato stems i e 180 m² for 498 stems and 149 m² for 411 stems for the hp and ap treatments respectively for 2017 a net surface of 658 m² spread over two greenhouse compartments housed 1818 tomato stems there were 2 stems per tomato plant and they were topped in early september each year the hydroponic cultivation method was the drip irrigation method as described in heuvelink 2005 the substrate used was rockwool with slabs of 1 0 20 x 0 075 m grodan vital roermond the netherlands the slabs were renewed every year two plants were set per slab and one dripper was stuck close to the foot of each plant the slabs were placed on drainage gutters meteor systems bv breda the netherlands allowing to recover the drain water for reuse the space in between plants on the gutters was 0 55 m with 0 80 m distance between gutters giving a plant density of 2 27 stems per square meter for both treatments the ph target of the ns was 5 6 the irrigation pace of the ns was regulated in function of the daily radiation by the computer climate software priva de lier the netherlands aiming a drain water quantity comprised in a range of 20 40 of the inflow for each season studied tomatoes were sown in november and inserted in the drip irrigation system upon the rockwool slabs in january when the first truss was visible the fruits were harvested from march to november the plant pruning harvesting and support were conducted as in normal tomato greenhouse professional operation as described by heuvelink 2005 2 3 determination of tomato production four randomized plots comprising ten tomato stems each were defined per treatment area in the greenhouse the production of the tomatoes from these plots was followed this gave an experimental setup of four replicates for each season of production the plots were located around the centre of the greenhouse to prevent border effects and to assure all plants were studied under the same temperature and lighting conditions the tomatoes were harvested every 3 4 days to compare the total yield the harvested fruits of each plot were counted and weighed the fruit quality was evaluated and the fruits were categorized into marketable and non marketable within the non marketable category the fruits were sub categorized into blossom end rot ber cracks due to disturbed moisture balance and other damaged during manipulation not properly ripe too small etc unlike the other sub categories ber occurred only at specific periods with a higher risk to reduce the weekly marketable yields therefore its yield percentage was calculated only based on these periods once a week the diameter of the second tomato fruit of each truss within each plot was measured the average fruit diameter was calculated per treatment for each year the stem growth of the tomato plant was followed weekly by measuring the stem length gain of three plants per plot 2 4 water quality measurement the ec and ph of the ns were monitored once a week in the feeding tank in the slabs and in the drain water ec was measured with a conductivity tester profiline cond 3110 wtw weilheim germany and ph with a ph meter profiline ph 3110 wtw weilheim germany the solution content in macronutrients i e ammonium nitrate phosphorus potassium calcium magnesium and sulphates micronutrients i e iron boron copper zinc and manganese chlorides sodium and alkalinity was monitored in the slabs and in the drain water once every two weeks for both treatments the feeding ns were controlled once per month every time a new batch of water was pumped from the ras i e supernatant from the drum filter wastewater to the fish water storage tank a new sample was taken for analysis prior to the calculation of the salt complementation the water samples were brought to the lab for proceeding analysis immediately after the sampling the concentrations of the nitrogen compounds were determined with a continuous flow analyser sfa type 4000 skalar analytical b v breda the netherlands total ammoniacal nitrogen tan was determined by the reaction with salicylate nitroprusside and dichlororisocyanurate reagents in a buffer solution the nitrite no2 was determined with the sulphanilamide and n 1 naphthyl ethylenediamine dihydrochloride reagents separately the nitrite plus nitrate no2 no3 were reduced in no2 with the cadmium reduction method and determined with the precited reagents the no3 was calculated by subtracting the no2 concentration determined with the first described method from the concentration obtained with the cadmium

1994 method 2 5 sodium monitoring the ap feeding water had a highly variable ec because nacl was intermittently inserted into the ras water to prevent fish health problems it was decided not to dilute the ras water and thus not to control the ec in the ap feeding ns leading to a different ec of that in the hp the fish water was then independently of its ec complemented with the macro and micronutrients to meet the concentration targets i e same as for the hp treatment it was aimed also to apply in both treatments the same rate of reused drain water this resulted in a higher ec in the ap treatment compared to conventional hydroponic standards occasionally when weekly growth measurements indicated a reduced growth the ap drain water was flushed and the irrigation system was rinsed with the standard solution 2 6 nutrient solution formulation the standard feeding ns for the hp treatment was formulated with 20 tap water and 80 rain water and by the addition of the following commercial fertilisers yara rotterdam the netherlands amnitra ammoniumnitrate calsal calciumnitrate magnesul magnesiumsulfate baskal potassiumhydroxyde bfk potassiumpolyphosphatehydroxyde sulfakal potassiumsulfate sz 38 nitric acid dtpa fe fervent mn manganesesulfate fervent zn zincsulfate fervent b boronpotassiumhydroxyde fervent cu coppersulfate and fervent mo molybdenumoxide the targeted nutrient concentrations for the feeding solutions were as follows in accordance to general practice in flanders for macronutrients mmol l 16 no3 1 2 tan 1 4 po4 9 5 k 5 4 ca 2 4 mg 4 4 so4 and for micronutrients μmol l 30 b 15 fe 0 75 cu 10 mn 5 zn 0 5 mo the formulation was slightly adjusted during the season according to the plant development following the recommendations of heuvelink 2005 the ns for the ap treatment was formulated with ras water and the same commercial fertilisers were added to reach concentrations in macro and micronutrients equivalent to the standard hydroponic ns prior to the experiment the content in macro and microelements of ras water was regularly measured and was found to be relatively constant table 1 every two weeks the ns in both treatments was adjusted using new measurements of the drain water based on the desired ec and the nutrient content of the ras wastewater and the drain water the amount of fertilisers needed was calculated with a specific software yarasoft dealerversie 3 0 beta yara rotterdam the netherlands in 2015 a constant ec was aimed in both objects in 2016 and 2017 a higher ec in the ap was tolerated in order to obtain a better reuse of drainwater addition of the calculated amounts of fertiliser to the mixture of new water and drain water happened automatically by the nutronic device priva de lier the netherlands in combination with the priva connect software 2 7 statistical analysis the statistical analysis was carried out with the agrova statistical package software developed and validated by inagro the experimental data were tested for the null hypothesis that the use of complemented ras wastewater for the cultivation of tomatoes did not cause any effect as compared to the hp control for growth fruit size and yield combined analysis of variance over 3 years was applied years being considered as a random variable and the effect of the treatments being tested against the interaction years x treatments multiple comparison of means was carried out with the duncan test the average nutrient concentrations in the feeding ns and in the slabs and the results of the brix measurements n 120 were compared with a duncan test in addition to anova as for each time point only one analysis was available per treatment successive time points were taken as replicates 3 results 3 1 tomato production for the 3 years studied the total yields not shown and marketable yields fig 2 of tomato fruits of the ap and the hp treatments were not significantly different duncan test p 0 05 no significant interaction was found between the ns type and the years over the overall experiment the average total yield and the average marketable yield respectively were 48 3 2 4 and 47 3 2 4 kg m² for the ap treatment 48 0 1 8 and 46 3 1 8 kg m² for the hp treatment hence in both treatments there was only a small difference 0 0 to 2 0 between total and marketable yield when ber occurred depending on the year the yields were affected more strongly fig 3 while the level of ber varied substantially i e range of 0 9 18 6 in the hp treatment it was remarkably constant and low i e range of 0 2 to 0 4 over the years in the ap treatment although in each year the incidence of ber was lowered in the ap treatment the difference between both treatments was significant in 2016 and 2017 combined anova could not detect any significant effect of the ns type because the mean square value of the interaction years x ns type used to calculate the f value was relatively large to the mean square value of ns type for the number of fruits produced and for the tomato fruit diameter no significant difference was found between both treatments results not shown the fruit diameter was remarkably constant over the years with an overall average of 67 3 mm at some point during the production seasons some wilting at the top of the tomato stems and inferior weekly growth was observed in the ap treatment this was always consistent with the sodium peaks in the ap slabs and was reflected in a lower total stem length for ap average final stem size over 3 years being 868 6 cm than for hp average final stem size of 878 64 cm although the difference was not significant 3 2 water quality the ph and macro and micronutrient concentrations in the ap feeding ns were maintained close to the targeted hp concentrations and on the average over all growing periods no significant differences were found between both treatments table 1 only a difference in na and cl was observed with on average 2 90 times more na and 5 97 times more cl in the ap na concentration in ap feeding ns variated from 1 31 to 11 84 mmol l with an average of 4 32 mmol l in the hp feeding solution na concentration variated only from 0 87 to 2 23 mmol l with an average of 1 49 mmol l cl concentrations approximately showed the same variability the higher na and cl contents in the ap feeding solution resulted in the ap slabs in 2016 and 2017 in persistently higher concentrations of these elements and a significantly higher ec fig 4 shows ec and measured na contents some high peaks of na e g up to 35 mmol l were observed in the ap slabs especially in 2016 and 2017 because of these peaks the ap drain water was flushed and the slabs were rinsed on the 28th of april and 25th of july in 2016 and on the 26th of april and 24th of september in 2017 on average na content in ap slabs was 11 48 7 32 mmol l average na concentration in hp slabs was much lower 4 44 1 71 mmol l but was quite constant over the growing period cl concentrations in the slabs showed the same variability as na concentrations high for ap and low for hp and deviated from them with a quite constant value on average 4 89 mmol l for ap and 4 25 mmol l for hp in addition analysis of the macro and micronutrients in solution in slabs revealed significant difference between both treatments only for the mn in 2016 and 2017 table 2 mn was less concentrated in the ap slabs in 2015 also mn was less concentrated in ap slabs but not significantly overall in both treatments the nutrients were more concentrated in slabs than in the feeding ns except for tan only in 2017 mg and ph were significantly higher in the ap slabs 4 discussion 4 1 tomato production in our experimental design the ap treatment differed from the hp only by its water origin we aimed to have a similar feeding regime in both treatments i e equivalent nutrient supply and ph in the respective feeding solutions this goal was achieved as no significant ph macro and micronutrient concentration differences between the ap and the hp treatment were found in the feeding ns the only detected difference was the higher concentration of na and cl for the ap treatment consequently a significantly higher ec 1 2 ds m in 2016 and 1 3 ds m in 2017 was detected in the ap than in the hp slabs table 2 and fig 4 indeed na and cl were present in substantial concentrations in the pikeperch water the reason was that nacl salt was directly added in the ras water to prevent fish health issues due to stress occurring at fish grading frequent fish grading was done for research purposes and nacl was applied directly after grading at concentrations of up to 34 mmol l cl concentrations in slabs were always lower than na ones with an approximately constant value giving some evidence for plant uptake to be the cause after correction for the difference between cl and na concentrations already present in the feeding ns the remaining difference caused by plant uptake was 4 08 mmol l for ap and 3 29 mmol l for hp while high cl and na contents can induce salt stress high na contents can induce a supplemental deleterious effect due to the antagonism with k and ca uptake indeed during two short periods in 2016 and 2017 a reduced plant growth was noticed to prevent further growth reduction the drain water was discharged it is commonly admitted that plant growth and yield are adversely influenced by salinity stress cuartero et al 1999 kanayama and kochetov 2015 soria and cuartero 1998 zhai et al 2015 or by high root zone concentrations of na cuartero and fernández muñoz 1998 in addition the stress induced by salinity is known to increase ber symptoms and so to further reduce the marketable yields kanayama and kochetov 2015 zhai et al 2015 consequently because of the higher average ec a lower fruit yield would have been expected in the ap treatment for both 2016 and 2017 some ec peaks even were higher than 9 ds m in the ap slabs although a slightly weekly lower yield has been observed after these peaks result not shown no significant reduction of the total yearly production occurred total stem length total tomato fruit yields and fruit number were not significantly different between the ap and the hp treatment slightly more marketable fruits were recorded in the ap treatment in 2015 and 2017 but this yield increase was not significant this slight yield difference is presumably linked to the incidence of ber that was always lower significantly lower in 2016 and 2017 and remarkably constant through the seasons and years i e 0 4 in the ap treatment fig 3 we only found two experiments comparing aquaponic tomato production to a hydroponic control suhl et al 2016 compared tomato production in nft with complemented ras water solution to that in hydroponic solution and also obtained similar yields in both treatments and lower ber in the complemented ras water treatment crappé et al 2017 compared complemented ras water to hydroponics with drip irrigation and obtained similar yields ber incidence was higher for the complemented ras water treatment but this was due to an excess of k leading to an unfavourable k ca ratio however these studies were based only on one season of production without succeeding to have similar i e without significant differences macro and micronutrient concentrations in the feeding solutions of both treatments making the interpretation of tomato production and ber symptoms in our opinion not sufficiently trustable regarding the statistical analysis the experimental setup of 4 replicates studied for 3 years gave only 2 degrees of freedom for the interaction years x treatment against which the effect of the treatments was tested this is quite low from a statistical point of view but increasing this number of degrees of freedom for such large scale semi practice experiment would require still more years of experiment or a higher number of treatments while the first solution was out of question a higher number of treatments would have been at the expense of the semi practice scale of the treatment a few studies have reported higher yields i e in vegetative mass in complemented ras water compared to hydroponic control for leafy vegetables as lettuce delaide et al 2016b goddek and vermeulen 2018 and basil saha et al 2016 for tomatoes however no significant increase in tomato vegetative mass has yet been reported in literature it was also not measured in our study butit is important to notice that during tomato cultivation the plants were continuously pruned to keep only two stems old leaves and suckers were thus continuously removed and this biomass has not been quantified as the observed increase of salinity and na content in the ap treatment were supposed to reduce the plant production and increase ber symptoms an important question is what can explain the absence of stress and this apparent resistance to salinity the only possible answer is that ras wastewater used in the ap treatment should contain factors that were not present in the hp water indeed ras water is charged with a variety of microorganisms bacteria fungi protozoa etc rurangwa and verdegem 2015 schmautz et al 2017 schreier et al 2010 and dissolved organic molecules dom the latter are released by physicochemical degradation of the fish feed and the fish excretions or by microorganisms e g organic molecule alteration triggering molecules for quorum sensing etc hence a broad variety of dom can be present as peptides amino acids phytohormones like humic acid like organic molecules hambly et al 2015 microorganisms and or dom may have acted as tomato plant biostimulants du jardin 2015 providing possibilities to overcome the salinity stress and keep productivity as high and sometimes higher than in the hp treatment at the end of each cultivation period slightly more roots were observed on the side of the ap slabs however for technical reasons it was not possible to weigh or score it such increase of root development is in accordance with the observations of delaide et al 2016a 2016b for lettuce in complemented ras water indeed microorganisms settled in the rhizosphere can beneficially interact with the plants bartelme et al 2018 and promote root development amin et al 2015 wienhausen et al 2017 further experiments with a close monitoring of the root mass plant biostimulating microorganisms and dom presence are needed to confirm our assumptions 4 2 blossom end rot and mn interestingly mn had a significant difference in concentration between treatments in the slabs no technical intervention i e unlike for cl could explain this difference mn was always lower in the ap slabs and this was repeated through the years table 2 on average mn was 1 9 times less concentrated in the ap than in the hp slabs compared to the feeding solution mn was slightly more concentrated in the hp slabs but 1 7 times less concentrated in the ap slabs no significant differences were found between both treatments for the concentration of mn in the feeding ns nor for the ph in the slabs thus excluding the possibility of mn loss by switching to an insoluble form e g precipitation as such the lower concentration of mn in the ap slabs indicates that ap tomato plants assimilated more mn than the hp ones this higher mn assimilation then should be due to microorganisms that colonized the rhizosphere and improved the nutrient use efficiency meena et al 2017 or increased the root mass silber et al 2009 and aktas et al 2005 demonstrated that higher mn content in fruit was correlated to reduced ber symptoms and as we observed reduced ber and high mn uptake we suspect the tomato plants to have had a higher mn content in their fruits unfortunately in our study the mn content in tomato leaves and fruits was not quantified this should be achieved in further research to verify our assumption finally as some authors claimed the low ca concentration in the fruit tip accompanying ber to be a consequence of a metabolic disorder related with an increase of reactive oxygen species de freitas et al 2011 saure 2014 it is possible that microorganisms and or dom have interacted with the tomato plant metabolism and promoted resistance against ber via other ways than by only enhancing mn uptake canellas et al 2015 mangmang et al 2015 5 conclusion in our study we compared the production of tomatoes grown in a ns based on complemented ras wastewater to tomatoes grown in conventional hydroponic ns we especially achieved for the first time to accurately complement ras water with macro and micronutrient concentrations equivalent i e no significant difference observed to the hydroponic ns and this during 3 seasons of production our results clearly indicate the suitability of complemented pikeperch ras wastewater as feeding water for professional hp tomato production using drip irrigation as similar growth and yields were obtained in ap and hp treatments while a significant higher ec was recorded in the ap treatment due to intermittent nacl addition in the ras water the tomato yields did not diminish interestingly symptoms of ber were even reduced in this treatment as ras water contains a diversity of microorganisms e g bacteria fungi protozoa etc and dom e g amino acid like phytohormones like humic acid like organic molecules etc it is presumed that some of these beneficially interacted with the plant metabolism e g by promoting the root growth and mitigated the salinity stress and the ber symptoms this study delivered also much evidence that this was achieved by the promotion of mn uptake which has been reported as a ber reducing factor further experiments with a close monitoring of the root mass the nutrient content in leaves and fruits especially mn would be needed to confirm our assumptions the simultaneous identification and count of microorganisms present in the plant root zone using advanced technology such as flow cytometry and metagenomic techniques should be envisaged methods to identify plant promoting doms should also be applied funding this research was done in the frame of the inapro project funded by the european

10852,the plastic covered ridge and furrow rainwater harvesting rfrh system has been used widely to enhance crop productivity in the semiarid regions of china we conducted a field study during 2015 2017 where the rfrh method was combined with deficit irrigation to decrease the irrigation water usage and improve the crop water productivity cwp and irrigation water productivity iwp under the rfrh system the amount of irrigation was reduced by half compared with that under traditional flat planting tf with border irrigation due to the effects of precipitation harvesting half of the deficit irrigation was supplied before wintering and the remaining half at the jointing stage the following eight treatments were tested rfrh system with 75 mm deficit irrigation r75 37 mm irrigation r37 18 mm irrigation r18 and 0 mm irrigation r0 tf cultivation with 150 mm irrigation f150 75 mm irrigation f75 37 mm irrigation f37 and 0 mm irrigation f0 the results showed that the irrigation volume doubled under conventional border irrigation but the soil water storage was greater under rfrh with deficit irrigation the r75 treatment resulted in significantly greater soil water storage reduced evapotranspiration 44 2 and a higher grain yield 14 6 thereby increasing cwp 64 8 icwp irrigation crop water productivity 44 2 and iwp 57 0 compared with f150 r75 improved the biomass per plant leaf area index and net income for farmers by 17 5 compared with f150 thus we recommend r75 for decreasing the irrigation water usage and increasing the effective consumption of precipitation in semiarid regions keywords border irrigation evapotranspiration ridge furrow system semiarid region crop water productivity winter wheat 1 introduction due to worldwide increases in the frequency of drought irrigation water resource deficiencies have become important in dryland cultivation systems xie et al 2005 globally china ranks sixth in terms of the total volume of water resources but the availability of water is only 1 4 per capita martinez et al 2011 in addition dryland farming areas have undergone significant declines due to competition for water by domestic and industrial users wang et al 2004 rusu et al 2009 the rainwater and nutrient use efficiencies are significantly lower in semiarid regions due to poor dryland management payero et al 2008 in these areas about 97 of the irrigation applied is conventional border irrigation border irrigation utilizes low amounts of energy but it requires 1 7 times more water than the ridge and furrow rainwater harvesting rfrh system thereby decreasing the irrigation water productivity iwp wu et al 2015 northern areas of china are highly reliant on groundwater and the water level has declined significantly by 1 m per year over the last three decades han et al 2004 deng et al 2006 thus increasing the areas of irrigated farmland and the amount of irrigation water to increase yields are not practical options therefore it is vitally important to efficiently manage the consumption of rainfall enhance dryland production and the crop water productivity cwp with inadequate rainwater resources and develop efficient water saving cultivation techniques the rfrh system has been used increasingly due to frequent droughts the rfrh system captures the surface runoff in the planting zone as an efficient technique for increasing crop production in dryland farming systems du et al 2010 the main benefits of the rfrh cultivation method are an increased moisture content and yield and reduced evapotranspiration et at the field scale due to the ridges covered with plastic mulch and increased rainwater capture in the planting furrows wang et al 2009 patanè et al 2011 reported that the rfrh cultivation method facilitates the enhanced consumption of light rainfall where the soil moisture improves by 8 16 cwp increases by 39 45 and et is reduced by 21 29 compared with traditional flat tf cultivation it has been reported that excessive border irrigation may lead to high crop water consumption and the risk of nitrate nitrogen leaching thereby reducing the cwp kim et al 2008 tian et al 2003 showed that rfrh improved the potato yield and iwp by 58 69 and 27 34 respectively the effective collection of rainwater can significantly increase the rainfall use efficiency maintain the crop production efficiency and facilitate sustainable dryland farming singh et al 2010 these benefits of the rfrh cultivation method can be used to persuade farmers to implement this cultivation technique to cope with water scarcity problems in dryland farming systems water saving agricultural technology is based mainly on irrigation scheduling with various methods at present drip and sprinkler irrigation are the most popular techniques and they can decrease the usage of water by 40 70 compared with border irrigation liu et al 2014 2016 however sprinkler irrigation is more appropriate for economic crops rather than field crops due to the restrictions imposed by the high cost of water and the soil texture as a consequence 97 of the irrigation applied in china is border irrigation although the iwp is significantly lower than that with sprinkler irrigation kang et al 2004 therefore in recent decades the application of limited irrigation has been promoted in semiarid regions increasing the volume of irrigation significantly increases the dry matter and et but it does not significantly enhance crop production and iwp chakraborty et al 2008 zhou et al 2009 showed that supplying 50 of the limited irrigation water under the rfrh system significantly stabilized the grain yield of up to 1 2 t ha 1 the rfrh system is an efficient method for improving the soil water storage sws wu et al 2015 but higher winter wheat production also requires the supply of deficit irrigation in the critical growth stages li et al 2007 several studies demonstrated that plastic film combined with irrigation considerably decreased the amount of irrigation required and obtained higher yields compared with the border irrigation method zhang et al 2015 ali et al 2017 advances have been made in water saving agriculture in semiarid regions but few studies have investigated the application of deficit irrigation by fully utilizing light precipitation under the rfrh technique in the present study we determined the effects of decreasing the volume of irrigation water to increase the cwp iwp economic benefit plant growth and winter wheat production under different planting models we examined the effects of different planting models on the sws plant growth biomass production economic returns cwp and iwp under different border irrigation methods we consider that this practice could support a complete rfrh system and our findings provide a reference to facilitate the application of border irrigation in winter wheat planting under the rfrh system in semiarid regions of china 2 materials and

study design the field study tested two cultivation techniques comprising rfrh and tf which were combined with border irrigation the amount of deficit irrigation using the rfrh system was decreased by half compared with that under conventional border irrigation f due to its precipitation harvesting effects the following eight treatments were tested rfrh cultivation with 75 mm deficit irrigation r75

with 0 mm irrigation f0 the trial used a completely randomized block with a split plot design and three replicates tillage was a main plot treatment and deficit irrigation was a sub plot treatment half of the irrigation was applied before wintering on 12 december 2015 and 15 december 2016 and the other half was supplied at the jointing stage on 28 march 2016 and 25 march 2017 with the aid of a precise water meter the borders were 3 6 m wide and 10 cm high under tf planting the irrigated area under tf cultivation was 22 m2 4 4 5 m and under f150 f75 and f37 mm the irrigation volumes were 3 30 1 65 and 0 81 m3 respectively under rfrh the irrigated area in one furrow was 3 m2 0 6 m 5 m and the irrigation volumes under r75 r37 and r18 in one furrow were 0 23 0 11 and 0 05 m3 respectively rfrh employed a ridge height of 15 cm with ridge and furrow widths of 40 cm and 60 cm respectively all of the ridges were covered with plastic film thickness 0 008 mm and four rows of winter wheat were planted in the furrows fig 2 the length width for each treatment was 5 m 4 4 m and a 1 5 m wide space was maintained between two adjacent plots to reduce possible water leakage the xinong 979

multiple comparisons means were tested using the least significant difference test at p 0 05 the difference in grain filling was not significant between the study years so data from the second year were pooled and the variations in the grain filling processes were then calculated 3 results 3 1 sws and et rate differences in crop water utilization rainfall and evaporation led to significant differences in the sws between the rfrh system and tf planting under different irrigation levels during various winter wheat growth stages fig 3 the sws values did not differ significantly among treatments at 0 days after planting dap during the two study years sws changed with the irrigation level cultivation technique and dap during the two years of the study the crop water consumption rate improved during crop development but the rfrh system increased sws by 26 compared with tf planting sws increased gradually from 30 to 60 dap under rfrh cultivation with various irrigation levels compared with tf planting sws increased significantly from 60 to 90 dap under both cultivation methods with different irrigation levels the two year average data showed that rfrh75 obtained a higher maximum sws 21 higher at 90 dap compared with tf150 during 90 120 dap the trend in sws decreased for each treatment except for r75 compared with that at 90 dap at 120 dap sws was significantly higher 33 higher under rfrh75 compared with tf150 the two year averages indicated that the sws 0 200 cm values during 150 180 dap were 21 20 22 and 27 higher in the rfrh75 rfrh37 rfrh18 and rfrh0 treatments respectively compared with the tf150 tf75 tf37 and tf0 treatments p 0 05 however sws decreased significant from 180 to 210 dap under both planting techniques with various irrigation levels sws improved considerably as the amount of irrigation water increased under both planting techniques during various growth stages increasing the deficit irrigation from 18 mm to 37 mm under the rfrh system led to no significant differences in sws in addition increasing the deficit irrigation from 37 mm to 75 mm under tf planting led to no significant differences in sws the et rates differed significantly among the various treatments during the two study years table 2 during the early growth stages from 0 to 60 dap the winter wheat was small and the utilization of water generally occurred via soil evaporation where the et was significantly lower under rfrh compared with that under tf cultivation when various irrigation conditions were applied covering the ridges with plastic mulch reduced the soil evaporation and improved the crop transpiration compared with tf planting throughout the entire growth period the development of the winter wheat was faster during the middle growth stages 90 180 dap and the cultivation techniques and deficit irrigation levels had significant effects on the et rate the et rates at 150 180 dap in the r75 r37 r18 and r0 treatments were 12 8 22 5 15 6 and 29 5 mm lower respectively compared with the f150 f75 f37 and f0 treatments in the later growth stage from 180 to 210 dap the two year mean et rates under r75 r37 r18 and r0 were 17 5 14 5 11 5 and 14 5 mm lower respectively compared with f150 f75 f37 and f0 during the whole wheat growing period the total et rates under the f150 f75 f37 and f0 treatments were 122 8 127 5 102 8 and 75 6 mm lower respectively compared with the r75 r37 r18 and r0 treatments 3 2 seed filling process the different cultivation techniques greatly affected the seed filling rates for winter wheat under various deficit irrigation conditions under rfrh cultivation increasing the deficit irrigation level significantly improved the mean and maximum grain filling rates for both the superior and inferior seeds compared with tf planting fig 4 when deficit irrigation was applied at 75 mm the rfrh system r75 greatly enhanced the maximum seed weight and the mean and maximum grain filling rates by both superior and inferior seeds were higher compared with those under f150 the maximum seed weights and the mean and maximum seed filling rates by both the superior and inferior seeds were significantly lower under f0 compared with r0 there were no significant differences between r75 and f150 in terms of the mean grain filling rates for the superior and inferior seeds increasing the deficit irrigation level from 18 mm to 37 mm under the rfrh system led to no significant differences in the maximum seed weight and grain filling rate under tf planting increasing the deficit irrigation level from 37 mm to 75 mm led to no significant differences in the maximum seed weight and seed filling rate on different days after flowering the seed filling rate increased by much more in the superior seeds compared with the inferior seeds fig 4 the seed filling rates under the r75 and f150 treatments peaked at 15 days after flowering for the superior grains and at 18 days after flowering for the inferior grains 3 3 cwp icwp and iwp cwp represents the correlation between water utilization and the grain yield rfrh cultivation with various irrigation levels considerably increased the cwp compared with tf cultivation table 4 over the two years combined the rfrh method improved the cwp by 7 2 kg mm 1 ha 1 61 2 compared with tf planting in 2015 2016 the cwp values with r75 r37 r18 and r0 were 10 8 kg mm 1 ha 1 78 5 10 0 kg mm 1 ha 1 79 8 7 2 kg mm 1 ha 1 69 1 and 4 8 kg mm 1 ha 1 46 3 higher respectively compared with f150 f75 f37 and f0 in 2016 2017 the cwp values with r75 r37 r18 and r0 were 7 9 kg mm 1 ha 1 52 2 8 5 kg mm 1 ha 1 72 6 5 2 kg mm 1 ha 1 49 7 and 3 5 kg mm 1 ha 1 33 8 higher respectively compared with f150 f75 f37 and f0 in addition the rfrh planting method obtained a higher wheat yield despite using only half the amount of irrigation water compared with tf planting thus the icwp under the rfrh system was 5 5 kg mm 1 35 1 higher compared with tf planting table 4 the two year averages indicated that the icwp values under r75 r37 and r18 were 7 0 kg mm 1 44 2 6 1 kg mm 1 36 9 and 3 5 kg mm 1 23 3 higher respectively compared with f150 f75 and f37 iwp characterizes the amount of the wheat yield improvement due to deficit irrigation the rfrh system obtained a satisfactory iwp by using half of the deficit irrigation compared with tf planting the iwp with the rfrh system was 2 9 kg mm 1 64 7 higher compared with that under tf cultivation the average iwp values under the r75 r37 and r18 treatments were 3 8 kg mm 1 57 0 3 4 kg mm 1 69 0 and 1 4 kg mm 1 83 1 higher respectively compared with f150 f75 and f37 the icwp did not change significantly when the deficit irrigation increased from 37 to 75 mm under the rfrh system and increasing the deficit irrigation level from 75 to 150 mm under tf planting had no significant influence on the icwp 3 4 total dry matter accumulation and lai the dynamic changes in the maximum biomass accumulated shoots roots per plant differed significantly fig 5 under the rfrh and tf methods when different deficit irrigation levels were applied in 2015 16 and 2016 17 in the tillering and wintering stages the biomass accumulation under both planting techniques did not differ significantly with various irrigation levels the accumulation of dry matter increased slowly in the early growth stages more rapidly in the middle growth stages and it was maximized in the maturity stage the biomass accumulation per plant did not differ significantly when the deficit irrigation level increased from 18 mm to 37 mm under the rfrh system under tf planting increasing the deficit irrigation level from 37 mm to 75 mm had no significant effect on the biomass accumulation per plant throughout the whole wheat growing season except in the maturity stage the differences in biomass accumulation between r18 and f150 were not significant throughout the whole growing season the dynamic changes in the lai were affected significantly by the cultivation techniques under different deficit irrigation levels during 2015 16 and 2016 17 fig 6 the variations in lai started at the jointing stage and reached a peak in the flowering stage before slowly declining from the flowering stage to the seed filling stage due to leaf yellowing the application of deficit irrigation significantly affected lai under both cultivation techniques except in the tillering and wintering stages in the later growth stage for wheat the lai values in the plots with no irrigation tended to decrease much more than those treated with deficit irrigation using both cultivation techniques thereby indicating that an insufficient supply of irrigation water could lead to early leaf senescence the difference in the lai values was not significant between f150 and f75 3 5 winter wheat production and rue the volume of irrigation water and the cultivation technique had significant effects on wheat production and rue tables 3 under both cultivation techniques the biomass and grain yield increased greatly with the amount of irrigation water over the two years the results showed that the rfrh method increased the soil moisture and decreased et where the biomass grain yield increased by 0 96 t ha 1 8 6 in 2015 2016 and by 0 62 kg ha 1 14 2 in 2016 2017 compared with tf planting the average biomass yields under r75 r37 r18 and r0 in both years were 1 2 t ha 1 9 2 1 0 t ha 1 8 2 1 2 t ha 1 11 4 and 0 5 t ha 1 5 2 higher respectively compared with f150 f75 f37 and f0 the mean grain winter wheat yields under the r75 r37 r18 and r0 treatments were 0 8 t ha 1 14 6 0 9 t ha 1 18 7 0 5 t ha 1 14 0 and 0 2 t ha 1 7 2 higher respectively compared with the f150 f75 f37 and f0 treatments the results obtained in both years indicated that the rfrh method significantly increased the rue by 14 2 compared with tf planting the mean rue values under the r75 r37 r18 and r0 treatments were 14 5 8 9 19 0 13 9 and 7 0 higher respectively compared with the f150 f75 f37 and f0 treatments 3 6 economic analysis the total input costs for the treatments were ranked as follows r75 r37 r18 r0 f150 f75 f37 f0 table 5 the important outputs from the wheat comprised the biomass and grain yield under r75 ni increased by 1542 cny ha 1 17 5 the o i ratio by 0 10 4 2 and nid by 1637 cny ha 1 26 8 compared with f150 the mean ni under the r37 treatment was 1580 cny ha 1 24 9 higher compared with the f75 treatment the ni with r18 was 688 cny ha 1 18 2 higher compared with f37 the ni was 95 cny ha 1 3 5 lower under r0 compared with f0 4 discussion the rfrh system is considered to be an important method for conserving soil water and decreasing evaporation fang et al 2009 several studies have shown that the rfrh system can considerably reduce soil evaporation to improve the rainfall use efficiency zhang et al 2015 gan et al 2013 in the present study we found that the crop water consumption rate increased during crop development but the rfrh system increased the sws 26 compared with tf planting the sws increased gradually from 30 to 60 dap under the rfrh system using various irrigation levels compared with tf planting in the early growth stage the plant canopy is small and high evaporation of water occurs from the bare soil and thus applying plastic mulch on the ridges can minimize the exchange of water between the soil and air to reduce water evaporation from the soil thereby obtaining the optimum soil moisture content for seedling growth ren et al 2017 in addition the rfrh method directs precipitation into the furrow zone and ensures its deep penetration to decrease evaporation from the soil turner 2011 wang et al 2015 we found that the r75 treatment significantly increased 21 the sws at 90 dap compared with the f150 treatment in the two years of the experiment during 90 120 dap sws decreased under each treatment except for r75 compared with the sws values at 90 dap increasing the deficit irrigation level from 18 mm to 37 mm under the rfrh system did not significantly change the sws under tf planting increasing the deficit irrigation level from 37 mm to 75 mm had no significant effect on the change in the sws this difference occurred because precipitation increased during the middle and later growing stages and the ridges of the rfrh system harvested the precipitation to improve the soil moisture ali et al 2016 in addition the plastic mulch on the ridges inhibited the evaporation of water from the soil li et al 2001 previous studies have shown that the wheat yield is positively associated with the et rate wang et al 2015 we also determined that the rfrh system reduced the evaporation of water from the soil and enhanced crop transpiration compared with tf planting during the middle growth stages 90 180 dap the development of winter wheat was faster and the cultivation techniques and deficit irrigation levels greatly affected the et rate mulching the ridges with film can significantly prevent the exchange of water between the soil and air to decrease evaporation thereby obtaining the optimum soil moisture levels for emergence and seedling growth teixeira et al 2014 the total et rates under the f150 f75 f37 and f0 treatments were 122 8 127 5 102 8 and 75 6 mm higher respectively compared with the r75 r37 r18 and r0 treatments the rfrh system decreased the et rate compared with tf cultivation as also shown in a previous study ramakrishna et al 2006 previous studies have demonstrated that plastic film mulching increases the soil water content but more soil moisture is lost by transpiration so the et rate is eventually increased qin et al 2014 feng et al 2016 seed filling determines the seed weight and it is a major agronomic trait for crops previous studies have demonstrated that plastic mulching greatly affects the seed filling rate and seed weight in corn yang and zhang 2010 we also found that rfrh cultivation with increasing deficit irrigation levels greatly improved the seed filling rates for both the superior and inferior seeds compared with tf planting when deficit irrigation was applied at 75 mm rfrh cultivation greatly enhanced the single seed weight as well as the grain filling rates for both the superior and inferior grains compared with f150 the single grain weight and grain filling rates for both the superior and inferior grains were significantly lower under f0 compared with r0 ali et al 2016 indicated that rice varieties with poor filling by the inferior grains do not achieve high potential yields however the cultivation pattern greatly influences the filling of the inferior grains which are more susceptible to drought zhang et al 2007 it is essential to develop suitable water management practices to ensure the most effective use of irrigation and rainwater zhang et al 2015 the rfrh system can significantly increase the cwp compared with conventional flat planting ali et al 2017 in the present study we found that the rfrh system increased the cwp by 61 2 compared with tf planting the mean cwp values under the r75 r37 r18 and r0 treatments were 78 5 79 8 69 1 and 46 3 higher respectively compared with the f150 f75 f37 and f0 treatments however li et al 2016 showed that the effects of the rfrh system on the cwp are often reduced due to seasonal precipitation and by increasing the deficit irrigation levels but we found that the rfrh system obtained a higher grain yield by applying only half the amount of irrigation water compared with tf planting thus the icwp with the rfrh system was 35 1 higher compared with tf planting liu et al 2014 found that deficit irrigation significantly increased the icwp and iwp du et al 2010 also showed that applying deficit irrigation with the rfrh method considerably increased the icwp and iwp compared with border irrigation we found that the rfrh system obtained a satisfactory iwp when only half the amount of deficit irrigation was applied compared with tf planting thus the iwp with rfrh cultivation was 64 7 higher compared with tf planting the icwp did not change significantly when the deficit irrigation level increased from 37 mm to 75 mm under rfrh system and the icwp did not change significantly under tf planting when the deficit irrigation level increased from 75 to 150 mm many studies have shown that the rfrh system can make better use of rain water thereby improving the availability of water to crops compared with tf planting with a higher grain yield and cwp chen et al 2012 hu et al 2014 water scarcity is an essential factor that restricts crop production previous studies showed that the mulching with plastic film and applying deficit irrigation could increase the sws and reduce et to significantly increase the availability of water zhang et al 2017 our findings indicated that the biomass accumulation per plant did not differ significantly when the deficit irrigation level increased from 18 mm to 37 mm under the rfrh system and the biomass accumulation per plant under tf planting did not change significantly throughout the whole wheat growing season except in the maturity stage when the deficit irrigation level increased from 37 to 75 mm the lai reaches its maximum value after the flowering stage and transpiration is mainly responsible for the utilization water it is well known that water utilization by crops has a positive association with the accumulated biomass chen et al 2004 therefore irrigation greatly affects the lai indeed we found that irrigation significantly affected the lai under both cultivation techniques in the later growth stage the lai in the plots without irrigation tended to decrease much more than that in the plots with deficit irrigation under both cultivation techniques the r75 treatment significantly increased the lai but the lai values did not differ significantly between f150 and f75 and similar results were obtained by liu et al 2016 in semiarid regions the rfrh method can more effectively utilize precipitation and increase the availability of water to crops compared with tf planting qin et al 2014 liu et al 2014 showed that rfrh cultivation with half the amount of deficit irrigation increased the crop grain yield by 84 168 compared with conventional border irrigation in the present study we determined that under both cultivation techniques the biomass and grain yield increased greatly with the amount of irrigation water applied the rfrh system increased the sws and reduced et and the biomass and grain yield were 8 6 and 14 2 higher respectively compared with tf planting the economic benefit is an effective indicator when evaluating crop management practices rfrhp requires more investment but this can be offset by increased crop yields and greater economic returns ren et al 2008 we found that the r75 treatment increased the mean ni by 1542 cny ha 1 17 5 the o i ratio by 0 10 4 2 and nid by 1637 cny ha 1 26 8 compared with the f150 treatment the rfrh method with supplemental irrigation can significantly increase the income and profit ren et al 2008 but excessive border irrigation wastes water resources and increases the costs in addition the effects of deficit irrigation are strongly associated with rainfall where light precipitation reduces wheat growth and thus the irrigation schedule and amount need to be modified if the precipitation is adequate for crop growth no irrigation is required when plastic film mulching is applied and the net income and wheat production are significantly increased 5 conclusions dryland farming regions throughout the world are affected by water deficiencies but irrigation is expensive and possibly insufficient for growing winter wheat thus it is important to develop a deficit irrigation strategy for use under various cultivation techniques to address water shortages in this study we determined that the rfrh method with deficit irrigation at 75 mm achieved water saving benefits to improve the sws reduce et and obtain higher winter wheat production thereby achieving higher cwp icwp and iwp values compared with tf planting under deficit irrigation at 150 mm we found that deficit irrigation at 75 mm under the rfrh system had significant positive effects on the total dry matter grain yield and net income compared with the f150 treatment therefore the rfrh system with deficit irrigation at 75 mm is an efficient water saving technique for alleviating the problem of water scarcity and it obtains the highest net income however it should be noted that the effects of various cultivation techniques under different deficit irrigation amounts are directly correlated with the distribution and amount of rainfall during the wheat growth period declaration

10852,the plastic covered ridge and furrow rainwater harvesting rfrh system has been used widely to enhance crop productivity in the semiarid regions of china we conducted a field study during 2015 2017 where the rfrh method was combined with deficit irrigation to decrease the irrigation water usage and improve the crop water productivity cwp and irrigation water productivity iwp under the rfrh system the amount of irrigation was reduced by half compared with that under traditional flat planting tf with border irrigation due to the effects of precipitation harvesting half of the deficit irrigation was supplied before wintering and the remaining half at the jointing stage the following eight treatments were tested rfrh system with 75 mm deficit irrigation r75 37 mm irrigation r37 18 mm irrigation r18 and 0 mm irrigation r0 tf cultivation with 150 mm irrigation f150 75 mm irrigation f75 37 mm irrigation f37 and 0 mm irrigation f0 the results showed that the irrigation volume doubled under conventional border irrigation but the soil water storage was greater under rfrh with deficit irrigation the r75 treatment resulted in significantly greater soil water storage reduced evapotranspiration 44 2 and a higher grain yield 14 6 thereby increasing cwp 64 8 icwp irrigation crop water productivity 44 2 and iwp 57 0 compared with f150 r75 improved the biomass per plant leaf area index and net income for farmers by 17 5 compared with f150 thus we recommend r75 for decreasing the irrigation water usage and increasing the effective consumption of precipitation in semiarid regions keywords border irrigation evapotranspiration ridge furrow system semiarid region crop water productivity winter wheat 1 introduction due to worldwide increases in the frequency of drought irrigation water resource deficiencies have become important in dryland cultivation systems xie et al 2005 globally china ranks sixth in terms of the total volume of water resources but the availability of water is only 1 4 per capita martinez et al 2011 in addition dryland farming areas have undergone significant declines due to competition for water by domestic and industrial users wang et al 2004 rusu et al 2009 the rainwater and nutrient use efficiencies are significantly lower in semiarid regions due to poor dryland management payero et al 2008 in these areas about 97 of the irrigation applied is conventional border irrigation border irrigation utilizes low amounts of energy but it requires 1 7 times more water than the ridge and furrow rainwater harvesting rfrh system thereby decreasing the irrigation water productivity iwp wu et al 2015 northern areas of china are highly reliant on groundwater and the water level has declined significantly by 1 m per year over the last three decades han et al 2004 deng et al 2006 thus increasing the areas of irrigated farmland and the amount of irrigation water to increase yields are not practical options therefore it is vitally important to efficiently manage the consumption of rainfall enhance dryland production and the crop water productivity cwp with inadequate rainwater resources and develop efficient water saving cultivation techniques the rfrh system has been used increasingly due to frequent droughts the rfrh system captures the surface runoff in the planting zone as an efficient technique for increasing crop production in dryland farming systems du et al 2010 the main benefits of the rfrh cultivation method are an increased moisture content and yield and reduced evapotranspiration et at the field scale due to the ridges covered with plastic mulch and increased rainwater capture in the planting furrows wang et al 2009 patanè et al 2011 reported that the rfrh cultivation method facilitates the enhanced consumption of light rainfall where the soil moisture improves by 8 16 cwp increases by 39 45 and et is reduced by 21 29 compared with traditional flat tf cultivation it has been reported that excessive border irrigation may lead to high crop water consumption and the risk of nitrate nitrogen leaching thereby reducing the cwp kim et al 2008 tian et al 2003 showed that rfrh improved the potato yield and iwp by 58 69 and 27 34 respectively the effective collection of rainwater can significantly increase the rainfall use efficiency maintain the crop production efficiency and facilitate sustainable dryland farming singh et al 2010 these benefits of the rfrh cultivation method can be used to persuade farmers to implement this cultivation technique to cope with water scarcity problems in dryland farming systems water saving agricultural technology is based mainly on irrigation scheduling with various methods at present drip and sprinkler irrigation are the most popular techniques and they can decrease the usage of water by 40 70 compared with border irrigation liu et al 2014 2016 however sprinkler irrigation is more appropriate for economic crops rather than field crops due to the restrictions imposed by the high cost of water and the soil texture as a consequence 97 of the irrigation applied in china is border irrigation although the iwp is significantly lower than that with sprinkler irrigation kang et al 2004 therefore in recent decades the application of limited irrigation has been promoted in semiarid regions increasing the volume of irrigation significantly increases the dry matter and et but it does not significantly enhance crop production and iwp chakraborty et al 2008 zhou et al 2009 showed that supplying 50 of the limited irrigation water under the rfrh system significantly stabilized the grain yield of up to 1 2 t ha 1 the rfrh system is an efficient method for improving the soil water storage sws wu et al 2015 but higher winter wheat production also requires the supply of deficit irrigation in the critical growth stages li et al 2007 several studies demonstrated that plastic film combined with irrigation considerably decreased the amount of irrigation required and obtained higher yields compared with the border irrigation method zhang et al 2015 ali et al 2017 advances have been made in water saving agriculture in semiarid regions but few studies have investigated the application of deficit irrigation by fully utilizing light precipitation under the rfrh technique in the present study we determined the effects of decreasing the volume of irrigation water to increase the cwp iwp economic benefit plant growth and winter wheat production under different planting models we examined the effects of different planting models on the sws plant growth biomass production economic returns cwp and iwp under different border irrigation methods we consider that this practice could support a complete rfrh system and our findings provide a reference to facilitate the application of border irrigation in winter wheat planting under the rfrh system in semiarid regions of china 2 materials and

study design the field study tested two cultivation techniques comprising rfrh and tf which were combined with border irrigation the amount of deficit irrigation using the rfrh system was decreased by half compared with that under conventional border irrigation f due to its precipitation harvesting effects the following eight treatments were tested rfrh cultivation with 75 mm deficit irrigation r75

with 0 mm irrigation f0 the trial used a completely randomized block with a split plot design and three replicates tillage was a main plot treatment and deficit irrigation was a sub plot treatment half of the irrigation was applied before wintering on 12 december 2015 and 15 december 2016 and the other half was supplied at the jointing stage on 28 march 2016 and 25 march 2017 with the aid of a precise water meter the borders were 3 6 m wide and 10 cm high under tf planting the irrigated area under tf cultivation was 22 m2 4 4 5 m and under f150 f75 and f37 mm the irrigation volumes were 3 30 1 65 and 0 81 m3 respectively under rfrh the irrigated area in one furrow was 3 m2 0 6 m 5 m and the irrigation volumes under r75 r37 and r18 in one furrow were 0 23 0 11 and 0 05 m3 respectively rfrh employed a ridge height of 15 cm with ridge and furrow widths of 40 cm and 60 cm respectively all of the ridges were covered with plastic film thickness 0 008 mm and four rows of winter wheat were planted in the furrows fig 2 the length width for each treatment was 5 m 4 4 m and a 1 5 m wide space was maintained between two adjacent plots to reduce possible water leakage the xinong 979

treatment 2 3 2 et the et rate was calculated on a seasonal basis as wu et al 2015 2 et p i c sw1 sw2 d r where p is the total precipitation mm i is the irrigation amount mm c is the upward flow into the root zone sw1 is the soil water mm at the time of sowing sw2 is the soil water mm at the time of harvesting d is the downward drainage and r is the surface runoff the groundwater table remained at a depth of about 50 m below the surface so the upward flow into the root was negligible the field was flat so runoff was never observed and the drainage was insignificant over the depth of 200 cm the

spikes that flowered at the same time were selected and labeled six labeled spikes were selected from each treatment at three day intervals from flowering to maturity as described by jiang et al 2003 the grains on each spike were divided into upper and basal seeds the seed samples were dried in an oven to constant weight at 70 c for a minimum of 48 h the grain filling rates were determined using the following equation richards 1959 8 w a 1 b e k t 1 n the grain filling rate g was then determined as the derivative of eq 8 9 g a k b e k t 1 b e k t n 1 n where a is the final grain weight mg b k

multiple comparisons means were tested using the least significant difference test at p 0 05 the difference in grain filling was not significant between the study years so data from the second year were pooled and the variations in the grain filling processes were then calculated 3 results 3 1 sws and et rate differences in crop water utilization rainfall and evaporation led to significant differences in the sws between the rfrh system and tf planting under different irrigation levels during various winter wheat growth stages fig 3 the sws values did not differ significantly among treatments at 0 days after planting dap during the two study years sws changed with the irrigation level cultivation technique and dap during the two years of the study the crop water consumption rate improved during crop development but the rfrh system increased sws by 26 compared with tf planting sws increased gradually from 30 to 60 dap under rfrh cultivation with various irrigation levels compared with tf planting sws increased significantly from 60 to 90 dap under both cultivation methods with different irrigation levels the two year average data showed that rfrh75 obtained a higher maximum sws 21 higher at 90 dap compared with tf150 during 90 120 dap the trend in sws decreased for each treatment except for r75 compared with that at 90 dap at 120 dap sws was significantly higher 33 higher under rfrh75 compared with tf150 the two year averages indicated that the sws 0 200 cm values during 150 180 dap were 21 20 22 and 27 higher in the rfrh75 rfrh37 rfrh18 and rfrh0 treatments respectively compared with the tf150 tf75 tf37 and tf0 treatments p 0 05 however sws decreased significant from 180 to 210 dap under both planting techniques with various irrigation levels sws improved considerably as the amount of irrigation water increased under both planting techniques during various growth stages increasing the deficit irrigation from 18 mm to 37 mm under the rfrh system led to no significant differences in sws in addition increasing the deficit irrigation from 37 mm to 75 mm under tf planting led to no significant differences in sws the et rates differed significantly among the various treatments during the two study years table 2 during the early growth stages from 0 to 60 dap the winter wheat was small and the utilization of water generally occurred via soil evaporation where the et was significantly lower under rfrh compared with that under tf cultivation when various irrigation conditions were applied covering the ridges with plastic mulch reduced the soil evaporation and improved the crop transpiration compared with tf planting throughout the entire growth period the development of the winter wheat was faster during the middle growth stages 90 180 dap and the cultivation techniques and deficit irrigation levels had significant effects on the et rate the et rates at 150 180 dap in the r75 r37 r18 and r0 treatments were 12 8 22 5 15 6 and 29 5 mm lower respectively compared with the f150 f75 f37 and f0 treatments in the later growth stage from 180 to 210 dap the two year mean et rates under r75 r37 r18 and r0 were 17 5 14 5 11 5 and 14 5 mm lower respectively compared with f150 f75 f37 and f0 during the whole wheat growing period the total et rates under the f150 f75 f37 and f0 treatments were 122 8 127 5 102 8 and 75 6 mm lower respectively compared with the r75 r37 r18 and r0 treatments 3 2 seed filling process the different cultivation techniques greatly affected the seed filling rates for winter wheat under various deficit irrigation conditions under rfrh cultivation increasing the deficit irrigation level significantly improved the mean and maximum grain filling rates for both the superior and inferior seeds compared with tf planting fig 4 when deficit irrigation was applied at 75 mm the rfrh system r75 greatly enhanced the maximum seed weight and the mean and maximum grain filling rates by both superior and inferior seeds were higher compared with those under f150 the maximum seed weights and the mean and maximum seed filling rates by both the superior and inferior seeds were significantly lower under f0 compared with r0 there were no significant differences between r75 and f150 in terms of the mean grain filling rates for the superior and inferior seeds increasing the deficit irrigation level from 18 mm to 37 mm under the rfrh system led to no significant differences in the maximum seed weight and grain filling rate under tf planting increasing the deficit irrigation level from 37 mm to 75 mm led to no significant differences in the maximum seed weight and seed filling rate on different days after flowering the seed filling rate increased by much more in the superior seeds compared with the inferior seeds fig 4 the seed filling rates under the r75 and f150 treatments peaked at 15 days after flowering for the superior grains and at 18 days after flowering for the inferior grains 3 3 cwp icwp and iwp cwp represents the correlation between water utilization and the grain yield rfrh cultivation with various irrigation levels considerably increased the cwp compared with tf cultivation table 4 over the two years combined the rfrh method improved the cwp by 7 2 kg mm 1 ha 1 61 2 compared with tf planting in 2015 2016 the cwp values with r75 r37 r18 and r0 were 10 8 kg mm 1 ha 1 78 5 10 0 kg mm 1 ha 1 79 8 7 2 kg mm 1 ha 1 69 1 and 4 8 kg mm 1 ha 1 46 3 higher respectively compared with f150 f75 f37 and f0 in 2016 2017 the cwp values with r75 r37 r18 and r0 were 7 9 kg mm 1 ha 1 52 2 8 5 kg mm 1 ha 1 72 6 5 2 kg mm 1 ha 1 49 7 and 3 5 kg mm 1 ha 1 33 8 higher respectively compared with f150 f75 f37 and f0 in addition the rfrh planting method obtained a higher wheat yield despite using only half the amount of irrigation water compared with tf planting thus the icwp under the rfrh system was 5 5 kg mm 1 35 1 higher compared with tf planting table 4 the two year averages indicated that the icwp values under r75 r37 and r18 were 7 0 kg mm 1 44 2 6 1 kg mm 1 36 9 and 3 5 kg mm 1 23 3 higher respectively compared with f150 f75 and f37 iwp characterizes the amount of the wheat yield improvement due to deficit irrigation the rfrh system obtained a satisfactory iwp by using half of the deficit irrigation compared with tf planting the iwp with the rfrh system was 2 9 kg mm 1 64 7 higher compared with that under tf cultivation the average iwp values under the r75 r37 and r18 treatments were 3 8 kg mm 1 57 0 3 4 kg mm 1 69 0 and 1 4 kg mm 1 83 1 higher respectively compared with f150 f75 and f37 the icwp did not change significantly when the deficit irrigation increased from 37 to 75 mm under the rfrh system and increasing the deficit irrigation level from 75 to 150 mm under tf planting had no significant influence on the icwp 3 4 total dry matter accumulation and lai the dynamic changes in the maximum biomass accumulated shoots roots per plant differed significantly fig 5 under the rfrh and tf methods when different deficit irrigation levels were applied in 2015 16 and 2016 17 in the tillering and wintering stages the biomass accumulation under both planting techniques did not differ significantly with various irrigation levels the accumulation of dry matter increased slowly in the early growth stages more rapidly in the middle growth stages and it was maximized in the maturity stage the biomass accumulation per plant did not differ significantly when the deficit irrigation level increased from 18 mm to 37 mm under the rfrh system under tf planting increasing the deficit irrigation level from 37 mm to 75 mm had no significant effect on the biomass accumulation per plant throughout the whole wheat growing season except in the maturity stage the differences in biomass accumulation between r18 and f150 were not significant throughout the whole growing season the dynamic changes in the lai were affected significantly by the cultivation techniques under different deficit irrigation levels during 2015 16 and 2016 17 fig 6 the variations in lai started at the jointing stage and reached a peak in the flowering stage before slowly declining from the flowering stage to the seed filling stage due to leaf yellowing the application of deficit irrigation significantly affected lai under both cultivation techniques except in the tillering and wintering stages in the later growth stage for wheat the lai values in the plots with no irrigation tended to decrease much more than those treated with deficit irrigation using both cultivation techniques thereby indicating that an insufficient supply of irrigation water could lead to early leaf senescence the difference in the lai values was not significant between f150 and f75 3 5 winter wheat production and rue the volume of irrigation water and the cultivation technique had significant effects on wheat production and rue tables 3 under both cultivation techniques the biomass and grain yield increased greatly with the amount of irrigation water over the two years the results showed that the rfrh method increased the soil moisture and decreased et where the biomass grain yield increased by 0 96 t ha 1 8 6 in 2015 2016 and by 0 62 kg ha 1 14 2 in 2016 2017 compared with tf planting the average biomass yields under r75 r37 r18 and r0 in both years were 1 2 t ha 1 9 2 1 0 t ha 1 8 2 1 2 t ha 1 11 4 and 0 5 t ha 1 5 2 higher respectively compared with f150 f75 f37 and f0 the mean grain winter wheat yields under the r75 r37 r18 and r0 treatments were 0 8 t ha 1 14 6 0 9 t ha 1 18 7 0 5 t ha 1 14 0 and 0 2 t ha 1 7 2 higher respectively compared with the f150 f75 f37 and f0 treatments the results obtained in both years indicated that the rfrh method significantly increased the rue by 14 2 compared with tf planting the mean rue values under the r75 r37 r18 and r0 treatments were 14 5 8 9 19 0 13 9 and 7 0 higher respectively compared with the f150 f75 f37 and f0 treatments 3 6 economic analysis the total input costs for the treatments were ranked as follows r75 r37 r18 r0 f150 f75 f37 f0 table 5 the important outputs from the wheat comprised the biomass and grain yield under r75 ni increased by 1542 cny ha 1 17 5 the o i ratio by 0 10 4 2 and nid by 1637 cny ha 1 26 8 compared with f150 the mean ni under the r37 treatment was 1580 cny ha 1 24 9 higher compared with the f75 treatment the ni with r18 was 688 cny ha 1 18 2 higher compared with f37 the ni was 95 cny ha 1 3 5 lower under r0 compared with f0 4 discussion the rfrh system is considered to be an important method for conserving soil water and decreasing evaporation fang et al 2009 several studies have shown that the rfrh system can considerably reduce soil evaporation to improve the rainfall use efficiency zhang et al 2015 gan et al 2013 in the present study we found that the crop water consumption rate increased during crop development but the rfrh system increased the sws 26 compared with tf planting the sws increased gradually from 30 to 60 dap under the rfrh system using various irrigation levels compared with tf planting in the early growth stage the plant canopy is small and high evaporation of water occurs from the bare soil and thus applying plastic mulch on the ridges can minimize the exchange of water between the soil and air to reduce water evaporation from the soil thereby obtaining the optimum soil moisture content for seedling growth ren et al 2017 in addition the rfrh method directs precipitation into the furrow zone and ensures its deep penetration to decrease evaporation from the soil turner 2011 wang et al 2015 we found that the r75 treatment significantly increased 21 the sws at 90 dap compared with the f150 treatment in the two years of the experiment during 90 120 dap sws decreased under each treatment except for r75 compared with the sws values at 90 dap increasing the deficit irrigation level from 18 mm to 37 mm under the rfrh system did not significantly change the sws under tf planting increasing the deficit irrigation level from 37 mm to 75 mm had no significant effect on the change in the sws this difference occurred because precipitation increased during the middle and later growing stages and the ridges of the rfrh system harvested the precipitation to improve the soil moisture ali et al 2016 in addition the plastic mulch on the ridges inhibited the evaporation of water from the soil li et al 2001 previous studies have shown that the wheat yield is positively associated with the et rate wang et al 2015 we also determined that the rfrh system reduced the evaporation of water from the soil and enhanced crop transpiration compared with tf planting during the middle growth stages 90 180 dap the development of winter wheat was faster and the cultivation techniques and deficit irrigation levels greatly affected the et rate mulching the ridges with film can significantly prevent the exchange of water between the soil and air to decrease evaporation thereby obtaining the optimum soil moisture levels for emergence and seedling growth teixeira et al 2014 the total et rates under the f150 f75 f37 and f0 treatments were 122 8 127 5 102 8 and 75 6 mm higher respectively compared with the r75 r37 r18 and r0 treatments the rfrh system decreased the et rate compared with tf cultivation as also shown in a previous study ramakrishna et al 2006 previous studies have demonstrated that plastic film mulching increases the soil water content but more soil moisture is lost by transpiration so the et rate is eventually increased qin et al 2014 feng et al 2016 seed filling determines the seed weight and it is a major agronomic trait for crops previous studies have demonstrated that plastic mulching greatly affects the seed filling rate and seed weight in corn yang and zhang 2010 we also found that rfrh cultivation with increasing deficit irrigation levels greatly improved the seed filling rates for both the superior and inferior seeds compared with tf planting when deficit irrigation was applied at 75 mm rfrh cultivation greatly enhanced the single seed weight as well as the grain filling rates for both the superior and inferior grains compared with f150 the single grain weight and grain filling rates for both the superior and inferior grains were significantly lower under f0 compared with r0 ali et al 2016 indicated that rice varieties with poor filling by the inferior grains do not achieve high potential yields however the cultivation pattern greatly influences the filling of the inferior grains which are more susceptible to drought zhang et al 2007 it is essential to develop suitable water management practices to ensure the most effective use of irrigation and rainwater zhang et al 2015 the rfrh system can significantly increase the cwp compared with conventional flat planting ali et al 2017 in the present study we found that the rfrh system increased the cwp by 61 2 compared with tf planting the mean cwp values under the r75 r37 r18 and r0 treatments were 78 5 79 8 69 1 and 46 3 higher respectively compared with the f150 f75 f37 and f0 treatments however li et al 2016 showed that the effects of the rfrh system on the cwp are often reduced due to seasonal precipitation and by increasing the deficit irrigation levels but we found that the rfrh system obtained a higher grain yield by applying only half the amount of irrigation water compared with tf planting thus the icwp with the rfrh system was 35 1 higher compared with tf planting liu et al 2014 found that deficit irrigation significantly increased the icwp and iwp du et al 2010 also showed that applying deficit irrigation with the rfrh method considerably increased the icwp and iwp compared with border irrigation we found that the rfrh system obtained a satisfactory iwp when only half the amount of deficit irrigation was applied compared with tf planting thus the iwp with rfrh cultivation was 64 7 higher compared with tf planting the icwp did not change significantly when the deficit irrigation level increased from 37 mm to 75 mm under rfrh system and the icwp did not change significantly under tf planting when the deficit irrigation level increased from 75 to 150 mm many studies have shown that the rfrh system can make better use of rain water thereby improving the availability of water to crops compared with tf planting with a higher grain yield and cwp chen et al 2012 hu et al 2014 water scarcity is an essential factor that restricts crop production previous studies showed that the mulching with plastic film and applying deficit irrigation could increase the sws and reduce et to significantly increase the availability of water zhang et al 2017 our findings indicated that the biomass accumulation per plant did not differ significantly when the deficit irrigation level increased from 18 mm to 37 mm under the rfrh system and the biomass accumulation per plant under tf planting did not change significantly throughout the whole wheat growing season except in the maturity stage when the deficit irrigation level increased from 37 to 75 mm the lai reaches its maximum value after the flowering stage and transpiration is mainly responsible for the utilization water it is well known that water utilization by crops has a positive association with the accumulated biomass chen et al 2004 therefore irrigation greatly affects the lai indeed we found that irrigation significantly affected the lai under both cultivation techniques in the later growth stage the lai in the plots without irrigation tended to decrease much more than that in the plots with deficit irrigation under both cultivation techniques the r75 treatment significantly increased the lai but the lai values did not differ significantly between f150 and f75 and similar results were obtained by liu et al 2016 in semiarid regions the rfrh method can more effectively utilize precipitation and increase the availability of water to crops compared with tf planting qin et al 2014 liu et al 2014 showed that rfrh cultivation with half the amount of deficit irrigation increased the crop grain yield by 84 168 compared with conventional border irrigation in the present study we determined that under both cultivation techniques the biomass and grain yield increased greatly with the amount of irrigation water applied the rfrh system increased the sws and reduced et and the biomass and grain yield were 8 6 and 14 2 higher respectively compared with tf planting the economic benefit is an effective indicator when evaluating crop management practices rfrhp requires more investment but this can be offset by increased crop yields and greater economic returns ren et al 2008 we found that the r75 treatment increased the mean ni by 1542 cny ha 1 17 5 the o i ratio by 0 10 4 2 and nid by 1637 cny ha 1 26 8 compared with the f150 treatment the rfrh method with supplemental irrigation can significantly increase the income and profit ren et al 2008 but excessive border irrigation wastes water resources and increases the costs in addition the effects of deficit irrigation are strongly associated with rainfall where light precipitation reduces wheat growth and thus the irrigation schedule and amount need to be modified if the precipitation is adequate for crop growth no irrigation is required when plastic film mulching is applied and the net income and wheat production are significantly increased 5 conclusions dryland farming regions throughout the world are affected by water deficiencies but irrigation is expensive and possibly insufficient for growing winter wheat thus it is important to develop a deficit irrigation strategy for use under various cultivation techniques to address water shortages in this study we determined that the rfrh method with deficit irrigation at 75 mm achieved water saving benefits to improve the sws reduce et and obtain higher winter wheat production thereby achieving higher cwp icwp and iwp values compared with tf planting under deficit irrigation at 150 mm we found that deficit irrigation at 75 mm under the rfrh system had significant positive effects on the total dry matter grain yield and net income compared with the f150 treatment therefore the rfrh system with deficit irrigation at 75 mm is an efficient water saving technique for alleviating the problem of water scarcity and it obtains the highest net income however it should be noted that the effects of various cultivation techniques under different deficit irrigation amounts are directly correlated with the distribution and amount of rainfall during the wheat growth period declaration

10853,disk till dt and no till nt maize zea mays l water use crop growth characteristics and microclimatic differences have been shown to differ with these differences it becomes essential that maize be managed differently under these tillage practices in terms of irrigation and hence it is indispensable that tools to effectively implement irrigation management be developed however water management tools such as crop coefficients that account for tillage practices are extremely rare to investigate and develop better management tools this research aimed to develop single average kc and basal dual kcb daily grass and alfalfa reference crop coefficients kco and kcr respectively using measured crop evapotranspiration at two carefully and cautiously managed producer fields disk till and no till fields at holdrege nebraska for 2011 2012 and 2013 growing seasons both kc and kcb differed among dt and nt maize in that nt maize showed lower kc and kcb during pre anthesis and higher kc and kcb during post anthesis and the period of maximum kc and kcb occurred later in the crop growing season specifically the magnitude of these differences in kc values were 56 29 1 8 47 and 41 for may june july august september and october respectively i e greater in early and late season but smaller in mid season kcb presented similar trends within the season kcb exhibited 70 lower magnitudes than kc due to minimized evaporation effects on or around precipitation events and hence had reasonably strong relationship with leaf area index daily crop coefficients were correlated with two types of base scales days after planting dap and cumulative growing degree days cgdd it is demonstrated with evidence that cgdd was a better predictor of seasonal variation in kc and kcb the relationships between kc both kcr and kco and kcb both kcbr and kcbo vs dap and cgdd for both dt and nt maize during the three growing seasons in the form of transferable polynomial equations were also presented the crop coefficients for dt and nt maize and their estimation equations presented in this research are novel and have immense application in the task of accurate quantification of maize evapotranspiration and manage irrigation under these two contrasting tillage systems keywords conservation agriculture water use evapotranspiration evaporation irrigation tillage 1 introduction various conservation agriculture practices have been shown to influence key soil properties such as bulk density aggregate stability total porosity and organic carbon content resulting in alteration of soil structure bronick and lal 2005 pagliai et al 2004 hernanz et al 2002 beare et al 1994 conservation agriculture can be referred to any tillage system that leaves 30 of harvested crop residue on the soil surface after planting uri et al 1998 the impacts of conservation agriculture have been shown to vary substantially with climate soil texture management practices and other factors the alterations in soil properties can potentially translate into variation in crop performance and other crop resource use processes such as reduction of soil moisture deficits and evaporation alteration of microclimate crop water productivity decrease in pest and disease pressure minimization of weed pressure improvement in nutrient cycling and soil fertility and increase in carbon sequestration kassam et al 2009 palm et al 2014 irmak et al 2019 amongst these processes that can be impacted by tillage practices impact on crop water use and productivity is an important one from both economic and conservation points of view these impacts have been evaluated via limited research in a range of climatic conditions and cropping systems i e irmak et al 2019 and were found to be significantly variable and hence need to be addressed for specific cropping systems and climate regimes at local scales while being representative of commercial agricultural production systems irmak et al 2019 investigated the impact of disk tillage or dt a conventional tillage practice and no tillage or nt a conservation tillage practice on irrigated maize zea mays l water use crop evapotranspiration or etc grain yield water productivity and field microclimate in semi arid climate of nebraska using flux measurements of energy balance components from a nebraska water and energy flux measurement modeling and research network nebflux site irmak 2010 during 2011 2012 and 2013 it was concluded that no tillage results in reduced crop water use etc and comparative magnitudes of nt and dt maize etc varies within the growing season i e maize etc varies between dt and nt with crop growth and developmental stages specifically dt maize was found to demonstrate higher etc prior to anthesis while nt maize had higher etc post anthesis however no tillage does not present any advantage in producing higher grain yield dt maize yield was higher than that of nt maize and consequently did not influence maize water productivity moreover it was found that micrometeorological variables measured over the two surfaces dt and nt maize were significantly different and were strongly correlated to the difference in dt and nt maize etc the observations of a altered crop water use etc and b modification of the field microclimate including ambient temperature vapor pressure deficit net radiation wind speed eventually leading to modification of field level evaporative demand etref while practicing contrasting tillage systems imply that irrigation management under the two systems should be different as well it has been shown that other field management practices like deficit irrigation djaman and irmak 2012a nitrogen fertilization rudnick and irmak 2014 planting date and density irmak and djaman 2016 cover crops sharma and irmak 2017 surface residue cover irmak et al 2019 can have significant impacts on crop water use and hence irrigation management since there is quantitative evidence indicating the impacts of tillage practices or lack thereof on crop water use it is necessary that tools for precisely estimating etc for optimal irrigation management under these contrasting tillage systems be developed to aid water managers planners and irrigation practitioners to optimally manage these production systems evapotranspiration etc and crop coefficient measurement quantification techniques include lysimeter bowen ratio energy balance system brebs eddy correlation covariance system flux profile techniques surface renewal and the soil water balance approach hatfield 1990 irmak et al 2008 djaman and irmak 2012b rana and katerji 2000 rose and sharma 1984 in many cases it is preferable to quantify etc using an experimentally derived mathematical approach etc kc etref i e crop coefficients kc coupled with values of measured or estimated reference evapotranspiration etref due to difficulties in operating and managing cost and trained personnel requirement of etc measurement techniques the kc value for a given crop is assumed to intrinsically account for the effects of crop characteristics such as height albedo canopy resistance groundcover etc that distinguish the vegetation surface from that of two reference surfaces defined in standardization of etref asce 2005 i e grass or alfalfa the concept of crop coefficients was originally proposed by van wijk and de vries 1954 and further developed by jensen 1968 jensen et al 1971 doorenbos 1975 wright and jensen 1978 wright 1982 and allen et al 1998 the use of kc method to model etc has been practiced by the irrigation community since the early 1960s irmak et al 2013 the kc concept simplifies the impact of very complex soil plant atmosphere continuum relationships on the evaporative transfer and represents the combined relative effects of resistance to 1 water movement from the soil to the evaporating surfaces 2 diffusion of water vapor from the evaporating surfaces through the laminar boundary layer and 3 turbulent transfer to the free atmosphere and 4 the relative amount of radiant energy available compared to the reference surface jensen 1968 for its ability to implicitly account for these processes kc is considered as an integrated factor that represents all entities influencing the difference in diffusion of water vapor through the soil plant atmosphere continuum as compared with the reference surface which includes crop type and growth and development stage water land and nutrient management practices irrigation method and soil and micrometeorological conditions however this assumption might not hold true practically due to significant variability in these parameters as well as their interactions as a function of management practices under different climatic and soil conditions the two step approach kc x etref is the most commonly used approach to quantify etc globally due to its simplicity the widespread use of this technique in etc determination as well as irrigation management necessitates that local kc values for different cropping systems in various climatic conditions and management practices are developed therefore research efforts in the direction of developing new sets of crop coefficients that account for different management practices e g tillage practices in this research can aid in further improving the applicability of the two step approach for more accurate etc quantification the kc concept can be implemented using two different approaches depending on data availability accuracy desired and application i e single kc and dual kc methods both of which represent the relationship between a crop s evaporative transfers and the reference surface in certain ways the dual kc method kc kcb ke separates total evaporative transfer etc into crop transpiration and soil evaporation process by using two distinct coefficients basal dual crop coefficient kcb and soil water evaporation coefficient ke the kcb is crop specific and represents the ratio of crop evapotranspiration etc to reference evapotranspiration etref under conditions when soil evaporation is minimal but soil water content in the root profile is adequate to sustain crop transpiration at a potential rate whereas the ke is the ratio of soil evaporation to etref which represents evaporation from wet moist soil in contrast the single kc method does not address partitioned etc i e evaporation and transpiration and the difference between a crop and the reference surface is solely expressed using a single coefficient to the best knowledge of the authors any attempt to develop crop coefficients under dt and nt practices or any other contrasting tillage systems has not been reported in the literature with increasing pressure on water resources globally this is especially crucial to achieve more accurate etc quantification and effective within season water management given that tillage practices have been shown to affect field level microclimate which consequently results in altered field level evaporative demand etref as well as crop water use etc which have been presented in detail by irmak et al 2019 consequently these changes would impact plant growth and development as demonstrated by the leaf area index lai data and analyses in irmak et al 2019 resistance of water vapor flow through the soil plant atmosphere continuum and the relative amount of intercepted radiation within the plant canopy all of which affect the relationship between a crop and the reference surface and hence justify the need for tillage practice specific crop coefficients to aid in optimal irrigation management as also discussed in irmak et al 2019 the use of brebs in this research provides a unique opportunity to develop crop coefficients for dt and nt practices at daily time steps aggregated from hourly datasets of etc and etref thus the specific objectives addressed in this research were to i quantify and interpret daily alfalfa and grass reference kc and kcb curves for maize under dt and nt management ii develop functions representing the relationships among daily kc and kcb values to base scales such as days after planting dap and cumulative growing degree days cgdd and iii develop relationships among basal crop coefficients and leaf morphological area as represented by lai the functions of kc and kcb vs dap and cgdd will aid in efficient application of this tillage practice specific crop coefficients in more effective water management strategies hereon we will refer to grass reference single average crop coefficient and grass reference dual basal crop coefficient as kco and kcbo respectively and alfalfa reference single crop coefficient and alfalfa reference dual basal crop coefficient as kcr and kcbr respectively 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and soil and crop management the research utilized field measured data collected in 2011 2012 and 2013 maize growing seasons at two large scale farmers production fields near holdrege nebraska managed similarly with the only exception of tillage practice followed detailed research site characteristics and management practices soil properties crop establishment emergence and harvest crop varieties plant populations planting depths fertilizer and pesticide application irrigation followed at each field are provided in irmak et al 2019 and will not be repeated here briefly the general view of the nt and dt research fields that contrast the residue cover between the two fields are presented in picture 1 a nt and 1b dt as mentioned in irmak et al 2019 two similar fields were selected and were in close proximity to each other the selection of the two fields was an extensive process but was also a critical component of this research two fields that had similar topography slope etc same soil characteristics same irrigation system and system capacity same drop nozzles on the pivot same field size 53 6 ha each field same planting direction when necessary the same nitrogen herbicide insecticide fungicide management and the same or very similar other field management practices were selected the farmer cooperators agreed to plant on similar days with the same planting depth same maize hybrids table 1 same planting population density table 1 and also agreed to use the same planter to plant both dt and nt research fields in some cases the dt field had been disk tilled twice a year once in fall after harvest and once in spring before planting for 17 years and the nt field had been under nt management for the last 17 years the soils at both sites had very similar physical characteristics as detailed in irmak et al 2019 and were silt loam holdrege fine silty mixed superactive mesic typic argiustolls soil survey staff 2018 with all the conditions and management practices being similar across the two experimental fields it was justifiably assumed that any observed differences in water use dynamics were attributed to differences in field specific tillage practices irrigations for both dt and nt maize fields were managed by the farmer collaborators and the senior author s irmak by utilizing the soil water status measured continuously on an hourly basis at each field using model cs616 volumetric soil water content reflectometers campbell sci inc logan utah installed in the plant row at 0 0 30 0 30 0 60 0 60 0 90 0 90 1 20 and 1 20 1 50 m depths below the soil surface irrigation management was aimed at maintaining optimal non stressed conditions for maize by maintaining the available soil water in the crop root zone between approximately 90 of the field capacity to maintain some soil water storage for any potential precipitation and the maximum allowable depletion of 55 of total available soil water taw irrigation was triggered each time the soil water in the crop root zone was depleted by about 40 45 below the field capacity the long term 1981 2010 mean annual maximum and minimum air temperatures tmax and tmin respectively at holdrege nebraska are 17 8 c and 3 8 c respectively similarly long term mean annual and growing season total precipitation is 631 mm and 457 mm respectively during the experimental period 2011 2013 the mean growing season tmax and tmin were recorded as 27 3 c and 11 1 c respectively while mean growing season precipitation was 319 mm however precipitation was highly variable among the three individual growing seasons 469 202 and 288 mm for the 2011 2012 and 2013 growing seasons respectively and the wettest year 2011 received 132 greater total growing season precipitation than the driest year 2012 the year 2012 was the most severe drought over the central u s plains since data record began in 1895 hoerling et al 2014 the total seasonal irrigation amounts for dt maize were 165 371 and 180 mm for the 2011 2012 and 2013 growing seasons respectively for the nt maize these were 157 361 and 175 mm for the 2011 2012 and 2013 growing seasons respectively for the 2012 growing season the irrigation amounts under both dt and nt were higher more than two folds as compared to 2011 and 2013 growing seasons so as to compensate for the greater water deficit for greater details on weather conditions at the experimental sites during the experimental period refer to irmak et al 2019 2 2 measurement of crop evapotranspiration and growth maize etc during the 2011 2012 and 2013 growing seasons was measured using two identical brebs radiation and energy balance systems rebs inc bellevue wash which were part of the larger nebflux irmak 2010 that were installed in each of the two research fields etc was measured about 1 m above the maximum canopy height in the growing season maximum canopy height was 3 43 m irmak et al 2019 for detailed canopy height data and thus the measurement height did not change during the growing season as it was always sufficiently high 1 m above the canopy height prior to installation of the two brebss in research fields the two identical brebss were run for a period of time in the same location to collect data to ensure that both systems provide exact data under the same conditions so that the measurements in two different fields are not biased effective and robust performance of brebs in successfully quantifying the evaporative fluxes above various vegetation surfaces have been documented lafleur and rouse 1990 ham et al 1991 bausch and bernard 1992 fritschen 1965 irmak and mutiibwa 2008 irmak 2010 crop evapotranspiration etc and various meteorological measurements including sensible heat flux h soil heat flux g net radiation rn and air temperature ta and vapor pressure e gradients ta e were measured on an hourly basis in both dt and nt fields in three growing seasons using two identical brebss additional detailed descriptions of the instrumentation and measurements using brebss are provided in irmak 2010 along with examples and data procedures daily etc was calculated from hourly etc data measured with brebs to represent daily crop water use in both dt and nt maize and hence merge with daily etref data to realize the objectives of developing daily kc

reference evapotranspiration for both reference surfaces i e grass reference et eto and alfalfa reference et etr were quantified at each of the experimental fields using the standardized asce penman

surface respectively on a daily time scale asce 2005 field level microclimate data used in eq 1 were measured using the brebss installed in the middle of each of the experimental fields it has been established that using meteorological data measured above a well watered agronomic crop to calculate etref closely resembles etref calculated using a standard weather station data skaggs and irmak 2011 irmak and odhiambo 2009 the sensors and instruments used to measure microclimatic variables and their detailed descriptions are provided in irmak 2010 both single and basal maize alfalfa based crop coefficients kcr and kcbr unitless and grass based crop coefficients kco and kcbo unitless were derived from measured etc mm d 1 and etref mm d 1 on a daily basis and crop coefficient curves were developed to analyze the seasonal pattern of crop coefficients both grass and alfalfa have been used as standard reference surfaces to compute etc ideally usage of eto or etr should result in similar etc values no consensus exists on the choice of a reference surface for a certain region however climate or aridity of a region is a contributor to this choice for example alfalfa reference may be more suitable to semiarid or arid regions because alfalfa is capable of transpiring at potential rates even under advective environments also due to its vigorous and deeper root structure alfalfa is less likely to suffer water stress as compared with a shallow rooted grass on the other hand in humid and subtropical regions where alfalfa is not commonly grown the grass reference may be preferable crop coefficients kc are empirically defined as ratios of etc to etref eto or etr as 2 k c e t c e t r e f where kc kco or kcr is the dimensionless crop coefficient for a particular crop at a given growth stage soil water status and climatic condition and etc is the crop evapotranspiration the kc value in eq 2 includes effects of evaporation from both plant and soil surfaces and thus is influenced by the available soil water within the plant root zone and the wetness of the exposed soil surface in addition to single kc values basal crop coefficients kcb were also developed to represent the ratio of etc to etref in those conditions when the soil surface layer is dry so that evaporation of water from the soil surface is minimal yet the average soil water content in the root zone is adequate to sustain crop transpiration at a potential rate approximate kcb values were derived by removing the etc and etref data for the days when wetting events i e precipitation and irrigation occurred and for the two or three days after the wetting event irmak et al 2015 this procedure yet simple is effective in removing days with conditions conducive for evaporation to occur and the resulting data represents only basal evapotranspiration under non water limiting conditions the seasonal distribution of daily crop coefficients both single and basal was modeled using two base scales namely dap and cgdd the gdd concept quantitatively describes accumulation of daily air temperatures between certain growth limiting high and low temperatures and is commonly expressed as 3 gdd i 1 n t max t min 2 t base where tmax is the maximum air temperature tmin is the minimum air temperature tbase is the base temperature threshold and n is the number of days the base temperature for calculating gdd is the minimum threshold temperature below which plant growth ceases in this research maximum and minimum temperature thresholds of 30 c and 10 c respectively were chosen for maize djaman and irmak 2012b kukal and irmak 2018 all temperature values exceeding the upper threshold value were reduced to 30 c and values below 10 c were taken as 10 c air temperature data from a weather station holdrege 5 n latitude 40 30 longitude 99 22 automated weather data network high plains regional climate center awdn hprcc in proximity to the field sites were used for gdd computation third order polynomial functions were employed to fit a curve through measured data which is characterized by the derived equation and the coefficient of determination r2 values presented in appendix a usual choices of the order of the polynomial function used to characterize kc measurements in the literature are 3rd djaman and irmak 2012b irmak et al 2013 piccinni et al 2009 4th djaman and irmak 2012b rudnick and irmak 2014 and 5th order sharma and irmak 2017 kang et al 2003 3 results and discussion 3 1 single average crop coefficients daily scale etc and etref both eto and etr data and analyses that were used to develop the crop coefficients for all three growing seasons have been presented in detail in irmak et al 2019 this section presents the experimentally derived daily single average crop coefficients for maize under dt and nt practices and their seasonal distribution as a function of dap and cgdd alfalfa reference kcr and grass reference kco crop coefficients were plotted with respect to dap for three individual growing seasons and for all growing seasons combined pooled data as presented in figs 1 and 2 respectively for the dt maize daily kcr ranged from 0 05 to 1 59 in 2011 from 0 06 to 1 41 in 2012 and from 0 04 to 1 56 in 2013 whereas for nt maize it ranged from 0 07 to 1 56 in 2011 from 0 07 to 1 53 in 2012 and from 0 01 to 1 54 in 2013 similarly for dt maize daily kco ranged from 0 07 to 1 75 in 2011 from 0 10 to 1 60 in 2012 and from 0 05 to 1 70 in 2013 whereas for nt maize it varied from 0 10 to 1 79 in 2011 from 0 10 to 1 79 in 2012 and from 0 10 to 1 76 in 2013 growing season across both the tillage practices and three growing seasons the daily kcr and kco data exhibited a typical kc curve that progressively increased from around 20 dap to around 100 dap and then gradually decreased thereafter towards the end of the growing season due to decrease in the transpiration component of etc owing to leaf aging and senescence at the start of the growing season i e between 0 and 40 dap some kcr and kco values were greater than what is expected for the initial growth period 0 10 0 15 this was particularly visible in 2011 although similar behavior was observed in 2012 and 2013 for both the fields and can be clearly observed in pooled kc data figs 1d 2 d these high values were attributed to wet soil surface conditions because of precipitation events resulting in greater evaporation rates from the soil surface than what would have occurred in the absence of rain it is worth to note that these higher kcr and kco values are greater for the dt maize than for nt maize this can be explained by the lower evaporation rates from the nt field than the dt field due to surface cover and no soil disturbance which translates to higher kc magnitudes for dt maize during the initial growth period gardner 1983 stated that surface soil treatments cause a decrease in either the initial constant rate evaporation or the rate of water movement to the soil surface thus the crop residue in nt maize due to the mulching effect affects the energy supply and affects evaporation while the improved structure from absence of tillage practices can have a longer lasting effect gardner 1983 the kcr and kco values increased as the crop developed and reached relatively constant magnitudes which coincided with complete canopy cover the timing of complete canopy cover indicated by maximum kc values was earlier in 2012 than in 2011 and 2013 due to greater heat accumulation from higher air temperatures in a given time which led to faster growth and development in 2012 until this period the fitted curve for dt maize always represented greater magnitudes than that of nt maize for the reasons explained above also it was observed that the peak constant kcr and kco values in nt maize were attained later than dt maize in all three years this is because of the higher kcr and kco values for nt maize obtained around mid august to mid september due to higher etc in nt maize than dt maize for the same reason the average mid season kcr and kco values from the fitted curves were also higher in nt maize than in dt maize for 2011 and 2013 but similar for 2012 in 2011 the kc values for the nt maize around 90 dap fig 1a were exceptionally lower than the observed kc values within the same crop developmental phase due to a hailstorm event which slightly impacted the etc of the nt maize in addition to dap the daily kcr and kco were also plotted against cgdd to realize the impact of heat accumulation on timing and magnitudes of kc values figs 3 and 4 it was found that the r2 value which evaluates the goodness of fit of kc vs base scale either dap or cgdd increased when cgdd was used as the base scale than when dap was used overall both the kcr vs cgdd and kco vs cgdd curves demonstrated a fit that was better than kcr vs dap and kco vs dap by around 14 the improvement in fit was observed in all growing seasons and under both tillage practices except for nt maize in 2011 when the inconsistent kc values near tasseling reduced the r2 in 2011 specifically the improvement in r2 when using cgdd as a base scale ranged from 10 to 26 across growing seasons and the two fields this implies that cgdd demonstrates a better explanation of the seasonal variation occurring in kc values because it removes the effect of variable heat accumulation among days across different years and implicitly accounts for some of the plant physiological and development characteristics for example another interesting observation is that the improvement in r2 value was the highest for the year 2012 closely followed by 2013 because of relatively higher heat accumulation in a given number of days in 2012 and 2013 dap was not capable of explaining the seasonal variation in kc and hence cgdd is a better explanatory factor than dap although cgdd does not account for all kc influencing factors it still provides a means of reducing inter annual differences arising from climatic conditions hence improving the transferability of kc values between different climate regions kukal and irmak 2016 2018 and across growing seasons overall our data and observations revealed that tillage management has three distinct effects on the measured single crop coefficients a lower nt kc values during pre anthesis b higher nt kc values during post anthesis and c later occurrence of maximum kc phase around anthesis in nt maize these differences primarily stem from the demonstrated growth stage specific differences in water use among dt and nt maize irmak et al 2019 reported that dt maize had higher etc prior to anthesis due to higher evaporation prior to canopy closure in dt maize while nt maize evapotranspired more post anthesis which translates into similar patterns in difference in dt and nt kc curves another factor that contributed to these differences is the earlier senescence observed in dt maize due to lower soil moisture storage than nt maize which is responsible for the apparent shifting of the nt kc curves to the right direction of maturity all the above discussed results illustrate that kc values are strongly dependent on crop growth and development and management practices such as tillage inter annual differences in local climatic conditions and farming practices can result in variability in kc for the same growth and development stage across years sammis et al 1985 reported that gdd or cgdd cannot solely account for the total variability in crop development and kc between years nevertheless they suggest that gdd is less variable than julian days as a base scale monthly averaged single crop coefficients for the dt maize and nt maize for the three growing seasons are listed in table 2 for inter comparison the numbers of observations used to compute monthly average kc were total number of days in the respective month while for kcb they were number of days when surface conditions were nearly dry or dry respectively as was observed from daily progression of kc values monthly analysis also signifies the differences in dt and nt maize kc for the first three months of maize growth may june and july dt maize kc was greater than nt maize kc while the opposite was true for the last two months august september and finally dt maize kc was again greater for october specifically these differences among dt and nt kc averaged kcr and kco are substantial in may 56 june 29 september 47 and october 41 and relatively small in mid season i e july 1 and august 8 moreover we found that the maximum kc value for dt maize occurred in july whereas for nt maize it occurred in august the polynomial functions that relate kco and kcr to dap and cgdd are provided in the appendix along with the r2 value derived from the measured data for each growing season and pooled and tillage practice since cgdd represents the heat energy received by the plant canopy over a period of time irmak et al 2013 kc curves developed for a given location using cgdd should be applicable to locations with different climatic conditions sammis et al 1985 3 2 basal dual crop coefficients since single crop coefficients kcr kco are calculated using data which include precipitation and irrigation events these derived crop coefficient values are impacted by the precipitation and irrigation frequency and amount during the crop growing season due to these factors these kc values would be impacted considerably by site specific surface conditions of a given field and therefore would be relatively less transferrable and would also be subject to change in different precipitation regimes either at different locations or in a different year in the same location which is not ideal especially from a transferability perspective hence the influence of precipitation needs to be minimized to obtain kc values that are fairly independent of precipitation variations and soil surface moisture conditions to accomplish this we quantified basal crop coefficients and adjusted them for soil surface wetness when the single kcr and kco values were adjusted to obtain basal crop coefficients kcbr and kcbo the fluctuations in kc values which arose from soil evaporation from precipitation were minimized figs 5 8 present alfalfa reference kcbr and grass reference kcbo basal crop coefficient curves developed by fitting third order polynomial regression functions to the time distribution dap and cgdd distribution of the measured kcbr and kcbo data respectively for the dt maize daily kcbr ranged from 0 004 to 1 59 in 2011 from 0 04 to 1 38 in 2012 and from 0 02 to 1 28 in 2013 whereas for the nt maize it varied from 0 02 to 1 56 in 2011 from 0 03 to 1 44 in 2012 and from 0 003 to 1 53 in 2013 similarly the daily kcbo for dt maize ranged from 0 03 to 1 78 in 2011 from 0 02 to 1 55 in 2012 and from 0 02 to 1 49 in 2013 whereas for nt maize it varied from 0 01 to 1 77 in 2011 from 0 11 to 1 70 in 2012 and from 0 02 to 1 74 in 2013 the kcbr and kcbo data also exhibited a typical bell shaped distribution and seasonal pattern which was in agreement to the distribution of kcr and kco values although the day to day variation in kcb was significantly lower this is supported by the significant increase observed in r2 values observed in kcb distribution curves than that in kc distribution curves overall r2 of the kcb vs cgdd relationship was 42 higher than that of kc vs cgdd relationships when averaged across all growing seasons reference surfaces and tillage practices however this improvement in r2 varied among growing seasons and tillage practice firstly the r2 value improved by 68 in dt maize kcb curves than kc curves while it only improved by 16 in nt maize which is explained by the observation of lower evaporation in nt maize than dt maize irmak et al 2019 due to which the kcb model had lesser evaporation events to adjust for in nt maize secondly the r2 improvement was 68 and 65 in 2011 and 2013 respectively while it was only 13 in 2012 which is explained by lower precipitation in 2012 than the other growing seasons due to which the kcb model had lesser precipitation events to adjust for in 2012 as observed from comparing kc and kcb curves the unusually high kc values that resulted from soil evaporation were adjusted to lower magnitudes in kcb curves this adjustment of kcb values from kc lead to 70 reduction in kcb values than their kc counterparts when averaged across the growing season and the two reference surfaces grass and alfalfa however this reduction varied during the crop growing season the magnitude of this reduction was higher in the early and late growing seasons and minimal in the mid season 160 53 5 6 23 and 175 in may june july august september and october respectively although kcb represents the crop water use per unit etref after correcting for the evaporative effects from irrigation and precipitation the influence of surface wetting might not be completely eliminated the magnitudes of kcb initially in the growing season especially in 2011 and 2012 were observed to still be slightly higher than what crop transpiration would result in although they are substantially lower than their kc counterparts the monthly averaged basal crop coefficients for the dt maize and nt maize for the three growing seasons and pooled data are listed in table 2 for inter comparison dt maize showed higher kcb values than those for nt maize for may and june and the opposite was true for july august september and october these differences in dt and nt maize kcb averaged kcbo and kcbr were 73 33 1 14 57 and 27 for may june july august september and october respectively which is in agreement to the trend observed in dt and nt maize kc differences i e greater in early and late season and lower in mid season moreover the differences that were found among dt and nt kc values were true for kcb values among the two tillage systems as well i e lower and higher nt kcb values during pre and post anthesis respectively and later occurrence of maximum kcb values since dt and nt maize have been shown to have differences in their kcb even after adjusting for evaporation and precipitation it implies that the two tillage practices differ in their transpiration or basal evapotranspiration processes and that evaporation is not the only process that is impacted by tillage practice the functions for kcb both kcbr and kcbo vs dap and kcb both kcbr and kcbo vs cgdd for the three years as well as for pooled data are presented in the appendix the r2 values from the development of these functions are also provided generally functions developed form pooled data across three growing seasons should be the most transferrable given their development using extensive data from three contrasting growing seasons as with the kc functions especially cgdd based functions these can be applicable to other locations these functions are intended to aid in daily computation of single and basal crop coefficients and can be sought for a range of practical applications such as in season irrigation management estimation of maize water use under dt and nt tillage practices and for further use in water balance analyses and other analyses involving water resource demand and availability as well as projections moreover these empirical functions provide a more realistic and practical approach for irrigation management as well studying crop water use patterns per unit etref in comparison to their conventional counterparts such as stage based crop coefficients in fao 56 allen et al 1998 this is due to the fact that differential crop growth and development patterns in dt and nt maize irmak et al 2019 exemplify that the lengths of the crop growth stages as stated in fao 56 may not be necessarily constant and are subject to change with management tillage djaman and irmak 2012b stated that initial midseason and late season kc values as well as the lengths of these stages can be subject to change as a result of differences in hybrid characteristics planting population density and tillage practices demonstrated in this research moreover for precision management of irrigation crop coefficients for a given stage cannot be assumed to be constant or incremented linearly as proposed by fao 56 payero and irmak 2011 recorded significant variability in the daily kc values derived from eddy covariance measured etc for maize in north platte nebraska making it challenging to fit an average kc curve to the observed data accounting for this within growth stage variability is not possible by the use of fao 56 growth stage specific kc and rather has to be accounted for using an empirical function fit through high frequency crop coefficient data as in this research thus the empirical functions proposed here appendix distinguish crop coefficients for nt and dt maize and overcome the challenges associated with the practical application of a simplistic four growth stage based crop coefficient approach 3 3 relationship between crop coefficient and leaf area index lai we also studied the relationships between kcb values and leaf area index lai of nt and dt maize to accomplish this we chose the days when lai was measured in the two fields and sampled kcb values for these specific days figs 9 and 10 present kcbr vs lai and kcbo vs lai respectively for dt and nt maize during the three individual growing seasons and for the pooled data since kcb represents the transpiration component of etc it is expected that ideally theoretically kcb would exhibit a linear relationship with lai until full canopy cover is reached as greater the area of leaf tissue in a given plant the greater the transpiration of the plant overall the relationship between kcbo and kcbr vs lai varied between the tillage practice but also exhibited inter annual variation within the tillage practice for example for the kcbr values for dt the r2 values were 0 52 0 57 and 0 68 for 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively whereas the kcbr values for the nt were 0 63 0 56 and 0 54 for the same years respectively while these r2 values are reasonable the pooled data kcbr relationships with lai had much lower r2 values for both dt 0 37 and nt 0 35 fig 9 due to inter annual variation in the relationships for the individual growing seasons the relationships between kcbo and lai also had inter annual variation for both tillage practices although with higher r2 values than kcbr vs lai fig 10 indicating that kcbo might be a better more sensitive variable that captures the variability in the kcb vs lai relationship in most cases the relationship between kcbr and kcbo vs lai was stronger for dt than nt irmak et al 2019 developed similar relationships but with maize etc vs lai and found that while those relationships were also linear their r2 was relatively lower as compared to the kcb vs lai relationships developed in this research this is because the etc includes evaporation which is non beneficial water loss and does not contribute towards carbon uptake via stomatal processes and hence resulting in weaker relationship between crop growth lai and etc in contrast developing kcb values results in removal of effect of evaporation a stronger relationship between lai and kcb is anticipated other research trout and dejonge 2018 borges et al 2015 has also found linear relationships among crop kcb and lai or ground cover fraction until full canopy cover in contrast our data do not seem to approach a diminishing return ceiling yielding a curvilinear fit at high lai values implying that the plants transpiration ability was not constrained and thus was a direct function of the leaf assimilatory tissue and is an implication of the optimum irrigation management in the two fields 4 summary and conclusions the impact of adoption of contrasting tillage practices on maize water use growth characteristics and field microclimate irmak et al 2019 warrant that dt and nt maize irrigation management be tillage practice specific requiring development of tools and information to do so efficiently thus we present quantification analyses and interpretation of dt and nt maize crop coefficients both single average and dual basal under grass and alfalfa reference surfaces major differences existed in dt and nt maize kc a lower nt kc values during pre anthesis b higher nt kc values during post anthesis and c later occurrence of maximum kc phase around anthesis difference in dt and nt maize kc were substantial in may 56 june 29 september 47 and october 41 and relatively small in mid season i e july 1 and august 8 kc in early and late season were found to be subject to intermittent high values especially in dt maize due to higher evaporation rates during and after precipitation events relative to nt maize cgdd was found to be a better predictor of kc variability than dap the kcb vs cgdd relationship had 42 higher r2 than kc vs cgdd relationship the adjustment for evaporation in kcb development caused 70 reduction in kcb values than their kc counterparts especially in the early and late growing seasons when kcb was considered dt maize had higher kcb than nt maize for may and june while the opposite was true for july august september and october linear kcb vs lai relationships were observed with lai explaining moderate degree of variability in kcb to facilitate the application of our findings from a practical management perspective we developed polynomial functions appendix relating kco kcr kcbo kcbr to two types of base scales i e dap and cgdd to the best of our knowledge this research is the first one to study and quantify the impact of tillage practices on crop coefficients experimentally on carefully managed commercial production fields using sophisticated flux measurement technique for characterization of energy balance over vegetative surfaces the polynomial functions proposed here can be used to obtain reasonable estimates of maize etc under both dt and nt practices in environments similar to the research area or others within transferable limits of cgdd or dap this research established the need of differential irrigation management for dt and nt maize production and proposed transferrable tools to aid in accurate etc estimation to optimize irrigation management and crop productivity in these systems declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest acknowledgments this

10853,disk till dt and no till nt maize zea mays l water use crop growth characteristics and microclimatic differences have been shown to differ with these differences it becomes essential that maize be managed differently under these tillage practices in terms of irrigation and hence it is indispensable that tools to effectively implement irrigation management be developed however water management tools such as crop coefficients that account for tillage practices are extremely rare to investigate and develop better management tools this research aimed to develop single average kc and basal dual kcb daily grass and alfalfa reference crop coefficients kco and kcr respectively using measured crop evapotranspiration at two carefully and cautiously managed producer fields disk till and no till fields at holdrege nebraska for 2011 2012 and 2013 growing seasons both kc and kcb differed among dt and nt maize in that nt maize showed lower kc and kcb during pre anthesis and higher kc and kcb during post anthesis and the period of maximum kc and kcb occurred later in the crop growing season specifically the magnitude of these differences in kc values were 56 29 1 8 47 and 41 for may june july august september and october respectively i e greater in early and late season but smaller in mid season kcb presented similar trends within the season kcb exhibited 70 lower magnitudes than kc due to minimized evaporation effects on or around precipitation events and hence had reasonably strong relationship with leaf area index daily crop coefficients were correlated with two types of base scales days after planting dap and cumulative growing degree days cgdd it is demonstrated with evidence that cgdd was a better predictor of seasonal variation in kc and kcb the relationships between kc both kcr and kco and kcb both kcbr and kcbo vs dap and cgdd for both dt and nt maize during the three growing seasons in the form of transferable polynomial equations were also presented the crop coefficients for dt and nt maize and their estimation equations presented in this research are novel and have immense application in the task of accurate quantification of maize evapotranspiration and manage irrigation under these two contrasting tillage systems keywords conservation agriculture water use evapotranspiration evaporation irrigation tillage 1 introduction various conservation agriculture practices have been shown to influence key soil properties such as bulk density aggregate stability total porosity and organic carbon content resulting in alteration of soil structure bronick and lal 2005 pagliai et al 2004 hernanz et al 2002 beare et al 1994 conservation agriculture can be referred to any tillage system that leaves 30 of harvested crop residue on the soil surface after planting uri et al 1998 the impacts of conservation agriculture have been shown to vary substantially with climate soil texture management practices and other factors the alterations in soil properties can potentially translate into variation in crop performance and other crop resource use processes such as reduction of soil moisture deficits and evaporation alteration of microclimate crop water productivity decrease in pest and disease pressure minimization of weed pressure improvement in nutrient cycling and soil fertility and increase in carbon sequestration kassam et al 2009 palm et al 2014 irmak et al 2019 amongst these processes that can be impacted by tillage practices impact on crop water use and productivity is an important one from both economic and conservation points of view these impacts have been evaluated via limited research in a range of climatic conditions and cropping systems i e irmak et al 2019 and were found to be significantly variable and hence need to be addressed for specific cropping systems and climate regimes at local scales while being representative of commercial agricultural production systems irmak et al 2019 investigated the impact of disk tillage or dt a conventional tillage practice and no tillage or nt a conservation tillage practice on irrigated maize zea mays l water use crop evapotranspiration or etc grain yield water productivity and field microclimate in semi arid climate of nebraska using flux measurements of energy balance components from a nebraska water and energy flux measurement modeling and research network nebflux site irmak 2010 during 2011 2012 and 2013 it was concluded that no tillage results in reduced crop water use etc and comparative magnitudes of nt and dt maize etc varies within the growing season i e maize etc varies between dt and nt with crop growth and developmental stages specifically dt maize was found to demonstrate higher etc prior to anthesis while nt maize had higher etc post anthesis however no tillage does not present any advantage in producing higher grain yield dt maize yield was higher than that of nt maize and consequently did not influence maize water productivity moreover it was found that micrometeorological variables measured over the two surfaces dt and nt maize were significantly different and were strongly correlated to the difference in dt and nt maize etc the observations of a altered crop water use etc and b modification of the field microclimate including ambient temperature vapor pressure deficit net radiation wind speed eventually leading to modification of field level evaporative demand etref while practicing contrasting tillage systems imply that irrigation management under the two systems should be different as well it has been shown that other field management practices like deficit irrigation djaman and irmak 2012a nitrogen fertilization rudnick and irmak 2014 planting date and density irmak and djaman 2016 cover crops sharma and irmak 2017 surface residue cover irmak et al 2019 can have significant impacts on crop water use and hence irrigation management since there is quantitative evidence indicating the impacts of tillage practices or lack thereof on crop water use it is necessary that tools for precisely estimating etc for optimal irrigation management under these contrasting tillage systems be developed to aid water managers planners and irrigation practitioners to optimally manage these production systems evapotranspiration etc and crop coefficient measurement quantification techniques include lysimeter bowen ratio energy balance system brebs eddy correlation covariance system flux profile techniques surface renewal and the soil water balance approach hatfield 1990 irmak et al 2008 djaman and irmak 2012b rana and katerji 2000 rose and sharma 1984 in many cases it is preferable to quantify etc using an experimentally derived mathematical approach etc kc etref i e crop coefficients kc coupled with values of measured or estimated reference evapotranspiration etref due to difficulties in operating and managing cost and trained personnel requirement of etc measurement techniques the kc value for a given crop is assumed to intrinsically account for the effects of crop characteristics such as height albedo canopy resistance groundcover etc that distinguish the vegetation surface from that of two reference surfaces defined in standardization of etref asce 2005 i e grass or alfalfa the concept of crop coefficients was originally proposed by van wijk and de vries 1954 and further developed by jensen 1968 jensen et al 1971 doorenbos 1975 wright and jensen 1978 wright 1982 and allen et al 1998 the use of kc method to model etc has been practiced by the irrigation community since the early 1960s irmak et al 2013 the kc concept simplifies the impact of very complex soil plant atmosphere continuum relationships on the evaporative transfer and represents the combined relative effects of resistance to 1 water movement from the soil to the evaporating surfaces 2 diffusion of water vapor from the evaporating surfaces through the laminar boundary layer and 3 turbulent transfer to the free atmosphere and 4 the relative amount of radiant energy available compared to the reference surface jensen 1968 for its ability to implicitly account for these processes kc is considered as an integrated factor that represents all entities influencing the difference in diffusion of water vapor through the soil plant atmosphere continuum as compared with the reference surface which includes crop type and growth and development stage water land and nutrient management practices irrigation method and soil and micrometeorological conditions however this assumption might not hold true practically due to significant variability in these parameters as well as their interactions as a function of management practices under different climatic and soil conditions the two step approach kc x etref is the most commonly used approach to quantify etc globally due to its simplicity the widespread use of this technique in etc determination as well as irrigation management necessitates that local kc values for different cropping systems in various climatic conditions and management practices are developed therefore research efforts in the direction of developing new sets of crop coefficients that account for different management practices e g tillage practices in this research can aid in further improving the applicability of the two step approach for more accurate etc quantification the kc concept can be implemented using two different approaches depending on data availability accuracy desired and application i e single kc and dual kc methods both of which represent the relationship between a crop s evaporative transfers and the reference surface in certain ways the dual kc method kc kcb ke separates total evaporative transfer etc into crop transpiration and soil evaporation process by using two distinct coefficients basal dual crop coefficient kcb and soil water evaporation coefficient ke the kcb is crop specific and represents the ratio of crop evapotranspiration etc to reference evapotranspiration etref under conditions when soil evaporation is minimal but soil water content in the root profile is adequate to sustain crop transpiration at a potential rate whereas the ke is the ratio of soil evaporation to etref which represents evaporation from wet moist soil in contrast the single kc method does not address partitioned etc i e evaporation and transpiration and the difference between a crop and the reference surface is solely expressed using a single coefficient to the best knowledge of the authors any attempt to develop crop coefficients under dt and nt practices or any other contrasting tillage systems has not been reported in the literature with increasing pressure on water resources globally this is especially crucial to achieve more accurate etc quantification and effective within season water management given that tillage practices have been shown to affect field level microclimate which consequently results in altered field level evaporative demand etref as well as crop water use etc which have been presented in detail by irmak et al 2019 consequently these changes would impact plant growth and development as demonstrated by the leaf area index lai data and analyses in irmak et al 2019 resistance of water vapor flow through the soil plant atmosphere continuum and the relative amount of intercepted radiation within the plant canopy all of which affect the relationship between a crop and the reference surface and hence justify the need for tillage practice specific crop coefficients to aid in optimal irrigation management as also discussed in irmak et al 2019 the use of brebs in this research provides a unique opportunity to develop crop coefficients for dt and nt practices at daily time steps aggregated from hourly datasets of etc and etref thus the specific objectives addressed in this research were to i quantify and interpret daily alfalfa and grass reference kc and kcb curves for maize under dt and nt management ii develop functions representing the relationships among daily kc and kcb values to base scales such as days after planting dap and cumulative growing degree days cgdd and iii develop relationships among basal crop coefficients and leaf morphological area as represented by lai the functions of kc and kcb vs dap and cgdd will aid in efficient application of this tillage practice specific crop coefficients in more effective water management strategies hereon we will refer to grass reference single average crop coefficient and grass reference dual basal crop coefficient as kco and kcbo respectively and alfalfa reference single crop coefficient and alfalfa reference dual basal crop coefficient as kcr and kcbr respectively 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and soil and crop management the research utilized field measured data collected in 2011 2012 and 2013 maize growing seasons at two large

properties crop establishment emergence and harvest crop varieties plant populations planting depths fertilizer and pesticide application irrigation followed at each field are provided in irmak et al 2019 and will not be repeated here briefly the general view of the nt and dt research fields that contrast the residue cover between the two fields are presented in picture 1 a nt and 1b dt as mentioned in irmak et al 2019 two similar fields were selected and were in close proximity to each other the selection of the two fields was an extensive process but was also a critical component of this research two fields that had similar topography slope etc same soil characteristics same irrigation system and system capacity same drop nozzles on the pivot same field size 53 6 ha each field same planting direction when necessary the same nitrogen herbicide insecticide fungicide management and the same or very similar other field management practices were selected the farmer cooperators agreed to plant on similar days with the same planting depth same maize hybrids table 1 same planting population density table 1 and also agreed to use the same planter to plant both dt and nt research fields in some cases the dt field had been disk tilled twice a year once in fall after harvest and once in spring before planting for 17 years and the nt field had been under nt management for the last 17 years the soils at both sites had very similar physical characteristics as detailed in irmak et al 2019 and were silt loam holdrege fine silty mixed superactive mesic typic argiustolls soil survey staff 2018 with all the conditions and management practices being similar across the two experimental fields it was justifiably assumed that any observed differences in water use dynamics were attributed to differences in field specific tillage practices irrigations for both dt and nt maize fields were managed by the farmer collaborators and the senior author s irmak by utilizing the soil water status measured continuously on an hourly basis at each field using model cs616 volumetric soil water content reflectometers campbell sci inc logan utah installed in the plant row at 0 0 30 0 30 0 60 0 60 0 90 0 90 1 20 and 1 20 1 50 m depths below the soil surface irrigation management was aimed at maintaining optimal non stressed conditions for maize by maintaining the available soil water in the crop root zone between approximately 90 of the field capacity to maintain some soil water storage for any potential precipitation and the maximum allowable depletion of 55 of total available soil water taw irrigation was triggered each time the soil water in the crop root zone was depleted by about 40 45 below the field capacity the long term 1981 2010 mean annual maximum and minimum air temperatures tmax and tmin respectively at holdrege nebraska are 17 8 c and 3 8 c respectively similarly long term mean annual and growing season total precipitation is 631 mm and 457 mm respectively during the experimental period 2011 2013 the mean growing season tmax and tmin were recorded as 27 3 c and 11 1 c respectively while mean growing season precipitation was 319 mm however precipitation was highly variable among the three individual growing seasons 469 202 and 288 mm for the 2011 2012 and 2013 growing seasons respectively and the wettest year 2011 received 132 greater total growing season precipitation than the driest year 2012 the year 2012 was the most severe drought over the central u s plains since data record began in 1895 hoerling et al 2014 the total seasonal irrigation amounts for dt maize were 165 371 and 180 mm for the 2011 2012 and 2013 growing seasons respectively for the nt maize these were 157 361 and 175 mm for the 2011 2012 and 2013 growing seasons respectively for the 2012 growing season the irrigation amounts under both dt and nt were higher more than two folds as compared to 2011 and 2013 growing seasons so as to compensate for the greater water deficit for greater details on weather conditions at the experimental sites during the experimental period refer to irmak et al 2019 2 2 measurement of crop evapotranspiration and growth maize etc during the 2011 2012 and 2013 growing seasons was measured using two identical brebs radiation and energy balance systems rebs inc bellevue wash which were part of the larger nebflux irmak 2010 that were installed in each of the two research fields etc was measured about 1 m above the maximum canopy height in the growing season maximum canopy height was 3 43 m irmak et al 2019 for detailed canopy height data and thus the measurement height did not change during the growing season as it was always sufficiently high 1 m above the canopy height prior to installation of the two brebss in research fields the two identical brebss were run for a period of time in the same location to collect data to ensure that both systems provide exact data under the same conditions so that the measurements in two different fields are not biased effective and robust performance of brebs in successfully quantifying the evaporative fluxes above various vegetation surfaces have been documented lafleur and rouse 1990 ham et al 1991 bausch and bernard 1992 fritschen 1965 irmak and mutiibwa 2008 irmak 2010 crop evapotranspiration etc and various meteorological measurements including

established that using meteorological data measured above a well watered agronomic crop to calculate etref closely resembles etref calculated using a standard weather station data skaggs and irmak 2011 irmak and odhiambo 2009 the sensors and instruments used to measure microclimatic variables and their detailed descriptions are provided in irmak 2010 both single and basal maize alfalfa based crop coefficients kcr and kcbr unitless and grass based crop coefficients kco and kcbo unitless were derived from measured etc mm d 1 and etref mm d 1 on a daily basis and crop coefficient curves were developed to analyze the seasonal pattern of crop coefficients both grass and alfalfa have been used as standard reference surfaces to compute etc ideally usage of eto or etr should result in similar etc values no consensus exists on the choice of a reference surface for a certain region however climate or aridity of a region is a contributor to this choice for example alfalfa reference may be more suitable to semiarid or arid regions because alfalfa is capable of transpiring at potential rates even under advective environments also due to its vigorous and deeper root structure alfalfa is less likely to suffer water stress as compared with a shallow rooted grass on the other hand in humid and subtropical regions where alfalfa is not commonly grown the grass reference may be preferable crop coefficients kc are empirically defined as ratios of etc to etref eto or etr as 2 k c e t c e t r e f where kc kco or kcr is the dimensionless crop coefficient for a particular crop at a given growth stage soil water status and climatic condition and etc is the crop evapotranspiration the kc value in eq 2 includes effects of evaporation from both plant and soil surfaces and thus is influenced by the available soil water within the plant root zone and the wetness of the exposed soil surface in addition to single kc values basal crop coefficients kcb were also developed to represent the ratio of etc to etref in those conditions when the soil surface layer is dry so that evaporation of water from the soil surface is minimal yet the average soil water content in the root zone is adequate to sustain crop transpiration at a potential rate approximate kcb values were derived by removing the etc and etref data for the days when wetting events i e precipitation and irrigation occurred and for the two or three days after the wetting event irmak et al 2015 this procedure yet simple is effective in removing days with conditions conducive for evaporation to occur and the resulting data represents only basal evapotranspiration under non water limiting conditions the seasonal distribution of daily crop coefficients both single and basal was modeled using two base scales namely dap and cgdd the gdd concept quantitatively describes accumulation of daily air temperatures between certain growth limiting high and low temperatures and is commonly expressed as 3 gdd i 1 n t max t min 2 t base where tmax is the maximum air temperature tmin is the minimum air temperature tbase is the base temperature threshold and n is the number of days the base temperature for calculating gdd is the minimum threshold temperature below which plant growth ceases in this research maximum and minimum temperature thresholds of 30 c and 10 c respectively were chosen for maize djaman and irmak 2012b kukal and irmak 2018 all temperature values exceeding the upper threshold value were reduced to 30 c and values below 10 c were taken as 10 c air temperature data from a weather

analyses that were used to develop the crop coefficients for all three growing seasons have been presented in detail in irmak et al 2019 this section presents the experimentally derived daily single average crop coefficients for maize under dt and nt practices and their seasonal distribution as a function of dap and cgdd alfalfa reference kcr and grass reference kco crop coefficients were plotted with respect to dap for three individual growing seasons and for all growing seasons combined pooled data as presented in figs 1 and 2 respectively for the dt maize daily kcr ranged from 0 05 to 1 59 in 2011 from 0 06 to 1 41 in 2012 and from 0 04 to 1 56 in 2013 whereas for nt maize it ranged from 0 07 to 1 56 in 2011 from 0 07 to 1 53 in 2012 and from 0 01 to 1 54 in 2013 similarly for dt maize daily kco ranged from 0 07 to 1 75 in 2011 from 0 10 to 1 60 in 2012 and from 0 05 to 1 70 in 2013 whereas for nt maize it varied from 0 10 to 1 79 in 2011 from 0 10 to 1 79 in 2012 and from 0 10 to 1 76 in 2013 growing season across both the tillage practices and three growing seasons the daily kcr and kco data exhibited a typical kc curve that progressively increased from around 20 dap to around 100 dap and then gradually decreased thereafter towards the end of the growing season due to decrease in the transpiration component of etc owing to leaf aging and senescence at the start of the growing season i e between 0 and 40 dap some kcr and kco values were greater than what is expected for the initial growth period 0 10 0 15 this was particularly visible in 2011 although similar behavior was observed in 2012 and 2013 for both the fields and can be clearly observed in pooled kc data figs 1d 2 d these high values were attributed to wet soil surface conditions because of precipitation events resulting in greater evaporation rates from the soil surface than what would have occurred in the absence of rain it is worth to note that these higher kcr and kco values are greater for the dt maize than for nt maize this can be explained by the lower evaporation rates from the nt field than the dt field due to surface cover and no soil disturbance which translates to higher kc magnitudes for dt maize during the initial growth period gardner 1983 stated that surface soil treatments cause a decrease in either the initial constant rate evaporation or the rate of water movement to the soil surface thus the crop residue in nt maize due to the mulching effect affects the energy supply and affects evaporation while the improved structure from absence of tillage practices can have a longer lasting effect gardner 1983 the kcr and kco values increased as the crop developed and reached relatively constant magnitudes which coincided with complete canopy cover the timing of complete canopy cover indicated by maximum kc values was earlier in 2012 than in 2011 and 2013 due to greater heat accumulation from higher air temperatures in a given time which led to faster growth and development in 2012 until this period the fitted curve for dt maize always represented greater magnitudes than that of nt maize for the reasons explained above also it was observed that the peak constant kcr and kco values in nt maize were attained later than dt maize in all three years this is because of the higher kcr and kco values for nt maize obtained around mid august to mid september due to higher etc in nt maize than dt maize for the same reason the average mid season kcr and kco values from the fitted curves were also higher in nt maize than in dt maize for 2011 and 2013 but similar for 2012 in 2011 the kc values for the nt maize around 90 dap fig 1a were exceptionally lower than the observed kc values within the same crop developmental phase due to a hailstorm event which slightly impacted the etc of the nt maize in addition to dap the daily kcr and kco were also plotted against cgdd to realize the impact of heat accumulation on timing and magnitudes of kc values figs 3 and 4 it was found that the r2 value which evaluates the goodness of fit of kc vs base scale either dap or cgdd increased when cgdd was used as the base scale than when dap was used overall both the kcr vs cgdd and kco vs cgdd curves demonstrated a fit that was better than kcr vs dap and kco vs dap by around 14 the improvement in fit was observed in all growing seasons and under both tillage practices except for nt maize in 2011 when the inconsistent kc values near tasseling reduced the r2 in 2011 specifically the improvement in r2 when using cgdd as a base scale ranged from 10 to 26 across growing seasons and the two fields this implies that cgdd demonstrates a better explanation of the seasonal variation occurring in kc values because it removes the effect of variable heat accumulation among days across different years and implicitly accounts for some of the plant physiological and development characteristics for example another interesting observation is that the improvement in r2 value was the highest for the year 2012 closely followed by 2013 because of relatively higher heat accumulation in a given number of days in 2012 and 2013 dap was not capable of explaining the seasonal variation in kc and hence cgdd is a better explanatory factor than dap although cgdd does not account for all kc influencing factors it still provides a means of reducing inter annual differences arising from climatic conditions hence improving the transferability of kc values between different climate regions kukal and irmak 2016 2018 and across growing seasons overall our data and observations revealed that tillage management has three distinct effects on the measured single crop coefficients a lower nt kc values during pre anthesis b higher nt kc values during post anthesis and c later occurrence of maximum kc phase around anthesis in nt maize these differences primarily stem from the demonstrated growth stage specific differences in water use among dt and nt maize irmak et al 2019 reported that dt maize had higher etc prior to anthesis due to higher evaporation prior to canopy closure in dt maize while nt maize evapotranspired more post anthesis which translates into similar patterns in difference in dt and nt kc curves another factor that contributed to these differences is the earlier senescence observed in dt maize due to lower soil moisture storage than nt maize which is responsible for the apparent shifting of the nt kc curves to the right direction of maturity all the above discussed results illustrate that kc values are strongly dependent on crop growth and development and management practices such as tillage inter annual differences in local climatic conditions and farming practices can result in variability in kc for the same growth and development stage across years sammis et al 1985 reported that gdd or cgdd cannot solely account for the total variability in crop development and kc between years nevertheless they suggest that gdd is less variable than julian days as a base scale monthly averaged single crop coefficients for the dt maize and nt maize for the three growing seasons are listed in table 2 for inter comparison the numbers of observations used to compute monthly average kc were total number of days in the respective month while for kcb they were number of days when surface conditions were nearly dry or dry respectively as was observed from daily progression of kc values monthly analysis also signifies the differences in dt and nt maize kc for the first three months of maize growth may june and july dt maize kc was greater than nt maize kc while the opposite was true for the last two months august september and finally dt maize kc was again greater for october specifically these differences among dt and nt kc averaged kcr and kco are substantial in may 56 june 29 september 47 and october 41 and relatively small in mid season i e july 1 and august 8 moreover we found that the maximum kc value for dt maize occurred in july whereas for nt maize it occurred in august the polynomial functions that relate kco and kcr to dap and cgdd are provided in the appendix along with the r2 value derived from the measured data for each growing season and pooled and tillage practice since cgdd represents the heat energy received by the plant canopy over a period of time irmak et al 2013 kc curves developed for a given location using cgdd should be applicable to locations with different climatic conditions sammis et al 1985 3 2 basal dual crop coefficients since single crop coefficients kcr kco are calculated using data which include precipitation and irrigation events these derived crop coefficient values are impacted by the precipitation and irrigation frequency and amount during the crop growing season due to these factors these kc values would be impacted considerably by site specific surface conditions of a given field and therefore would be relatively less transferrable and would also be subject to change in different precipitation regimes either at different locations or in a different year in the same location which is not ideal especially from a transferability perspective hence the influence of precipitation needs to be minimized to obtain kc values that are fairly independent of precipitation variations and soil surface moisture conditions to accomplish this we quantified basal crop coefficients and adjusted them for soil surface wetness when the single kcr and kco values were adjusted to obtain basal crop coefficients kcbr and kcbo the fluctuations in kc values which arose from soil evaporation from precipitation were minimized figs 5 8 present alfalfa reference kcbr and grass reference kcbo basal crop coefficient curves developed by fitting third order polynomial regression functions to the time distribution dap and cgdd distribution of the measured kcbr and kcbo data respectively for the dt maize daily kcbr ranged from 0 004 to 1 59 in 2011 from 0 04 to 1 38 in 2012 and from 0 02 to 1 28 in 2013 whereas for the nt maize it varied from 0 02 to 1 56 in 2011 from 0 03 to 1 44 in 2012 and from 0 003 to 1 53 in 2013 similarly the daily kcbo for dt maize ranged from 0 03 to 1 78 in 2011 from 0 02 to 1 55 in 2012 and from 0 02 to 1 49 in 2013 whereas for nt maize it varied from 0 01 to 1 77 in 2011 from 0 11 to 1 70 in 2012 and from 0 02 to 1 74 in 2013 the kcbr and kcbo data also exhibited a typical bell shaped distribution and seasonal pattern which was in agreement to the distribution of kcr and kco values although the day to day variation in kcb was significantly lower this is supported by the significant increase observed in r2 values observed in kcb distribution curves than that in kc distribution curves overall r2 of the kcb vs cgdd relationship was 42 higher than that of kc vs cgdd relationships when averaged across all growing seasons reference surfaces and tillage practices however this improvement in r2 varied among growing seasons and tillage practice firstly the r2 value improved by 68 in dt maize kcb curves than kc curves while it only improved by 16 in nt maize which is explained by the observation of lower evaporation in nt maize than dt maize irmak et al 2019 due to which the kcb model had lesser evaporation events to adjust for in nt maize secondly the r2 improvement was 68 and 65 in 2011 and 2013 respectively while it was only 13 in 2012 which is explained by lower precipitation in 2012 than the other growing seasons due to which the kcb model had lesser precipitation events to adjust for in 2012 as observed from comparing kc and kcb curves the unusually high kc values that resulted from soil evaporation were adjusted to lower magnitudes in kcb curves this adjustment of kcb values from kc lead to 70 reduction in kcb values than their kc counterparts when averaged across the growing season and the two reference surfaces grass and alfalfa however this reduction varied during the crop growing season the magnitude of this reduction was higher in the early and late growing seasons and minimal in the mid season 160 53 5 6 23 and 175 in may june july august september and october respectively although kcb represents the crop water use per unit etref after correcting for the evaporative effects from irrigation and precipitation the influence of surface wetting might not be completely eliminated the magnitudes of kcb initially in the growing season especially in 2011 and 2012 were observed to still be slightly higher than what crop transpiration would result in although they are substantially lower than their kc counterparts the monthly averaged basal crop coefficients for the dt maize and nt maize for the three growing seasons and pooled data are listed in table 2 for inter comparison dt maize showed higher kcb values than those for nt maize for may and june and the opposite was true for july august september and october these differences in dt and nt maize kcb averaged kcbo and kcbr were 73 33 1 14 57 and 27 for may june july august september and october respectively which is in agreement to the trend observed in dt and nt maize kc differences i e greater in early and late season and lower in mid season moreover the differences that were found among dt and nt kc values were true for kcb values among the two tillage systems as well i e lower and higher nt kcb values during pre and post anthesis respectively and later occurrence of maximum kcb values since dt and nt maize have been shown to have differences in their kcb even after adjusting for evaporation and precipitation it implies that the two tillage practices differ in their transpiration or basal evapotranspiration processes and that evaporation is not the only process that is impacted by tillage practice the functions for kcb both kcbr and kcbo vs dap and kcb both kcbr and kcbo vs cgdd for the three years as well as for pooled data are presented in the appendix the r2 values from the development of these functions are also provided generally functions developed form pooled data across three growing seasons should be the most transferrable given their development using extensive data from three contrasting growing seasons as with the kc functions especially cgdd based functions these can be applicable to other locations these functions are intended to aid in daily computation of single and basal crop coefficients and can be sought for a range of practical applications such as in season irrigation management estimation of maize water use under dt and nt tillage practices and for further use in water balance analyses and other analyses involving water resource demand and availability as well as projections moreover these empirical functions provide a more realistic and practical approach for irrigation management as well studying crop water use patterns per unit etref in comparison to their conventional counterparts such as stage based crop coefficients in fao 56 allen et al 1998 this is due to the fact that differential crop growth and development patterns in dt and nt maize irmak et al 2019 exemplify that the lengths of the crop growth stages as stated in fao 56 may not be necessarily constant and are subject to change with management tillage djaman and irmak 2012b stated that initial midseason and late season kc values as well as the lengths of these stages can be subject to change as a result of differences in hybrid characteristics planting population density and tillage practices demonstrated in this research moreover for precision management of irrigation crop coefficients for a given stage cannot be assumed to be constant or incremented linearly as proposed by fao 56 payero and irmak 2011 recorded significant variability in the daily kc values derived from eddy covariance measured etc for maize in north platte nebraska making it challenging to fit an average kc curve to the observed data accounting for this within growth stage variability is not possible by the use of fao 56 growth stage specific kc and rather has to be accounted for using an empirical function fit through high frequency crop coefficient data as in this research thus the empirical functions proposed here appendix distinguish crop coefficients for nt and dt maize and overcome the challenges associated with the practical application of a simplistic four growth stage based crop coefficient approach 3 3 relationship between crop coefficient and leaf area index lai we also studied the relationships between kcb values and leaf area index lai of nt and dt maize to accomplish this we chose the days when lai was measured in the two fields and sampled kcb values for these specific days figs 9 and 10 present kcbr vs lai and kcbo vs lai respectively for dt and nt maize during the three individual growing seasons and for the pooled data since kcb represents the transpiration component of etc it is expected that ideally theoretically kcb would exhibit a linear relationship with lai until full canopy cover is reached as greater the area of leaf tissue in a given plant the greater the transpiration of the plant overall the relationship between kcbo and kcbr vs lai varied between the tillage practice but also exhibited inter annual variation within the tillage practice for example for the kcbr values for dt the r2 values were 0 52 0 57 and 0 68 for 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively whereas the kcbr values for the nt were 0 63 0 56 and 0 54 for the same years respectively while these r2 values are reasonable the pooled data kcbr relationships with lai had much lower r2 values for both dt 0 37 and nt 0 35 fig 9 due to inter annual variation in the relationships for the individual growing seasons the relationships between kcbo and lai also had inter annual variation for both tillage practices although with higher r2 values than kcbr vs lai fig 10 indicating that kcbo might be a better more sensitive variable that captures the variability in the kcb vs lai relationship in most cases the relationship between kcbr and kcbo vs lai was stronger for dt than nt irmak et al 2019 developed similar relationships but with maize etc vs lai and found that while those relationships were also linear their r2 was relatively lower as compared to the kcb vs lai relationships developed in this research this is because the etc includes evaporation which is non beneficial water loss and does not contribute towards carbon uptake via stomatal processes and hence resulting in weaker relationship between crop growth lai and etc in contrast developing kcb values results in removal of effect of evaporation a stronger relationship between lai and kcb is anticipated other research trout and dejonge 2018 borges et al 2015 has also found linear relationships among crop kcb and lai or ground cover fraction until full canopy cover in contrast our data do not seem to approach a diminishing return ceiling yielding a curvilinear fit at high lai values implying that the plants transpiration ability was not constrained and thus was a direct function of the leaf assimilatory tissue and is an implication of the optimum irrigation management in the two fields 4 summary and conclusions the impact of adoption of contrasting tillage practices on maize water use growth characteristics and field microclimate irmak et al 2019 warrant that dt and nt maize irrigation management be tillage practice specific requiring development of tools and information to do so efficiently thus we present quantification analyses and interpretation of dt and nt maize crop coefficients both single average and dual basal under grass and alfalfa reference surfaces major differences existed in dt and nt maize kc a lower nt kc values during pre anthesis b higher nt kc values during post anthesis and c later occurrence of maximum kc phase around anthesis difference in dt and nt maize kc were substantial in may 56 june 29 september 47 and october 41 and relatively small in mid season i e july 1 and august 8 kc in early and late season were found to be subject to intermittent high values especially in dt maize due to higher evaporation rates during and after precipitation events relative to nt maize cgdd was found to be a better predictor of kc variability than dap the kcb vs cgdd relationship had 42 higher r2 than kc vs cgdd relationship the adjustment for evaporation in kcb development caused 70 reduction in kcb values than their kc counterparts especially in the early and late growing seasons when kcb was considered dt maize had higher kcb than nt maize for may and june while the opposite was true for july august september and october linear kcb vs lai relationships were observed with lai explaining moderate degree of variability in kcb to facilitate the application of our findings from a practical management perspective we developed polynomial functions appendix relating kco kcr kcbo kcbr to two types of base scales i e dap and cgdd to the best of our knowledge this research is the first one to study and quantify the impact of tillage practices on crop coefficients experimentally on carefully managed commercial production fields using sophisticated flux measurement technique for characterization of energy balance over vegetative surfaces the polynomial functions proposed here can be used to obtain reasonable estimates of maize etc under both dt and nt practices in environments similar to the research area or others within transferable limits of cgdd or dap this research established the need of differential irrigation management for dt and nt maize production and proposed transferrable tools to aid in accurate etc estimation to optimize irrigation management and crop productivity in these systems declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest acknowledgments this

10854,cabbage brassica oleracea saltbush atriplex nummularia and japanese millet echinochloa esculenta were grown in recirculating hydroponic systems to determine their capacity to remove sodium from brewery effluent be each treatment was irrigated with post anaerobically digested effluent where the ph was either adjusted to 6 5 or unadjusted the irrigation solutions from the hydroponic systems planted with saltbush had the lowest concentration of sodium 708 54 6 18 mg l whereas the systems planted with millet and cabbage had a similar sodium concentration 729 01 5 17 mg l the ph adjustment of be significantly decreased the sodium leaf content of cabbages saltbush and millet plants by an average of 633 33 mg kg this could have been due to two reasons firstly the addition of h would decrease the ratio of na positively charged ions thus decreasing the sodium electrochemical gradient between the root plasma and rhizosphere and secondly the addition of h may enhance sodium efflux halophytes such as saltbush have been shown to assimilate sodium from soil water complexes saltbush planted hydroponic systems resulted in the lowest increase in effluent sodium concentration which corresponded to saltbush leaf tissue having the highest sodium concentration however the sodium concentration in all hydroponic systems increased during each cycle the rate of sodium assimilation into the halophyte plant tissue was slower than the concentrating effect caused by evapotranspiration which accounted for the increase in sodium in all the treatments hydroponic systems which aim to remove sodium from effluent need to be designed to minimize evaporation keywords phytoremediation halophytes hydroponics wastewater 1 introduction brewery effluent be that has undergone anaerobic digestion ad can successfully be used as a water source in crop production however there are still uncertainties regarding how suitable it is for this purpose power and jones 2016 taylor et al 2018 taylor et al 2018 found that after prolonged irrigation with be the sodium levels built up in the soil and negatively affected crop growth and soil structure the sodium concentration of be 516 786 mg l is thus a constraint when it is used in downstream agriculture and technologies that enable the removal of sodium from be need to be identified a preliminary study grew cabbages brassica oleracea cv star 3301 in recirculating hydroponic systems and compared their treatment efficiencies to convention activated sludge as systems taylor 2015 results indicated that hydroponic production can treat brewery effluent to a similar standard to as systems taylor 2015 however the conductivity and high alkalinity of post anaerobically digested post ad be resulted in decreased yields of cabbages it was therefore suggested that crops need to be identified that grow well in be and have the potential to remove sodium from the effluent if a hydroponic production system is able to reduce the sodium concentration in be it will render the effluent more suitable for the irrigation of crops in the soil previous from this study the authors are not aware literature that investigates the use of a hydroponic crop production system to remove sodium from be there are also no published studies that determine the influence of ph on the sodium removal rates of crops grown in effluent treatment systems however since ph influences nutrient removal rates and biomass production of crops grown in hydroponic systems that use treated effluent as a nutrient source power and jones 2016 it stands to reason that ph could potentially influence sodium removal rates in similar systems but this remains to be tested it is important that research is done in this field as the major limitation for using effluents for irrigated crop production is the sodium concentration qadir et al 2003 muyen et al 2011 most studies have found that effluent irrigation results in a build up of sodium in the soil followed by a deterioration in the soils physical profile and reduced crop yields qadir et al 2003 muyen et al 2011 dakoure et al 2013 certain crop species are more salt tolerant than others and some have been shown to aid in the removal of sodium from the soil qadir et al 2001 2005 halophytes are plants that have adapted to grow and reproduce in saline and sodic environments flowers and colmer 2008 many species of halophytes have been used in crop production systems using saline or sodic irrigation waters miyamoto et al 1996 brown et al 1999 glenn et al 1999 qadir et al 2005 saltbush atriplex nummularia has been used numerously in saline water irrigation systems it can also be used as an animal fodder due to its high protein content brown et al 1999 glenn et al 1999 in general the most suitable crops to be used in saline water irrigation have a greater biomass production together with the ability to tolerate soil and irrigation water salinity and tolerance of periodic inundation qadir et al 2001 some of the plant species that have been shown to aid in the removal of sodium from soils are japanese millet echinochloa esculenta amaranth amaranthus cruentus lucerne medicago sativa kallar grass leptochloa fusca and saltbush atriplex nummularia gritsenko and gritsenko 1999 oster 1994 salt bush was identified as one of the test crops due to its halophytic properties and use as animal fodder lucerne and millet are moderately tolerant to salinity and have the potential to be used as crops in agricultural systems where irrigation with slightly saline water is an option ilyas et al 1993 gritsenko and gritsenko 1999 qadir et al 2003 qadir and oster 2004 millet and lucerne are both popular forage crops for livestock farming and could potentially remove sodium from be crops species that can be used to remove nutrients and sodium from be and the influence of ph on sodium removal rate need to be identified this could lead to the use hydroponic systems capable of treating be treatment to a similar standard as an as system and render the effluent suitable for re use in agriculture or non production activities at the brewery 2 aims and objectives the aim of this study was to determine the sodium removal rate of various plant species grown on be the influence of ph on their removal rate and the effect of alkalinity and ph on crop growth and plant health in a hydroponic production system cabbage saltbush and millet plants were grown in a recirculating hydroponic system fed with ph adjusted or ph unadjusted post ad be the objectives of this experiment were 1 to compare the growth health and chemical composition of cabbage saltbush and millet plants grown in a hydroponic system fed with be with and without ph adjustment and 2 to compare the effect of ph on the nutrient sodium and chloride removal rates of cabbage saltbush and millet from post ad be grown in a hydroponic production system 3 material and methods 3 1 experimental species cabbage brassica oleracea cv star 3301 saltbush atriplex nummularia and japanese millet echinochloa esculenta were grown in recirculating hydroponic systems to observe their capacity to remove sodium from be sixty cabbage seedlings were purchased from a commercial nursery moorland seedlings pty ltd humansdorp sixty saltbush seedlings were purchased from a commercial nursery mountain herb estate pty ltd pretoria japanese millet seeds were obtained from a seed supplier agricol pty ltd port elizabeth and were planted in polystyrene planter trays filled with a mixture of 40 soil and 60 compost these seeds were germinated and allowed to grow for three weeks prior to the start of the experiment 3 2 treatments the four crop treatments used in this experiment were cabbage millet saltbush and no crop the no crop treatment served as the control each crop treatment was irrigated with post ad effluent where the ph was either adjusted to 6 5 with 98 sulphuric acid protea chemicals pty ltd south africa or left unadjusted this resulted in eight experimental treatments being tested table 1 sulphuric acid was used to adjust ph because when compared to nitric phosphoric and hydrochloric acid it resulted in the lowest increase in effluent conductivity 3 3 experimental system the experiment was carried out in 24 identical recirculating hydroponic growing systems each containing five plants fig 1 each treatment was replicated three times with a replicate consisting of an entire hydroponic system the system was a variation of the dutch bucket hydroponic system roberto 2005 each channel was made from a 1500 mm long 160 mm diameter polyvinylchloride pvc pipe with five 110 mm holes drilled in the top to accommodate the pots power and jones 2016 each 120 mm pot was filled with washed 13 mm gravel which served as a physical support but provided no nutritional benefit to the plants power and jones 2016 below each channel the nutrient solution was stored in a 25 l plastic bucket and a 18 w submersible pump resun model sp 2500 china fed the nutrient solution through a 15 mm irrigation line along the length of the channel a 5 mm tube fitted with a micro valve connected the 15 mm main line to each of the gravel filled pots power and jones 2016 the micro value was used to ensure even distribution of nutrient solution to each pot power and jones 2016 a 50 mm submerged root zone was kept in the channel and the nutrient solution flowed out the channel via a 20 mm outlet pipe into the plastic bucket power and jones 2016 this created a closed recirculating system fig 1 power and jones 2016 at the start of the trial one plant was planted in each pot filled with gravel brewery effluent in each hydroponic system was replaced every seven days or when the water level in the reservoir was less than 25 full whichever came first power and jones 2016 3 4 data collection water quality parameters of effluent were recorded before being placed in

discussion the ph of the hydroponic systems was not stable the ph increased from about 8 4 to more than ph 9 0 in the unadjusted be treatments over the course of a single replacement cycle the ph adjusted treatments all started at 6 5 but this increased to above ph 8 0 before the end of the replacement cycle under seven days the high alkalinity of be was able to resist the change in ph prior to ad sodium hydroxide is added to the be to neutralise the ph and during ad carbonate and bicarbonate alkalinity is generated through the production of carbon dioxide van rensburg et al 2003 when be is aerated or exposed to the atmosphere such as in hydroponic systems the volatile carbon dioxide expressed as carbonic acid is gassed off whereas the carbonate alkalinity is more stable and remains in the water musvoto et al 2000 van rensburg et al 2003 this results in a decrease in acidity of be and an increase in ph musvoto et al 2000 van rensburg et al 2003 the high alkalinity of be is a major issue because it is difficult to keep be at a constant ph without continuously adding acid in order to optimise the availability of nutrients to plants when it is used as a hydroponic nutrient source the continual addition of acid would increase the conductivity of be and would put more osmotic stress on the plants in hydroponic systems one of the objective of this experiment was to determine how much sodium could be removed from be by various crops the sodium concentration increased in all hydroponic systems as the time that the plants were exposed to the solution increased this increase in sodium concentration with time was probably due to a process called evapotranspiration where salt concentration increases due to the removal of water lymbery et al 2006 muyen et al 2011 rozema 2014 the irrigation solutions from the hydroponic systems planted with saltbush had the lowest concentration of sodium whereas the systems planted with millet and cabbage had similar sodium concentration to the hydroponic systems with no crops halophytes such as saltbush have been shown to assimilate sodium from soil water complexes miyamoto et al 1996 brown et al 1999 glenn et al 1999 however this rate of sodium assimilation was slower than the concentrating effect caused by evapotranspiration which accounted for the increase in sodium in all the treatments rozema 2014 future hydroponic systems used to treat brewery effluent should be designed in such a way to minimise evaporation and thus the increase in the sodium concentration of the treated effluent the level of sodium found in be has been identified as a major restriction to the widespread use of be as a water and nutrient source in irrigated crop production salinity poses two major threats to plants osmotic stress due to the relatively high solute concentrations irrigation waters and ion specific stresses resulting from the k na ratios and na concentrations that are harmful to plants blumwald et al 2000 the sodium leaf concentration was lower in millet saltbush and cabbage plants grown in ph adjusted be systems when compared to ph unadjusted be systems the influx of na into root cells is passive while the efflux of na out of the root cells in active blumwald et al 2000 blumwald 2000 apse and blumwald 2007 an increase in the extracellular na concentration will cause an increased electrochemical gradient that will favour the movement of na into the root cell blumwald et al 2000 sodium enters the cell through k carriers in the membrane because na and k ions have similar hydraulic radii blumwald et al 2000 the efflux of na is an active process as they have to be transported against their electrochemical gradient cramer et al 1985 blumwald et al 2000 sodium extrusion is mediated by the plasma membranes h atpase which pump out h generating an electrochemical gradient against the natural h gradient blumwald et al 2000 this allows the na h antiporters to couple the movement of h into the cell with the extrusion of na hassidim et al 1990 blumwald et al 2000 the increase in extracellular h has been found to aid in the efflux of sodium through the plasma membrane and to enhance the salt tolerance of cells nass et al 1997 blumwald et al 2000 therefore the ph adjustment of be may have enhanced the efflux of na in the root cells thus decreasing the level of na in the plant tissue future research should investigate the influence of irrigation water ph on the na influx and efflux of plants and the salt tolerance of plants under acidic and alkaline conditions the growth of plants in hydroponic systems should be accompanied by a decrease in the nutrient concentration of the irrigation solutions phosphorous and tin concentrations decreased over time in all hydroponic systems at the end of each cycle cabbage saltbush and millet ph adjusted treatments had a lower tin and p concentrations than the no crop cabbage and millet ph unadjusted hydroponic systems nitrogen and p are macronutrients needed by plants to support growth lucas and davis 1961 epstein and bloom 2005 millet grown on ph unadjusted be hardly grew and did not remove more nutrients than the hydroponic systems with no crops this emphasises the importance of ph when using be as a hydroponic irrigation source the ph of a hydroponic solution can influence the growth and health of plants the cci readings of cabbage saltbush and millet leaves were all higher when grown in the ph adjusted hydroponic systems millet plants grown in ph unadjusted be hydroponic systems did not gain biomass chlorophyll concentration index is a direct measurement of the photosynthetic potential of a leaf and can be indirectly related to the nitrogen nutrient status of a leaf filella et al 1995 moran et al 2000 chlorophyll concentration index is also closely related to plant stress and age peñuelas and filella 1998 merzlyak et al 1999 the nitrogen concentration of cabbage millet and saltbush plants was higher in ph adjusted be systems which can be linked to the higher cci of their leaves as most leaf nitrogen is incorporated into chlorophyll filella et al 1995 moran et al 2000 the ph adjustment increased the cci of millet and saltbush plants which interm means they were able to grow faster the re use of brewery effluent for downstream use in irrigation is limited by its conductivity and sodium concentration dakoure et al 2013 taylor et al 2018 post ad brewery treated in ph adjusted hydroponic systems planted with saltbush had the lowest ec and sodium concentration however this effluent is not ideal for irrigation and can result in deteriorating the soils physical structure and fertility dwaf 1996 oudin et al 1999 qadir and oster 2004 for this effluent to be used for irrigation the following practices should be used cultivation of salt and sodium tolerant crops irrigation methods and soil structure should allow adequate leaching of sodium and the integrated use with water contain a sodium concentration below 70 mg l dwaf 1996 qadir and oster 2004 the high sodium and alkalinity of be is the main limitation when using be in hydroponic production systems there are two contributors to the sodium content of be sodium hydroxide is used in the bottle washing process and it is added to the incoming effluent before it goes through ad an opportunity exists to decrease the reliance on the addition of sodium hydroxide during ad if post ad effluent is exposed to atmospheric conditions it will lose its carbonic acidity while maintaining its alkalinity musvoto et al 2000 power 2014 a fraction of this degassed post ad effluent can then be recycled back with incoming effluent going into the digester which will stabilise the ph of the digester power 2014 this will increase the influent alkalinity and potentially reduce the amount of sodium hydroxide added during ad this in turn will decrease the sodium concentration of the be making it more suitable for downstream use in irrigation 6 conclusion the ph adjustment of post ad be had a major influence on the growth and chemical composition of plants grown in hydroponic systems the biomass increases of

10854,cabbage brassica oleracea saltbush atriplex nummularia and japanese millet echinochloa esculenta were grown in recirculating hydroponic systems to determine their capacity to remove sodium from brewery effluent be each treatment was irrigated with post anaerobically digested effluent where the ph was either adjusted to 6 5 or unadjusted the irrigation solutions from the hydroponic systems planted with saltbush had the lowest concentration of sodium 708 54 6 18 mg l whereas the systems planted with millet and cabbage had a similar sodium concentration 729 01 5 17 mg l the ph adjustment of be significantly decreased the sodium leaf content of cabbages saltbush and millet plants by an average of 633 33 mg kg this could have been due to two reasons firstly the addition of h would decrease the ratio of na positively charged ions thus decreasing the sodium electrochemical gradient between the root plasma and rhizosphere and secondly the addition of h may enhance sodium efflux halophytes such as saltbush have been shown to assimilate sodium from soil water complexes saltbush planted hydroponic systems resulted in the lowest increase in effluent sodium concentration which corresponded to saltbush leaf tissue having the highest sodium concentration however the sodium concentration in all hydroponic systems increased during each cycle the rate of sodium assimilation into the halophyte plant tissue was slower than the concentrating effect caused by evapotranspiration which accounted for the increase in sodium in all the treatments hydroponic systems which aim to remove sodium from effluent need to be designed to minimize evaporation keywords phytoremediation halophytes hydroponics wastewater 1 introduction brewery effluent be that has undergone anaerobic digestion ad can successfully be used as a water source in crop production however there are still uncertainties regarding how suitable it is for this purpose power and jones 2016 taylor et al 2018 taylor et al 2018 found that after prolonged irrigation with be the sodium levels built up in the soil and negatively affected crop growth and soil structure the sodium concentration of be 516 786 mg l is thus a constraint when it is used in downstream agriculture and technologies that enable the removal of sodium from be need to be identified a preliminary study grew cabbages brassica oleracea cv star 3301 in recirculating hydroponic systems and compared their treatment efficiencies to convention activated sludge as systems taylor 2015 results indicated that hydroponic production can treat brewery effluent to a similar standard to as systems taylor 2015 however the conductivity and high alkalinity of post anaerobically digested post ad be resulted in decreased yields of cabbages it was therefore suggested that crops need to be identified that grow well in be and have the potential to remove sodium from the effluent if a hydroponic production system is able to reduce the sodium concentration in be it will render the effluent more suitable for the irrigation of crops in the soil previous from this study the authors are not aware literature that investigates the use of a hydroponic crop production system to remove sodium from be there are also no published studies that determine the influence of ph on the sodium removal rates of crops grown in effluent treatment systems however since ph influences nutrient removal rates and biomass production of crops grown in hydroponic systems that use treated effluent as a nutrient source power and jones 2016 it stands to reason that ph could potentially influence sodium removal rates in similar systems but this remains to be tested it is important that research is done in this field as the major limitation for using effluents for irrigated crop production is the sodium concentration qadir et al 2003 muyen et al 2011 most studies have found that effluent irrigation results in a build up of sodium in the soil followed by a deterioration in the soils physical profile and reduced crop yields qadir et al 2003 muyen et al 2011 dakoure et al 2013 certain crop species are more salt tolerant than others and some have been shown to aid in the removal of sodium from the soil qadir et al 2001 2005 halophytes are plants that have adapted to grow and reproduce in saline and sodic environments flowers and colmer 2008 many species of halophytes have been used in crop production systems using saline or sodic irrigation waters miyamoto et al 1996 brown et al 1999 glenn et al 1999 qadir et al 2005 saltbush atriplex nummularia has been used numerously in saline water irrigation systems it can also be used as an animal fodder due to its high protein content brown et al 1999 glenn et al 1999 in general the most suitable crops to be used in saline water irrigation have a greater biomass production together with the ability to tolerate soil and irrigation water salinity and tolerance of periodic inundation qadir et al 2001 some of the plant species that have been shown to aid in the removal of sodium from soils are japanese millet echinochloa esculenta amaranth amaranthus cruentus lucerne medicago sativa kallar grass leptochloa fusca and saltbush atriplex nummularia gritsenko and gritsenko 1999 oster 1994 salt bush was identified as one of the test crops due to its halophytic properties and use as animal fodder lucerne and millet are moderately tolerant to salinity and have the potential to be used as crops in agricultural systems where irrigation with slightly saline water is an option ilyas et al 1993 gritsenko and gritsenko 1999 qadir et al 2003 qadir and oster 2004 millet and lucerne are both popular forage crops for livestock farming and could potentially remove sodium from be crops species that can be used to remove nutrients and sodium from be and the influence of ph on sodium removal rate need to be identified this could lead to the use hydroponic systems capable of treating be treatment to a similar standard as an as system and render the effluent suitable for re use in agriculture or non production activities at the brewery 2 aims and objectives the aim of this study was to determine the sodium removal rate of various plant species grown on be the influence of ph on their removal rate and the effect of alkalinity and ph on crop growth and plant health in a hydroponic production system cabbage saltbush and millet plants were grown in a recirculating hydroponic system fed with ph adjusted or ph unadjusted post ad be the objectives of this experiment were 1 to compare the growth health and chemical composition of cabbage saltbush and millet plants grown in a hydroponic system fed with be with and without ph adjustment and 2 to compare the effect of ph on the nutrient sodium and chloride removal rates of cabbage saltbush and millet from post ad be grown in a hydroponic production system 3 material and methods 3 1 experimental species cabbage brassica oleracea cv star 3301 saltbush atriplex nummularia and japanese millet echinochloa esculenta were grown in recirculating hydroponic systems to observe their capacity to remove sodium from be sixty cabbage seedlings were purchased from a commercial nursery moorland seedlings pty ltd humansdorp sixty saltbush seedlings were purchased from a commercial nursery mountain herb estate pty ltd pretoria japanese millet seeds were obtained from a seed supplier agricol pty ltd port elizabeth and were planted in polystyrene planter trays filled with a mixture of 40 soil and 60 compost these seeds were germinated and allowed to grow for three weeks prior to the start of the experiment 3 2 treatments the four crop treatments used in this experiment were cabbage millet saltbush and no crop the no crop treatment served as the control each crop treatment was irrigated with post ad effluent where the ph was either adjusted to 6 5 with 98 sulphuric acid protea chemicals pty ltd south africa or left unadjusted this resulted in eight experimental treatments being tested table 1 sulphuric acid was used to adjust ph because when compared to nitric phosphoric and hydrochloric acid it resulted in the lowest increase in effluent conductivity 3 3 experimental system the experiment was carried out in 24 identical recirculating hydroponic growing systems each containing five plants fig 1 each treatment was replicated three times with a replicate consisting of an entire hydroponic system the system was a variation of the dutch bucket hydroponic system roberto 2005 each channel was made from a 1500 mm long 160 mm diameter polyvinylchloride pvc pipe with five 110 mm holes drilled in the top to accommodate the pots power and jones 2016 each 120 mm pot was filled with washed 13 mm gravel which served as a physical support but provided no nutritional benefit to the plants power and jones 2016 below each channel the nutrient solution was stored in a 25 l plastic bucket and a 18 w submersible pump resun model sp 2500 china fed the nutrient solution through a 15 mm irrigation line along the length of the channel a 5 mm tube fitted with a micro valve connected the 15 mm main line to each of the gravel filled pots power and jones 2016 the micro value was used to ensure even distribution of nutrient solution to each pot power and jones 2016 a 50 mm submerged root zone was kept in the channel and the nutrient solution flowed out the channel via a 20 mm outlet pipe into the plastic bucket power and jones 2016 this created a closed recirculating system fig 1 power and jones 2016 at the start of the trial one plant was planted in each pot filled with gravel brewery effluent in each hydroponic system was replaced every seven days

discussion the ph of the hydroponic systems was not stable the ph increased from about 8 4 to more than ph 9 0 in the unadjusted be treatments over the course of a single replacement cycle the ph adjusted treatments all started at 6 5 but this increased to above ph 8 0 before the end of the replacement cycle under seven days the high alkalinity of be was able to resist the change in ph prior to ad sodium hydroxide is added to the be to neutralise the ph and during ad carbonate and bicarbonate alkalinity is generated through the production of carbon dioxide van rensburg et al 2003 when be is aerated or exposed to the atmosphere such as in hydroponic systems the volatile carbon dioxide expressed as carbonic acid is gassed off whereas the carbonate alkalinity is more stable and remains in the water musvoto et al 2000 van rensburg et al 2003 this results in a decrease in acidity of be and an increase in ph musvoto et al 2000 van rensburg et al 2003 the high alkalinity of be is a major issue because it is difficult to keep be at a constant ph without continuously adding acid in order to optimise the availability of nutrients to plants when it is used as a hydroponic nutrient source the continual addition of acid would increase the conductivity of be and would put more osmotic stress on the plants in hydroponic systems one of the objective of this experiment was to determine how much sodium could be removed from be by various crops the sodium concentration increased in all hydroponic systems as the time that the plants were exposed to the solution increased this increase in sodium concentration with time was probably due to a process called evapotranspiration where salt concentration increases due to the removal of water lymbery et al 2006 muyen et al 2011 rozema 2014 the irrigation solutions from the hydroponic systems planted with saltbush had the lowest concentration of sodium whereas the systems planted with millet and cabbage had similar sodium concentration to the hydroponic systems with no crops halophytes such as saltbush have been shown to assimilate sodium from soil water complexes miyamoto et al 1996 brown et al 1999 glenn et al 1999 however this rate of sodium assimilation was slower than the concentrating effect caused by evapotranspiration which accounted for the increase in sodium in all the treatments rozema 2014 future hydroponic systems used to treat brewery effluent should be designed in such a way to minimise evaporation and thus the increase in the sodium concentration of the treated effluent the level of sodium found in be has been identified as a major restriction to the widespread use of be as a water and nutrient source in irrigated crop production salinity poses two major threats to plants osmotic stress due to the relatively high solute concentrations irrigation waters and ion specific stresses resulting from the k na ratios and na concentrations that are harmful to plants blumwald et al 2000 the sodium leaf concentration was lower in millet saltbush and cabbage plants grown in ph adjusted be systems when compared to ph unadjusted be systems the influx of na into root cells is passive while the efflux of na out of the root cells in active blumwald et al 2000 blumwald 2000 apse and blumwald 2007 an increase in the extracellular na concentration will cause an increased electrochemical gradient that will favour the movement of na into the root cell blumwald et al 2000 sodium enters the cell through k carriers in the membrane because na and k ions have similar hydraulic radii blumwald et al 2000 the efflux of na is an active process as they have to be transported against their electrochemical gradient cramer et al 1985 blumwald et al 2000 sodium extrusion is mediated by the plasma membranes h atpase which pump out h generating an electrochemical gradient against the natural h gradient blumwald et al 2000 this allows the na h antiporters to couple the movement of h into the cell with the extrusion of na hassidim et al 1990 blumwald et al 2000 the increase in extracellular h has been found to aid in the efflux of sodium through the plasma membrane and to enhance the salt tolerance of cells nass et al 1997 blumwald et al 2000 therefore the ph adjustment of be may have enhanced the efflux of na in the root cells thus decreasing the level of na in the plant tissue future research should investigate the influence of irrigation water ph on the na influx and efflux of plants and the salt tolerance of plants under acidic and alkaline conditions the growth of plants in hydroponic systems should be accompanied by a decrease in the nutrient concentration of the irrigation solutions phosphorous and tin concentrations decreased over time in all hydroponic systems at the end of each cycle cabbage saltbush and millet ph adjusted treatments had a lower tin and p concentrations than the no crop cabbage and millet ph unadjusted hydroponic systems nitrogen and p are macronutrients needed by plants to support growth lucas and davis 1961 epstein and bloom 2005 millet grown on ph unadjusted be hardly grew and did not remove more nutrients than the hydroponic systems with no crops this emphasises the importance of ph when using be as a hydroponic irrigation source the ph of a hydroponic solution can influence the growth and health of plants the cci readings of cabbage saltbush and millet leaves were all higher when grown in the ph adjusted hydroponic systems millet plants grown in ph unadjusted be hydroponic systems did not gain biomass chlorophyll concentration index is a direct measurement of the photosynthetic potential of a leaf and can be indirectly related to the nitrogen nutrient status of a leaf filella et al 1995 moran et al 2000 chlorophyll concentration index is also closely related to plant stress and age peñuelas and filella 1998 merzlyak et al 1999 the nitrogen concentration of cabbage millet and saltbush plants was higher in ph adjusted be systems which can be linked to the higher cci of their leaves as most leaf nitrogen is incorporated into chlorophyll filella et al 1995 moran et al 2000 the ph adjustment increased the cci of millet and saltbush plants which interm means they were able to grow faster the re use of brewery effluent for downstream use in irrigation is limited by its conductivity and sodium concentration dakoure et al 2013 taylor et al 2018 post ad brewery treated in ph adjusted hydroponic systems planted with saltbush had the lowest ec and sodium concentration however this effluent is not ideal for irrigation and can result in deteriorating the soils physical structure and fertility dwaf 1996 oudin et al 1999 qadir and oster 2004 for this effluent to be used for irrigation the following practices should be used cultivation of salt and sodium tolerant crops irrigation methods and soil structure should allow adequate leaching of sodium and the integrated use with water contain a sodium concentration below 70 mg l dwaf 1996 qadir and oster 2004 the high sodium and alkalinity of be is the main limitation when using be in hydroponic production systems there are two contributors to the sodium content of be sodium hydroxide is used in the bottle washing process and it is added to the incoming effluent before it goes through ad an opportunity exists to decrease the reliance on the addition of sodium hydroxide during ad if post ad effluent is exposed to atmospheric conditions it will lose its carbonic acidity while maintaining its alkalinity musvoto et al 2000 power 2014 a fraction of this degassed post ad effluent can then be recycled back with incoming effluent going into the digester which will stabilise the ph of the digester power 2014 this will increase the influent alkalinity and potentially reduce the amount of sodium hydroxide added during ad this in turn will decrease the sodium concentration of the be making it more suitable for downstream use in irrigation 6 conclusion the ph adjustment of post ad be had a major influence on the growth and chemical composition of plants grown in hydroponic systems the biomass increases of millet and cabbage plants grown in hydroponic systems fed with ph adjusted post ad be was 2 20 times higher than that of plants grown in ph unadjusted hydroponic systems the ph adjustment of post ad brewery effluent to 6 5 is necessary to ensure good growth and nutrient uptake by plants grown in hydroponic systems the ph adjustment of be decreased the sodium leaf concentration of cabbages
